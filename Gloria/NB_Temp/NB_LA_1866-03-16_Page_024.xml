        <p>FRIDAY, MARCH 16.<lb/>
          On motion of COL. BOYD, the House<lb/>
          went into Committee to take into consi-<lb/>
          deration. A Bill to incorporate the St.<lb/>
        Andrew's Friendly Society.</p>
        <p>COL. BOYD in explaining the object<lb/>
          of the Bill, said, that there was another<lb/>
          Society in St.Andrews called the St.<lb/>
          Andrew's Benefit Society, which Society<lb/>
          had lost a considerable amount of<lb/>
          money which they had invested in Char-<lb/>
          lotte County Bank Stock. That Society<lb/>
          was still in existence, and this Society<lb/>
          is formed for the same object—viz: a<lb/>
          Society to render mutual assistance to<lb/>
          its members, and to enable them to in-<lb/>
          vest their money in Provincial Deben-<lb/>
        tures.</p>
        <p>HON. MR. GILMOR laid on the table<lb/>
        a Report on Public Accounts.</p>
        <p>A BILL TO ABOLISH PROPERTY QUALIFICA-<lb/>
          TION OF MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF<lb/>
        ASSEMBLY.</p>
        <p>MR. COSTIGAN moved the House<lb/>
          into Committee on the above Bill and<lb/>
          said, he always had doubts about the<lb/>
          propriety of that portion of the law pro-<lb/>
          viding for a property qualification of<lb/>
          members serving in the Assembly. He<lb/>
          had prepared a Bill somewhat different<lb/>
          from this, but, upon speaking to several<lb/>
          members of the House, he found there<lb/>
          was a general willingness that the pro-<lb/>
          perty qualification should be done away<lb/>
          with entirely. The law requires that<lb/>
          the candidate, before coming before the<lb/>
          constituency, shall possess an estate<lb/>
          valued at £300 over and above his lia-<lb/>
          bilities. The spirit of the law is, that<lb/>
          no person can represent a constituency<lb/>
          in this Assembly unless he is possessed<lb/>
          of an estate of £300. Suppose a mem-<lb/>
          ber of this House has a ship at sea, and<lb/>
          by some accident the ship was lost, and<lb/>
          the loss of that ship placed him in a<lb/>
          position that enabled his creditors to<lb/>
          come down upon him, so that he would<lb/>
          not be possessed of £300 of real estate;<lb/>
          to carry out the spirit of the law, he<lb/>
          should resign his seat in the Legisla-<lb/>
          ture, because the law says no man shall<lb/>
          be qualified to represent any constitu-<lb/>
          ency uless possessed of that sum. In<lb/>
          the debates which took place on this<lb/>
          question in the Parliament of England,<lb/>
          some of the most able men on the other<lb/>
          side of the Atlantic, took strong grounds<lb/>
          in favor of doing away with this pro-<lb/>
          perty qualification. He would read the<lb/>
          arguments put forth by one of them<lb/>
          which will corroborate the arguments<lb/>
          he had made use of. He then read<lb/>
          from Lord John Russell's speech on<lb/>
        this question.</p>
        <p>COL. BOYD said, the property quali-<lb/>
          fication was a very small one, and any<lb/>
          person could not expect to represent<lb/>
          the people of this country without ha-<lb/>
          ving some interest in the country. He<lb/>
          considered the property qualification as<lb/>
          entirely too low now, and he would<lb/>
        therefore oppose the Bill.</p>
        <p>HON. MR. CUDLIP said, he was in-<lb/>
          clined to support the principle of the Bill,<lb/>
          but he should not support the Bill with-<lb/>
          out it went further. It should take from<lb/>
          the members all the privileges they have,<lb/>
          as members all the privileges they have,<lb/>
          as members, over other men. They<lb/>
          should be liable to be arrested for debt,<lb/>
          except during the meeting of the Legis-<lb/>
          lature, and for twenty days before and<lb/>
          twenty days after it has met. The law<lb/>
          of property qualification, which they had,<lb/>
          <cb/>
          was of no service, as it is so often<lb/>
        evaded.</p>
        <p>MR. ANGLIN said, it was a matter of<lb/>
          little important whether it passed or<lb/>
          not. They ought to study not to teach<lb/>
          the people to violate the laws, or not to<lb/>
          teach them they are something that could<lb/>
          be violated. This law is scarcely ever<lb/>
          regarded at all. If you go back to the<lb/>
          history of the formation of the British<lb/>
          Parliament, you will find the reason why<lb/>
          it was required. At that time, when the<lb/>
          King of England called a Parliament, he<lb/>
          found it very difficult to get the members<lb/>
          to attend, and he had to compel the at-<lb/>
          tendance of persons in distant districts,<lb/>
          for they did not like to come to London,<lb/>
          and spend their time, besides being to a<lb/>
          considerable expense, which they could<lb/>
          not afford. They did not have as much<lb/>
          relish for Parliamentary life as the people<lb/>
          of the present day; and, as they received<lb/>
          no pay for their services, it was necessary<lb/>
          they should have a certain income of their<lb/>
          own, to enable them to attend. This is<lb/>
          the reason a law was made requiring a<lb/>
          property qualification, but it is now abo-<lb/>
          lished, and it is absured that we should<lb/>
          require a property qualification when it is<lb/>
          not required in England. The law is so<lb/>
          easily evaded that it is of no effect, and<lb/>
          only serves to bring the law into con-<lb/>
        tempt.</p>
        <p>DR. THOMPSON thought they should<lb/>
          get the opinion of their constituents upon<lb/>
          a Bill of that kind. He did not think it<lb/>
          right to pass a law to lower the property<lb/>
          qualification of the voters, or the person<lb/>
          voted for. There were very few candi-<lb/>
          dates for a seat in that House who were<lb/>
          not possessed of £300 worth of property.<lb/>
          As to the qualification of voters, it gives<lb/>
          poor men a kind of stimulus, and induces<lb/>
          them to strive to acquire property for the<lb/>
          purpose of enabling them to vote, thus<lb/>
          acquiring a habit of industry which ena-<lb/>
          bles them in time to become well off.<lb/>
          He thought the Bill had better stand over<lb/>
          until they had a revision of the election<lb/>
          law, for he would like to see a good elec-<lb/>
          tion law made, which would commend<lb/>
          itself to the views of all; for these reasons<lb/>
          he thought they had better report pro-<lb/>
        gress.</p>
        <p>MR. NEEDHAM said, that a law rela-<lb/>
          ting to elections had been introduced, and<lb/>
          another for the registration of votes.<lb/>
          They had better let them all go together,<lb/>
        and they might be incorporated in one.</p>
        <p>MR. COSTIGAN remarked that the<lb/>
          more they took off restrictions from the<lb/>
          candidate, the more they increased the<lb/>
          privileges of the elector, because they<lb/>
          gave them a larger field from which to<lb/>
        select their representatives.</p>
        <p>MR. NEEDHAM had no doubt but a<lb/>
          great deal could be said on both sides;<lb/>
          but he thought the fair, honest, legitimate<lb/>
          principle was this: the qualification of a<lb/>
          member of the House should be the same<lb/>
          as that of the elector. The idea of pro-<lb/>
          perty qualification ought to have been<lb/>
          buried long ago. When the election law<lb/>
          was brought forward by the former Gov-<lb/>
          ernment he went for universal suffrage<lb/>
          will be adopted. That is the principle of<lb/>
          the sound constitutional lawyer. Black-<lb/>
          stone, who speaks, though he is dead.<lb/>
        <cb/>
          When he had heard that Nova Scotia had<lb/>
          passed that law and then went back, it<lb/>
          reminded him of "the dog that went to his<lb/>
          vomit, and the sow to her wallowing in<lb/>
        the mire."</p>
        <p>Progress was reported upon this Bill.</p>
        <p>QUESTION CONCERNING VOLUNTEERS.</p>
        <p>MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY asked the<lb/>
          Government whether several companies<lb/>
          of volunteers had not been called out. If<lb/>
          so , to what part have they been called,<lb/>
        and to what extent.</p>
        <p>HON. MR. SMITH doubted the pro-<lb/>
          priety of making public everything done<lb/>
          in reference to the defence of the country.<lb/>
          He could only assure this House that the<lb/>
          most active and energetic steps are being<lb/>
          taken for the defence of the country.<lb/>
          The military authorities are vigilant, and<lb/>
          the volunteers are being organized and<lb/>
        drilled in different places.</p>
        <p>MR. LINDSAY did not think it would<lb/>
          do any harm to let the people know<lb/>
          whether there will be a force sent to the<lb/>
          frontier to prevent an invasion of our<lb/>
          borders. It had been stated that a large<lb/>
          number of arms had been sent to Wood-<lb/>
          stock. He found that it was not the case.<lb/>
          A company had been formed there, one<lb/>
          hundred strong, and they had never re-<lb/>
        ceived any arms.</p>
        <p>HON. MR. SMITH replied that there<lb/>
          were 500 rifles in the County of Carleton,<lb/>
          in the hands of men able to use them. He<lb/>
          would further inform him that so far as<lb/>
          information has been received from<lb/>
          abroad from those persons best able to<lb/>
          form an opinion on the subject, that<lb/>
          Woodstock is not in danger at all, for it<lb/>
          is not the intention of any parties to make<lb/>
        a raid upon it.</p>
        <p>MR. LINDSAY wished information in<lb/>
          regard to a company of Home Guards,<lb/>
          which had been organized two months<lb/>
          ago at Woodstock, and of which he had<lb/>
          the honor of being elected captain, but<lb/>
        which had never received a gun.</p>
        <p>HON. MR. SMITH asked whether<lb/>
          there had not been some local difficulty<lb/>
        regarding them.</p>
        <p>MR. LINDSAY was not aware of any.<lb/>
          They had requested to have arms, but<lb/>
          had never received a reply whether they<lb/>
        could have them or not.</p>
        <p>MR. HILL could scarcely understand<lb/>
          why there should be so much alarm felt<lb/>
          in the County of Carleton, as the nearest<lb/>
          point from which it could be reached was<lb/>
          from Bangor, which was about one hun-<lb/>
          dred mile from Houlton Village, which<lb/>
          contained about one thousand inhabitants,<lb/>
          and where it was not at all probable that<lb/>
          any Fenian organization existed, it being<lb/>
          so far from the centre. In Bangor he be-<lb/>
          lieved the organization did exist, but to<lb/>
          reach Houlton they would have to travel<lb/>
          one hundred miles, and we would receive<lb/>
          notice of it from the American authori-<lb/>
          ties. They would not invade us from that<lb/>
          quarter when they could reach Calais so<lb/>
          much easier, and be met by others from<lb/>
          Boston and New York; but for all this,<lb/>
          they did not feel any great alarm there.<lb/>
          They try to embarrass the Government<lb/>
          by questions. He did not think informa-<lb/>
          tion of this kind should be put in the<lb/>
          newspapers, for it would not be wise poli-<lb/>
          cy to tell the enemy just what we intended<lb/>
          to do. He did not think the Government<lb/>
          knew just what they were going to do.<lb/>
          (Laughter.) He would venture to say<lb/>
          if the Government expended $200,000 for<lb/>
          the defence of the country, as certain<lb/>
        gentlemen seem desire is they should do,</p>
