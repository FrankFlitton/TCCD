out a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fede-</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ral</span> Union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Canada alone ; but that at <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> time they would
attempt, in con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sidering</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a change in</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">already</span> under the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sovereign. It</span> <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">highly</span> proper that before
touching<br />
the edifice of Government that had been<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">raised</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada, they should address the</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statesmen</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the</span> Lower<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> Provinces, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
<br />
try to induce them to form a common sys- <br />
tem. If it were found impossible to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>
<br />
a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union of all</span> the British <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> Provinces, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> they could re- <br />
serve to the local Governments of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">several </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> the control of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub-</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jects</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concerned</span> them, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">while</span> the rest <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be committed to the care
of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> Government." Now do
we <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> any further testimony to
show that <br />
this did not emanate from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span>
Go<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bled</span> in session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">befo</span>re they had any com-<br />
munications from the British Government<br />
at all. This Scheme arose from the poli- <br />
tical embarrassing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessities</span>
of Canada,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
and not from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> philanthropy of
Cana-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span> but to enable
them to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
obtain power. I made a statement in dif-<br />
ferent speeches which I delivered upon<br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">electioneering</span> tour. I
ventured to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">s</span>uppose that the authors of this
new Con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stitution,</span> framed in a short time
might be<br />
biased in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span> by the
prospect of<br />
personal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aggrandisement</span> ; for
this I was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">task,</span> and was told I was imput- <br />
ing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motives.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> it is our duty to watch <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> in power, for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tendency</span> of power <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> to be aggressive. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference</span>
<br />
held their meetings at Quebec to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">frame</span>
<br />
a new Constitution, with closed doors. It <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">istration.</span> This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
most ingeniously contrived piece of poli- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tical machinery</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> that was ever planned</span><br />
by any set of men, was to be pressed<br />
through the then existing Legislature<br />
without any reference to the people<br />
Keeping that fact in view, and allowing<br />
this Scheme all the elements necessary to<br />
bring it into existence, how were the<br />
Legislative Council to be appointed ? ten<br />
of them were to be taken out of the Le-<br />
gislative Council of this Province, irre-<br />
spective of party politics. This would<br />
have the effect of neutralizing any oppo-<br />
sition there, for they are men, and like<br />
ourselves are susceptible of these influ-<br />
ences. How are their places to be filled<br />
up ? Would there have been no mem-<br />
bers in the House who could have been<br />
fonnd ten men in the House who would<br />
be influenced by considerations like these.<br />
Then there were seven men in the Gov-<br />
ernment, that would make seventeen, and<br />
there would be only four more wanted to<br />
carry the Scheme. I think those four<br />
men could be found. It might be, they<br />
would be animated by patriotism ; but if<br />
not they could be prevailed upon by some<br />
influence which the Government could<br />
wield, and thus twenty-one members<br />
could be found to carry the Scheme. This<br />
was my view, and for stating that view I<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was </span>cri<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ticized</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maligned.</span> I intend to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
condense my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remarks,</span> because to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notice</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> points would take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hours.</span> If I had<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consulted my own feelings</span> I
should not<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have spoken at all, as I have become<br />
tired of the subject ; it is like addressing<br />
a jury after they have rendered their ver- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dict.
When I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear</span> the hon. member for<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the County of Albert put forward the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bold</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition that</span> if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people of</span> the coun-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
try were better informed, they would sup-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
port the Scheme, and the ex-Surveyor<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
General says the same thing. I want to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ask that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman, and</span> through
him the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
members of the late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span>
why it<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
was, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if they</span> courted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enquir</span>y or discussion, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
that they dissolved the House, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after Mr.</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
Tilley had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distinctly</span>
stated to the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of Carleton that a dissolution would not<br />
take place. I characterize it as an act of<br />
tyranny and cruelty to the people of this<br />
country to dissolve the House in the win-<br />
ter season, when, if they had not been<br />
especially favored with fine weather, not<br />
one-half the aged men could have got to<br />
the polls to render their voice against<br />
this question, in which was involved the<br />
rendering up of their rights which they<br />
had so long enjoyed. When this question<br />
first came up, I asked for information on<br />
the subject ; but official etiquette forbid<br />
its being known to the people of this<br />
country until after it had been shown to<br />
Her Majesty the Queen, and we were in-<br />
debted to Mr. Palmer, of Prince Edward<br />
Island, for the details of the Scheme.<br />
These delegates kept back this informa-<br />
tion, but called an assemblage of the<br />
people in St. John, and condescended to<br />
tell them what they had done for them<br />
but would not allow them to see the<br />
agreement by which their country was<br />
sold. Was it right for Mr. Tilley to pro-<br />
claim to the people that a dissolution<br />
would not take place until after the House<br />
had met, and thus lull the people into a<br />
false security. That was the effect upon<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my mind,
for I thought the first place in<br />
which the subject would be discussed<br />
would be in Parliament. You may search<br />
history in vain, to find a case in which,<br />
when the Constitution of a country was<br />
changed, it was first discussed at a public<br />
meeting before it was discussed in Par-<br />
liament. They should have told the people<br />
of the country whether they were going<br />
to dissolve the House or not. While we<br />
were lulled into a false security, those<br />
delegates were impressing their views<br />
upon the people of the country, and tell-<br />
ing them that they would become rich,<br />
because millions upon millions of money<br />
were to be expended among them, while<br />
their taxes were to be reduced. I do not<br />
see how any man could believe it possible,<br />
when looking at our condition, and the<br />
condition of Canada, and the enormous<br />
sums of money to be spent, that our taxes<br />
can be reduced, unless it can be proved<br />
that the more a man owes the less it will<br />
take to pay his debts ; yet, many did be-<br />
lieve that statement to be true that a large<br />
expenditure of money was to be made, and<br />
our taxes were to be less. How could<br />
Mr. Tilley, or any other man, say what<br />
this Confederation would do? after it was<br />
once organized they could not control it.<br />
How then could they say how much per<br />
head our taxes were to be nuder Confed-<br />
eration ? These delegates might be there,<br />
and they might not. Men die and pass<br />
away, but the Constitution would live<br />
after them, and Mr. Tilley or anybody<br />
else could not say what they would do,<br />
and what they would not do, after the<br />
Constitution was once adopted. This<br />
taxation must be inevitable, for any man<br />
that knows anything of the history of this<br />
country for the last forty years, knows<br />
that our wants increase as our population<br />
increases. Then what must be the dernier<br />
resort ? what must be the remedy for that<br />
state of things ? It will be direct taxa-<br />
tion. I will call the testimony of Mr.<br />
Galt : " If they increased their expenses<br />
in proportion to the growth of population.<br />
they would be obliged to resort to direct<br />
taxation." This is a statement from Mr.<br />
Galt, unquestionably true. Then, in re-<br />
gard to this Intercolonial Railway. You<br />
are aware of the fact that Mr. George<br />
Brown has always been opposed to the<br />
construction of this work, and he was the<br />
cause of that railway scheme not being<br />
accepted by the people of Canada. But<br />
now Mr. George Brown says, that rather<br />
than not have Confederation, he would<br />
consent to build half a dozen such rail-<br />
ways. Has he such a care for this Pro-<br />
vince that he willing to tax his own<br />
people to give us better terms that was<br />
provided two or three years ago ? Mr.<br />
George Brown, through the consummation<br />
of this Scheme, will accomplish the object<br />
which he has advocated all his life</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—that<br />
is, representation by population, which<br />
will give Canada, by the rapid increase of<br />
her population, the controlling power of<br />
this whole Confederacy By adopting this<br />
Scheme we surrender our independence,<br />
and become dependent upon Canada, for<br />
this Federal Government will have the<br />
veto power upon our legislation. The<br />
51st section of the Scheme says: " Any<br />
Bill passed by the General Parliament<br />
shall be subject to disallowance by Her<br />
Majesty within two years, as in the case<br />
of Bills passed by the Legislatures of the<br />
said Provinces hitherto ; in like manner</span><br />
any Bill passed by a local Legislature<br />
