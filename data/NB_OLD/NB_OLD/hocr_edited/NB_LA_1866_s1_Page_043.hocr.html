<p style="background-color: white;" class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stick their bill into it. And such was<br />
the character of the miserable band who<br />
had so industriously endeavored to poi-<br />
son the public mind by base and dis-<br />
honest means, and some men who hold<br />
their heads high, and present a friend-<br />
ly appearance, had encouraged it;<br />
but "a man may smile, and smile, and<br />
be a villain." He had borne their per-<br />
sonal abuse and slander for twelve<br />
months, and was now going to free his<br />
mind, and as he cared little personally<br />
for political distinction, he should speak<br />
without reserve his honest conviction,<br />
let it cut where it would.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Their political opponents, with some<br />
honorable exceptions, had pretended to<br />
look upon the Government with contempt.<br />
This was a quality seldom seen in a<br />
gentleman, it was most prominent in the<br />
lower order of men. Gentlemen, al-<br />
though superior in education and in posi-<br />
tion, seldom looked with contempt upon<br />
those, who in reality were their in-<br />
feriors; but there was a class of men who<br />
became intoxicated with their own sup-<br />
posed greatness and superiority, having<br />
excessive vanity, who in order to gratify<br />
a low principle, treated with contempt<br />
men who were quite their equals, this <br />
quality increased as you descended in the<br />
scale of manhood, and was very prominent<br />
in the negro character, and he had been<br />
informed that in the South the slaves<br />
looked upon and treated with contempt <br />
not only those of their own class who<br />
might not be just equal with them in the<br />
social scale, but even the white men who<br />
were free and in every respect their<br />
superiors. And in animals it is the<br />
same. Writers who had studied their<br />
habits said, that the lion and the horse<br />
were never known to have been influenced<br />
by any such disposition, while the ass and<br />
the meaner beasts were strongly in-<br />
fluenced by that principle. He had been<br />
amused to see with what contempt some<br />
of the very meanest specimens of hu-<br />
manity pretended to look upon the pre-<br />
sent Government. A great many of the<br />
public officials, from the judge upon the<br />
bench down to the humblest employee<br />
upon the railroad, had been opposed to<br />
the Government, and, with some honora-<br />
ble exceptions, they had been industrious-<br />
ly endeavoring to defeat them. It had<br />
not been the policy of the Government to<br />
remove from office their opponents and<br />
replace them with their friends, but acts<br />
of kindness and forbearance in too many<br />
cases had been met with base ingratitude.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Personally he had, since his first en-<br />
trance into public life, been opposed to<br />
removals, except where the public in-<br />
terests require it. He had never been<br />
disposed to use any brief authority or<br />
power which might have been entrusted<br />
to him in any unkind or ungenerous way,<br />
and for pursuing that course he had suf-<br />
fered to some extent with the extreme<br />
men of the Liberal party, and now, he<br />
believed, that he was likely to suffer from<br />
the extreme men of the Conservative<br />
party, but so far he had had courage<br />
enough in that respect to do what he<br />
thought was right, but there was a point<br />
beyond which forbearance ceased to be a<br />
virtue.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Having now dwelt long enough upon<br />
general matters, he would allude to a<br />
few of the charges which had been urged<br />
against this Government; and as all of<br />
them had been so ably answered by<br />
speakers who had preceded him, it was<br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 566 426 1195 489">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> not necessary that he should dwell long<br />
upon any of them.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Fisher charged the Govern-<br />
ment with having called the House to-<br />
gether on the 8th of March instead of<br />
the 14th of February. This House was<br />
prorogued on the 8th day of June last,<br />
and was called together on the 8th of<br />
March, covering a recess of only nine<br />
months, when formerly twelve months<br />
was the time between the sessions; and<br />
what interest had suffered in consequence<br />
of this delay of three weeks from the<br />
usual time? He knew of none. Had any<br />
constituency or any hon. member been<br />
put to inconvenience in consequence of<br />
it? He knew of none. Perhaps his hon.<br />
friend, Mr. Fisher, fancied the session<br />
might be a few days shorter in conse-<br />
quence of it, or that some of the large<br />
stock of poultry he had said in might not<br />
keep during the long days of March. The<br />
charge was unworthy of any further no-<br />
tice, he was satisfied the House and the<br />
country would so view it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The next charge preferred by Mr.<br />
Fisher was, that an Auditor General had<br />
not been appointed, and that he was<br />
satisfied there were thousands of ac-<br />
counts in that office not checked at this<br />
day. Now he was sure that the duties of<br />
that office had never, since its first forma-<br />
tion, been better and more efficiently<br />
done than they had been the last year,<br />
and he denied the assertion that such a<br />
number of accounts remained in that<br />
office unchecked. The last quarter, or<br />
rather the first quarter of the fiscal year<br />
1866, might not be yet entirely checked,<br />
because after the close of the fiscal year,<br />
a good deal of time was required to pre-<br />
pare the report for the Legislature, and<br />
then as there were only two persons in<br />
the office a few accounts may not be<br />
examined immediately on their receipt,<br />
but as soon as the report was completed,<br />
Mr. Johnson at once attended to that<br />
duty; but he (Hon. Mr. Gillmer) would<br />
inform the hon. member for York, Mr.<br />
Fisher, if there were any accounts in the<br />
Audit Office unchecked, when they were<br />
neglected, it was when there was an<br />
Auditor General and three clerks in that<br />
office, at an expense of six or seven hun-<br />
dred pounds more than it was now, and<br />
when Mr. Fisher was in the Government<br />
also, that was the time, and not since the<br />
office of Auditor General had been vacant,<br />
that the public interests had been neglect-<br />
ed, and this he thought could be fully<br />
substantiated. There was no fear of the<br />
public interest suffering in that depart-<br />
ment when Mr. Johnson had charge; he<br />
was a most efficient and faithful official.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Up to 1854 there had been only a par-<br />
tial audit of the public accounts. At that<br />
time the political necessities of Mr. Fisher<br />
and his friends, together with the con-<br />
sideration for an old public servant, caus-<br />
ed the Government to appoint Mr. Parte-<br />
low, and he remembered that his hon.<br />
colleague (Col. Boyd) and himself agreed<br />
at the time that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Â£100 per annum
was<br />
sufficient salary for that official. But it<br />
was also very convenient to have a finan-<br />
cier so competent to give information and<br />
advice convenient to the Government ;<br />
but it was well known that for four years<br />
before his death he was entirely unfit to<br />
discharge the duties of the office, and<br />
that the whole duties devoted on Mr.<br />
Johnson. Mr. Fisher told them that the<br />
Constitution had been violated in not fill-<br />
ing up the office. Why did not the late<br />
Government fill it up? Three or four<br />
months elapsed between the death of Mr.<br />

<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Partelow and their resignation. The<br />
reason was, that so many of them wanted<br />
it that they could not agree, and they<br />
concluded not to fill it until after the elec-<br />
tion. He thought, if they could not<br />
agree to give it to one of their own num-<br />
ber, there was more than one gentleman<br />
who had given them a generous support<br />
for ten years, who would have accepted<br />
it and would have discharged its duties<br />
well. He would not charge them with<br />
having violated the Constitution in not<br />
filling it up, but he thought they were<br />
unmindful of their old friends. Gratitude<br />
in old politicians was a rare commodity.<br />
He thought the Opposition would fail to<br />
convince either a majority of the House or<br />
the public that the Government deserved<br />
censure for not appointing an Auditor<br />
General, when they knew and understood<br />
that the duties of that Department had<br />
been done as well, certainly and some<br />
persons thought better, than they ever<br />
were before, and at an expense some<br />
$2000 less than formerly. Mr. Fisher<br />
said the Minute of Council was an<br />
insult to the Queen. He did not so un-<br />
derstand it, and he was sure it was not so<br />
intended and he was not afraid to allow an<br />
intelligent public to pronounce on it. He<br />
thought there could not in the history of<br />
New Brunswick, be found a memorandum<br />
of Council, in answer to any dispatch<br />
from the British Government, that was<br />
more respectful, and at the same time<br />
more determined to maintain the rights<br />
which belonged to them under the Con-<br />
stitution. His hon. friend (Mr. Fisher)<br />
thought it a great offence to beg to differ<br />
from the Colonial Secretary in a matter<br />
which affected out best interests; but he<br />
did not think it any offence to the Queen's<br />
represenative to call his advisers "thim-<br />
ble riggers," traitors, hypocrites, &amp;c.<br />
Such language to men on this side of the<br />
water was considered by him quite right,<br />
but to dare to differ from Mr. Caldwell,<br />
in the most respectful manner, was a<br />
crime of the deepest dye. Such arrant<br />
nonsense was unworthy the least consid-<br />
eration. He was proud of that dispatch.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Another charge was, that the Govern-<br />
ment had not made proper provision for<br />
the defence of the country; that the<br />
money which was to be expended during<br />
the sumer for militia purposes, should<br />
have been expended on the frontier be-<br />
fore now. What would the hon. member<br />
have said if the Government had expended<br />
$30,000 to $40,000 up to the present<br />
time for militia purposes. Had they done<br />
so, he thought they would justify have de-<br />
served censure, for until very recently,<br />
the Government was not aware of any<br />
danger that would have justified such as<br />
expenditure; and he was sure the people,<br />
of the frontier Countries, who were most<br />
exposed, had not yet been so much alarm-<br />
ed that they would have justified the<br />
large expenditure that would have done<br />
no good. He charged the Government<br />
with vascillation and hypocrisy, and with<br />
having pursued a sinuous course. If<br />
there was a man in the world who de-<br />
served to be styled a crooked disciple, it<br />
was Mr. Fisher. Politically, he was<br />
known as a dodger. There appeared to <br />
be a constitutional predisposition to do<br />
everything by a sort of side-winded<br />
round-about way. He was really the best<br />
illustration of the Irishman's gun, that<br />
would shoot round a corner, that he had<br />
ever seen. He hastened to a part of his<br />
speech on declaration day in York, that<br />
such frequent reference had been made to<br />
during this Session. At that time he<br />
