we wanted public works, and I<br />
supported them in their Railway Scheme<br />
of 1856 ; that undertaking involved us,<br />
with other liabilities, to the extent of six<br />
millions of dollars. This, in their opin-<br />
ion, was not all we could stand, so they<br />
undertook 3 1 2 12ths of the Intercolonial<br />
road, estimated to cost three million<br />
pounds sterling. According to the cost<br />
of the St. John and Shediac road, as com-<br />
pared with the cost, that amount might be<br />
doubled ; but we are safe in saying it<br />
would cost fourteen millions of dollars, our<br />
part of that would be $5,833,000. Not<br />
thinking, even then, that our resources<br />
would be exhausted, at the last Session<br />
they introduced and carried their Subsidy<br />
Bill, providing $10,000 per mile for 188<br />
miles of road, involving an additional lia-<br />
bility of $1,780,000 more-making in all<br />
at close of last Session $13,613,000.<br />
These acts were upon the statute book,<br />
and, of course, they thought and said we<br />
were able to carry all this out ; if so it ill<br />
becomes them to speak of us as very in-<br />
significant and poor and isolated. I<br />
thought then, and I think now, they over<br />
estimated our resources, and if there were<br />
any political trouble, they had time and<br />
power to have remedied them</span>—but the<br />
discovery was made just when they wanted<br />
this great change. I do not profess to be<br />
well acquainted with the history of Can-<br />
ada, but it is well known that for many<br />
years there has been a great deal of poli-<br />
tical discord there, and to remedy this I<br />
think this scheme was originated. My<br />
hon. friend from Albert says they are our<br />
brother colonists, and we ought to go in<br />
and help them out of their difficulties. It<br />
reminds me of a little story told by my<br />
colleague, Mr. Hill ; A steamboat was<br />
coming down the Mississippi ; there was<br />
on board a tall, grave young man—so<br />
grave and sober that he was observed by<br />
all the passengers. When the boat ar-<br />
rived at Vicksburg and the passengers<br />
landed on the wharf, there was a great<br />
fight going on there. This young man<br />
brightened up, and asked some of the by-<br />
standers if it was a free fight? They said<br />
" Yes." Says he, " Has any one a right<br />
to go in?" "Yes." said they. He took<br />
off his coat and pitched in. In a short<br />
time he returned to the boat, with a pair<br />
of black eyes and his nose considerably<br />
canted, very strongly convinced that it<br />
would have been for his interest to have<br />
remained out of the fight. Now this man<br />
got served as we should had we gone into<br />
this Union, with this exception—he got<br />
out, we would have had to remain in. It<br />
has been stated by some of the advocates<br />
of this scheme, that when the Delegates<br />
left the Conference, the Governments of<br />
each of the Provinces were to use such<br />
measures as they thought best to secure<br />
its passage in the different Colonies.<br />
Those who could get it passed without<br />
submitting it to the people were to do so ;<br />
those who felt sure of carrying it by<br />
going to the country were to do so. This,<br />
certainly, was not a very uniform mode of<br />
commencing this great nationality. I am<br />
not aware of what the intention of our<br />
Government was on their return home ; at<br />
the time I thought they would call the<br />
Legislature together at the usual time,<br />
discuss the question, and decide it at the<br />
General Election which would have been<br />
this summer ; and not until a very few<br />
days before the dissolution did I believe<br />
the House was to have been dissolved. It<br />
was stated that Mr. Tilley, in answer to<br />
a question put to him by Mr. McShane,<br />
in Carleton, as to his intention to appeal<br />
to the people, said that it would not be<br />
decided without an appeal to the people.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Had I been present, I should certainly <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have </span>concluded from that reply
that he did <br />
not intend to dissolve the Hous<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e ;</span>
but the <br />
answer was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perfectly</span> safe one.
If he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intended</span> to dissolve at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">once,</span> as he did, he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right ;</span> and if he intended to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cuss it, and appeal to the people at
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General
Election,</span> then he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> all
right,— <br />
b<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ut which he</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intended</span> no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one but</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himself</span>
<br />
knew, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cer</span>tainly he was not
very frank <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and candid. The advocates of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confeder-</span> <br />
atio<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">n</span> had in this Province a
decided ad- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vantage.
They <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had some</span> of the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ablest</span>
<br />
men as l<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ecturers,</span> and certainly
they im- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proved</span>
the time. They had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">influence</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of
the Government, which is certainly <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">v</span>ery
great. They had, I think, four-fifths <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the entire Press of the Province.
They <br />
had that disposition
in man, a desire to <br />
change, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which is</span> very common,
and a great <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many believe their condition is a hard
<br />
one, and any change would be for the bet- <br />
ter, and they made the best use of all <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theses advantages ;</span> but the
people
had some <br />
common <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sense</span> and some
judgment, and <br />
rejected a scheme which would certainly, <br />
in my opinion, if adopted, have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> destructive to our best <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests.</span> <br />
One very singular feature in this scheme <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was,</span> that every colony had got
the <br />
best of the bargain. Mr. Tilley had <br />
in finance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outwitted</span> all the
rest. <br />
In Upper Canada the politicians had made <br />
so good a bargain, that they could afford <br />
to build several Intercolonial Railroads <br />
and then make in the transaction. Nova <br />
Scotia and Newfouudland, all had made a <br />
wonderful good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade ;</span> how all
could <br />
have got the best of the arrangement and <br />
no party the worst, I cannot understand. <br />
It might be considered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smart</span> to
get the <br />
best of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bargain,</span> but if it
were done <br />
knowingly, it could badly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be considered</span>
<br />
honest, and if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discovered</span>, not
calculated <br />
to add much to the harmony of the Union. <br />
One great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument,</span> and one
which was <br />
used to good effect, was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railroad.</span>
<br />
Now, I am free to admit, that the chances <br />
were that the road would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span>
built <br />
in Confederation ; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not,</span> I
think, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quite</span> <br />
so soon as some people imagined. It de- <br />
pended entirely upon what a majority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<br />
the Federal Parliament concluded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span>
<br />
the Constitution was complete ; it de- <br />
pended upon what a majority of that Par- <br />
liament might think<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary.</span> They <br />
might conclude that the finances were not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> at that time in a state to
warrant the <br />
undertaking. They in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span>
played <br />
false, so Mr. Tilley said, and they might <br />
do so again ; but I think they would have <br />
built it, and I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further that</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it would</span> <br />
not have paid either them or us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span>
it <br />
was built. The immense traffic and the <br />
terrible increase of manufactories were <br />
all or nearly so in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagination</span>
of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederates.</span> This Confederate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parlia-</span> <br />
ment was to be conducted by men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the</span>
<br />
first talent from all the Colonies. Our <br />
fifteen representatives would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">little</span>
<br />
influence there, even if they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span>
all uni- <br />
ted ; these fifteen gentlemen could do a <br />
great deal more for New Brunswick in <br />
our own Parliament, and would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quite</span>
<br />
as well able to consider these general <br />
matters here as there. I have never known<br />
this Assembly to decline the considera-<br />
tion of any question on account of its<br />
magnitude, particularly the late Govern-<br />
ment ; and we have no right to suppose<br />
that our fifteen members would be united<br />
in their politics, they would represent<br />
both political parties. Human nature<br />
would not be changed, and party feelings<br />
would not be removed by the new order<br />
of things. The hon. member for Resti-<br />
gouche says parties would be so evenly<br />
divided that our men by going to either<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> side could effect their object, that
would <br />
not be a very moral way to get what we <br />
thought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belonged</span> to us, to ask
our re- <br />
presentatives to join any party, right or <br />
wrong. That hon. member said the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ference had</span> tried to copy after
both the <br />
Constitution of Britain and the United <br />
States. They have succeeded in getting <br />
a good deal of what is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span>
perfect in <br />
both, and not a great deal of the good <br />
qualities of either. The truth is, Mr. <br />
Chairman, that an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long</span> as we
remain Co- <br />
lonies of England, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do</span> not
want any <br />
such expensive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establishment :</span> we
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> <br />
no such power between the Colonial Le- <br />
gislatures and the Crown. If we are to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">become separate,</span> then we may copy
after <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span> Union, and perhaps
improve <br />
some upon their system ; but until we are <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seperate,</span> we do not want this fifth wheel
to <br />
our coach. I think there is not a desire <br />
in this Province to become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">independent</span>
<br />
of England. There may be such desire <br />
in Canada West. It has been urged <br />
that this arrangement was to bind us <br />
more closely to the Mother Country. I <br />
think it would have an entirely opposite <br />
effect. Union they say is strength. They <br />
have had for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twenty-ﬁve</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> a union of <br />
Upper and Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> They <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <br />
had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties,</span> and at last come <br />
almost to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand</span> still. And
this Union <br />
of the Colonies was the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remedy</span> the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politicians</span> of Canada could think
of, and <br />
it was their troubles, and not ours, that <br />
suggested it. In the appointment of the <br />
Delegates they commenced a Coalition. <br />
The late Government of New Brunswick  <br />
never used to think any advice or assis- <br />
tance necessary to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manage</span> the affairs of <br />
the country ; in fact the thought the op- <br />
position had mismanaged it, but now there <br />
was a matter to be carried out that would <br />
suit all the political leaders. The unani- <br />
mity of the delegates, and the different <br />
Governments was certainly most remarka-  <br />
ble, and only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accident</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did</span> we disco- <br />
ver that any difference of opinion existed : <br />
but we have heard that in the Constitu- <br />
tion of the Federal Council there was a <br />
differ<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ence,</span> and that part of
the Scheme <br />
was carried by the casting vote of the <br />
Chairman, who was Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tilley.</span>
I think <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> body should at ﬁrst at least
have <br />
been elected, so that the people in the first<br />
instance could have chosen that branch <br />
of the Legislature, a branch powerful <br />
enough if they chose, to stop all legisla- <br />
tion. Canada did some seven years ago <br />
adopt the elective principle for their Le- <br />
gislative Council, and the British Govern-<br />
ment evidently thinks it should be so in <br />
this Scheme, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggests</span> it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Co- <br />
lonial minister objects to two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most im-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">portant</span> principles in this
Scheme, said <br />
to be so perfect, and hints strongly that <br />
there are a goodly number of smaller de- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fects ;</span> but here it was to be taken just as<br />
it was, being humanly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speaking,</span> perfect,<br />
—and in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span> Executive Council <br />
it would be exceedingly difficult to so <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compose</span> it with the local and
sectional <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> as to make it work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">harmoni-</span> <br />
ously, and in fact I think it would not <br />
have worked at all, and am pleased <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thus</span>
<br />
far that the people have not decided to let <br />
them try it. The Scheme does not pro- <br />
vide how the local Governments are to be <br />
constituted. They are to have a Lieute- <br />
nant Governor,,who shall be appointed <br />
by the Governor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> ; the
local Go- <br />
vernment and Legislature of each Pro- <br />
vînce shall be constructed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such</span>
man- <br />
ner as the existing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span>
of each <br />
Province shall provide, so each can have <br />
about what they like, no uniformity is <br />
provided for all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonies.</span>
