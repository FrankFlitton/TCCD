            <!-- PG, 2017-10-24, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->
            <!--<p>
     hour, it is my duty to conclude. In con<lb break="no"/>clusion I may be permitted to add that I am 
     <lb/>
     now more strongly in favor of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation that we are now considering, 
     <lb/>
     than I was at the time of the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions in reply to the Speech from the 
     <lb/>
     Throne. Then I had some doubts, but the 
     <lb/>
     position taken by the opponents of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure has sufficed to dissipate them. A cause 
     <lb/>
     must indeed be a bad one, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     when such men as those whom I see on the 
     <lb/>
     other side cannot find arguments to support 
     <lb/>
     their views, which are worthy of being dis- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cusssed, and who, in order to maintain their 
     <lb/>
     position, are obliged to resort to such means 
     <lb/>
     as honorable gentlemen opposite, with their 
     <lb/>
     friends, have been compelled to have recourse 
     <lb/>
     to since it has been under consideration to 
     <lb/>
     establish a Federal union of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On motion of Mr. DUNKIN, the debate was 
     <lb/>
     then adjourned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
   
   <head rendition="simple:centre">MONDAY, <hi rendition="simple:italic">February</hi> 27, 1865.</head> 
     <lb/>
            
   <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, almost 
     <lb/>
     every one who has yet spoken in this debate 
     <lb/>
     has begun with some expression of his feeling 
     <lb/>
     of embarrassment. For my own part, I should 
     <lb/>
     be glad if I could begin in some other way, 
     <lb/>
     but I confess that I cannot. For I certainly 
     <lb/>
     never did rise to address this House, or any 
     <lb/>
     other public body, under a feeling of such 
     <lb/>
     oppressive embarrassment as I experience at 
     <lb/>
     this moment. It is impossible for me, occu<lb break="no"/>pying the position in which I now stand, not 
     <lb/>
     to feel that I am opposed to powerful odds, 
     <lb/>
     and that there is a sort of foregone conclu<lb break="no"/>sion, here, against the views I desire to 
     <lb/>
     impress upon the House. It is impossible 
     <lb/>
     for me not to feel that the considerations to 
     <lb/>
     which I have to ask the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House, are so many and so complex, that no 
     <lb/>
     sort of justice can possibly be done them 
     <lb/>
     within the limits of my capacity to speak, or 
     <lb/>
     of yours to listen. The interests at stake, 
     <lb/>
     too, are so large—so much larger than ever 
     <lb/>
     were at stake in any question which has yet 
     <lb/>
     been brought under the notice of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and the difficulties arising out of the question 
     <lb/>
      are so formidable, owing in no small mea<lb break="no"/>sure to what I must call the many reticences 
     <lb/>with which this scheme has been laid before 
     <lb/>us, and the ambiguities of expression which 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
           
     everywhere characterise it, as to tax 
     <lb/>
     seriously the courage of those who may 
     <lb/>
     attempt to discuss it. I feel, besides, that 
     <lb/>
     I am entirely cut off from that description 
     <lb/>
     of remark which most of all tends to make 
     <lb/>
     one's speech pleasant to listen to ; for I can<lb break="no"/>not prophecy smooth things, or dilate on 
     <lb/>
     the marvels of progress to result from Con<lb break="no"/>federation in the future. There is a charac<lb break="no"/>ter of hurry, too, impressed on the whole 
     <lb/>
     style of this debate ; everybody feels so 
     <lb/>
     impatient, that one can scarcely hope to 
     <lb/>
     express his views fully, as he would wish 
     <lb/>
     and ought, on this vast scheme. I have even 
     <lb/>
     the feeling that my capacity for exertion is 
     <lb/>
     not up to its ordinary standard. I address 
     <lb/>
     the House in a state of health that renders 
     <lb/>
     me less capable than usual of physical 
     <lb/>
     exertions. I must, therefore, beg honorable 
     <lb/>
     members to make allowance for these circum<lb break="no"/>stances surrounding my position ; believing 
     <lb/>
     me that what I wish to do is to present as 
     <lb/>
     briefly as I can, and as truthfully as I can, 
     <lb/>
     my own deep seated convictions on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion now before the House. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     So strongly, Mr. SPEAKER, do I feel my 
     <lb/>
     inability to discuss this scheme as I could 
     <lb/>
     wish, that I almost must throw myself on 
     <lb/>
     the forbearance of Hon. members—that I 
     <lb/>
     hardly can help saying I should be in danger 
     <lb/>
     of shrinking from the duty of addressing 
     <lb/>
     you, but for the recollection that time and 
     <lb/>
     again, I have known, in cases of contest 
     <lb/>
     almost or quite as discouraging as this, that 
     <lb/>
     " the race has not been to the swift nor the 
     <lb/>
     battle to the strong"—that time and again I 
     <lb/>
     have known those who went into such con<lb break="no"/>tests with the best hopes of success, disap<lb break="no"/>pointed in their expectations. I do know, 
     <lb/>
     and I know that others know—I believe it 
     <lb/>
     to be the general conviction of those whom 
     <lb/>
     I address to-night, as regards this question, 
     <lb/>
     that whatever of popular feeling there may 
     <lb/>
     seem to be in favor of the views I have 
     <lb/>
     to combat, is anything but the deliberate 
     <lb/>
     result of a well-considered examination of 
     <lb/>
     the whole subject—is a feeling of most 
     <lb/>
     sudden growth, and of most passing char<lb break="no"/>acter. (Hear, hear.) Before I go further, 
     <lb/>
     I may be permitted distinctly to accept the 
     <lb/>
     challenge which has been more than once 
     <lb/>
     thrown out on the other side as to the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which this question ought to be 
     <lb/>
     discussed. I freely admit and sincerely 
     <lb/>
     maintain that it ought not to be discussed 
     <lb/>
     otherwise than as a great question, to be 
     <lb/>
     considered entirely on a large view of its 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="483" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0483.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">483</fw>
         
     merits. It is not a question of party, it is 
     <lb/>
     not a question of persons, it is not a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of merely local, or class, or passing in<lb break="no"/>terest, and it is not to be met by any of those 
     <lb/>
     passing appeals which are too often resorted 
     <lb/>
    to. It is not to be settled upon any ground 
     <lb/>of mere theory, or by any criticism of mere 
     <lb/>details. It requires indeed to be taken up 
     <lb/>at once as a question of principle, and also 
     <lb/>as a question of detail, involving a multi<lb break="no"/>tude of details ; and there must necessarily 
     <lb/>be a careful criticism of such details. The 
     <lb/>question really presented is this : on the 
     <lb/>whole, viewing them collectively, are the 
     <lb/>details involved in this great scheme such as 
     <lb/>to commend the scheme itself to our appro<lb break="no"/>bation, or are they not ? (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>pledge myself that I will discuss the ques<lb break="no"/>tion from that point of view. I will do my 
     <lb/>utmost to avoid mere passing or personal 
     <lb/>allusions. I will try to tread the dangerous 
     <lb/>ground before me without arousing danger<lb break="no"/>ous feelings. I do not know that I can suc<lb break="no"/>ceed, but at least I will make the effort. This, 
     <lb/>however, I am bound to repeat at the outset, 
     <lb/>that no one can do justice to a question like 
     <lb/>this, and start with the idea of at all ignoring 
     <lb/>details. Here is a measure proposed for our 
     <lb/>acceptance, embodied in seventy-two resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, and which resolutions affirm a great 
     <lb/>many more than seventy-two propositions, 
     <lb/>connected with almost every principle known  
     <lb/>to have reference to the theory and practice 
     <lb/>of popular government. I say it is a scheme 
     <lb/>which is as complex and as vast as one can 
     <lb/>well imagine, and declamation about first 
     <lb/>principles can be of no real use in its dis<lb break="no"/>cussion—can avail only to mislead in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to it. We have to deal with no more 
     <lb/>abstract question of a nationality, or of union 
     <lb/>or disunion, or of a Federal as opposed to a 
     <lb/>Legislative union. It is idle to talk 
     <lb/>vaguely about the maintenance of British 
     <lb/>connection, or to go into magnificent 
     <lb/>speculations about the probable results of 
     <lb/>independence, or blindly to urge this 
     <lb/>scheme as a sure preventative of annex<lb break="no"/>ation to the United States. These cheap 
     <lb/>and easy generalities are thoroughly unreli<lb break="no"/>able. The only question is, how is this plan, 
     <lb/>in its entirety, going to work ? And this 
     <lb/>question is one which is not easy to answer ; 
     <lb/>it is one requiring much patience, and a close 
     <lb/>examination of details. It is the question 
     <lb/>which, if the House will lend me its attention, 
     <lb/>I will endeavor to discuss to the extent of 
     <lb/>my ability. (Hear, hear.) I may further 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     take leave to say at starting, that I do not 
     <lb/>
     approach this question from any new point 
     <lb/>
     of view whatever. Always I have been, and 
     <lb/>
     now I am, a unionist in the strictest and 
     <lb/>
     largest sense of the term. I desire to per<lb break="no"/>petuate the union between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I desire to see developed, the largest 
     <lb/>
     union that can possibly be developed (I care 
     <lb/>
     not by what name you call it) between all 
     <lb/>
     the colonies, provinces, and dependencies of 
     <lb/>
     the British Crown. I desire to maintain that 
     <lb/>
     intimate union which ought to subsist, but 
     <lb/>
     which unfortunately does not subsist as it 
     <lb/>
     ought, between the Imperial Government and 
     <lb/>
     all those dependencies. I am a unionist, who 
     <lb/>
     especially does not desire to see the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Upper and Lower Canada disunited. To 
     <lb/>
     my mind, this scheme does not at all present 
     <lb/>
     itself as one of union ; and if hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite will admit the truth, they will 
     <lb/>
     acknowledge that, practically, it amounts to a 
     <lb/>
     disunion between Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I confess that I am irrecon<lb break="no"/>cileably opposed to that portion of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. I repeat I do not care to see 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada more dissevered 
     <lb/>
     than they are ; on the contrary, I wish to 
     <lb/>
     see them brought into closer union ; and 
     <lb/>
     far from regarding this scheme as cementing 
     <lb/>
     more closely the connection of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces with the British Empire, I look upon 
     <lb/>
     it as tending rather towards a not distant 
     <lb/>
     disunion of these provinces from the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire. (Hear, hear.) My posi<lb break="no"/>tion as regards this scheme is that of one 
     <lb/>
     who desires to see this union perpetuated, 
     <lb/>
     and not of one who would contemplate a 
     <lb/>
     state of disunion between any of the 
     <lb/>
     component parts of the British Empire. 
     <lb/>
     I hold that proper means ought to 
     <lb/>
     be taken to prevent our disunion from the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire and absorption into the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and that this scheme by no 
     <lb/>
     means tends that way. I have no fancy for 
     <lb/>
     democratic or republican forms or institu<lb break="no"/>tions, or indeed for revolutionary or political 
     <lb/>
     novelties of any sort. The phrase of " politi<lb break="no"/>cal creation " is no phrase of mine. I hold 
     <lb/>
     that the power to create is as much a higher 
     <lb/>
     attribute than belongs to man, in the politi<lb break="no"/>cal world, as in any other department of the 
     <lb/>
     universe. All we can do is to attend to and 
     <lb/>
     develope the ordinary growth of our institu<lb break="no"/>tions ; and this growth, if it is to be healthy 
     <lb/>
     at all, must be slow. There must be the same  
     <lb/>
     slow, steady change in political matters, 
     <lb/>
     which answers to the growth visible in the 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="484" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0484.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">484</fw>
            
     physical world. I do believe in this gradual 
     <lb/>
     development of our institutions, but I do 
     <lb/>
     not believe in any of those violent and sudden 
     <lb/>
     changes which have for their object the 
     <lb/>
     creation of something entirely new. I fear 
     <lb/>
     this scheme is just of the character to pre<lb break="no"/>vent that slow, gradual, healthy development 
     <lb/>
     which I would wish to see steadily carried 
     <lb/>
     out. If I could be astonished at any<lb break="no"/>thing in politics, Mr. SPEAKER, I should 
     <lb/>
     be astonished at the attempt which has been 
     <lb/>
     made by some honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches to represent the state of 
     <lb/>
     the public feeling on this subject as not having 
     <lb/>
     that mere sudden, sensational, unreliable 
     <lb/>
     character which I have ascribed to it. Long 
     <lb/>
     forgotten expressions of individual opinion ; 
     <lb/>
     clauses said to have formed part of bills not 
     <lb/>
     to be found, and not known to have been 
     <lb/>
     even drawn ; motions threatened but never 
     <lb/>
     made, the small party fencings of past times, 
     <lb/>
     from before the days of the Canada Trade 
     <lb/>
     Act downwards, have been pressed into ser<lb break="no"/>vice to meet the exigencies of a hard case. 
     <lb/>
     Well, I shall not follow out that line of 
     <lb/>
     argument: it is not worth while. We all 
     <lb/>
     know that, from the time of the union of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, at all events, until very lately in<lb break="no"/>deed, nothing like serious discussion of the 
     <lb/>
     propriety or impropriety of a Federal union, 
     <lb/>
     or of any union at all, of the aggregate of 
     <lb/>
     these British American Provinces, has ever 
     <lb/>
     so little occupied the public mind. I will 
     <lb/>
     here go back merely to 1858, when the 
     <lb/>
     sixth Parliament was elected, and from that 
     <lb/>
     time bring under review, as rapidly as I can, 
     <lb/>
     such few points of our political history as 
     <lb/>
     are relevant to shew that this is the fact; 
     <lb/>
     although, indeed, argument to establish it is 
     <lb/>
     scarcely necessary. At the election of 1857- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     '58, what really were the issues before the 
     <lb/>
     country? They can be easily stated. I 
     <lb/>
      take the <hi rendition="simple:italic">résumé</hi>, in fact, from the an<lb break="no"/>nouncements of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, the organ of 
     <lb/>
     the great popular party of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     at that time; mentioning not every<lb break="no"/>thing, but everything at all material. The 
     <lb/>
     great demand of the then Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, which gave the key-note to the 
     <lb/>
     whole political controversies of the time, 
     <lb/>
     was representation according to population, 
     <lb/>
     irrespectively of the dividing line between 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada. That was urged 
     <lb/>
     as involving everything. It was urged for 
     <lb/>
     the sake of all the rest, and as sure to bring 
     <lb/>
     about all the rest, that was demanded by the 
     <lb/>
     party. It was to enable them to carry out 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     their opposition to what were called sectarian 
     <lb/>
     grants, their opposition to the holding of 
     <lb/>
     land in mortmain for sectarian uses, their 
     <lb/>
     opposition to separate schools on a sectarian 
     <lb/>
     basis. It was urged for the avowed purpose 
     <lb/>
     of obtaining uniform legislation in the future 
     <lb/>
     for the two sections of the province, and 
     <lb/>
     also what was spoken of as the assimilation 
     <lb/>
     of the existing institutions of the two 
     <lb/>
     sections of the province, but which was 
     <lb/>
     meant to be an assimilation of those of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada to those of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     much more than of those of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     to those of Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     [t was urged with the view of obtaining 
     <lb/>
     what was called free-trade, that is, an anti- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Lower Canadian commercial policy. It was 
     <lb/>
     urged with the view of obtaining the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of the North-West; in other words, 
     <lb/>
     the relative aggrandizement of Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da. It was urged, also, no doubt, with the 
     <lb/>
     view of obtaining what was called adminis<lb break="no"/>trative reform—the driving from power of 
     <lb/>
     a set of men who were alleged, for various 
     <lb/>
     reasons, to be unworthy of holding it. But 
     <lb/>
     the great questions of measures above alluded 
     <lb/>
     to came first; those as to the mere men, 
     <lb/>
     second. (Hear, hear.) The grand object 
     <lb/>
     was declared to be to obtain an Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canadian preponderance of representation 
     <lb/>
     on the floor of this House, in order to put an 
     <lb/>
     end to everything like sectarian grants, the 
     <lb/>
     holding of lands in mortmain and separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, to render uniform our legislation, to 
     <lb/>
     assimilate our institutions, to carry out an anti- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Lower Canadian commercial policy, and to 
     <lb/>
     secure the North-West for the aggrandize<lb break="no"/>ment of Upper Canada. In this way the 
     <lb/>
     question of Upper Canada against Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada was unmistakably raised. What 
     <lb/>
     must have been, what could not fail to be, 
     <lb/>
     the result of an appeal of that kind? It 
     <lb/>
     was easy to foresee that there would be 
     <lb/>
     returned in Upper Canada a majority in 
     <lb/>
     favor of these demands, and in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada an overwhelming majority against 
     <lb/>
     them. I do not go into this to raise the 
     <lb/>
     ghost of past animosities; I am merely 
     <lb/>
     showing what cannot be denied—that no 
     <lb/>
     one at that time spoke of or cared for this 
     <lb/>
     magnificent idea of the union of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, by Confederation or otherwise. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The session commenced. 
     <lb/>
     Those who had the advantage or disadvan<lb break="no"/>tage of sitting in that Parliament that session 
     <lb/>
     will remember the tremendous contrast there 
     <lb/>
     was between all those debates which had refer<lb break="no"/>
         
            <pb n="485" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0485.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">485</fw>
      
      ence to this class of subjects, and the one single 
     <lb/>
     debate which-was attempted. but could not 
     <lb/>
     be made to take place, on the question of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the Provinces. With all 
     <lb/>
     his ability—and there are few abler men than 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman who undertook at that 
     <lb/>
     time to bring that question before the House— 
     <lb/>
     with all his ability, and the most earnest 
     <lb/>
     effort on his part to press it on the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the House, he could scarcely obtain a 
     <lb/>
     hearing. No one cared for the matter; and 
     <lb/>
     it was felt by every one that such was the 
     <lb/>
     case. Soon after, a ministerial crisis took 
     <lb/>
     place. A new government came in for a few 
     <lb/>
     hours, and started a policy. But that policy, 
     <lb/>
     again, was not this policy. It did not touch 
     <lb/>
     this question. (Hear, hear.) It was pro<lb break="no"/>posed, indeed, to deal with that question of 
     <lb/>
     representation by population by applying 
     <lb/>
     some system of checks or guarantees, doing 
     <lb/>
     or trying to do something that might lessen 
     <lb/>
     the objection of Lower Canada to a change 
     <lb/>
     urged forward as that had been. But that 
     <lb/>
     was all. That government fell—fell instant<lb break="no"/>ly—and another was formed in its place. 
     <lb/>
     And the present Finance Minister, the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Sherbrooke, who, with 
     <lb/>
     all his ability, had not been able to obtain a 
     <lb/>
     serious hearing for his proposal of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the provinces, going into the new 
     <lb/>
     government, induced his colleagues to come 
     <lb/>
     before the House and the country, with that 
     <lb/>
     as a professed portion of their policy. I 
     <lb/>
     may be pardoned, perhaps, for a single word 
     <lb/>
      here of personal reference, for saying, <hi rendition="simple:italic">en 
     <lb/>
     passant</hi>, that when that idea was thus 
     <lb/>
     broached (as it was by a Government of 
     <lb/>
     which I was as firm a supporter as any man 
     <lb/>
     in the House), I did not fail to make it 
     <lb/>
     known, that if ever it should be presented 
     <lb/>
     to the House as a practical measure by that 
     <lb/>
     Government, I should cease to be (so far as 
     <lb/>
     it was concerned) one of such supporters. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) That was not the first time I 
     <lb/>
     had thought of it. It had long before been 
     <lb/>
     a matter of study with me; and all the 
     <lb/>
     anxious reflection l have ever been able to 
     <lb/>
     give it, has only had the result of strength<lb break="no"/>ening my convictions against it every day. 
     <lb/>
     But how was this idea then brought for<lb break="no"/>ward? Tentatively, and just to neutralize 
     <lb/>
     the scheme which the BROWN—DORION Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration had hinted to the country. 
     <lb/>
     The one fire was to burn out another's burn<lb break="no"/>ing. (Hear, hear.) The plan of that 
     <lb/>
    Government was to make propositions to 
     <lb/>the Imperial Government, and to the gov<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
     ernments of the Lower Provinces. But 
     <lb/>
     how? If you want to gain an object, you 
     <lb/>
     put that object before those to whom you 
     <lb/>
     propose it in the way most likely to induce 
     <lb/>
     them to say yes. This scheme was suggest<lb break="no"/>ed to the Imperial Government, and to the 
     <lb/>
     people and governments of the Lower Prov<lb break="no"/>inces, precisely in the way most calculated 
     <lb/>
     to induce them to say no. We went and 
     <lb/>
     told them, "We are in such a state of 
     <lb/>
     embarrassment, we have political questions 
     <lb/>
     which so trouble and bother us, that we 
     <lb/>
     do not know if we can get along at all, 
     <lb/>
     unless you will be so kind as to come into 
     <lb/>
     this union with us." (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     was just as though I were in business, and 
     <lb/>
     went round to half a dozen capitalists, 
     <lb/>
     telling them, " I have got into debt; my 
     <lb/>
     business is gone to the dogs; I have no 
     <lb/>
     business capacity; help me by going into 
     <lb/>
     partnership with me, or I am ruined." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear) If the object had been not 
     <lb/>
     to carry it, it does appear to me that those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen could not have taken a better 
     <lb/>
     method of accomplishing that object. And 
     <lb/>
     we saw this—that just so soon as it was 
     <lb/>
     found that the Lower Provinces did not, as 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances they could not, say 
     <lb/>
     yes to a proposal of this kind, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government let the matter drop, 
     <lb/>
     our Administration let it drop too. We 
     <lb/>
     never heard another word about it The 
     <lb/>
     despatches were laid on our table in 
     <lb/>
     1859, but nobody asked a question about 
     <lb/>
     them. The child was still-born, and no 
     <lb/>
     one troubled himself about its want of 
     <lb/>
     baptism. We went on with our old ques<lb break="no"/>tions—representation by pepulation ; Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada against Lower Canada ; measures, to 
     <lb/>
     a great extent; men also, to a great and 
     <lb/>
     increasing extent. And we quarrelled and 
     <lb/>
     fought about almost everything, but did not 
     <lb/>
     waste a thought or word upon this gigantic 
     <lb/>
     question of the Confederation of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. (Hear, hear.) In a little while we 
     <lb/>
     drifted into another crisis—that of 1862. 
     <lb/>
     And from the time of that crisis, and the 
     <lb/>
     formation of the MACDONALD-SICOTTE 
     <lb/>
     Administration, down to the time when the 
     <lb/>
     present Administration was, last summer, 
     <lb/>
     brought into its present shape, the one 
     <lb/>
     prominent demand made upon political 
     <lb/>
     parties and political men everywhere was, 
     <lb/>
     to set aside the older questions of measures, 
     <lb/>
     and occupy ourselves very much more—not 
     <lb/>
     to say exclusively—with the question of 
     <lb/>
     men. (Hear, hear.) I am not blaming 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">486</fw>
            
     honorable gentlemen ; I am not raising the 
     <lb/>
     question whether they were right or 
     <lb/>
     wrong in taking that course. They may 
     <lb/>
     have been the purest patriots, the most 
     <lb/>
     farseeing statesmen the world has known, 
     <lb/>
     for ought I care. What I say is merely 
     <lb/>
     this, that whether for good or evil, whether 
     <lb/>
     wisely or unwisely, the fact is, that the 
     <lb/>
     public mind was not occupied in the least 
     <lb/>
     with this Confederation question. After 
     <lb/>
     having fought a long time, mainly about 
     <lb/>
     measures, and secondarily about men, we 
     <lb/>
     were all suddenly called upon, in 1862, to 
     <lb/>
     consider nothing but the question of the men 
     <lb/>
     who were to do everything right, and to 
     <lb/>
     settle everything fairly and honestly, and so 
     <lb/>
     forth. Representation by population was un<lb break="no"/>mistakably, for a time at least, laid upon the 
     <lb/>
     shelf, declared to be secondary, almost unim<lb break="no"/>portant. It had been half shelved some 
     <lb/>
     time before ; then, it was wholly shelved. 
     <lb/>
     It was hardly taken down from the shelf in 
     <lb/>
     1863, when the  MACDONALD-DORION Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment merely put it back to the same 
     <lb/>
     place, which it had long occupied to no 
     <lb/>
     purpose of a practical character under 
     <lb/>
     the CARTIER-MACDONALD Administration. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Such, then, was the state of 
     <lb/>
     affairs—nobody thinking or caring about 
     <lb/>
     this great question, until last Session of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, when the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford, the present President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, moved for and obtained a commit<lb break="no"/>tee on the subject of constitutional changes 
     <lb/>
     generally. Certainly that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     did a very clever thing, in embodying in his 
     <lb/>
     motion extracts from the unfortunate defunct 
     <lb/>
     dispatch of Messrs. CARTIER,  GALT and 
     <lb/>
     ROSS. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER—It was 
     <lb/>
     a fortunate despatch—unfortunate for you, 
     <lb/>
     but fortunate for us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         MR. DUNKIN —lt is an old proverb that 
     <lb/>
     says " He laughs well who laughs last." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
          HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER—I ex<lb break="no"/>pect to laugh the last. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         MR. DUNKIN—No doubt. But I do 
     <lb/>
     not care to joke in a matter which I think 
     <lb/>
     of a very serious character ; and, seriously 
     <lb/>
     speaking, I think the hon. gentleman is very 
     <lb/>
     wrong. We have yet to see, in the first 
     <lb/>
     place, whether the thing is done, and then, 
     <lb/>
     if it is done, whether it succeeds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. McGEE—" If 'twere done, 
     <lb/>
     'twere well 'twere done quickly." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         MR. DUNKIN—The Minister of Agri<lb break="no"/>culture is too good a Shakspearian to need to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     be reminded that the thing to be done in that 
     <lb/>
     case was a something very bad. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is welcome to all he can make of 
     <lb/>
     his quotation,—" If 'twere done when 'tis 
     <lb/>
     done, then 'twere well it were done quickly." 
     <lb/>
     To return, however. It was clever, undoubt<lb break="no"/>edly clever, in the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     Oxford to quote from the despatch of these 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen—then, by the  way, in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to the then Government and to himself 
     <lb/>
     —an expression of opinion almost coinciding 
     <lb/>
     with his own. He carried his committee. 
     <lb/>
     No one made any great objection to it. I 
     <lb/>
     have been told that I am guilty of some sort 
     <lb/>
     of inconsistency, after having voted for that 
     <lb/>
     committee, in now opposing this measure. 
     <lb/>
     The <hi rendition="simple:italic">sequitur</hi> is hard to see. I did certainly 
     <lb/>
     speak and vote for it, but on the express 
     <lb/>
     ground that I believed it would do no sort of 
     <lb/>
     harm, and that, on the contrary, it might 
     <lb/>
     have the good effect of leading other hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen to the sober conclusion at which 
     <lb/>
     I had long before arrived myself. I there<lb break="no"/>fore had no objection to the committee, and 
     <lb/>
     I sat on it. I am not going to reveal what 
     <lb/>
     have been called the secrets of the commit<lb break="no"/>tee. As in many other like cases, there was 
     <lb/>
     mighty little in them. Owing to accidents, 
     <lb/>
     wholly  aside from this question of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, the report of the committee was pre<lb break="no"/>sented on the very night that vote happened 
     <lb/>
     to be given, indirectly adverse to the TACHE— 
     <lb/>
     MACDONALD Administration. The report 
     <lb/>
     itself was an accident. All the allusion there 
     <lb/>
     was in it to Federation of any sort, found its 
     <lb/>
     way there at the last moment and unexpect<lb break="no"/>edly. It is no violation of confidence to say 
     <lb/>
     that it was even voted against by the leader 
     <lb/>
     of this House, the Attorney General for 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, the new leading advocate of 
     <lb/>
     the present scheme. That fact is on the 
     <lb/>
     printed record. It was voted against, also  
     <lb/>
     by the members for Cornwall and West El<lb break="no"/>gin. There were five other members, of 
     <lb/>
     whom I am sorry I was one, who were absent ; 
     <lb/>
     had I been there, unquestionably my vote 
     <lb/>
     would have been against it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And, Mr. SPEAKER, those who were in this 
     <lb/>
     House at the time that report was made, will 
     <lb/>
     remember pretty well the more than cool 
     <lb/>
     indifference with which it was here received, 
     <lb/>
     little or nothing, after all, as it amounted to. 
     <lb/>
     Well, this vote in the House thus following, 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity suddenly offered to honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen  opposite of starting on a tack 
     <lb/>
     which, up to that moment, I believe no two 
     <lb/>
     men in the House had ever thought of as 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="487" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0487.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">487</fw>
           
     possible. And from that day to this, a 
     <lb/>
     series of accidents, each one more extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary than its predecessor, has led to a state 
     <lb/>
     of things about as extraordinary as the acci<lb break="no"/>dents emselvcs were. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CART3">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—It is said 
     <lb/>the world was made by a series of accidents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—I dare say some people 
     <lb/>think so ; and it may be so according to the 
     <lb/>theology of my hon. friend, but not according 
     <lb/>to mine. I repeat, what has happened since 
     <lb/>has been tolerably unexpected, even by the 
     <lb/>actors in those occurrences. I do not believe 
     <lb/>they were expected by anybody ; and none, 
     <lb/>I fancy, have been more surprised at them 
     <lb/>than the very men who now take all the 
     <lb/>advantage possible of them, and even the 
     <lb/>credit of 0 having brought them about. And 
     <lb/>how, Mr. SPEAKER, was this scheme pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the public? Piecemeal, and with 
     <lb/>reticences innumerable ; in a way that made 
     <lb/>it hardly possible to criticise it in any of its 
     <lb/>parts. When, after several members of the 
     <lb/>Government of this province and several other 
     <lb/>members of the Conference had gone into 
     <lb/>long explanations of it publicly at Quebec, 
     <lb/>Montreal and Toronto, the honorable member 
     <lb/>for Hochelaga came out with a criticism 
     <lb/>upon and a dissent from it. He was set 
     <lb/>upon with a clamor, to the effect that he 
     <lb/>ought not to have pronounced himself so 
     <lb/>soon, as the whole scheme was not yet de<lb break="no"/>veloped ! It was said he had misrepresented 
     <lb/>the scheme, and ought to have waited until its 
     <lb/>details were really known before attacking it. 
     <lb/>Brought thus before the country, in piece<lb break="no"/>meal style, with some portions kept back, 
     <lb/>and others ambiguously and even contradic<lb break="no"/>torily stated, no one could seriously take hold 
     <lb/>of it. After some time, it is true, a printed 
     <lb/>paper, purporting to set forth the resolutions 
     <lb/>of the Conference, was sent round to mem<lb break="no"/>bers, but with the word " Private" written 
     <lb/>on it, as much as to say that it was not offici<lb break="no"/>ally communicated, and must be made no 
     <lb/>public use of. That that private communi<lb break="no"/>cation was not even perfectly accurate, is 
     <lb/>now perfectly well known ; but that was of 
     <lb/>little consequence, as it could not be made 
     <lb/>use of publicly. Such is the way in which 
     <lb/>this matter was laid before the people. Every 
     <lb/>possible advantage was given to the people 
     <lb/>to praise it from every point of view, and 
     <lb/>nobody got a fair opportunity of saying that 
     <lb/>he did not like it. The praise was carefully 
     <lb/>prepared and published, and everything that 
     <lb/>could possibly be done to prepare the public 
     <lb/>mind for the scheme before it final announce<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
       ment was skilfully done. And now what 
     <lb/>
     have we? Why, the cry that the whole 
     <lb/>
     thing must be passed, " now or never." It 
     <lb/>
     will never pass, we are told, if it does not 
     <lb/>
     pass now! (Hear, hear.) Was there ever 
     <lb/>
    l a measure of this magnitude before, on which 
     <lb/>the heart of a country was set, the whole of 
     <lb/>which was so wise and good as this scheme 
     <lb/>is said to be—and yet, that had to be passed 
     <lb/>(the whole of it) at once, or never? (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) We are even told that it is a positive 
     <lb/>treaty— made however, by the way, by 
     <lb/>parties who were never authorized to make 
     <lb/>any treaty at all. I must say, for one, that 
     <lb/>I cannot but see in all this precipitancy 
     <lb/>the unmistakeable admission <hi rendition="simple:italic">de facto</hi>, that 
     <lb/>the Government themselves know and feel 
     <lb/>that the feeling they have got up in favor of 
     <lb/>this scheme is a passing feeling of momentary 
     <lb/>duration, that they cannot themselves in the 
     <lb/>least rely upon. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>it is rather curious that hon. gentlemen, in 
     <lb/>recommending this scheme of theirs, seem 
     <lb/>never to be tired of speaking of its ex<lb break="no"/>cellencies in general, and of modestly 
     <lb/>eulogiziug the wisdom, and foresight, 
     <lb/>and statesmanship of those who got it up. 
     <lb/>I cannot wonder that their judgment in this 
     <lb/>behalf should be a little led astray by their 
     <lb/>surprise at the success which has so far 
     <lb/>attended their project. Their " officious" visit 
     <lb/>to Prince Edward Island took but a very 
     <lb/>few days, and it resulted in the scheme of 
     <lb/>a legislative union for the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>being (as I think, unfortunately) laid aside; 
     <lb/>and then followed the Conference at Quebec, 
     <lb/>where these twelve honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>representing Canada, and twenty-one other 
     <lb/>gentlemen representing the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, sat together for the long period of 
     <lb/>nineteen days—seventeen working days and 
     <lb/>two Sundays—and as the result of these 
     <lb/>seventeen days of but partial work by the 
     <lb/>way, we have from these thirty-three gentle<lb break="no"/>men a scheme of a Constitution which they 
     <lb/>vaunt of as being altogether better than that 
     <lb/>of the model republic of the United States, 
     <lb/>and even than that of the model kingdom of 
     <lb/>Great Britain. Neither the model republic nor 
     <lb/>yet the model kingdom of whose glorious tra<lb break="no"/>ditions and associations we are all so proud, is 
     <lb/>for a moment to be compared with this work 
     <lb/>of theirs. (Hear, hear.) So perfect do 
     <lb/>they seem to regard their pet measure, that 
     <lb/>they tell us we must not take time to discuss 
     <lb/>it. Even though Her Majesty's Secretary 
     <lb/>of State has told us that there are features 
     <lb/>of it that require further consideration and 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="488" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0488.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">488</fw>
     must be revised, yet they tell us that we 
     <lb/>
     must not change a letter or line of it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And yet, we are at the same time 
     <lb/>
     told that the details of this scheme, if 
     <lb/>
     examined at all, must be examined and 
     <lb/>
     viewed as those of a compromise. It is not, 
     <lb/>
     they freely admit, as satisfactory in its de<lb break="no"/>tails as any of us would desire to have ; but 
     <lb/>
     it is all we can get, and must be accepted or 
     <lb/>
     rejected as a whole. It must be examined 
     <lb/>
     in the very spirit of compromise, meaning 
     <lb/>
     that no serious fault shall be found with it, 
     <lb/>
     however unsatisfactory it may be. I have 
     <lb/>
     heard of Paddy's notion of a reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     that was all on one side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. McGEE</persName>—Now let us have no

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Oh! I mean it as a

     across the House these jokes; not that I

     object to an occasional interruption by way 
     <lb/>
     of question, but mere jokes thrown into the 
     <lb/>
     discussion of a serious subject do not help 
     <lb/>
     any man who desires to present his honest, 
     <lb/>
     sincere and serious views on a grave ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I must ask the two hon. members of

     the Government, who have several times, by 
     <lb/>
     means of interruptions of that nature, tried 
     <lb/>
     to throw me off the track, to desist from

     such course in future.

     <persName ref="pers:CART3">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—I am sure 
     <lb/>
     the hon.gentleman did not intend to discon<lb break="no"/>cert you, nor had I any such purpose in view. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—I will not say it is done 
     <lb/>
     for that purpose; but I feel myself more 
     <lb/>
     than usually annoyed with interruptions to<lb break="no"/>night, because the subject is of a nature to 
     <lb/>
     require the closest attention. This measure, 
     <lb/>
     then, it is said, must be examined in this 
     <lb/>
     spirit, of compromise, that is to sav, not 
     <lb/>
     objecting to any of its provisions. One of 
     <lb/>
     the expressions used by the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     was—that we should not require in the 
     <lb/>
     scheme "an impossible perfection." Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I do not think there is any danger of 
     <lb/>
     our finding any impossible perfection in it, 
     <lb/>
     or anything relating to it, unless, indeed, in 
     <lb/>
     one particular direction ; and in that direc<lb break="no"/>tion I do not know but that there has been 
     <lb/>
     attained all possible perfection at least, if 
     <lb/>
     not an impossible perfection. I allude to 
     <lb/>
     that particular kind of wisdom and foresight 
     <lb/>
     which marks the astute official politician, as 
     <lb/>
     contradistinguished from the far-seeing 
     <lb/>
     statesman. (Hear, hear.) There has been 
     <lb/>
     exhibited, in this one respect, an all but 
     <lb/>
     impossible perfection. Every feeling, every 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     interest, every class, is bid for in the cleverest 
     <lb/>
     way imaginable. The seat of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government is to be at Ottawa, of course. 
     <lb/>
     The Governor General or other head of this 
     <lb/>
     magnificent future vice-royalty, or what not, 
     <lb/>
     will hold his court and parliament at Ottawa; 
     <lb/>
     but a handsome sop is thrown to Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     Toronto, also. They, too, are each to have 
     <lb/>
     a provincial court and legislature and go<lb break="no"/>vernmental departments. Everything for 
     <lb/>
     everybody! As to the state that is to be 
     <lb/>
     created, its style and rank are left in most 
     <lb/>
     delightful ambiguity. We may be honored 
     <lb/>
     with the dignity of a kingdom, or of a vice<lb break="no"/>royalty, or of we know not what. All we 
     <lb/>
     are assured of is, that it is to be a something 
     <lb/>
     better, higher and more grand than we now 
     <lb/>
     have. Perhaps the Sovereign herself will 
     <lb/>
     occasionally come over and exercise her 
     <lb/>
     authority in person; or, perhaps, a throne 
     <lb/>
     will be created for some member of the royal 
     <lb/>
     family; or, failing such dreams as these, 
     <lb/>
     we are told, at the least, in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     character of the representative who is to 
     <lb/>
     be sent here in place of the Sovereign—that 
     <lb/>
     is to say. the representative who is to ad<lb break="no"/>minister the government during the ordi<lb break="no"/>nary absence of the Sovereign from this 
     <lb/>
     part of the British dominions—we are told, 
     <lb/>
     I say, by the leader of this House, that, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the functions to be entrusted to 
     <lb/>
     him, the high position he is to hold, the 
     <lb/>
     vice-regal state he will have to keep, it is 
     <lb/>
     possible we shall, at least, have sent out here 
     <lb/>
     in that capacity. hereafter, men of the class 
     <lb/>
     emphatically called statesmen. I have no taste 
     <lb/>
     for paying what may be termed courtier com<lb break="no"/>pliments to the living; but, looking back only 
     <lb/>
     to the dead, of whom one may speak freely, 
     <lb/>
     without such fear, I must say that tho-e 
     <lb/>
     who have been appointed to administer our 
     <lb/>
     government in the past are hardly of the 
     <lb/>
     class to be looked down upon—that the list 
     <lb/>
     in which we find the names of DURHAM, 
     <lb/>
     SYDENHAM, METCALFE and ELGIN, is not 
     <lb/>
     precisely a list of men inferior to the higher 
     <lb/>
     class of those whom we call statesmen; and 
     <lb/>
     am not quite sure that even after this great 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy shall have been established, 
     <lb/>
     men of much higher mark than those we 
     <lb/>
     have already had will be appointed to rule 
     <lb/>
     over it. Be that as it may, however, the 
     <lb/>
     bait is thrown out that we are to have men 
     <lb/>
     much higher than we ever had before; that 
     <lb/>
     in all manner of ways our state is to be 
     <lb/>
     better, finer, grander, in fact, than our ima<lb break="no"/>gination can well conceive. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     We are, it seems, among other things, to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="489" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0489.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">489</fw>
               
     get a little more than we now have of what 
     <lb/>
     is called a feature of the British Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, in the composition of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council. It has been spoken of as an im<lb break="no"/>propriety, almost treasonable, to hint at it as 
     <lb/>
     a bait thrown out to gentlemen who have 
     <lb/>
     been elected to the Legislative Council for 
     <lb/>
     a fixed period, that by voting for this 
     <lb/>
     scheme they may get themselves made le<lb break="no"/>gislative councillors for life. If in this 
     <lb/>
     scheme provision had been made, in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the members of this branch of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, that they should hold their seats, not 
     <lb/>
     for life, but say, for a mere period of five 
     <lb/>
     years, I rather think there would be few 
     <lb/>
     found here very mealy-mouthed on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject; and when it is offered to men who, 
     <lb/>
     like ourselves, will have to go before their 
     <lb/>
     constituents within a few months, or years, 
     <lb/>
     at most, that they are to be made legislative 
     <lb/>
     councillors for life, the bait, I think, is not 
     <lb/>
     a very small one. (Hear, hear.) We are told, 
     <lb/>
     too, on the face of this scheme, that the 
     <lb/>
     choice is to be made by the present govern<lb break="no"/>ments of the several provinces; but of course 
     <lb/>
     with perfect fairness to the Opposition in 
     <lb/>
     each province! Most satisfactory! Each Op<lb break="no"/>position is to be treated with perfect fairness 
     <lb/>
     —" it is so nominated in the bond." We hear 
     <lb/>
     of a minister of the Crown in one place, ad<lb break="no"/>dressing his neighbors, and telling them they 
     <lb/>
     may depend on it, that when Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     comes to make the selection, the utmost res<lb break="no"/>pect will be paid to the rights and privileges 
     <lb/>
     of the elected members, so that their elected 
     <lb/>
     member will have the fairest chance of be<lb break="no"/>coming a life member of the Confederate 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council. In another place, on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, we hear from another minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Crown that those gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     hold patents of appointment for life may feel 
     <lb/>
     quite as safe, for certainly their claim to be 
     <lb/>
     retained in their present position is sure to 
     <lb/>
     have full weight. Further, in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     each locality is told that it may rest satisfied 
     <lb/>
     It will not be overlooked, for each is to be 
     <lb/>
     represented in the Legislative Council by a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman residing or holding property in 
     <lb/>
     it; and both origins and both creeds alike 
     <lb/>
     are thus to have representation and full pro<lb break="no"/>tection. Another point upon which there 
     <lb/>
     has been a like pleasant sort of ambiguity 
     <lb/>
     kept up, is as to who are to make the future 
     <lb/>
     nominations to this Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     Viewing this part of the scheme as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     principle, one would have thought that these 
     <lb/>
     future nominations must be made on the 
     <lb/>
     
          
            <cb/>
            
     Federal principle. It was not expressly so 
     <lb/>
     stated; it is not (as we are at last here 
     <lb/>
     told) it is not so meant; but till we 
     <lb/>
     were so told, everybody who thought one 
     <lb/>
     way said that the resolutions meant it 
     <lb/>
     to be that way, and all who thought the 
     <lb/>
     other way conveniently found the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     to justify their way of thinking. Well, 
     <lb/>
     turning then to matters which affect this 
     <lb/>
     House, the same sort of thing is still observ<lb break="no"/>able. Representation by population is 
     <lb/>
     given to meet the grand demand of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada; but the people of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     are assured, in the same breath, that it will 
     <lb/>
     not hurt them; that their institutions and 
     <lb/>
     privileges are made perfectly safe ; that they 
     <lb/>
     will even have as many members in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower House as before, and that they will, 
     <lb/>
     in a variety of ways, be really better off 
     <lb/>
     than ever. A delightful ambiguity is found, 
     <lb/>
     too, upon the point as to who will make the 
     <lb/>
     future apportionments of the constituencies. 
     <lb/>
     The leader of the Government, in explaining 
     <lb/>
     the scheme the other night, admitted that 
     <lb/>
     the decennial revisions of our representation 
     <lb/>
     districts are really not to be left to the local 
     <lb/>
     legislatures, but are to be dealt with alto<lb break="no"/>gether by the Federal Legislature. Till 
     <lb/>
     then most people, I believe, had held the 
     <lb/>
     contrary; but all had admitted the text of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions to be equivocal, and each 
     <lb/>
     party had of course interpreted them as it 
     <lb/>
     wished. The postponement of the local 
     <lb/>
     constitutions is of the same character. 
     <lb/>
     Everyone is given to understand that the 
     <lb/>
     thing will be made to work to the satis<lb break="no"/>faction of all; each is promised that he 
     <lb/>
     shall have it as he wants. Those who 
     <lb/>
     hold to the principle of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, as commonly understood, in the local 
     <lb/>
     administrations are, of course, told to 
     <lb/>
     expect a lieutenant-governor, with a cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     and, presumably, two branches of a local 
     <lb/>
     legislature. Those who Wmlld have two 
     <lb/>
     legislative bodies, without a responsible 
     <lb/>
     ministry, are told that very well it may be 
     <lb/>
     so. Whoever prefers one legislative body, 
     <lb/>
     hears that it is beyond a doubt there very 
     <lb/>
     well may only be one; and those again who, 
     <lb/>
     even with one House, do not wish to see 
     <lb/>
     responsible government in the provinces, are 
     <lb/>
     assured that the machinery is likely to be 
     <lb/>
     very simple; that each province will proba<lb break="no"/>bly have a lieutenant-governor, with a few 
     <lb/>
     heads of needed departments, and one House, 
     <lb/>
     and that so, no doubt, the affairs of each pro<lb break="no"/>vince can be managed most economically and 
     <lb/>
            <pb n="490" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0490.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">490</fw>
          
     to the entire satisfaction of all. The appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of lieutenant-governors is again a bait, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps not a small one for more than 
     <lb/>
     a few of our public men. The power of 
     <lb/>
     disallowance of local bills, and also that of 
     <lb/>
     reserving them for the sanction of the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government, are on the one hand 
     <lb/>
     represented as realities—powers that will 
     <lb/>
     really be exercised by the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to restrain improper local legislation— 
     <lb/>
     to make everything safe for those who want 
     <lb/>
     a Legislative rather than a Federal union ; 
     <lb/>
     but on the other hand, to those who do not 
     <lb/>
     want a legislative union, it is represented 
     <lb/>
     that they mean nothing at all, and will never 
     <lb/>
     be exercised. (Hear, hear.) Uniformity 
     <lb/>
     of laws again is to be given to all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, if they desire it, except Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada ; but by a peculiar provision of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, although nothing can be done 
     <lb/>
     by the General Parliament to render the 
     <lb/>
     laws uniform, without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces concerned, it is stipulated that it 
     <lb/>
     shall be impossible for Lower Canada, even 
     <lb/>
     though she should desire it, to have her laws 
     <lb/>
     uniform with those of the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     So, too, with regard to education in Upper 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada ; the provision is to be 
     <lb/>
     made, no one knows how, for everybody, and 
     <lb/>
     all are guaranteed some sort of satisfaction. 
     <lb/>
     It is true we are not told what the promised 
     <lb/>
     measures on this head are to be ; whether 
     <lb/>
     they really will give increased facilities to 
     <lb/>
     the minorities in the two sections for the 
     <lb/>
     education of their youth in their own way 
     <lb/>
     or not ; but we are to take the promise as 
     <lb/>
     all right, and everybody is required to be 
     <lb/>
     content. Turning to the financial features 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme, we find it roundly stated that 
     <lb/>
     all the debts and liabilities of each province 
     <lb/>
     are to be assumed by the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ; but if we look again into details we 
     <lb/>
     find that—no, they are not. There is a 
     <lb/>
     something here, too, beyond what appears 
     <lb/>
     on the face of things. Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada are each to stay burthened with some 
     <lb/>
     unstated parts of the debt of Canada, and the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces are to have <hi rendition="simple:italic">bonuses</hi> of unstated 
     <lb/>
     and variant mounts, not easy to be come at. 
     <lb/>
     The financial portion of the scheme, equally 
     <lb/>
     with every other, is presented to everybody 
     <lb/>
     in whatever light he would like to view it in. 
     <lb/>
     It will surely bring about economy, because 
     <lb/>
     the local governments will have so little to 
     <lb/>
     expend unless they resort to direct taxation ; 
     <lb/>
     but yet, on the other hand, it is as surely to 
     <lb/>
     carry us through all sorts of wild expendi<lb break="no"/>ture—to give us new and exhaustless credit 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     in England—to make possible vast defensive 
     <lb/>
     works throughout the country—to construct 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway—to enlarge our 
     <lb/>
     canals westward—to create no one knows 
     <lb/>
     how vast a scheme of communication with 
     <lb/>
     the far North-West. Literally, it sounds at 
     <lb/>
     every turn as a promise of everything for 
     <lb/>
     everybody ; and yet, when each comes to ask 
     <lb/>
     how much it promises, and how, and where, 
     <lb/>
     and when, the whole is to be found ambigu<lb break="no"/>ous, unsubstantial and unreal. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I repeat, there is everywhere throughout this 
     <lb/>
     scheme a most amazing amount of that sort 
     <lb/>
     of cleverness which may characterize the 
     <lb/>
     astute politician, but which, I think, I shall 
     <lb/>
     be able to show is yet far from being the wis<lb break="no"/>dom and foresight characteristic of the far<lb break="no"/>seeing statesman. (Hear, hear.) The game 
     <lb/>
     of all things to all men is a game that cannot 
     <lb/>
     be played with success in the long run. lt 
     <lb/>
     can, under any circumstances, be but tempo<lb break="no"/>rary in its success. (Hear, hear.) Seriously, 
     <lb/>
     then, Mr. SPEAKER, I pass on to examine 
     <lb/>
     this work in a constitutional point of view, 
     <lb/>
     clearing away, as best one may, these ambigu<lb break="no"/>ities that surround it, dealing with it as it is, 
     <lb/>
     and comparing it primarily with the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the United States, and secondarily with 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution of Great Britain. I wish 
     <lb/>
     I could compare it primarily with that of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain ; but it is so much more like 
     <lb/>
     that of the United States, that I cannot. In 
     <lb/>
     parts only has it any resemblance to the 
     <lb/>
     British Constitution ; and for this reason the 
     <lb/>
     order of comparison cannot be reversed. I 
     <lb/>
     must say, before I go further, that I am by 
     <lb/>
     no means an admirer of a great deal that I 
     <lb/>
     find in the Constitution of the United States. 
     <lb/>
     I have always preferred, decidedly preferred, 
     <lb/>
     and do now prefer, our own British Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. But this, at least, no one can deny, 
     <lb/>
     that the framers of the American Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion were great men, wise men, far-seeing 
     <lb/>
     men ; that their work was a great work ; and 
     <lb/>
     that to compare anybody else's work— 
     <lb/>
     especially a work such as this, of the few 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, doubtless able gentlemen, who 
     <lb/>
     framed this Constitution—with it, is to 
     <lb/>
     submit that work to a very severe and trying 
     <lb/>
     test. (Hear, hear.) The framers of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution of the United States were, 
     <lb/>
     indeed, great men—living in, and the 
     <lb/>
     product of a great age, who had passed 
     <lb/>
     through a great ordeal and been brought 
     <lb/>
     up to the level of their work by great 
     <lb/>
     events in which they had been leading 
     <lb/>
     actors ; and their work was a great 
     <lb/>
     work, which cost much time and much 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="491" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0491.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">491</fw>
            
     discussion, and underwent long and pains<lb break="no"/>taking revision of all sorts, in all quarters, 
     <lb/>
     before it was finally adopted. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Yet we are called upon to admit now, and to 
     <lb/>
     admit it without examination, that this work 
     <lb/>
     of thirty-three gentlemen, done in seventeen 
     <lb/>
     days, is a much better work than that; and 
     <lb/>
     not only so, but that it is even better for 
     <lb/>
     our people and situation, than the time- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     honored Constitution of our Mother Land; 
     <lb/>
     that it combines essentially the advantages 
     <lb/>
     of both, with the disadvantages of neither. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think so. The Constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, it must be borne in mind, at 
     <lb/>
     least lasted seventy years without fracture. 
     <lb/>
     It has stood a good deal of straining, from 
     <lb/>
     events beyond the possible foresight or con<lb break="no"/>trol of those who framed it; and it may yet 
     <lb/>
     stand many more years, notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     this late strain upon it. If, indeed, Louisiana 
     <lb/>
     had not been purchased, if the cotton-gin 
     <lb/>
     had not been invented—the two unforeseen 
     <lb/>
     events which so encouraged the growth 
     <lb/>
     of cotton and therefore of slavery—if it 
     <lb/>
     had not been for these, what I may call 
     <lb/>
     extraneous events, which could not be 
     <lb/>
     expected to enter into the minds of the 
     <lb/>
     framers of that Constitution, it probably 
     <lb/>
     would not have received the shock that 
     <lb/>
     it has received ; but we do not know yet 
     <lb/>
     that that shock will have a fatal effect, 
     <lb/>
     or that it will break up the wonderful fabric 
     <lb/>
     which they created. Perhaps it may change 
     <lb/>
     that fabric more or less in some of its parts; 
     <lb/>
     and after it shall have passed away, the fabric 
     <lb/>
     itself may not improbably endure for a very 
     <lb/>
     long time to come. But as to this proposed 
     <lb/>
     Constitution of ours, should it become the 
     <lb/>
     organic law of the land, how long will it last ? 
     <lb/>
     How will it work, if it does last? And to 
     <lb/>
     or towards what, while working, will it tend? 
     <lb/>
     To these questions, I have now to call the 
     <lb/>
     earnest attention of this House. I begin, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, with the future House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons—falsely so called. I shall not take 
     <lb/>
     up the different resolutions one after another, 
     <lb/>
     and criticise them in that manner; but I 
     <lb/>
     will take up the difl'erent leading features of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme consecutively, and endeavor not 
     <lb/>
     to misrepresent them. If I should do so, 
     <lb/>
     or at all misstate their character or probable 
     <lb/>
     effects, I give honorable gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     full leave, if only they will do so without 
     <lb/>
     throwing jokes across the floor of this House, 
     <lb/>
     to correct me, and I will do my best'to set 
     <lb/>
     myself right. The House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     then, incorrectly so called, to distinguish it 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     from the other House that corresponds 
     <lb/>
     with, but is not named after the House 
     <lb/>
     of Lords, the Legislative Council, forms 
     <lb/>
     the leading feature of this project; and 
     <lb/>
     I take it up first, comparing it with the 
     <lb/>
     House of Representatives of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, and speaking litre not so much of its 
     <lb/>
     powers as of its composition. I cannot, in 
     <lb/>
     this view, compare it with the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, because the principle of 
     <lb/>
     its construction is so entirely different. In 
     <lb/>
     that respect, it is simply copied from what I 
     <lb/>
     think the wrong model; and the copied 
     <lb/>
     parts correspond most faithfully and exactly 
     <lb/>
     with what I venture to call the least desirable 
     <lb/>
     features of the Constitution of the United 
     <lb/>
     States House of Representatives. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The copy is not, I repeat, of a thing 
     <lb/>
     absolutely good, but only of a thing as good 
     <lb/>
     as the framers of the Constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, circumstanced as they were, 
     <lb/>
     could make it ; but the peculiarity of their 
     <lb/>
     system that I object to, was not at all neces<lb break="no"/>sary to ours. I think it was absolutely 
     <lb/>
     unnecessary; I think it even very much of . 
     <lb/>
     an excrcscence. It can hardly be denied, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, that there is a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     practical objection to the plan of shifting 
     <lb/>
     representation districts, which is what this 
     <lb/>
     system adopts, and what the system of the 
     <lb/>
     United States adopted. Every ten years the 
     <lb/>
     representation from each province in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons is to be changed or 
     <lb/>
     readjusted by a rule which, for all practical 
     <lb/>
     purposes, is essentially the same as that of 
     <lb/>
     the United States. Of course we have not 
     <lb/>
     the little addition of the allowance for the 
     <lb/>
     three-fifths of the slave population which 
     <lb/>
     they have ; but decennially we are to take 
     <lb/>
     the population of the several provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     by a rule in all essentials common to the 
     <lb/>
     two systems, we are to declare how many 
     <lb/>
     representation districts are to be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     each province. Now, the result of that 
     <lb/>
     system must be that we can have no lasting 
     <lb/>
     constituencies for the future House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. These representation districts cannot 
     <lb/>
     be kept to correspond with our municipal, 
     <lb/>
     business or registration districts, or with our 
     <lb/>
     districts for representation in our provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislatures. We are to have sect of special, 
     <lb/>
     shifting districts for the mere purpose of 
     <lb/>
     electing our Federal House of Commons. I 
     <lb/>
     must say that this principle is not, from a Brit<lb break="no"/>ish point of view, a sound one. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     What we ought to «his, to try to establish 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     for other purposes, as circumstances will allow 
     <lb/>
     us to have them; subdividing or otherwise 
     <lb/>
     altering them, or erecting new ones, only as 
     <lb/>
     occasion may be found to require.

     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—"Perhaps so, and perhaps 
     <lb/>
    not.  That distinction, however, is just what

     <lb/>local parliaments, if we like, but not unless 
     <lb/>we like. These subdivisions of our provinces 
     <lb/>may thus, in the main, be permanent.  But. 
     <lb/>for representation in the Federal Parliament 
     <lb/>we are, at each of these decennial periods, to 
     <lb/>have a general readjustment of the whole 
     <lb/>country, so as to divide each province anew 
     <lb/>into its due number of aliquot parts. This 
     <lb/>is an innovation on our usages, greatly for 
     <lb/>the worse. It goes to destroy that character 
     <lb/>of reality, convenience and stability which— 
     <lb/>if our system, as a whole, is to have such 
     <lb/>character—had need be maintained to the 
     <lb/>utmost extent practicable, in respect of our 
     <lb/>constituencies and of our minor territo<lb break="no"/>rial delimitations generally. This changing 
     <lb/>every ten years brings together electors who 
     <lb/>have not been in the habit of acting with 
     <lb/>each other. In England they do nothing of 
     <lb/>this sort; they do not change their limits 
     <lb/>lightly. The several bodies of men who 
     <lb/>send representatives to the Imperial House 
     <lb/>of Commons have the habit of so coming 
     <lb/>together, as bodies not likely to be broken 
     <lb/>up. We ought to keep this as an element 
     <lb/>of our Constitution, but it is carefully elimi<lb break="no"/>nated from it.

            <p>.  HON. Mr. McDOUGALL—I am sure 
     <lb/>the honorable gentleman does not wish to 
     <lb/>build up an argument on a misconception of 
     <lb/>the resolutions for the purpose of misrepre<lb break="no"/>sentation. I am sure that he must have 
     <lb/>observed this fact, that it may, and probably 
     <lb/>will often happen, that there will be no 
     <lb/>change as to the number of members or 
     <lb/>electoral districts, and there certainly will 
     <lb/>be none if the increase of population in 
     <lb/>Lower Canada keeps pace with that in Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, and therefore the evil he com<lb break="no"/>plains of will not occur unless there be some 
     <lb/>different rule of increase from that which 
     <lb/>has prevailed heretofore. .

            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—If any one imagines that 
     <lb/>
     the population of the different provinces is 
     <lb/>
     going to increase upon any thing like the 
     <lb/>
     same rule, then I difler trom him. I believe 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     there will be a very much more rapid rate 
     <lb/>
     of increase in some provinces than in others; 
     <lb/>
     a divergence between them in this respect, 
     <lb/>
     of the same kind, and perhaps, even to the 
     <lb/>
     same degree as in the case of the United 
     <lb/>
     States. There, in the old states, at every 
     <lb/>
     decennial revision, the number of represen<lb break="no"/>tatives lessens, and in the new states it in<lb break="no"/>creases, and that rapidly. It is only in the 
     <lb/>
     comparatively few states which may be said to 
     <lb/>
     be neither old nor new that it remains about the 
     <lb/>
     same. The rule is one of change, for the 
     <lb/>
     country everywhere. Any escape from change 
     <lb/>
     is the exception. And with us, those provinces 
     <lb/>
     which shall be found to increase faster than 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, as some certainly will be, 
     <lb/>
     will re-divide their whole territory every ten 
     <lb/>
     years, in order to increase their number of 
     <lb/>
     districts; and those which increase slower 
     <lb/>
     will do the same, in order to cut some off. 
     <lb/>
     Even Lower Canada, to meet the varying 
     <lb/>
     rates of increase of its several parts, will be 
     <lb/>
     drawn into doing the same sort of thing. I 
     <lb/>
     shall be told, no doubt, that this need not 
     <lb/>
     be—that mere partial changes here and there 
     <lb/>
     may be made to answer the end; but I know 
     <lb/>
     that in the nature of things it will be, that 
     <lb/>
     such partial changes will not be made the 
     <lb/>
     rule. The sweeping rule is laid down, in the 
     <lb/>
     abstract, of basing representation on mere 
     <lb/>
     population; and that rule is sure to be fol<lb break="no"/>lowed out—not only as between the several 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but also as within each ; and 
     <lb/>
     here again, not only as for Federal, but also 
     <lb/>
     as for provincial legislation. For all legis<lb break="no"/>lative purposes, we must look to have all our 
     <lb/>
     territorial divisions open to frequent, one 
     <lb/>
     might say perpetual, reconstruction ; and 
     <lb/>
     this subject perpetually to the disturbing 
     <lb/>
     influences of the party warfare of the hour. 
     <lb/>
     The exigencies of that warfare, we may be 
     <lb/>
     sure, will tell ; and whatever the party in the 
     <lb/>
     ascendant, whether in the country at large 
     <lb/>
     or locally, will find means in this part of our 
     <lb/>
     machinery for advancing its ends—means not 
     <lb/>
     quite of the sort to commend themselves to 
     <lb/>
     one's approval. (Hear, hear.) It is claimed, 
     <lb/>
     I know, as a merit of this scheme, that it 
     <lb/>
     allows a five years' term to our House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons, in place of the two years' term 
     <lb/>
     fixed for the House of Representatives. 
     <lb/>
     Apart from these decennial revisions, I would 
     <lb/>
     be glad of this. But five is the half of ten, I 
     <lb/>
     think; and though our Houses of Commons may 
     <lb/>
     often not last their full term, there will yet sel<lb break="no"/>dom or never, in all probability, be more than 
     <lb/>
     either two or three general elections held 
     <lb/>
     between any two decennial revisions. A less 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="493" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0493.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">493</fw>
               
     satisfactory arrangement, if one is to think 
     <lb/>
     of our House of Commons at all treading in 
     <lb/>
     the footsteps of its great namesake, I confess 
     <lb/>
     I can hardly imagine. There everything 
     <lb/>
     favors that combined steadiness and variety 
     <lb/>
     of local influences upon the representative 
     <lb/>
     machinery which is at once characteristic of, 
     <lb/>
     and essential to, the British system, and 
     <lb/>
     without which neither public parties nor 
     <lb/>
     public men can act or last as it requires they 
     <lb/>
     should. Here everything is to be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     tend in precisely the opposite direction. Nor 
     <lb/>
     is this all. At home, while the constitu<lb break="no"/>encies are wisely kept as lasting as they can 
     <lb/>
     be, the members they return are all held 
     <lb/>
     members of the one House of Commons, as 
     <lb/>
     little distinguished by the English, Scotch, 
     <lb/>
     Irish or Welsh location of their constituen<lb break="no"/>cies as they well can be. Here, again, this 
     <lb/>
     United States system which we are asked to 
     <lb/>
     copy, is the reverse, and the reverse of sound 
     <lb/>
     judgment. The House of Representatives 
     <lb/>
     is an aggregate of state delegations, and our 
     <lb/>
     mock House of Commons is to be an aggre<lb break="no"/>gate of provincial delegations. Each man is 
     <lb/>
     to come to it ticketed as an Upper or Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, a New Brunswicker, a Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotian, Newfoundlander, a Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Islander, or what not. These distinctions, 
     <lb/>
     which, if we are to be a united 
     <lb/>
     people, we had better try to sink, we 
     <lb/>
     are to keep up and exaggerate. The 
     <lb/>
     system will do that, and but too well. 
     <lb/>
     There is, however, one marked contrast as 
     <lb/>
     to this, between the system of the United 
     <lb/>
     States and that proposed here. In the 
     <lb/>
     United States, for the House of Represen<lb break="no"/>tatives, the system is at least sure to work, 
     <lb/>
     whether for good or evil. Theirs is a true 
     <lb/>
     Federation. Its founders took care, when, 
     <lb/>
     with the foresight of statesmen, they arranged 
     <lb/>
     the details of their constitution, to frame it 
     <lb/>
     so as to work in all its important parts, and 
     <lb/>
     with that end they left it mainly to the 
     <lb/>
     several states to work out the arithmetical 
     <lb/>
     rule laid down for these decennial revisions, 
     <lb/>
     giving them such powers as to make sure 
     <lb/>
     that the thing intended would be really 
     <lb/>
     and punctually done. I thought when I 
     <lb/>
     read these resolutions first, that it was, of 
     <lb/>
     course, the intention of their framers to 
     <lb/>
     adopt that system here; but we are now 
     <lb/>
     authoritatively told that it is not so. The 
     <lb/>
     General Parliament is alone to do the whole 
     <lb/>
     work of these re-divisions of the consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies throughout the provinces. But, 
     <lb/>
     suppose that for any cause, such as readily 
     <lb/>
     may suggest itself—under pretext of alleged 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     incorrectness of a census, or without pretext 
     <lb/>
     —it should fail to discharge this duty 
     <lb/>
     promptly, or should discharge it in a ques<lb break="no"/>tionable way, or not at all—what then? 
     <lb/>
     Is the Imperial Parliament to reserve a right 
     <lb/>
     of interference in such case ; or is the 
     <lb/>
     doctrine broached the other night by the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Lower Canada, as to 
     <lb/>
     its power to revoke our constitutional charters, 
     <lb/>
     to be acted on?  I should fancy not.  But 
     <lb/>
     why, then, pretend to ask the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to do so weak a thing as to lay 
     <lb/>
     down for us a bad rule for all time to come, 
     <lb/>
     merely that we may follow it or not, as in 
     <lb/>
     our wisdom or unwisdom we may please? 
     <lb/>
     Well, then, Mr. SPEAKER, I turn next to 
     <lb/>
     our Legislative Council — too little like 
     <lb/>
     the House of Lords, to bear even a mo<lb break="no"/>ment's comparison. in that direction. It 
     <lb/>
     must be compared with the Senate of the 
     <lb/>
     United States; but the differences here are 
     <lb/>
     very wide. The framers of this Constitution 
     <lb/>
     have here contrived a system quite different 
     <lb/>
     from that; and when we are told (as it seems 
     <lb/>
     we are) that the Legislative Council is to 
     <lb/>
     represent especially the Federal element in 
     <lb/>
     our Constitution, I do not hesitate to affirm 
     <lb/>
     that there is not a particle of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     principle about it ; that it is the merest sham 
     <lb/>
     that can be imagined. (Hear, hear.) To 
     <lb/>
     show the contrast. The Senate of the 
     <lb/>
     United States consists of just two senators, 
     <lb/>
     freely chosen by the Legislature of each 
     <lb/>
     State of the Union.

     <lb/>
     the Senate consists of just two senators from 
     <lb/>
     each state, who are freely selected by the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of each state. It is true that in 
     <lb/>
     case of any casual vacancy power is given to 
     <lb/>
     the Governor of the state to fill up such 
     <lb/>
     vacancy until the next meeting of the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the state. But it is the legislatures 
     <lb/>
     of the several states who regularly elect these 
     <lb/>
     senators from each, for a stated term of six 
     <lb/>
     years, and subject to an arrangement for 
     <lb/>
     their retiring in such rotation as never to leave 
     <lb/>
     any state unre resented. Well, sir, the 
     <lb/>
     Senate of the nited States, thus constitu<lb break="no"/>ted of two picked men from each state, and 
     <lb/>
     presided over by the Vice-President or by 
     <lb/>
     one of themselves, freely chosen by them<lb break="no"/>selves, have devolved upon them the im<lb break="no"/>portant judicial function of impeachment. 
     <lb/>
     Even the President of the United States may 
     <lb/>
     be impeach before them for treason or 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="494" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0494.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">494</fw>
               
     malversation in office. They have a large 
     <lb/>
     share of executive power also; sitting in 
     <lb/>
     secret session upon all treaties and upon 
     <lb/>
     most appointments to oifice, that is to say, 
     <lb/>
     upon all appointments of the more important 
     <lb/>
     kind. There are appointments which the 
     <lb/>
     President may make without their concur<lb break="no"/>rence; but as a rule, there are no important 
     <lb/>
     appointments which he can so make. Every 
     <lb/>
     treaty and every important appointment 
     <lb/>
     must go before them, and may be disallowed 
     <lb/>
     by them. They further exercise coordinate 
     <lb/>
     legislative functions, as to expenditure and 
     <lb/>
     taxation, with the House of Representatives. 
     <lb/>
     From all these circumstances combined, the 
     <lb/>
     Senate of the United States is, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     on the whole, the ablest deliberative body 
     <lb/>
     the world has ever known. As to men of 
     <lb/>
     third and fourth rate importance finding 
     <lb/>
     their way there, it is hardly possible. The 
     <lb/>
     members of the Senate, almost without 
     <lb/>
     exception, are first or second-rate men. 
     <lb/>
     There are no small men among them. (Cries 
     <lb/>
     of " Yes ! yes !") Well, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     there is certainly no proportion of small men; 
     <lb/>
     comparatively speaking. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART3">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—It is a 
     <lb/>
     question at this moment as to the relative av<lb break="no"/>erages of the House of Representatives and of 
     <lb/>
     the Senate. I heard it discussed when I was 
     <lb/>
     in Washington.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Hear ! hear ! ! 
     <lb/>
     Looking to Washington.  (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—What I say is, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     fully borne out by constitutional writers of 
     <lb/>
     the highest mark—by DE TOCQUEVILLE, 
     <lb/>
     CHEVALIER, and others. They say that the 
     <lb/>
     peculiar constitution and attributes of the Sen<lb break="no"/>ate of the United States have made it a delibera<lb break="no"/>tive body of the very highest mark. And even 
     <lb/>
     were it doubtful whether or not in this respect 
     <lb/>
     it is all I have called it, at least of this there 
     <lb/>
     can be no doubt at all. As intended for the 
     <lb/>
     Federal check in the system of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, it is a machine simply perfect. It is 
     <lb/>
     a very able, deliberative body, of moderate 
     <lb/>
     numbers, carefully chosen on the strictest 
     <lb/>
     principle of federation, changing constantly, 
     <lb/>
     and having, on every matter of importance, 
     <lb/>
     a voice and veto of the most efficient kind. 
     <lb/>
     For stopping everything, for bringing about 
     <lb/>
     a deadlock—all parts of their machinery view<lb break="no"/>ed together—it affords no formidable facilities; 
     <lb/>
     whilst for preventing anything from being 
     <lb/>
     done which it may be to the public interest, 
     <lb/>
     or to that of any number of the states, to 
     <lb/>
     prevent, it is as perfect as can be. Look now 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, Mr. SPEAKER, at the Le<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
      gislative Council under the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration; what is it? There is a sort of at<lb break="no"/>tempt to prevent its numbers from resting on 
     <lb/>
     a population basis; and this is about the only 
     <lb/>
    principle I can find in it. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>would seem to have been thought, that as the 
     <lb/>branch of the legislature was to be shared be<lb break="no"/>tween the provinces in the ratio of their popu<lb break="no"/>lation, there must be some other rule followed 
     <lb/>for the Upper Chamber. So we are to have 
     <lb/>twenty-four for Upper Canada, twenty-four 
     <lb/>for Lower Canada, twenty-four for the three 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces, and four for Newfoundland; 
     <lb/>simply, I suppose, because the populations of 
     <lb/>these equalized sections are not equal, and 
     <lb/>because four is not in proportion to the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of Newfoundland (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>these legislative councillors, thus limited 
     <lb/>in number, are to hold their seats for 
     <lb/>life. They are not to be even freely 
     <lb/>chosen, in the first instance, at least, 
     <lb/>from the principal men in each section of 
     <lb/>the country. They are to be selected, 
     <lb/>as far as possible, from the small number of 
     <lb/>gentlemen holding seats in the present Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council, either by the accident of their 
     <lb/>having been nominated to them some time 
     <lb/>ago, or by the chances of popular election 
     <lb/>since; and until that panel is exhausted, no 
     <lb/>other person in any province is to be taken ; 
     <lb/>and hereafter, Mr. SPEAKER, as vacancies 
     <lb/>occur, they are to be filled as we are now told 
     <lb/>—and this is the strangest thing of all—not 
     <lb/>by the provincial legislatures, nor by any 
     <lb/>authority or under any avowed influence of 
     <lb/>the local kind, but possibly by the General 
     <lb/>Government. And forsooth, this is called 
     <lb/>the Federal feature of our system ! (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) The vacancies, to be sure, in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada are to be filled by selection of indivi<lb break="no"/>duals having or holding property in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada,—and more than that, in articular 
     <lb/>territorial divisions of Lower Canada ! But 
     <lb/>are these individuals to be ever so little chosen 
     <lb/>by the people of such territorial divisions, or 
     <lb/>even of Lower Canada, or with any necessary 
     <lb/>reference to their wishes in that behalf ? 
     <lb/>Bless you, no! not at all. That would go 
     <lb/>towards making a Federal body of this House! 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) It might then be something 
     <lb/>of a Federal check upon the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that would never do. But suppose 
     <lb/>this should happen—and honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>opposite must admit that it may,—that 
     <lb/>in the Federal Executive Council some 
     <lb/>one province or other—Upper Canada, Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, or any other, no matter which— 
     <lb/>either is not represented, or is represented 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="495" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0495.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">495</fw>
        
     otherwise than as it would wish to be. While 
     <lb/>
     thus out in the cold, a vacancy arises in the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, requiring to be filled as 
     <lb/>
    for such province. Where is the guarantee 
     <lb/>that it will be filled on any sort of Federal 
     <lb/>principle ? (Hear, hear.) And yet, what 
     <lb/>worse wrong or insult could be put upon a 
     <lb/>province, than would be involved in the kind 
     <lb/>of selection likely under such circumstances 
     <lb/>to be made for it? Surely, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>this Legislative Council, constituted so differ<lb break="no"/>ently from the Senate of the United States, 
     <lb/>presided over by a functionary to be nomin<lb break="no"/>ated by the General Government; having no 
     <lb/>such functions of a judicial or executive 
     <lb/>character as attached to that body, and cut 
     <lb/>off from that minute oversight of the finances 
     <lb/>which attaches to the Senate of the United 
     <lb/>States; although it may be a first-rate dead<lb break="no"/>lock; although it may be able to interpose 
     <lb/>an absolute veto, for no one can say how long, 
     <lb/>on all legislation, would be no Federal check 
     <lb/>at all. I believe it to be a very near approach 
     <lb/>to the worst system which could be devised in 
     <lb/>legislation. While the Senate of the United 
     <lb/>States is nearly perfect in the one way, our 
     <lb/>Legislative Council is to be as nearly perfect 
     <lb/>in the other way. (Laughter.) The Hon. At<lb break="no"/>torney General for Upper Canada, the other 
     <lb/>night, devised and stated just the cleverest de<lb break="no"/>fence he could, of this constitution of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council. But what did it amount to ? 
     <lb/>Nothing. He undertook to tell us, that from 
     <lb/>the ordinary course of events, the deaths to 
     <lb/>be counted on in a body numbering its certain 
     <lb/>proportion of elderly men, and so forth, the 
     <lb/>personal composition of this Council would not 
     <lb/>change so slowly as many feared. He also 
     <lb/>urged that those who thus found their way 
     <lb/>me it would be but men after all—perhaps 
     <lb/>politicians a little or more than a little given 
     <lb/>to complaisance—but at any rate men, who 
     <lb/>would know they had no great personal hold 
     <lb/>on public confidence; and so, that they might 
     <lb/>sometimes even yield to pressure too easily, in 
     <lb/>place of resisting it too much. Well, sir, I 
     <lb/>have heard it said that every government in 
     <lb/>the world is in a certain sense a constitutional 
     <lb/>government—a government, that is to say, 
     <lb/>tempered by check of some kind. The 
     <lb/>despotism of the Grand Turk has been said 
     <lb/>to have its constitutional check in a salutary 
     <lb/>fear of the bow-string; and there may prove 
     <lb/>to be something of the same sort here. But 
     <lb/>I confess I do not like the quasi-despotism of 
     <lb/>this Legislative Council, even though so 
     <lb/>tempered. Representing no public opinion or 
     <lb/>real power of any kind, it may hurt the less; 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
           
       but it can never tend to good, and it can never 
     <lb/>last. It is satisfactory for one to find that in this 
     <lb/>view I do not stand alone. This plan is con<lb break="no"/>demned, not simply by the Colonial Secretary, 
     <lb/>but by the Imperial Government, as one which 
     <lb/>cannot be carried out. The Imperial authori<lb break="no"/>ties cannot but see that a body appointed for 
     <lb/>life and limited in numbers, is just the worst 
     <lb/>body that could be contrived—ridiculously 
     <lb/>the worst. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART3">Hon. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Do they 
     <lb/>
     say it is the worst ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR DUNKIN—I say it is the worst. 
     <lb/>
     They say it is bad. It is condemned by Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's Government, in diplomatic terms it 
     <lb/>
     may be, but in sufiiciently emphatic terms. 
     <lb/>
     I believe Her Majesty's Government regard 
     <lb/>
     it as I do—as pretty nonsensical. I know it 
     <lb/>
     may be said that Her Majesty's Government, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, may apply a remedy by leaving out 
     <lb/>
     the provision about a limited number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART3">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—That is 
     <lb/>
     our security.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Security it is none, but 
     <lb/>
     the very contrary. But, Mr. SPEAKER, even 
     <lb/>
     though this should be done, or though the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Act should even not state the res<lb break="no"/>trictions by which it is proposed to limit the 
     <lb/>
     Crown in its first choice of Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cillors, such remedy would be the merest pal<lb break="no"/>liative imaginable. The restrictions on such 
     <lb/>
     choice would be maintained in practice all the 
     <lb/>
     same; and even the limitations as to number 
     <lb/>
     would remain as an understood rule, to be 
     <lb/>
     set aside for no cause, much less grave than 
     <lb/>
     might suflice to sweep away even a clause of 
     <lb/>
     an act of the Imperial Parliament. Before 
     <lb/>
     leaving this subject, Mr. SPEAKER, let me ask 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House for a few moments 
     <lb/>
     to the past history of Canada in respect of 
     <lb/>
     our Legislative Council. (Hear, hear.) Did 
     <lb/>
     it not happen, as matter of fact, that the first 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council of Canada, not being 
     <lb/>
     limited in point of numbers, being like the 
     <lb/>
     House of Lords in that respect—the Crown, 
     <lb/>
     I say, having the full choice of its members, 
     <lb/>
     and full control over their number—did it 
     <lb/>
     not happen, I say, that its members were most 
     <lb/>
     of them, for some time, named from one side 
     <lb/>
     in politics ? The gentlemen named by Lord 
     <lb/>
     SYDENHAM and his immediate successors, 
     <lb/>
     were, undoubtedly, most respectable. There 
     <lb/>
     was nothing out of common course that I see 
     <lb/>
     about these appointments; they were party, 
     <lb/>
     political appointments of the ordinary kind. 
     <lb/>
     And under this proposed scheme the same 
     <lb/>
     kind of thing would naturally happen again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But in 1848, with a change of government, 
     <lb/>
     it became necessary to carry through Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment a measure or measures to which it was 
     <lb/>
     well known that a large majority of this Upper 
     <lb/>
     House were decidedly opposed. There had to be 
     <lb/>
     some talking about a swamping of the House 
     <lb/>
     —a similar step to what was threatened once 
     <lb/>
     in the constitutional history of Great Britain. 
     <lb/>
     It was not really done. It did not need to be 
     <lb/>
     done, or at least, it only needed to be done 
     <lb/>
     in part; the peculiarity of the position 
     <lb/>
     of honorable gentlemen, and the impossi<lb break="no"/>bility of their standing out beyond a 
     <lb/>
     certain point, made it unnecessary to carry 
     <lb/>
     out the threat to extremity. But it was 
     <lb/>
     carried far enough to destroy their self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     respect, and the respect of the public for 
     <lb/>
     them. It was felt that they had no sufficient 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> in the country; they sank in public 
     <lb/>opinion, and sank and sank until every one 
     <lb/>quietly acquiesced in the change which was 
     <lb/>afterwards made in the Constitution of the 
     <lb/>Council. (Hear, hear.) I do not overstate 
     <lb/>the truth when I say that the Legislative 
     <lb/>Council so sank in public opinion, because 
     <lb/>there was no machinery by which public opin<lb break="no"/>ion could act upon it, except that of a further 
     <lb/>creation of councillors by the Crown, and 
     <lb/>there being no other way of averting a dead<lb break="no"/>lock, they had to be made to feel that in case 
     <lb/>of extremity their power would not be found 
     <lb/>equal to their will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CART3">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—That is 
     <lb/>because the number was unlimited.

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName> —If the Crown had not

     <lb/>swept them away, or they might have shrunk 
     <lb/>before the fear of it; as it was, they gave way

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CART3">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—There is a

     <lb/>physical world, is true also in the political 
     <lb/>world.

     <lb/>
     see that that has much to do with the re<lb break="no"/>marks I am just now offering. (Hear, hear.)  
     <lb/>
     I say the elective Legislative Council was 
     <lb/>
     rendered necessary, in the opinion of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, by this unfortunate state of things, even 
     <lb/>
     though the system then in existence was not so 
     <lb/>
     bad as the system now offered for our accept<lb break="no"/>ance. There was then the power constitution<lb break="no"/>ally given to the Crown to augment the num<lb break="no"/>bers of the Legislative Council, so that the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     gentlemen constituting that body could recede 
     <lb/>
     before the determined expression of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic will, as gracefully as did the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords on the memorable occasion I have al<lb break="no"/>ready alluded to. Had that House not yield<lb break="no"/>ed in those days of the Reform Bill, even the 
     <lb/>
     Crown of Great Britain might not have es<lb break="no"/>caped the consequences of a bloody revolution. 
     <lb/>
     That House might have been constitutionally 
     <lb/>
     omnipotent, but its physical was not equal to 
     <lb/>
     its constitutional capacity. What is it that 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to be given to us here? A body 
     <lb/>
     not at all weighty in the influence of its mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and which, it is said, will have to shrink 
     <lb/>
     from the exercise of its prerogatives. I do 
     <lb/>
     not know whether it will or not. But I had 
     <lb/>
     rather not give to a body of men limited in 
     <lb/>
     number—though even so little weighty in the 
     <lb/>
     community—an absolute veto on all legis<lb break="no"/>lation, for so long as the Almighty may 
     <lb/>
     be pleased to continue them in life. I 
     <lb/>
     think a much better system could be 
     <lb/>
     devised—nay, I am sure of it. At all 
     <lb/>
     events, here is this proposed body, which, 
     <lb/>
     we are told, is to be Federal, but which is not 
     <lb/>
     to be so. We are told it is to be a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional check, but it is not to be that either. 
     <lb/>
     It is rather, I take it, a cleverly devised piece 
     <lb/>
     of dead-lock machinery, and the best excuse 
     <lb/>
     made for it is, that it will not be strong enough 
     <lb/>
     to do near all the harm it seems meant to 
     <lb/>
     do. Her Majesty's Government condemns it. 
     <lb/>
     It may not be necessary that we should say 
     <lb/>
     with very marked emphasis how we join in 
     <lb/>
     that condemnation. (Hear, hear.) I have 
     <lb/>
     then shewn, Ithink, Mr. SPEAKER, as regards 
     <lb/>
     our House of Commons, that we have not reach<lb break="no"/>ed perfection; and that, as regards our House 
     <lb/>
     of Lords, we have not come near it. I pass 
     <lb/>
    on to the Executive. Here, too, there is to 
     <lb/>be a very wide difference between our pro<lb break="no"/>posed system and that of the United States. 
     <lb/>To begin, they have an elective president, 
     <lb/>chosen for a short term; with all the evils, 
     <lb/>therefore, of frequent presidential elections, 
     <lb/>aggravated by the president's allowed capacity 
     <lb/>for reelection. No doubt, we avoid these ; 
     <lb/>our Viceroy, or Governor General, is not to be 
     <lb/>elective. Nobody proposes that—I do not 
     <lb/>think anybody ever did propose it. And the 
     <lb/>authors of this project have, therefore, no 
     <lb/>great right to take credit for this, any more 
     <lb/>than for their unasked offer to continue Her 
     <lb/>Most Gracious Majesty upon the throne, or 
     <lb/>in other words, create her Queen of British 
     <lb/>North America, by the grace of the Quebec 
     <lb/>Conference ! (Laughter.) This, however, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, by the way. What is more im<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="num">497</fw>
         
     portant to notice in this connexion, is the 
     <lb/>
     marked distinction on which I have already 
     <lb/>
     touched, between the United States system, 
     <lb/>
     which devolves in part upon the Senate—and 
     <lb/>
     our system, which devolves not at all upon the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, but wholly on the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council, the duty of advising and 
     <lb/>
     aiding the head of the Government in the 
     <lb/>
     discharge of his executive functions. As I 
     <lb/>
     have said, in the United States the Senate 
     <lb/>
     has large executive functions.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     says "without responsibility." I rather 
     <lb/>
     think not. Take the case of a senator from 
     <lb/>
     Massachusetts or New York. I rather think 
     <lb/>
     he will feel himself very distinctly responsible 
     <lb/>
     to the state he represents. He is not responsible 
     <lb/>
     to the whole people of the United States, nor 
     <lb/>
     is the Senate, as a whole, collectively respon<lb break="no"/>sible. But each senator is particularly and 
     <lb/>
     personally responsible to his own state, and 
     <lb/>
     acts under a sense of that responsibility. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Take the case which occurred 
     <lb/>
     a number of years ago, when President JACK<lb break="no"/>SON named, as Minister to the British Court, 
     <lb/>
     MARTIN VAN BUREN, afterwards his suc<lb break="no"/>cessor in the presidential chair. A majority 
     <lb/>
     of the Senate disallowed that nomination. 
     <lb/>
     Did not the senators who voted for or 
     <lb/>
     against that nomination, do so under a weighty, 
     <lb/>
     practical responsibility? Every man of them 
     <lb/>
     did. They voted in the view and under the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of that responsibility; and some of 
     <lb/>
     them had to pay for the exercise of it. And 
     <lb/>
     so they do, all along. (Hear, hear.) This, 
     <lb/>
     however, is a digression into which I 
     <lb/>
     have been led by the remark of my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend. I return to the line of 
     <lb/>
     argument I was pursuing. What I am just 
     <lb/>
     now shewing is, that in respect of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the executive power, this scheme 
     <lb/>
      urged upon our acceptance differs <hi rendition="simple:italic">toto caelo</hi> 
     <lb/>
     from the system in operation in the United 
     <lb/>
     States. I shall consider presently the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of its advantages or disadvantages. In 
     <lb/>
     the United States, as is admitted, the Senate 
     <lb/>
     does a certain part of what we undertake here 
     <lb/>
     to do by means of a Cabinet. The Federal 
     <lb/>
     check so exercised by the Senate renders un<lb break="no"/>necessary, for any Federal purpose, the exist<lb break="no"/>ence of a Cabinet. Indeed they do not want 
     <lb/>
     a Cabinet for any purpose at all. It is not of 
     <lb/>
     their system. But here, with our chief ma<lb break="no"/>gistrate not elected, we must have one. And 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     yet, how are we to make it work, engrafted 
     <lb/>
     on a system which, in its essentials, is after 
     <lb/>
     all more American than British? This is 
     <lb/>
     what I have now come to. I have to ask 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen opposite how they are 
     <lb/>
     going to organize their Cabinet, for these 
     <lb/>
     provinces, according to this so-called Federal 
     <lb/>
     scheme? (Hear, hear.) I think I may defy 
     <lb/>
     them to shew that the Cabinet can be formed 
     <lb/>
     on any other principle than that of a repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the several provinces in that Ca<lb break="no"/>binet. It is admitted that the provinces are 
     <lb/>
     not really represented to any Federal intent 
     <lb/>
     in the Legislative Council. The Cabinet 
     <lb/>
     here must discharge all that kind of function, 
     <lb/>
     which in the United States is performed, in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal sense, by the Senate. And precisely 
     <lb/>
     as in the United States, wherever a Federal 
     <lb/>
     check is needed, the Senate has to do Federal 
     <lb/>
     duty as an integral part of the Executive 
     <lb/>
     Government. So here, when that check can<lb break="no"/>not be so got, we must seek such substitute 
     <lb/>
     for it as we may, in a Federal composition of 
     <lb/>
     the Executive Council; that is to say, by 
     <lb/>
     making it distinctly representative of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Well, I must say that this sort of 
     <lb/>
     thing is utterly variant from, and inconsistent 
     <lb/>
     with British practice and British principle; 
     <lb/>
     with the constitutional system which makes 
     <lb/>
     the whole Cabinet responsible for every act 
     <lb/>
     of government. The British Cabinet is no 
     <lb/>
     Cabinet of sections, but a unit. In illustra<lb break="no"/>tion of the view which I am anxious to im<lb break="no"/>press upon the judgment of the House, let me 
     <lb/>
     revert for a moment to our Canadian history. 
     <lb/>
     I can only look forward to the future by the 
     <lb/>
     lights given me by the past. The union of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadas, consummated in 1841, was a le<lb break="no"/>gislative union. There was nothing in it 
     <lb/>
     savoring ever so faintly of Federalism, unless 
     <lb/>
     it were the clause which declared, and quite 
     <lb/>
     unnecessarily declared, that there should be an 
     <lb/>
     equal representation, in the Legislative Assem<lb break="no"/>bly of Upper and Lower Canada respectively. 
     <lb/>
     If the Union Act had merely distributed the 
     <lb/>
     constituencies in such a way as to give equal<lb break="no"/>ity of representation to Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, it would have done for practical pur<lb break="no"/>poses all it did. But besides doing this, it 
     <lb/>
     quite uselessly added in terms that the num<lb break="no"/>bers were to be equal—subject always, how<lb break="no"/>ever, by a strange anomaly, to our declared 
     <lb/>
     power thereafter by legislation of our own 
     <lb/>
     to disturb that equality, if we pleased. Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, when an Executive Government had to 
     <lb/>
     be first organized for Canada, Lord SYDEN<lb break="no"/>HAM was obliged to call into his Cabinet cer<lb break="no"/>tain officials whom he found in Upper and 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="498" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0498.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">498</fw>
          
     Lower Canada respectively, and he did so 
     <lb/>
     without observing any rule of equality as to 
     <lb/>
     their numbers. Indeed, until 1848, equality 
     <lb/>
     in the representation of the two sections of the 
     <lb/>
     province in the Cabinet was never seriously 
     <lb/>
     aimed at. In 1848, from considerations of a 
     <lb/>
     peculiar character—perhaps more personal than 
     <lb/>
     political—the usage was commenced, and it has 
     <lb/>
     since been persevered in, of having a Premier 
     <lb/>
     and a sub-Premier, and a Cabinet organized 
     <lb/>
     under them, respectively, in two sections—of 
     <lb/>
     course equal in numbers, or as nearly so as 
     <lb/>
     possible. And on this usage and in connection 
     <lb/>
     with it have developed themselves all those 
     <lb/>
     double majority and double ministry notions 
     <lb/>
     and practices which again of late have so con<lb break="no"/>stantly been leading us into all manner of 
     <lb/>
     constitutional difficulties. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     has been found again and again impossible to 
     <lb/>
     constitute a satisfactory ministry of two sec<lb break="no"/>tions; because one or other of the two sections, 
     <lb/>
     if they came together on any basis of real 
     <lb/>
     political agreement, was so very likely not to 
     <lb/>
    be able to command a majority of its sectional 
     <lb/>representation in this House. It was, prac<lb break="no"/>tically, a division of the House, as well as of 
     <lb/>the Government, into two sections—practi<lb break="no"/>cally, all but a government by two ministries 
     <lb/>and with two Houses. We did not quite 
     <lb/>admit, to be sure, that there were two minis<lb break="no"/>tries; although, by the way, at one time—I 
     <lb/>refer to the time of the first proposed vote of 
     <lb/>want of confidence in the MACDONALD—DORION 
     <lb/>ministry—a motion was on the point of being 
     <lb/>made—notice of it was given—which posi<lb break="no"/>tively did speak of a Lower Canadian minis<lb break="no"/>try as contradistinguished from an Upper 
     <lb/>Canadian ministry. I go into this to shew 
     <lb/>that already, in Canada, the force of circum<lb break="no"/>stances has been one too many for us, and has 
     <lb/>inflicted upon us a system more complex—less 
     <lb/>workable—than obtains in England. With 
     <lb/>us, as at home, the Constitution makes the 
     <lb/>whole Ministry, collectively, responsible for all 
     <lb/>the acts it performs; but it is well known that 
     <lb/>here, for all practical purposes, we have for 
     <lb/>years had our Ministry acting by two sections 
     <lb/>—each section with a chief of its own, to a 
     <lb/>large extent a policy of its own, and the 
     <lb/>responsibility of leading and governing a 
     <lb/>section of this House of its own. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) We have been federalising our Con<lb break="no"/>stitution after a very new and anomalous 
     <lb/>fashion ever since 1848, and by that, more 
     <lb/>than by anything else, have been getting our<lb break="no"/>selves into that sort of difficulty in which we 
     <lb/>have latterly found ourselves. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>And now, Mr. SPEAKER, I just want to know 
     <lb/>
          
    
            <cb/>
           
     how this proposed scheme is going to work in 
     <lb/>
     this respect? As we have seen, it starts with 
     <lb/>
     a principle, as to the election of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons, which must involve the arraying 
     <lb/>
     on the floor of that House, not of a set of 
     <lb/>
     members of Parliament coming there to judge 
     <lb/>
     and to act each for the whole of British North 
     <lb/>
     America, but of a certain fixed number of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canadians, a certain fixed number of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadians, a certain fixed number of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotians, of New Brunswickers, of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Islanders, of Newfoundland<lb break="no"/>ers, of Red River men, of men from Vancou<lb break="no"/>ver's Island, of British Columbia men, of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan men—each to act there for his own 
     <lb/>
     province. (Hear, hear.) If we ever get all these 
     <lb/>
     territories laid out into provinces, we are to 
     <lb/>
     have just so many sections, numerically most 
     <lb/>
     unequal, upon the floor of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     the only abiding distinctions between mem<lb break="no"/>bers will be those represented by the territor<lb break="no"/>ial lines between their provinces. The Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council, we have seen, will not be the 
     <lb/>
     check which these sections will require. The 
     <lb/>
     Executive Council has got to be that check, 
     <lb/>
     and in the Executive Council these sections 
     <lb/>
     will have to reproduce themselves. Apart 
     <lb/>
     from the provinces or vast territory to the 
     <lb/>
     west of us, we shall thus have our six such 
     <lb/>
     sections on the floor of the Commons House, 
     <lb/>
     with their six corresponding sections in the 
     <lb/>
     Executive Council, and six parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     majorities to be worked together, if possible, 
     <lb/>
     while hitherto we have found our two sections 
     <lb/>
     and two majorities one too many. Our con<lb break="no"/>stitutional difliculties, I repeat, are referable 
     <lb/>
     to that very practice, and so it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     that we should try a system three times—and 
     <lb/>
     more than three times—more complex still. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) That cleverest of politicians 
     <lb/>
     who, for two or three years running, under 
     <lb/>
     such a system, shall have managed to carry 
     <lb/>
     on his Cabinet, leading six or more sections 
     <lb/>
     in our Commons House, six or more sections 
     <lb/>
     in the Legislative Council, and, forsooth, six 
     <lb/>
     or more local parliaments and lieutenant-gov<lb break="no"/>ernors, and all the rest of it besides—that 
     <lb/>
     gifted man who shall have done this for two 
     <lb/>
     or three years running, had better be sent 
     <lb/>
     home to teach Lords PALMERSTON and DER<lb break="no"/>BY their political alphabet. The task will be 
     <lb/>
     infinitely more dificult than the task these 
     <lb/>
     English statesmen find it none too easy to un<lb break="no"/>dertake. (Hear, hear.)

     good deal favored by accident. But I am 
     <lb/>
     not quite certain that I believe in the abso<lb break="no"/>lute omniscience of anybody. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But now, if this Executive Council is to 
     <lb/>
     have in it, as I am sure it must have, in 
     <lb/>
     order to work at all, a representation of the 
     <lb/>
     different provinces, all or nearly all of them, 
     <lb/>
     let us look for a moment at what will have 
     <lb/>
     to be its number. There are two ways of 
     <lb/>
      calculating this—two sets of <hi rendition="simple:italic">data</hi> on which 
     <lb/>
     to go. Either we must go upon what I may 
     <lb/>
     call the wants of the component parts, or we 
     <lb/>
     may start from the wants of the country as 
     <lb/>
     a whole. Suppose, then, we start from the 
     <lb/>
     wants of the different provinces. I take it 
     <lb/>
     that no section of the Confederation can 
     <lb/>
     well have less than one representative in the 
     <lb/>
     Cabinet. Prince Edward Island will want 
     <lb/>
     one; Newfoundland, one. A difficulty pre<lb break="no"/>sents itself with regard to Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     On just the same principle upon which 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada wants, for Federal ends, to 
     <lb/>
     have a proper representation in the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council, on that same principle the 
     <lb/>
     minority populations in Lower Canada will 
     <lb/>
     each want, and reasonably want, the same 
     <lb/>
     thing. We have three populations in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada—the French-Canadians, the Irish 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, and the British Protestants. In 
     <lb/>
     other words, there are the Catholics, and the 
     <lb/>
     non-Catholics, and the English-speaking and 
     <lb/>
     the non-English-speaking, and these two cross- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     lines of division cut our people into the three 
     <lb/>
     divisions I have just indicated. Well, if in 
     <lb/>
     a government of this Federal kind the differ<lb break="no"/>ent populations of Lower Canada are to feel 
     <lb/>
     that justice is done them, none of them are 
     <lb/>
     to be there ignored. The consequences of 
     <lb/>
     ignoring them might not be very comfortable. 
     <lb/>
    Heretofore, according to general usage, the 
     <lb/>normal amount of representation for Lower 
     <lb/>Canada in the Executive Council has been 
     <lb/>six seats out of twelve. Of those, four may 
     <lb/>be said legitimately to belong to the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Canadians, one to the Irish Catholics, and 
     <lb/>one to the British Protestant class. Every<lb break="no"/>one is satisfied that that is about the fairest 
     <lb/>thing that can be done. There have been 
     <lb/>times when these proportions have varied. 
     <lb/>There have been exceptional times when the 
     <lb/>British Protestant population has had to put 
     <lb/>up with a Solicitor-General out of the Cabinet, 
     <lb/>
           
    
            <cb/>
            
     and has done so with no very loud complaint. 
     <lb/>
     There has never been a time, I think, when 
     <lb/>
     there was not an Irish Catholic in the Cabi<lb break="no"/>net. There have been times when the number 
     <lb/>
     of French-Canadians has been less than four, 
     <lb/>
     and there was then much complaint. Six 
     <lb/>
     members—four, one and one—are just about 
     <lb/>
     what you must give to please each section 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada. Well, sir, if there are to 
     <lb/>
     be six for Lower Canada, there must be six 
     <lb/>
     or seven for Upper Canada and you cannot 
     <lb/>
     very well leave less than three each for Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick, and, as I have 
     <lb/>
     said, one each for Newfoundland and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island ; and thus you have an Exe<lb break="no"/>cutive Council of twenty or twenty-one mem<lb break="no"/>bers, besides all we might have to add for other 
     <lb/>
     provinces ; and this, I rather think, is a little 
     <lb/>
     too many. The thing could not be done; 
     <lb/>
     for so large a Cabinet could never work. 
     <lb/>
     Suppose then, on the other hand, that we start 
     <lb/>
     with the idea of limiting the number of our 
     <lb/>
     Executive Council to meet what I may call the 
     <lb/>
     exigencies of the country as a whole. Eleven, 
     <lb/>
     twelve or thirteen—the latter, as an hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber observes, is an unlucky number—will be as 
     <lb/>
     many as we can possibly allow. Of this 
     <lb/>
     number one, as before, will he wanted for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and one for Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island. If one is wanted for each of the 
     <lb/>
     little provinces, New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia will be sorely discontented 
     <lb/>
     unless they get, at least, two apiece; and 
     <lb/>
     neither Lower Canada nor Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     will be contented with the three left for each 
     <lb/>
     of them. And for Lower Canada, in parti<lb break="no"/>cular, how will anyone divide this intractable 
     <lb/>
     figure between her French, Irish and 
     <lb/>
     British? Shall we give them one apiece, 
     <lb/>
     and ask the French-Canadian element to be 
     <lb/>
     content with one voice in a cabinet of a 
     <lb/>
     dozen ?—or, give that element two, without 
     <lb/>
     satisfying it—so leaving out either the Irish 
     <lb/>
     or the British, to its intense disgust ?—or, give 
     <lb/>
     the preponderating element the whole, to 
     <lb/>
     the intense disgust of both the others? It 
     <lb/>
     will be none too easy a task, sir, I think, to 
     <lb/>
     form an Executive Council with its three 
     <lb/>
     members for Lower Canada, and satisfy the 
     <lb/>
     somewhat pressing exigencies of her creeds 
     <lb/>
     and races.

     <lb/>
     now, sir, I come to speak of the relations to 
     <lb/>
     subsist between this Federal power and the 
     <lb/>
     different provinces, as compared with those 
     <lb/>
     between the United States and the different 
     <lb/>
     states. Again, the comparison has to be 
     <lb/>
     made much more with the United States 
     <lb/>
     system than with that of Great Britain; 
     <lb/>
     although, unfortunately, perhaps, there is 
     <lb/>
     in this part of the scheme some confusion of 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent features of the two systems. 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain has not yet, in any true sense 
     <lb/>
     of the term, federated herself with any of 
     <lb/>
     her colonies. She just retains a nominal 
     <lb/>
     supremacy over them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOB1">MR. SCOBLE</persName>—It is a real supremacy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—No ; it is only nominal 
     <lb/>
     as regards its exercise. It is not real in the 
     <lb/>
     sense of amounting to a substantial, practical 
     <lb/>
     exercise of power over the colonies. For 
     <lb/>
     these nearly five and twenty years past.I 
     <lb/>
     call to mind no legislative act of ours dis<lb break="no"/>allowed by the Home Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     AN HON. MEMBER—Yes, there was 
     <lb/>
     one—Mr. HINCKS' Currency Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Well, I believe that was. 
     <lb/>
     But in that case we got our own way in 
     <lb/>
     effect directly afterwards. I am referring 
     <lb/>
     more particularly, of course, to what may be 
     <lb/>
     called the conduct of our own domestic 
     <lb/>
     affairs. There is no mistake but we have 
     <lb/>
     had given to us by Great Britain a control 
     <lb/>
     practically unlimited over our own affairs; 
     <lb/>
     she lets us do what we like, while professing 
     <lb/>
     to retain a perfect nominal supremacy over 
     <lb/>
     us. She appoints our Governor General, 
     <lb/>
     but when he comes here, he does what we 
     <lb/>
     want, not what she may want. She can, if 
     <lb/>
     she likes, disallow all our statutes; but for 
     <lb/>
     all practical purposes she never does. She 
     <lb/>
     may, if she chooses, alter or repeal the 
     <lb/>
     Charter of our liberties which she granted to 
     <lb/>
     us, but she never thinks of doing such a 
     <lb/>
     thing, and we know she will not. Well, 
     <lb/>
     here in this proposed Constitution—looking 
     <lb/>
     to the relations which are to subsist between 
     <lb/>
     the Federation and the provinces—in lieu 
     <lb/>
     of a real Federation, such as subsists between 
     <lb/>
     the United States and the different states, 
     <lb/>
     we find an attempt to adopt to a consider<lb break="no"/>able extent the British system of a stated 
     <lb/>
     supremacy, not meant to be in fact the half 
     <lb/>
     of what it passes for in theory. But, however 
     <lb/>
     such a system may work as between Great 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="501" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0501.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">502</fw>
               
     Britain and her colonies, it by no means 
     <lb/>
     follows that it admits of extension to this 
     <lb/>
     case. If the vaguely stated powers of our 
     <lb/>
     so-called Federation are to be merely nomi<lb break="no"/>nal, they will be insufficient; if not nominal, 
     <lb/>
     they will be excessive. Either way, the 
     <lb/>
     United States idea of an attempted precise 
     <lb/>
     statement of the powers meant to be given 
     <lb/>
     and used, is the true one. What, then, is 
     <lb/>
     the system adopted in the United States, as 
     <lb/>
     regards these relations between the Federal 
     <lb/>
     power and the several states? There are 
     <lb/>
     two leading principles, and very sound prin<lb break="no"/>ciples, that pervade it. In the first place the 
     <lb/>
     United States, by its Constitution, guarantees 
     <lb/>
     to every state in the union a republican form 
     <lb/>
     of government ; by which is meant a Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. in the main, analogous to that of the 
     <lb/>
     United States—an elective executive, an 
     <lb/>
     elective second branch, an elective popular 
     <lb/>
     branch—the whole without what we here 
     <lb/>
     call responsible government. This is what 
     <lb/>
     everybody understands as the republican sys<lb break="no"/>tem. Accordingly, just the same sort of 
     <lb/>
     thing in principle and in all its great outlines 
     <lb/>
     as the Constitution of the United States, is 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution of each separate state of the 
     <lb/>
     union. And in the second place, along with 
     <lb/>
     this uniformity in principle and outlines 
     <lb/>
     between the Constitution of the United States 
     <lb/>
     and those of the different states, there is 
     <lb/>
     established a very exact system of what I may 
     <lb/>
     call limited state autonomy. The state, 
     <lb/>
     within its certain range of subjects, does what 
     <lb/>
     it likes, and is as free to act as the United 
     <lb/>
     States; it has its own functions, and within 
     <lb/>
     the limits of those functions nobody controls 
     <lb/>
     it. The United States have their special 
     <lb/>
     functions also, and within the range of those 
     <lb/>
     functions can, in turn, control everything. 
     <lb/>
     The respective judiciary systems of the state 
     <lb/>
     and of the United States, are further so con<lb break="no"/>trived as to be the most perfect check that 
     <lb/>
     can well be imagined to secure the smooth 
     <lb/>
     and steady working of this Federal national 
     <lb/>
     machinery. It is a complex piece of machine<lb break="no"/>ry, if you will ; there are many delicate parts 
     <lb/>
     in it, one depending nicely upon another; 
     <lb/>
     but, upon the whole, it has worked pretty 
     <lb/>
     well for many years, and may go on working 
     <lb/>
     pretty well for many more.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Does the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     mean to tell this House that the principle of 
     <lb/>
     elective judges forms a part of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional system of the United States? Why, 
     <lb/>
     sir, elective judiciary is a mere excres<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     cence of quite late growth, and has not 
     <lb/>
     fastened itself on the system of the United 
     <lb/>
     States at all. It is not even as yet adopted 
     <lb/>
     by nearly all the individual states, but only 
     <lb/>
     by some of them. It is an excrescence 
     <lb/>
     which the founders of the United States 
     <lb/>
     system never, I fancy, thought of, or in all 
     <lb/>
     human probalility they would have expressly 
     <lb/>
     provided against it. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     now, sir, what is the system we are going to 
     <lb/>
     adopt according to these resolutions ? What 
     <lb/>
     are the relations to be established between 
     <lb/>
     our general and local governments? We 
     <lb/>
     are told to take for granted that no clashing 
     <lb/>
     of interest or feeling need be feared; that 
     <lb/>
     the Federal union offered us in name will 
     <lb/>
     be a legislative union in reality. Yet, who<lb break="no"/>ever dislikes the notion of a legislative union 
     <lb/>
     is assured it will be nothing of the sort. Now, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I do not believe that you can have all 
     <lb/>
     the advantages of these two systems com<lb break="no"/>bined in one. (Hear, hear.) A Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union is one thing; a Federal union is an<lb break="no"/>other. The same system cannot be both at 
     <lb/>
     once. You cannot devise a system that 
     <lb/>
     shall have all the advantages of the one and  
     <lb/>
     of the other; but it is quite possible that 
     <lb/>
     you may devise one that will combine the 
     <lb/>
     chief disadvantages of both, and that is, I 
     <lb/>
     fear, pretty much what this system does. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Let me first take one feature 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme, or, I might say, one absence 
     <lb/>
     of a feature from the scheme—the non- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     provision of anything like provincial consti<lb break="no"/>tutions. We are not told about them; they 
     <lb/>
     are kept back completely in the dark; it is 
     <lb/>
     part of the scheme that we are not to know 
     <lb/>
     what it means them to be. (Laughter.) It 
     <lb/>
     is part of the scheme, too, from all appear<lb break="no"/>ance, that they may not be at all alike. 
     <lb/>
     For anything I can see, Nova Scotia will 
     <lb/>
     have a right under this scheme to devise a 
     <lb/>
     system of responsible government, with a 
     <lb/>
     cabinet and two branches of the legislature. 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, if it pleases, may have only 
     <lb/>
     one legislative body, with or without respon<lb break="no"/>sible government. So may the Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island people have anything they 
     <lb/>
     like; and the people of Newfoundland may 
     <lb/>
     do what they like, and so may we in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada may even have a constitution 
     <lb/>
     of one kind, and Upper Canada one of a 
     <lb/>
     totally different kind. There may be no 
     <lb/>
     two of our six or more local constitutions 
     <lb/>
     framed on the same model. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It seems to he meant that these constitutions 
     <lb/>
     shall be as varied as the people of the 
     <lb/>
    different provinces may see fit to make them; 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="502" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0502.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">502</fw>
           
     nay, there are even left to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     different provinces the same large powers for 
     <lb/>
     amending them afterwards. To be sure 
     <lb/>
     there is the grand power of disallowance by 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government, which we are told, 
     <lb/>
     in one and the same breath, is to be possessed 
     <lb/>
     by it, but never exercised.

     <persName ref="pers:CART3">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>— The 
     <lb/>
     presumption is, it will be exercised in case 
     <lb/>
     of unjust or unwise legislation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—The hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     presumption reminds me of one, perhaps as 
     <lb/>
     conclusive, but which DICKENS tells us 
     <lb/>
     failed to satisfy his Mr. BUMBLE. That hen<lb break="no"/>pecked beadle is said to have said, on hearing 
     <lb/>
     of the legal presumption that a man's wife 
     <lb/>
     acts under his control :—" If the law pre— 
     <lb/>
     sumes anything of the sort, the law's a fool 
     <lb/>
     —a natural fool !" (Laughter.) If this 
     <lb/>
     permission of disallowance rests on a pre<lb break="no"/>sumption that the legislation of our provinces 
     <lb/>
     is going to be unjust or unwise, it may be 
     <lb/>
     needed ; but under that idea, one might 
     <lb/>
     have done better either not to allow, or else 
     <lb/>
     to restrict within narrower limits, such 
     <lb/>
     legislation. If the promised non-exercise of 
     <lb/>
     the power to disallow rests on a presumption 
     <lb/>
     that all will be done justly and wisely in the 
     <lb/>
     provincal legislatures, the legislative power 
     <lb/>
     is well given ; but then there is no need, 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, for the permission to 
     <lb/>
     disallow. (Hear, hear.) I repeat, this 
     <lb/>
     system, or no-system, aims at nothing like 
     <lb/>
     uniformity between the general and local 
     <lb/>
     constitutions, or between the local constitu<lb break="no"/>tions themselves ; and in this respect, it is 
     <lb/>
     essentially at variance with the much wiser 
     <lb/>
     system adopted in the United States. It 
     <lb/>
     further allows of no real autonomy; in fact, 
     <lb/>
     the only trace of uniformity it can be said to 
     <lb/>
     have about it, consists in its disallowance of 
     <lb/>
     all autonomy to the provinces. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Now, let me take up those few 
     <lb/>
     features that undoubtedly are given to us, 
     <lb/>
     as characterizing our provincial system. Wide 
     <lb/>
     as we have seen the latitude is which the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces may take in framing their constitutions, 
     <lb/>
     there are a few matters as to which the 
     <lb/>
     system lays down an iron rule. There is 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of a lieutenant-governor 
     <lb/>
     which is to be vested the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It is not said in so many words that 
     <lb/>
     he is to be a colonist, but I think it may be 
     <lb/>
     taken for granted that he will be. It is not 
     <lb/>
     ve likely that we shall get any right hono<lb break="no"/>rable gentleman or eminent statesman, from 
     <lb/>
     home, to come out here for an appointment 
     <lb/>
    of that kind ; and I take for granted, there<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
          fore, that the General Government will 
     <lb/>
     always nominate Mr. Somebody or other, of 
     <lb/>
     local distinction, to this office of lieutenant. 
     <lb/>
     governor. An hon. gentleman opposite, (I 
     <lb/>
     beg his pardon for noticing his gesture,) 
     <lb/>
     seems never to have had the thought cross 
     <lb/>
     his mind, that perhaps if he were named to 
     <lb/>
     it, there might be a doubt in some quarters 
     <lb/>
     as to his entire fitness for it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But seriously these lieutenant-governors 
     <lb/>
     thus selected, are all to hold office by a very 
     <lb/>
     peculiar tenure. They are not to be remov<lb break="no"/>able except by the Federal power; nor by it 
     <lb/>
     within the term of five years, except for 
     <lb/>
     cause, which cause must be stated in 
     <lb/>
     writing, and laid before both branches of 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Parliament. For five years, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, they may be said to hold office 
     <lb/>
     during good behaviour. They are to be 
     <lb/>
     paid, too, by the Federal power. They are 
     <lb/>
     to exercise the reprieving and pardoning 
     <lb/>
     power, subject to such instructions as they 
     <lb/>
     may receive from the General Government 
     <lb/>
     from time to time. And they are to have 
     <lb/>
     the initiation, by message, of all money 
     <lb/>
     bills, and the power to reserve bills for ap— 
     <lb/>
     proval of the Federal Government. They 
     <lb/>
     are to have these leading functions of the 
     <lb/>
     nominated lieutenant governors under our 
     <lb/>
     system, but with one most marked differ— 
     <lb/>
     ence— the attribute of non-removability. 
     <lb/>
     Beyond these few points, the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     leave us all at sea. Save as to these, they 
     <lb/>
     leave room, as we have seen, for the widest 
     <lb/>
     divergencies of constitution. To be sure, I 
     <lb/>
     gather one hint more, not from the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions themselves, but from the dispatched sent 
     <lb/>
     along with them to the Colonial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     by the Governor General, and this is, that 
     <lb/>
     according to the view of our Canadian Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, the provincial legislatures had bet<lb break="no"/>ter be framed on the one chamber principle. 
     <lb/>
     I presume this will hardly be gainsayed by 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentlemen who have laid the 
     <lb/>
     dispatch before us, and which supplies this 
     <lb/>
     feature that we cannot find in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     themselves. Says the dispatch :—

            </p>
   
            <p><quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     For the purpose of local administration, it is

           wise any of our provinces may experiment, 
     <lb/>
     in the way of variation, in framing their 
     <lb/>
     constitutions, at least there must everywhere 
     <lb/>
     be some attempted approach, in principle, 
     <lb/>
     to one or other of the two great divergent 
     <lb/>
     systems—the British on the one hand, with 
     <lb/>
     its responsible Cabinet—the American, on 
     <lb/>
     the other, without. That you cannot work 
     <lb/>
     the problem on the former of these two 
     <lb/>
     plans, I will show presently. For the latter, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, in the States, it is always 
     <lb/>
     carried on with two elective houses, never 
     <lb/>
     with one, and with an elective governor; 
     <lb/>
     and all are chosen for terms that are not 
     <lb/>
     long. It could not be made to work other<lb break="no"/>wise. An appointed governor, holding in<lb break="no"/>dependently, for a term not short, and above 
     <lb/>
     all, with only one House, is an experiment 
     <lb/>
     as new and unpromising as need be. For a 
     <lb/>
     moment, before going further, I revert to 
     <lb/>
     the principle on which the Federal Execu<lb break="no"/>tive is to be constituted. We are promised 
     <lb/>
     there a cabinet, responsible after the British 
     <lb/>
     model, and strangely and anomalously as we 
     <lb/>
     have seen that it will have to be organized, 
     <lb/>
     in sections to represent our provinces, we 
     <lb/>
     must understand that the British principle 
     <lb/>
     of its joint responsibility is to be and will 
     <lb/>
     be carried out. But it is of the essence of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, that with its re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility such government should have 
     <lb/>
     power. No ministry can be answerable for 
     <lb/>
     the entire government of a country, unless 
     <lb/>
     it has the power to control in some way or 
     <lb/>
     other, and to the requisite extent, the course 
     <lb/>
     of affairs. If we are going to build up or 
     <lb/>
     suffer in the country any power too strong for 
     <lb/>
     it to deal with, it will cease to be respon<lb break="no"/>sible. It must be able to overcome opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, and that in a constitutional manner. 
     <lb/>
     Yet, according to this scheme, indepen<lb break="no"/>dently of and besides all the difficulties our 
     <lb/>
     sectionally-organized Federal Cabinet will 
     <lb/>
     find in dealing with its sectionally-organized 
     <lb/>
     Federal Legislature, it is to have these pro<lb break="no"/>vincial governments also, to embarrass it. 
     <lb/>
     Let these last be what you will, responsible 
     <lb/>
     or republican, or some of them the one and 
     <lb/>
     some the other, so soon as they begin to act 
     <lb/>
     for themselves, so soon you have got powers 
     <lb/>
     in action that cannot long move together 
     <lb/>
     without clashing, and yet neither of which 
     <lb/>
     can overcome the other, unless by practically 
     <lb/>
     destroying it, or in other words, by revolu<lb break="no"/>tion. ( Hear, hear.) Whether we adopt 
     <lb/>
     one system or another, we must create the 
     <lb/>
     proper machinery for carrying out whatever 
     <lb/>
     system we adopt. And the plain truth is, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     that the Federal system is simply inconsist<lb break="no"/>ent with the first principles that must pre<lb break="no"/>vail in a properly organized British respon<lb break="no"/>sible central government. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Indeed, aside even from Federalism, the 
     <lb/>
     British system and the republican are 
     <lb/>
     antagonist in principle ; neither of them will 
     <lb/>
     work mixed up with the other. You 
     <lb/>
     must be content with one or other, and 
     <lb/>
     must not commit the folly of attempting 
     <lb/>
     any new, untried, mongrel system, or com<lb break="no"/>pound of the two—such as nobody can shew 
     <lb/>
     to be capable of being worked at all. 
     <lb/>
     And now, Mr. SPEAKER, let us just fol<lb break="no"/>low out the course of our distinguished fel<lb break="no"/>low-colonist who is trying to govern some 
     <lb/>
     one of our provinces under this proposed 
     <lb/>
     amalgamation of the two systems. We will 
     <lb/>
     suppose him a most admirably fitted person 
     <lb/>
     for the post, the functions of which he is called 
     <lb/>
     upon to exercise; but he must necessarily 
     <lb/>
     have one or two causes of incapacitation, so 
     <lb/>
     to speak, for it. When Her Majesty appoints 
     <lb/>
     a governor to come out to Canada, or any 
     <lb/>
     other colony, she is presumed by every one 
     <lb/>
     here to have named somebody holding a 
     <lb/>
     good position at home, and somebody against 
     <lb/>
     whom no one in the colony can have any 
     <lb/>
     ground of dislike. He comes with a social 
     <lb/>
     rank and <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> presumedly higher than that 
     <lb/>
     of the people whom he is here to meet with 
     <lb/>
     and govern. Every one is disposed to re<lb break="no"/>cognise in him the representative of Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty ; and he has every chance of main<lb break="no"/>taining himself in that pleasant attitude— 
     <lb/>
     that of administering his government to the 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction, so far as such a thing is pos<lb break="no"/>sible, of all parties. In adopting the views 
     <lb/>
     of his constitutional advisers, he is not called 
     <lb/>
     upon to give up any views which he may 
     <lb/>
     himself be thought to entertain. He can 
     <lb/>
     express to the people's representatives the 
     <lb/>
     views of his Cabinet, whether they be con<lb break="no"/>servative or reform, or even though they be 
     <lb/>
     conservative this session and reform the 
     <lb/>
     next, without any sacrifice of position, no 
     <lb/>
     matter what his own political views may 
     <lb/>
     have been in the Mother Country. But 
     <lb/>
     suppose any of our politicians, whether of 
     <lb/>
     this province or of any other in the Con<lb break="no"/>federacy, say Canada, Newfoundland or Nova 
     <lb/>
      Scotia, to be assuming this <hi rendition="simple:italic">rôleM</hi> of lieuten<lb break="no"/>ant-governor in any of our provinces. He 
     <lb/>
     has this disadvantage to begin with; he has 
     <lb/>
     to that moment been passing through that 
     <lb/>
     ordeal of abuse under which every prominent 
     <lb/>
     public man in this country must have suf<lb break="no"/>fered before attaining any distinction what<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="504" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0504.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">504</fw>
       ever. (Hear, hear.) When a politician, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, in the United States, who is 
     <lb/>
     obnoxious to the ill-will of any large body of 
     <lb/>
     the people, is there elected to be Governor 
     <lb/>
     of his state, the halo of his election sur<lb break="no"/>rounds him with a something of political 
     <lb/>
     glory that throws into shade any stains on 
     <lb/>
     his political reputation. But if the governors 
     <lb/>
     of the several states of the American Union 
     <lb/>
     were appointed from Washington, do you 
     <lb/>
     think the people would put up with the 
     <lb/>
     results of such appointment, as they now do 
     <lb/>
     with those of their own choice; when they 
     <lb/>
     might feel that the man was even a despised, 
     <lb/>
     dishonest man, and his appointment as well 
     <lb/>
     an insult as a wrong? Who does not know 
     <lb/>
     that our chief public men of all parties have 
     <lb/>
     been so assailed, as to be held at this moment 
     <lb/>
     at a painfully low value by the large section 
     <lb/>
     of our people who have differed from their 
     <lb/>
     views? I do not say that they have deserved 
     <lb/>
     this fate, but the fact is undeniable that 
     <lb/>
     they have met it. Let any one of our dozen 
     <lb/>
     or twenty most prominent Canadian politi<lb break="no"/>cians be named Lieutenant-Governor of Up<lb break="no"/>per or of Lower Canada, would net a large 
     <lb/>
     and powerful class of the community in 
     <lb/>
     either case to be governed, be very likely to 
     <lb/>
     resent the nomination as an insult? Do not 
     <lb/>
     tell me that we are entering upon a new era, 
     <lb/>
     that all such things are passed away, that 
     <lb/>
     we are to have a political millennium, by 
     <lb/>
     virtue of this Confederation? Come what 
     <lb/>
     may, we are going to have pretty sharp con<lb break="no"/>tests for place and power in the future as in 
     <lb/>
     the past. No matter over what colony ap<lb break="no"/>pointed, or from what colony coming, a lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant-governor will have hard cards to play, 
     <lb/>
     and will have very much to put up with from 
     <lb/>
     the people over whom he is set, on this 
     <lb/>
     mere score of his past political exploits. 
     <lb/>
     And he will not find it easy, either, to get 
     <lb/>
     along without exciting a good deal of ill- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     feeling, as he goes. He has been known as 
     <lb/>
     a politician, and will be held to be favorable 
     <lb/>
     or unfavorable to this or that party in the 
     <lb/>
     province he governs. He will have stepped 
     <lb/>
     into position as a statesman of the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. No man so placed will be able to blot 
     <lb/>
     the record of his past, or deny his participa<lb break="no"/>tion in this, that and the other proceeding, 
     <lb/>
     which his opponent may choose to brand as 
     <lb/>
     perhaps next to criminal; how then will he 
     <lb/>
     be able to hold that position of equilibrium 
     <lb/>
     between political parties, which, if he is not 
     <lb/>
     to fail utterly in his <hi rendition="simple:italic">rôle</hi> of governor, he must 
     <lb/>     
     maintain? He will be suspected, watched 
     <lb/>
     attacked, vilified; must stick by friends and 
     <lb/>
          <cb/>  
            punish enemies; cannot win respect, esteem 
     <lb/>and sympathy, as a stranger might. Nor will 
     <lb/>he be free from another source of embarrass<lb break="no"/>ment. I incline to think there will be a 
     <lb/>sort of distinction between the two clues 
     <lb/>of politicians to grow up under our proposed 
     <lb/>Confederation. There will be those who 
     <lb/>will aim at and get seats in the Federal 
     <lb/>Legislature, and who may be denominated 
     <lb/>the senior or higher class of our politicians. 
     <lb/>It will be from this class that men will get 
     <lb/>into the Federal Executive Council, into 
     <lb/>high-caste judgeships, lieutenant-governor<lb break="no"/>ships, and other high places of the new 
     <lb/>system—" the chief seats in the synagogue." 
     <lb/>The lower seats, with their less tem ting 
     <lb/>prizes, will be left to the junior or ower 
     <lb/>class of our politicians. But if anything 
     <lb/>ever so little like responsible government 
     <lb/>is to be carried out in the provinces, while 
     <lb/>the lieutenant-governors must be taken from 
     <lb/>the former of these two classes, the members 
     <lb/>of any cabinets or quasi-cabinets that they 
     <lb/>may have (not to say their provincial Pre<lb break="no"/>miers even, very likely), must be taken from 
     <lb/>the latter class. Do you mean to tell me that 
     <lb/>a governor chosen from among our politi<lb break="no"/>cians, of what I may call high caste, will put 
     <lb/>up with much of control from a lot of poli<lb break="no"/>ticians of low caste, sitting at his sham 
     <lb/>council board or forming his sham legisla<lb break="no"/>ture? I fancy he will want to have—and 
     <lb/>will be held by his pe0ple to be wanting to 
     <lb/>have—a vast deal more of power than they 
     <lb/>will like, or than any system ever so little 
     <lb/>free can allow of. And meantime, what of 
     <lb/>the power behind, and nominally above him 
     <lb/>—the Federal Executive—with its Premier, 
     <lb/>sections, and what not? Once named, he is 
     <lb/>likely to feel every inch a governor ; might 
     <lb/>perhaps run round to the Premier and Minis<lb break="no"/>try that had named him, and tell them in 
     <lb/>effect, though probably not in so many 
     <lb/>words: " I am here and you are there. I 
     <lb/>shall be careful not to give you suficient 
     <lb/>cause for so bold a step as my dismissal, but 
     <lb/>there is a good deal I can do. I am here for 
     <lb/>five years; and your tenure of office is less 
     <lb/>certain." He may be drawn into this atti<lb break="no"/>tude by differences growing up between 
     <lb/>himself and them. Or, the Federal Cabinet 
     <lb/>may so change its composition or policy as 
     <lb/>to force such attitude upon him. Why, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, you may have a Lieutenant-

            <p>
         Mr. DUNKIN - Yes,  may whistle—may 
     <lb/>
     find his Lieutenant-Governor counter-working  
     <lb/>
     him in Parliament, in the Provincial Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, everywhere ; and perhaps, in the en<lb break="no"/>counter, may catch a very ugly fall. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) Mr. SPEAKER, let me once again 
     <lb/>
     make reference to Canadian history. Just 
     <lb/>
      before the union of the Canadas, and after 
     <lb/>
     it, the late Lord SYDENHAM, who was cer<lb break="no"/>tainly not a fool, thought he would try a 
     <lb/>
     political experiment. I believe he made no 
     <lb/>
     secret of its being, to his own mind, an ex<lb break="no"/>periment, nor yet of the fact that he did not 
     <lb/>
     suppose it would so far succeed as to last 
     <lb/>
     long. He was very anxious to introduce 
     <lb/>
     into Canada a municipal system. Well, he 
     <lb/>
     tried first to get such a  system embodied in 
     <lb/>
     the Union Act ; but he failed  in that. He 
     <lb/>
     afterwards got his enactment passed as he 
     <lb/>
     wished, for Lower Canada, by the Special 
     <lb/>
     Council, and for Upper Canada by the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian Parliament at its first session. That 
     <lb/>
     system had in it certain features of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme now proposed for our Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Each municipal district was to have its 
     <lb/>
     warden appointed by the Governor General, 
     <lb/>
      and to have its elected district council, or 
     <lb/>
     little legislature of one chamber. The powers 
     <lb/>
     of that little legislature, or large municipal 
     <lb/>
     body, were well stated. There was no mis<lb break="no"/>take as to  just how far it could go. The 
     <lb/>
     power of disallowing by-laws passed by it, 
     <lb/>
     and also that of nominating the warden, 
     <lb/>
     were carefully reserved to Government. And, 
     <lb/>
     mind you, my Lord SYDENHAM did not 
     <lb/>
     make the blunder of letting his wardens 
     <lb/>
     hold otherwise than during pleasure. He 
     <lb/>
     kept in his own hands all needed control 
     <lb/>
     over them; and, by the way, he kept, too, 
     <lb/>
      what was most material, the power of dis<lb break="no"/>solving any refractory council, in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of Government. The whole thing was nicely 
     <lb/>
     arranged, and was meant to work, and Lord 
     <lb/>
     SYDENHAM  probably thought it would work 
     <lb/>
      for some few years, and that then the dis<lb break="no"/>tricts would outgrow the system, and elect 
     <lb/>
     their own wardens and pass their by-laws 
     <lb/>
     freely. But, Mr. SPEAKER, the plan never 
     <lb/>
      did work at all, neither in Lower nor 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada; and the first thing 
     <lb/>
     done by the next Parliament was to 
     <lb/>
      sweep it all away—nominated wardens and 
     <lb/>
      power of disallowing by-laws together. 
     <lb/>
      Everybody saw and felt that it was a 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     real power and not a sham, that was so<lb/>reserved to Government. And so it will be 
     <lb/>
     in this case. Your Lieutenant-Governor will 
     <lb/>
     be felt to have a real power, not a sham 
     <lb/>
     one. What your petty districts would not 
     <lb/>
     put up with five and twenty years ago, your 
     <lb/>
     provinces will not put up with now. Is a larger 
     <lb/>
     illustration wanted ? One comes readily to 
     <lb/>
     hand. The Imperial Government used once to 
     <lb/>
     try the experiment of sending out governors 
     <lb/>
     to colonies having representative institutions, 
     <lb/>
     without instructing them to pay due deference 
     <lb/>
     to those institutions, and it led to a most la<lb break="no"/>mentable failure. (Hear, hear.) Are we 
     <lb/>
     going to try to work, in all these provinces, a 
     <lb/>
     worse system than that which, when worked 
     <lb/>
     from the Colonial Ofice at home, resulted in 
     <lb/>
     what Lord DURHAM well called "constituted 
     <lb/>
     anarchy ?" If  we are, how long may we 
     <lb/>
     count on putting off the conflict of authority 
     <lb/>
     that shall end in a complete crash of the en<lb break="no"/>tire fabric ? (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I have not come to the crowning difficulties of 
     <lb/>
     this case, even yet. Not at all. Between 
     <lb/>
     the states of the United States, as I have al<lb break="no"/>ready stated, while there is an essential iden<lb break="no"/>tity of constitution, there is at the same time 
     <lb/>
     a carefully  distinct separation of powers and 
     <lb/>
     functions. I do not say that the dividing 
     <lb/>
     line is drawn exactly where it should be, but 
     <lb/>
     that there is a distinct dividing line, no one 
     <lb/>
     can gainsay. But how do we stand here, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, as to the attributes of our own 
     <lb/>
     provincial legislatures and governments,  on 
     <lb/>
     the one hand, and those of the Federal power 
     <lb/>
     on the other? Do we follow American ex<lb break="no"/>ample, and give so much to the union and the 
     <lb/>
     rest to the provinces; or so much to them, 
     <lb/>
     and the rest to it? Either rule would be 
     <lb/>
     plain; but this plan follows neither. It sim<lb break="no"/>ply gives us a sort of special list for each; 
     <lb/>
     making much common to both, and as to 
     <lb/>
     much more, not shewing what belongs to 
     <lb/>
     either. I cannot go now—it is impossible for 
     <lb/>
     me at this hour of the night to go—into de<lb break="no"/>tail on this head. I can give no more than 
     <lb/>
     some few specimens; and I take first the three 
     <lb/>
     subjects of the fisheries, agriculture, and im<lb break="no"/>migration. These three subjects are equally 
     <lb/>
     assigned to the General Legislature on the one 
     <lb/>
     hand, and the Provincial Legislature on the 
     <lb/>
     other. It is provided by the 45th resolution, 
     <lb/>
     that in all such cases, wherever any statutes 
     <lb/>
     of the general and local parliaments clash, 
     <lb/>
     those of the General Parliament shall over<lb break="no"/>ride those of the local. So that in these 
     <lb/>
     matters of the fisheries, agriculture and 
     <lb/>
     immigration, either the local legislatures 
     <lb/>
     must not legislate at all, or if they do 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="506" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0506.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">506</fw>
           
     the General Legislature may at any time 
     <lb/>
     undo any thing they may have done. One 
     <lb/>
     can easily  foresee any amount of clashing 
     <lb/>
     of authority in such cases. Fishery regula<lb break="no"/>tions of all sorts — bounties perhaps; the 
     <lb/>
     thousand questions affecting agriculture. Or 
     <lb/>
     to take just one that suggests itself as to im<lb break="no"/>migration ; one province wishes, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     to encourage immigration of a certain kind, 
     <lb/>
     say, for instance, from the continent of Eu<lb break="no"/>rope. It is a legitimate wish; but the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Legislature may, perhaps, in the varying 
     <lb/>
     shifts of public opinion, adopt a different  
     <lb/>
     policy, and reverse all that the province may 
     <lb/>
     have done. To what end give powers to 
     <lb/>
     the local parliaments which may thus be 
     <lb/>
     taken away at any moment by the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislature ? (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, there are a hundred other cases as to 
     <lb/>
     which I could satisfy the House, had I time 
     <lb/>
     for doing so, that more or less of this confu<lb break="no"/>sion arises. Take the subject of marriage 
     <lb/>
     and divorce for one—a subject on which there 
     <lb/>
     is a great deal of local prejudice and feeling, 
     <lb/>
     and into which even religious convictions 
     <lb/>
     largely enter. That matter is given to the 
     <lb/>
     General Legislature. But on the other hand 
     <lb/>
     the larger matter, civil rights—of which 
     <lb/>
     this of marriage and divorce, from one point 
     <lb/>
     of view, forms a mere part—is given to the lo<lb break="no"/>cal legislatures. I turn to another matter, hap<lb break="no"/>hazard—the subjects of railway legislation, of 
     <lb/>
     railway incorporation, and of railway amalga<lb break="no"/>mation. What Legislature has power in these 
     <lb/>
     matters under this scheme? I am not sure that 
     <lb/>
     there are not here as nice a lot of pretty little 
     <lb/>
     questions as one would desire to see in a sum<lb break="no"/>mer's day. And I am not alone in the matter of 
     <lb/>
     this criticism. Her Majesty's Colonial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary expresses an opinion, rather diplomati<lb break="no"/>cally,  it is true, but still an opinion on this 
     <lb/>
      point ; and what does the Colonial Secretary

         The point of principal importance to the prac<lb break="no"/>tical well-working of the scheme, is the accurate

     determination of the limits between the authority

     of the central and that of the local legislatures

     a good deal of short-coming between it and

     the execution. (Hear, hear.) A thing is not

     important clause in the whole resolutions, and 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately by no means the easiest to 
     <lb/>
     understand, is the one which defines the 
     <lb/>

         It is exceedingly difficult to construe these pro<lb break="no"/>visions. First, general powers of legislation are 
     <lb/>
     given in the widest terms to the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment; then a power is given especially to make 
     <lb/>
     laws on thirty-seven subjects, one of those being 
     <lb/>
     all matters of a general character not exclusively 
     <lb/>
     reserved to the local legislatures. Nothing is

     <lb/>from an article it contains on this subject. 
     <lb/>The article is in the last or January number 
     <lb/>of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Review</hi>, and purports to be in commen<lb break="no"/>dation of this scheme. After giving the words 
     <lb/>of the resolutions themselves on the subject, 
     <lb/>and especially their residuary legacy, if I may 
     <lb/> to call it, to the General Legislature, of all mat<lb break="no"/>ters of a general character not specially and 
     <lb/>exclusively reserved for the local parliaments, 
     <lb/>this probably not undistinguished writer

     <lb/>for what are  matters of a general character, 
     <lb/>and who is to decide whether a matter is of a 
     <lb/>general character or not? * * We should 
     <lb/>prefer to the foregoing enumeration of the

     <lb/>declaration that all powers are given to it 
     <lb/>except those expressly reserved to the several 
     <lb/>members of the  Confederation." And in 
     <lb/>another part of the same article, reverting to 
     <lb/>the same subject, we have these words—" And 
     <lb/>although the distinction attempted to be drawn 
     <lb/>between general and local matters is in some 
     <lb/> respects scarcely traceable in the draft 
     <lb/>minutes of the Conference "—Yes, sir, so this 
     <lb/> writer calls them, their looseness of expression

     too much. Any way, the idea is very like

     <lb/>
     matter, as to which further capacities for con<lb break="no"/>flict are very well laid out for us. In the

     framing of the United States Constitution 
     <lb/>
     they did not forget to provide for a district

     supreme for all purposes. And they did not 
     <lb/>
     forget to declare that the powers, legislative 
     <lb/>
     and otherwise, of the Federal authority, were 
     <lb/>
     to be complete over all the vast territories 
     <lb/>
     belonging to the nation, and over all its 
     <lb/>
      smaller properties, such as forts, arsenals, 
     <lb/>
     dockyards  and the like. We have nothing 
     <lb/>
     of the kind here; and, at least as regards 
     <lb/>
     the seat of Government, this is not a mere 
     <lb/>
      forget. We find it stated that " The seat 
     <lb/>
     of Government of the Federated Provin<lb break="no"/>ces shall be Ottawa, subject to the royal 
     <lb/>
     prerogative." It is distinctly laid down as a 
     <lb/>
     part of our system that the royal prerogative, 
     <lb/>
     the right to change the seat of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government at will, is to be maintained. But 
     <lb/>
     I venture to say that the maintaining of that 
     <lb/>
     right is simply inconsistent with the practical 
     <lb/>
     working out of a Federal system. And this 
     <lb/>
     is a matter involving a good deal of anomaly, 
     <lb/>
     as honorable gentlemen will see when they be<lb break="no"/>gin to think of it. The Governor General or<lb/>Viceroy, the all but king of this Confederacy,<lb/>with his all but Imperial Govenment, and all<lb/>but Imperial Legislature, constituted no mat<lb break="no"/>ter how, resident within the territorial juris<lb break="no"/>diction of a subordinate province! The po<lb break="no"/>lice of the Federal capital, not Federal but<lb/>provincial! That thing won't do. The framers <lb/>of the Constitution of the United States knew<lb/>it would not do, and therefore they were par<lb break="no"/>ticular to give power to their General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to acquire and hold and control and le<lb break="no"/>gislate for, in all respects, as they liked, a ter<lb break="no"/>ritory within which they could reign and rule<lb/>and have no subordinate authority over them.<lb/>We have not got to Ottawa yet, but suppose<lb/>the seat of Government were in Ottawa - per<lb break="no"/>haps we may yet get it there - it might so<lb/>

            <fw type="num">508</fw>
             happen that some Honorable Premier of the
<lb/>
Federal may not be on speaking <lb/>
terms with the Lieutenant-Governor of Uppcr <lb/>
Canada ; or at least, there may be between <lb/>
them the most decided, thorough, unmis<lb break="no"/>takably proclaimed antagonism of
views and <lb/>
feeling. It is easy to imagine that a Premier <lb/>
in that position, and a Lieutenant Governor in <lb/>
that position, could between them make a <lb/>
Viceroy very uncomfortable ; and
that the re<lb break="no"/>sult might be the bringing up of a great many <lb/>
ticklish questions for adjudication by the <lb/>
various authorities. It is clear there is a de<lb break="no"/>fect here, which might lead to plenty of <lb/>
trouble. But it is said—" Oh! there won't <lb/>
be any trouble; men are in the main sensible, <lb/>
and won't try to make trouble."
Well, sir, <lb/>
if this is so, if there is this general disposition <lb/>
to be sensible, and make things work well, I <lb/>
just want to know how we come to have had <lb/>
four crises in two years? (Hear,
hear.) <lb/>
There is another matter, intimately con<lb break="no"/>nected with this, to which also I must <lb/>
pass on. I said a little while ago, that <lb/>
the United States system was one of ex<lb break="no"/>ceeding skill as regards the constitution of the <lb/>
judiciary. DE TOCQUEVILLE, and every other <lb/>
writer who has treated of the United States, <lb/>
has awarded it this praise ; and
they are <lb/>
right. Each state has its own judiciary ; and <lb/>
the United States have theirs ; and the func<lb break="no"/>tions of the two are most carefully laid down, <lb/>
so that no serious trouble has ever arisen <lb/>
from their clashing. The judiciary of the <lb/>
United States is undoubtedly the most conser<lb break="no"/>vative and strongest bulwark of their whole <lb/>
system. (Hear, hear.) What then
are we <lb/>
going to do on this head ? Just as we have <lb/>
forgotten all about difficulties
where the seat <lb/>
of government is concerned, so here. We <lb/>
are not quite sure whether we are going to <lb/>
have any distinctively federal judiciary or <lb/>
not. There is a power given to have one—there
<lb/>
may be one ; but we are expressly told that <lb/>
perhaps there will not be. But what are <lb/>
we told on the other hand? Oh, there <lb/>
is no doubt whatever, according to the re<lb break="no"/>solutions laid before us — no doubt what<lb break="no"/>ever—that whether we have a Federal judi<lb break="no"/>ciary or not, the provincial judiciaries are to <lb/>
be a sort of joint institutions. And a very <lb/>
curious kind of co-partnership the Federal <lb/>
Government and the provincial governments <lb/>
—thc Federal Legislature and the
provincial <lb/>
legislatures—are thus to have in the judicial <lb/>
institutions of the country, generally. All <lb/>
the courts, judges, and other judicial officers<lb/>
of the provinces are to be, for all manner of <lb/>
            
            <cb/> 
           federal purposes, servants of the Federal
<lb/>
Government. There is an old saying, "No <lb/>
man can serve two masters." But all these <lb/>
unfortunate courts, and all their officers, and <lb/>
specially all their judges, must serve two mas<lb break="no"/>ters, whether they can or not. All the Su<lb break="no"/>perior Court judges—and, in Upper Canada, <lb/>
the judges of the County Courts—are to be <lb/>
named and paid by the Federal authority, and <lb/>
are only to be removable by the Federal au<lb break="no"/>thority, on a joint address of the two Houses <lb/>
of the Federal Parliament. But, on the other <lb/>
hand, the provinces are to constitute the <lb/>
courts—(hear, hear)—are to say what their <lb/>
functions shall be—what the number of the <lb/>
judges—how they are to perform their func<lb break="no"/>tions—are to give them more work or less— <lb/>
to make their work pleasant or disagreeable,
<lb/>
high work or dirty work, as they like. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) In this way they can wrong a judge <lb/>
just as much as they please ;
the only check <lb/>
on them being the power of the Federal Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to disallow their legislation. The <lb/>
Federal Government, forsooth, names the <lb/>
judges, and pays them, and alone can remove <lb/>
them. Does that take away the power from <lb/>
the local parliaments and governments, the <lb/>
power to change the constitution of the court, <lb/>
to change it in the way most distasteful to <lb/>
those judges, to legislate away the court alto<lb break="no"/>gether, to legislate down its
functions in such a <lb/>
manner as may drive the judge to resign? <lb/>
And we are told there will be no clashing! <lb/>
(Hear.) I have no doubt the Hon.
Attorney <lb/>
General East thinks he could manage courts <lb/>
on this system ; could have one
authority <lb/>
constituting the courts and another naming <lb/>
and removing thejudges, and have the system <lb/>
work harmoniously. He may think so. I do <lb/>
not. I am satisfied if ever the scheme is <lb/>
tried, it will be found that it will not work. <lb/>
Human nature is human nature ; and here is <lb/>
a first rate lot of matters to
quarrel over, and <lb/>
to quarrel over seriously. Why, there is even <lb/>
a special refinement of confusion as to crimi<lb break="no"/>nal matters. Criminal procedure is to be <lb/>
federal; civil procedure, provincial; crimi<lb break="no"/>nal legislation, proper, is to be federal; but <lb/>
with a most uncertain quantity of what one <lb/>
may call legislation about penalties, provin<lb break="no"/>cial; civil rights, in the main, provincial; <lb/>
but with no one can tell how much of federal <lb/>
interference and over-ruling, and all with <lb/>
courts provincial in constitution, but whose <lb/>
judges hold by federal tenure
and under <lb/>
federal pay. I pity the poor man who is at <lb/>
once a criminal judge and a civil judge. Be<lb break="no"/>tween the clashing ofhis masters and the clash<lb break="no"/>
          
            <pb n="509" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0509.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">509</fw>
       ing of his book authorities, he had
better mind <lb/>
what he is about, with the
painful doubt rising <lb/>
at every turn whether provincial legislation <lb/>
may not be overridden by federal legislation. <lb/>
His province may well have legislated on what <lb/>
it holds a local matter, while the Federal Par<lb break="no"/>liament may have legislated on it, thinking it <lb/>
a federal matter. Anywhere there
may well <lb/>
be some bit of federal legislation
contradict<lb break="no"/>ing something in a local statute. And do our <lb/>
resolutions say that the federal statute shall <lb/>
always override the local statute ? No, only <lb/>
in cases where there is concurrent jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion. And yet our judge who is
to decide these <lb/>
nice questions is paid by one power and re-<lb break="yes"/>
moveable by that power, and may have his func<lb break="no"/>tions taken away and be persecuted
to the death <lb/>
by the other. He will have it bad time of it. <lb/>
Well, Mr. Speaker, I have so far been deal<lb break="no"/>ing with matters, nearly all of which may be <lb/>
said to be general to every part of this great <lb/>
Confederacy ; but now I must ask the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the House for a few moments, to some <lb/>
sources of misunderstanding
which may more <lb/>
particularly make trouble, unless human na<lb break="no"/>ture ceases to be human nature
within this <lb/>
Canada of ours. There are in Canada, and <lb/>
especially in Lower Canada, the two differences
<lb/>
of language and faith ; and there is no doubt <lb/>
that the real remains which have
rendered, <lb/>
or are supposed to have rendered necessary <lb/>
this plan of a sort of Federal Government, <lb/>
are referable to this fact. This machinery is <lb/>
devised, on purpose to meet a possible or pro<lb break="no"/>bable clashing of races and creeds in Canada, <lb/>
and particularly in Lower Canada. Now, in <lb/>
the United States, when their constitutional <lb/>
system was adopted, the framers of it must <lb/>
have foreseen, of course, that controversy <lb/>
would arise on the subjects of state rights <lb/>
and slavery. There was a jealousy be<lb break="no"/>tween the small states and the large, and <lb/>
the commencement of a dissent
between the <lb/>
Northern and the Southern States of the re<lb break="no"/>public. There was undoubtedly a foresha<lb break="no"/>dowing of trouble on the subject of slavery, <lb/>
though, by the way, slavery was to all ap<lb break="no"/>pearance dying out rapidly in the Northern <lb/>
States, not so rapidly in the Southern. How, <lb/>
then, did the framers of that Constitution un<lb break="no"/>dertake to deal with these foreseen troubles, <lb/>
these questions of state rights
and slavery ? <lb/>
Sir, they did all they possibly could to keep <lb/>
both out of sight—to bury them—that they <lb/>
might not rise up in the future to give trou<lb break="no"/>ble. It is true that in so doing they but buried <lb/>
the dragon's teeth, and that these, all buried <lb/>
as they were, have yet since sprung up, armed <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            men ; but so far as they could, they kept
them <lb/>
down, kept them from growing, prevented <lb/>
recognition of them at that time and for long <lb/>
after. Well, how are we going to carry out <lb/>
this scheme of ours? Are we burying, or are <lb/>
we of set choice sowing, our dragon's teeth ? <lb/>
Are we trying to keep our difficulties out of <lb/>
the way, to bury them out of sight, that we <lb/>
may smooth our way for, the future lessening
<lb/>
of them? I think not. On the contrary, <lb/>
we are setting ourselves as deliberately as we <lb/>
well can to keep up the distinctions and the diff<lb break="no"/>erences which exist among us, to hold them <lb/>
constantly in everybody's sight—in the hope, <lb/>
I suppose, that while everybody is looking at <lb/>
them intently, somehow or other no one may <lb/>
see them at all. (Laughter.) In
the United <lb/>
States, be it remembered, they started with <lb/>
 their states sovereign and independent.
From <lb/>
that they went into their system of confed<lb break="no"/>eration, which was a great improvement; and <lb/>
from that they went on into their present <lb/>
federal-national constitution. At each step <lb/>
they were moving to limit state rights, and <lb/>
also, indirectly, the extent and influence of <lb/>
slavery. It is true they did
not altogether <lb/>
succeed in this policy, but their want of suc<lb break="no"/>cess has been mainly owing to circumstances
<lb/>
over which they could exercise no control. <lb/>
We in Canada, for the last twenty-five years, <lb/>
have been legislatively united,
and we have <lb/>
worked that union in a federal spirit. We <lb/>
complain that, as a result of this,
the dis<lb break="no"/>tinctions which exist among us have become <lb/>
so prominent—the truth being, that it is
<lb/>
rather this proposed change which is suddenly <lb/>
bringing them into startling
prominence— <lb/>
we have worked that union, however, I say,<lb/>
in a federal spirit, and it is said to have <lb/>
produced or aggravated a certain state of <lb/>
feud amongst us ; and now, for the purpose
<lb/>
of perpetuating this state of fund, we are <lb/>
going to effect a professcdly
Federal union <lb/>
which is even expressly
recommended to us, <lb/>
or to many of us, as meant and calculated to <lb/>
be so worked as to amount, for all practical
<lb/>
purposes, to disunion. Under it
Lower <lb/>
Canada has all sorts of special exceptions <lb/>
made, as the phrase runs, in her
favor. The <lb/>
Legislative Council is to he named
in a <lb/>
peculiar manner, so far as its members
from <lb/>
Lower Canada are concerned. The other <lb/>
provinces may have their laws
made uniform, <lb/>
but an exception in this respect is made for <lb/>
Lower Canada, and as if to make it apparent
<lb/>
that Lower Canadais never to be like the rest<lb/>
of the Confederation, it is carelully provided <lb/>
that the General Parliament may make <lb/>
         
            <pb n="510" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0510.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">510</fw>
          
     uniform the laws of the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     only—that is to say, provided those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces consent to it, but by inference it can<lb break="no"/>not extend this uniformity to Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     not even if she should wish it. Supposing, 
     <lb/>
     even, that the other provinces were to desire 
     <lb/>
     to adopt our Lower Canadian system, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the letter of this Constitution, one 
     <lb/>
     would say they cannot do it. They may 
     <lb/>
     become uniform among themselves, but 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, even though her people were 
     <lb/>
     to wish it, must not be uniform with them. 
     <lb/>
     Again, as to education, exceptions of some 
     <lb/>
     sort are to be made in Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     indeed in Upper Canada too, though no one 
     <lb/>
     can tell to what extent these exceptions are 
     <lb/>
     or are not to be carried. Thus, in one way 
     <lb/>
     and another, Lower Canada is to be placed 
     <lb/>
     on a separate and distinct footing from the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces, so that her interests 
     <lb/>
     and institutions may not be meddled 
     <lb/>
     with. I say this system, as a whole, 
     <lb/>
     and these peculiarities and exceptions in 
     <lb/>
     regard to Lower Canada, are adopted with a 
     <lb/>
     special view to remedy our Canadian difficul<lb break="no"/>ties of race and creed. But, sir, this is no way 
     <lb/>
     at all of avoiding or lessening trouble from 
     <lb/>
     this cause. It is idle to pretend that by this 
     <lb/>
     system collision is going to be prevented. 
     <lb/>
     Under the legislative union of the Canadas, 
     <lb/>
     even worked as it has been, the tendency of 
     <lb/>
     the minorities in Upper and Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     respectively, has been towards the mainten<lb break="no"/>ance of the union—towards the avoidance 
     <lb/>
     of all intemperate language and prejudiced 
     <lb/>
     feelings—towards the pulling down of the 
     <lb/>
     feuds that before divided them and the 
     <lb/>
     respective majorities. And the result has 
     <lb/>
     been, that while just before the union 
     <lb/>
     the feud between the races in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     was at its highest and bitterest point, it has 
     <lb/>
     since then all but disappeared. The com<lb break="no"/>plaint of Upper Canadian politicians has been 
     <lb/>
     that they could not set the British and 
     <lb/>
     French races in Lower Canada by the ears, 
     <lb/>
     that they could not get the former, either as 
     <lb/>
     British or as Protestants, to join with them 
     <lb/>
     in a crusade against the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     majority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—Who made that 
     <lb/>
     complaint ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—I do not say that it has 
     <lb/>
     been said in words, but it has been in spirit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—No, no. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Yes ; the complaint has 
     <lb/>
     been made, perhaps not in that particular 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
           
     form, but certainly in that spirit. The 
     <lb/>
     British of Lower Canada have been again 
     <lb/>
     and again told they were worse than their 
     <lb/>
     French neighbors, for not casting in their lot 
     <lb/>
     with the people of Upper Canada. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Well, Mr. SPEAKER, undoubtedly, 
     <lb/>
     before the union, Lower Canada, as I have 
     <lb/>
     said, was the place where the war of races 
     <lb/>
     was at its height ; and that war of races did 
     <lb/>
     not nearly cease for a number of years after. 
     <lb/>
     But the strife did very gradually lessen, and 
     <lb/>
     a better and more friendly feeling has for 
     <lb/>
     some time prevailed, in both camps. Indeed, 
     <lb/>
     there has been a more tolerant state of feel<lb break="no"/>ing in both camps, than in any other 
     <lb/>
     community so divided as to race and creed, 
     <lb/>
     that I know of. But the moment you tell 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada that the large-sounding 
     <lb/>
     powers of your General Government are 
     <lb/>
     going to be handed over to a British- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     American majority, decidedly not of the 
     <lb/>
     race and faith of her majority, that moment 
     <lb/>
     you wake up the old jealousies and hostility 
     <lb/>
     in their strongest form. By the very 
     <lb/>
     provisions you talk of for the protection of 
     <lb/>
     the non-French and non-Catholic interests, 
     <lb/>
     you unfortunately countenance the idea that 
     <lb/>
     the French are going to be more unfair than 
     <lb/>
     I believe they wish to be. For that matter, 
     <lb/>
     what else can they well be ? They will find 
     <lb/>
     themselves a minority in the General Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and their power in the General 
     <lb/>
     Government will depend upon their power 
     <lb/>
     within their own province and over their 
     <lb/>
     provincial delegations in the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. They will thus be compelled to be 
     <lb/>
     practically aggressive, to secure and retain 
     <lb/>
     that power. They may not, perhaps, wish 
     <lb/>
     to be ; they may not, perhaps, be aggressive 
     <lb/>
     in the worst sense of the term.—I do not say 
     <lb/>
     that they certainly will be ; but whether 
     <lb/>
     they are or not, there will certainly be in 
     <lb/>
     this system the very strongest tendencies to 
     <lb/>
     make them practically aggressive upon the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority in language and faith, 
     <lb/>
     and at the same time to make the minority 
     <lb/>
     most suspicious and resentful of aggression. 
     <lb/>
     The same sort of alienation, as between the 
     <lb/>
     two faiths, will be going on in Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Note of warning is already given by this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, to both parties, that they prepare 
     <lb/>
     for fight ; and the indications, I regret to 
     <lb/>
     say, are that such note of warning is not to 
     <lb/>
     be given in vain. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     prejudices of the two camps are once more 
     <lb/>
     stirred to their depths ; and if this scheme 
     <lb/>
     goes into operation, they will separate more 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="511" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-27_Page_0511.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">511</fw>
           
     and more widely, and finally break out 
     <lb/>
     into open war, unless, indeed, it shall work 
     <lb/>
     very differently from what any one can now 
     <lb/>
     imagine. If provincial independence is to 
     <lb/>
     be crushed down by a General Government 
     <lb/>
     careless of local majorities, then you will 
     <lb/>
     have this war. Or, if on the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     the policy of the Federal Executive should 
     <lb/>
     be to give effect to the aggregate will of the 
     <lb/>
     several local majorities, at whatever sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     of principle, still then you will have this 
     <lb/>
     war. The local minorities—threatened with 
     <lb/>
     elimination, in their alarm and jealousy, 
     <lb/>
     will be simply desperate, ready for any out<lb break="no"/>break of discontent at any moment. Take a 
     <lb/>
     practical case. Suppose the rule adopted, 
     <lb/>
     of not having an Executive Council inconve<lb break="no"/>niently large, Lower Canada, as we have 
     <lb/>
     seen, can then only have three members of 
     <lb/>
     it ; and if all these three are French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians—as they almost must be, because the 
     <lb/>
     French cannot put up with less than three 
     <lb/>
     out of twelve—how will not the Irish Catho<lb break="no"/>lics and the British Protestants feel them<lb break="no"/>selves aggrieved ? You cannot help it. 
     <lb/>
     They must in that case feel deeply aggrieved, 
     <lb/>
     and so feeling, they will cause troubles. The 
     <lb/>
     Irish Catholics will be told, I suppose, " Oh, 
     <lb/>
     you will have an Irish Catholic member of 
     <lb/>
     the Government to look to from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land;" and if so, they will have to guide 
     <lb/>
     themselves by some sort of Irish-Catholic 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland rule of policy, and not by any 
     <lb/>
     rule ever so little savoring of a regard for 
     <lb/>
     larger or higher principle. The British 
     <lb/>
     Protestants, in their turn, will be told : "You 
     <lb/>
     have a majority of your own tongue and 
     <lb/>
     faith from Upper Canada and the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces ; you must be content with that, 
     <lb/>
     and look to their members of the Government 
     <lb/>
     for such care as you may need in the matter 
     <lb/>
     of your affairs." " Oh, we must, must 
     <lb/>
     we ?" will be the answer ; "then we will 
     <lb/>
     square our conduct, not by any rule for 
     <lb/>
     British America or even Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but by the shifting exigencies of preju<lb break="no"/>dice or passion, whatever they may be, in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada and your Lower Provinces." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) These discontented elements 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada, depend upon it, will 
     <lb/>
     create no small confusion ; and among 
     <lb/>
     those thus driven into making trouble, there 
     <lb/>
     will be not a few whose preferences will even 
     <lb/>
     be American, and who will appeal to outside 
     <lb/>
     influences for protection. Such will be the 
     <lb/>
     legitimate effect of this system ; and if any 
     <lb/>
     one tells me that it will be conducive to the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     peace and good government of this country, 
     <lb/>
     I say he prophecies in a way that I cannot 
     <lb/>
     understand. Thank God, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     do not need, as I stand here, to defend my<lb break="no"/>self from any charge of bigotry as against 
     <lb/>
     any sect or party. There was a time in Ca<lb break="no"/>nada when it was most difficult for any 
     <lb/>
     person who spoke my tongue to stand up 
     <lb/>
     and say that the French-Canadians ought 
     <lb/>
     not to be politically exterminated from the 
     <lb/>
     face of the earth. I stood out steadfastly 
     <lb/>
     against that doctrine then. I remember 
     <lb/>
     well the painful events of that sad time. 
     <lb/>
     I foresee but too distinctly the fearful 
     <lb/>
     probability there is of that time coming 
     <lb/>
     again, through the adoption of these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions. And I do not shrink from the 
     <lb/>
     danger of being misunderstood or misrepre<lb break="no"/>sented, when I now stand up here and warn 
     <lb/>
     the country of this danger. If trouble of 
     <lb/>
     this sort ever arises, it is one that will ex<lb break="no"/>tend very rapidly over the whole Confederacy. 
     <lb/>
     In all parts of it, in every province, there 
     <lb/>
     are minorities that will be acted upon by 
     <lb/>
     that kind of thing. In the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and in Newfoundland, things are but too 
     <lb/>
     ripe for the outburst of hostilities of this 
     <lb/>
     description. Talk, indeed, in such estate of 
     <lb/>
     things, of your founding here by this means 
     <lb/>
     " a new nationality "—of your creating such 
     <lb/>
     a thing—of your whole people here rallying 
     <lb/>
     round its new Government at Ottawa. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, is such a thing possible ? We 
     <lb/>
     have a large class whose national feelings 
     <lb/>
     turn towards London, whose very heart is 
     <lb/>
     there ; another large class whose sympathies 
     <lb/>
     centre here at Quebec, or in a sentimental 
     <lb/>
     way may have some reference to Paris ; an<lb break="no"/>other large class whose memories are of the 
     <lb/>
     Emerald Isle ; and yet another whose com<lb break="no"/>parisons are rather with Washington ; 
     <lb/>
     but have we any class of people who are 
     <lb/>
     attached, or whose feelings are going to be 
     <lb/>
     directed with any earnestness, to the city 
     <lb/>
     of Ottawa, the centre of the new nationality 
     <lb/>
     that is to be created ? In the times to 
     <lb/>
     come, when men shall begin to feel strongly 
     <lb/>
     on those questions that appeal to national 
     <lb/>
    preferences, prejudices and passions, all 
     <lb/>talk of your new nationality will sound but 
     <lb/>strangely. Some other older nationality will 
     <lb/>then be found to hold the first place in 
     <lb/>most people's hearts. (Hear, hear.) Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, it is only right that I should 
     <lb/>state to the House that I have not reached 
     <lb/>within a long distance of the point which I 
     <lb/>had hoped to reach before sitting down ; but 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">512</fw>
         
     I feel compelled to ask the indulgence of

     HON. MR. CAMPBELL—Before the 
     <lb/>
     House rises, I desire to submit a statement 
     <lb/>
     of the revenue of the Island of Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward, which has come into my hands since 
     <lb/>
     the close of the debate on the proposed union 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and the Lower Provinces. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Niagara seemed to take 
     <lb/>
     exception to what I said in relation to that 
     <lb/>
     particular point, and I am therefore happy 
     <lb/>
     to be able to satisfy the hon. member that 
     <lb/>
     what I then stated is fully sustained by the 
     <lb/>
     authentic return now before me. I hold in 
     <lb/>
     my hand a " Report of the Comptroller of 
     <lb/>
     Customs and Sundry Statistics " of that 
     <lb/>
     colony for the year 1863, which shows that 
     <lb/>
     the total revenue of the island for that year 
     <lb/>
     was £61,688 14s. 4d., island currency, equal 
     <lb/>
     to £41,125 16s. 3d., sterling, an increase 
     <lb/>
     over the previous year of nearly 35 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member seemed to think it impos<lb break="no"/>sible that such a sum as I had stated should 
     <lb/>
     have been raised, and suggested that a great 
     <lb/>
     part must have come from local sources. 
     <lb/>
    Well, the amount derived from excise and 
     <lb/>duties on imports for 1863 was £46,057 6s. 
     <lb/>7d., island currency, from the post office 
     <lb/>£1,590, and from custom house office fees, 
     <lb/>£71 9s. 9d. ; together £47,718 16s. 4d., 
     <lb/>island currency, or about £32,000, sterling, 
     <lb/>equal to $156,000 or thereabouts. There 
     <lb/>are a good many other items of revenue, but 
     <lb/>I have selected these three, as those certain 
     <lb/>to come into the treasury of the General 
     <lb/>Government, and there may be others. But 
     <lb/>it will be seen that these alone would make 
     <lb/>up the sum I gave as the revenue of the 
     <lb/>island, which would be available for the 
     <lb/>general purposes of the Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     HON. MR. CURRIE—I did not question 
     <lb/>
     the correctness of the figures of the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Commissioner of Crown Lands, but I felt 
     <lb/>
     and expressed some surprise at the sum, 
     <lb/>
     which, when compared with former years, 
     <lb/>
     exhibited, as I thought, an almost incredible 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     increase. Will the Honorable Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     state what proportion of these imports was 
     <lb/>
     foreign, and what came from the provinces it 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to unite, as after the union no 
     <lb/>
     revenue would of course be derived from the 
     <lb/>
     latter ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. CAMPBELL—There are ta<lb break="no"/>bles shewing the imports and exports, and 
     <lb/>
     the imports from the following places were 
     <lb/>
     in 1863 :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     United Kingdom ............ £122,880 5 6 1/2 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia ................ 66,890 11 5 1/2 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick ............. 19,975 3 11 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland .............. 1,865 15 3 
     <lb/>
     Bermuda and West Indies. . . . 3,969 5 7 
     <lb/>
     Saint Pierre ................ 292 11 3 
     <lb/>
     Canada .................... 6,152 8 3 
     <lb/>
     Magdalene ................. 302 3 0 
     <lb/>
     United States ............... 71,103 0 8 
     <lb/>
     Total, sterling ........ £293,431 4 11 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Taking from the above the imports from 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and Canada, amounting to £94,883 18s. 
     <lb/>
     10d., the balance of nearly £200,000 was 
     <lb/>
     all foreign, and such as would pay duty to 
     <lb/>
     the General Government. The exports were 
     <lb/>
     £209,472 9s. 6d, to which was to be added 
     <lb/>
     the value of 24,991 tons of shipping built in 
     <lb/>
     the island, which at £5 sterling per ton, was 
     <lb/>
     equal to £124,955, and raised the credit side 
     <lb/>
     of the sheet to £334,427 9s. 6d., against 
     <lb/>
     £293,431 4s 11d to the debit side, thus 
     <lb/>
     shewing a balance in favor of the colony in 
     <lb/>
     1863 of £40,996 4s. 7d. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The honorable member here handed the 
     <lb/>
     report to the Hon. Mr. CURRIE, who, after 
     <lb/>
     having examined it, seemed to concur in the 
     <lb/>
     statement of the Hon. Commissioner of 
     <lb/>
     Crown Lands.]

     the kindness of the House permitted me to

     resume my seat last evening, I was comparing 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional system of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy with the Constitution of the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States primarily, and with that of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain secondarily. I had gone over several 
     <lb/>
     leading points of comparison ; and it will he 
     <lb/>
