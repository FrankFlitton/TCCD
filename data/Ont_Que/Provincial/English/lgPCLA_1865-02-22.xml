     <p rendition="simple:centre">WEDNESDAY, <hi rendition="simple:italic">February</hi> 22, 1865.</p> 
 
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Before the debate 
     <lb/>
     is resumed, I would enquire whether it is 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of the Government to bring 
     <lb/>
     down the promised measure on the subject 
     <lb/>
     of education in Lower Canada, before the 
     <lb/>
     House is invited to pass finally the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation now under discussion ? I 
     <lb/>
     need not say to honorable gentlemen that 
     <lb/>
     this is a matter which is regarded with a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of interest by a very large portion 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Lower Canada, and I think 
     <lb/>
     that before my honorable friend for Montreal 
     <lb/>
     Centre (Hon. Mr. ROSE) proceeds to take 
     <lb/>
     part in this debate. the position of the 
     <lb/>
     Government upon that question should be 
     <lb/>
     clearly defined. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Al<lb break="no"/>though the question is not put regularly, 
     <lb/>
     I have no hesitation in answering the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman. My answer is the 
     <lb/>
     answer which has already been given by my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend the member for Sherbrooke 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. GALT). 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
       HON. MR. HOLTON—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Sherbrooke has not stated to the 
     <lb/>
     House— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Order! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I think I am quite 
     <lb/>
     in order, on the calling of the Orders of the 
     <lb/>
     Day, to put a question of this kind. But I 
     <lb/>
     rise again, simply to give notice to the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman that I shall renew the 
     <lb/>
     question on the Orders of the Day being 
     <lb/>
     called tomorrow evening. I do think it is 
     <lb/>
     dealing slightingly with the House and with 
     <lb/>
     the country for honorable gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     refuse to state explicitly what are their pur<lb break="no"/>poses with regard to this important question 
     <lb/>
     —whether or not their measure is to be 
     <lb/>
     brought down before a final vote is taken on 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. I shall renew the question 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—The ques<lb break="no"/>tion has been answered twice, but the 
     <lb/>
     Government are ready to answer it again, 
     <lb/>
     if the honorable gentleman so desires. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName> then resumed the 
     <lb/>
     adjourned debate. He said—Before I pro<lb break="no"/>ceed, Mr. SPEAKER, to offer any observations 
     <lb/>
     on the motion in your hand, I wish to 
     <lb/>
     acknowledge very cordially the consideration 
     <lb/>
     which the House evinced last evening during 
     <lb/>
     my absence, and especially to acknowledge 
     <lb/>
     the courtesy of my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Lambton (Mr. A. MACKENZIE), my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend from Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
       

     HOLTON), and my honorable friend the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brome (Mr. DUNKIN). I certainly 
     <lb/>
     feel indebted to them for the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which they yielded me precedence, at the 
     <lb/>
     request of the honorable member for Mont<lb break="no"/>morenci (Hon. Mr. CAUCHON) ; and I shall 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to shew my sense of the kindness 
     <lb/>
     of the House, by not trespassing on its indul<lb break="no"/>gence any longer than I can possibly help. 
     <lb/>
     And, before I offer any remarks on the 
     <lb/>
    tion itself, I would premise this, that I hope 
     <lb/>in the course of them I shall not give utter<lb break="no"/>ance to a single expression which would 
     <lb/>seem to reflect upon those who entertain 
     <lb/>strong opinions adverse to the proposition 
     <lb/>now before the House. Far be it from me 
     <lb/>to deprecate discussion—discussion of the 
     <lb/>amplest, widest, and most searching charac<lb break="no"/>ter, on this important question. And 
     <lb/>far be it from me, by the use of a single 
     <lb/>word, to impute to those honorable members, 
     <lb/>who feel it their duty to oppose this measure. 
     <lb/>any absence of patriotism. I believe they 
     <lb/>are actuated by the same ardent desire for 
     <lb/>the good of the country, which I claim for 
     <lb/>myself. (Hear, hear.) It is right that the 
     <lb/>question should be considered in all its 
     <lb/>details—not merely in its hearings on the 
     <lb/>present state of parties, but as respects its 
     <lb/>influence in all time to come on the country 
     <lb/>at large. And with that view I think it 
     <lb/>ought to be calmly, deliberately and patiently 
     <lb/>investigated, and instead of deprecating the 
     <lb/>fullest and most ample discussion, I trust 
     <lb/>the opportunity will be afforded to every 
     <lb/>honorable member of this House to speak on 
     <lb/>it in his own way and at his own time. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Well, sir, I presume there 
     <lb/>are few who, in the abstract, would not favour 
     <lb/>the idea of a union between a number of 
     <lb/>small states adjoining each other, rather 
     <lb/>than that they should remain isolated under 
     <lb/>separate governments. To the idea of union 
     <lb/>in the abstract between states so circum<lb break="no"/>stanced, I take it no one would be op osed. 
     <lb/>But the principal ground of the opposition 
     <lb/>which is made to the present scheme by a not 
     <lb/>unimportant class, is this—that the mere 
     <lb/>abstract principle of union does not apply 
     <lb/>with full force to colonies circumstanced as 
     <lb/>Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island, and Newfoundland—the five 
     <lb/>colonies that are parties to this scheme. It 
     <lb/>is feared by many that it is the first step 
     <lb/>towards independence—that it must tend to 
     <lb/>loosen the ties now existing between this and 
     <lb/>the mother country—that it changes our 
     <lb/>relations, and will produce a strength incom<lb break="no"/>

     patible with Imperial sovereignty—that it 
     <lb/>
     may probably result in not only severing our 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Mother Country, but in 
     <lb/>
     forcing us to a union with the neighbouring 
     <lb/>
     republic. That 1 have heard urged as the 
     <lb/>
     greatest and most important objection which 
     <lb/>
     strikes at the root of the proceedings of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference. I know that many of 
     <lb/>
     the opponents of the scheme entertain the 
     <lb/>
     apprehension—perhaps the conviction—that 
     <lb/>
     that will be the result. (Hear, hear.) Far 
     <lb/>
     from deprecating, then, the discusion of that 
     <lb/>
     question in its broadest aspect, I think all of 
     <lb/>
     us who desire to perpetuate our connection 
     <lb/>
     with England, should listen calmly and anx<lb break="no"/>iously to the objections which are urged by 
     <lb/>
     those who conscientiously entertain these 
     <lb/>
     opinions which are not only blameless, but 
     <lb/>
     entitled to respect. (Hear, hear.) Now, I 
     <lb/>
     do not deny that the effect of the present 
     <lb/>
     movement may be to change the character of 
     <lb/>
     the actual relations which subsist between 
     <lb/>
     this province and the Mother Country. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Hear! hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSE1">Hon. MR. ROSE</persName>- I do not deny that the 
     <lb/>result may be to change the character of 
     <lb/>these relations. But I maintain, and I hope 
     <lb/>1 shall be able to satisfy the House of the 
     <lb/>soundness of the position I take, that the 
     <lb/>change will be of that character, that, instead 
     <lb/>of loosening or weakening or diminishing the 
     <lb/>connection with the Mother Country, it will 
     <lb/>tend to put it on a footing which will make 
     <lb/>it stronger and more enduring. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Though I believe these relatibns will 
     <lb/>be somewhat changed, and we may have to 
     <lb/>consider what new aspect they will present, 
     <lb/>I believe this measure is forced upon us by 
     <lb/>the necessities of our position. The irre<lb break="no"/>sistible force of passing events will not allow 
     <lb/>us to stand still. But, whether by this 
     <lb/>inevitable change the country shall gradually 
     <lb/>lose its dependent or protected character and 
     <lb/>assume more of the Federal relation, consti<lb break="no"/>tuting this a territorial division of the Em<lb break="no"/>pire, I believe it will result in placing those 
     <lb/>relations on a surer and more steadfast foot<lb break="no"/>ing, and that we will still acknowledge the 
     <lb/>same Sovereign, owe the same fealty, and 
     <lb/>maintain the same veneration for the English 
     <lb/>Constitution and name. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>cannot be denied that there is a state of pub<lb break="no"/>lic opinion growing up in England just now 
     <lb/>—not confined, as it was a few years ago, to 
     <lb/>a class of extreme theorists—that the connec<lb break="no"/>tion which subsists between the colonies— 
     <lb/>Canada especially—and the Mother Country, 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
         

     is a source of expense and danger. It can<lb break="no"/>not be denied that that kind of opinion has 
     <lb/>
     obtained a good deal more force within the 
     <lb/>
     last few years, than those of us who desire to 
     <lb/>
     maintain the connection between these colo<lb break="no"/>nies and England would like that it should 
     <lb/>
     have obtained; and we cannot ignore the 
     <lb/>
     consequences which that increasing volume 
     <lb/>
     of public opinion may have upon the legisla<lb break="no"/>tion of England. Then there is another 
     <lb/>
     consideration which makes this subject stand 
     <lb/>
     out more prominently before the people of 
     <lb/>
     England at the present time than otherwise 
     <lb/>
     it would do, and that is, the state of its 
     <lb/>
     relations with the republic adjoining us, and 
     <lb/>
     the enormous military power which the 
     <lb/>
     United States have shewn, within the last 
     <lb/>
     two or three years, that they possess. In 
     <lb/>
     consequence of this, the state of opinion in 
     <lb/>
     England which might have been confined 
     <lb/>
     for many years perhaps to mere theory, has 
     <lb/>
     been brought to a head. It is not now 
     <lb/>
     merely a question of abstract opinion, whether 
     <lb/>
     under such and such circumstances it would 
     <lb/>
     be better for this and other colonies to assume 
     <lb/>
     a more independent attitude towards Eng<lb break="no"/>land. But it has been pressed with unex<lb break="no"/>pected abruptness to a practical issue before 
     <lb/>
     the people of England, and they have now 
     <lb/>
     to consider what the relations of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain to these colonies would be, in the 
     <lb/>
     event of war with the United States; how 
     <lb/>
     far, in that event, it would be possible to 
     <lb/>
     protect this remote dependency of the em<lb break="no"/>pire, to avoid disaster to the English flag, 
     <lb/>
     and at a distance of 3,000 miles to maintain 
     <lb/>
     the prowess of the English name. It is this 
     <lb/>
     which has forced public opinion so strongly 
     <lb/>
     in England to a consideration of the actual 
     <lb/>
     relations between this country and the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, and it is this state of facts with 
     <lb/>
     which we must deal now. It is, I repeat, 
     <lb/>
     past discussing as a mere abstract matter of 
     <lb/>
     doctrine. We must look our situation in 
     <lb/>
     the face. We must consider the eventual<lb break="no"/>ities which press themselves on our notice, 
     <lb/>
     and it is our bounden duty to see whether 
     <lb/>
     we cannot find in the union of these colonies 
     <lb/>
     security to ourselves and a source of strength 
     <lb/>
     to the Empire at large. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     With respect, then, to the objections urged 
     <lb/>
     by those who consider that this scheme may 
     <lb/>
     be leading us along a new and untrodden 
     <lb/>
     path towards independence, or at least to a 
     <lb/>
     more independent relation with reference to 
     <lb/>
     England than that in which we now stand 
     <lb/>
     towards her, I say we cannot forget that our 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="396" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0396.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">396</fw>
         

     surroundings are of a peculiar kind. I 
     <lb/>
     would grant that there would be much force 
     <lb/>
     in the argument that it might sever our ties 
     <lb/>
     with England, if we were circumstanced as 
     <lb/>
     some of the smaller states of Europe—if we 
     <lb/>
     had, for example, a state like Switzerland on 
     <lb/>
     the one side and any of the German Princi<lb break="no"/>palities on the other. If we had, as our 
     <lb/>
     neighbours, states like Belgium or Den<lb break="no"/>mark—if, so situated, we were one of a num<lb break="no"/>ber of small states, I grant you that, if a union 
     <lb/>
     of all these provinces were to take place, it 
     <lb/>
     might lead possibly to that independence 
     <lb/>
     which those who oppose the scheme now fear, 
     <lb/>
     and which for one, I hope from my heart, 
     <lb/>
     may never occur. (Hear, hear.) No 
     <lb/>
     doubt, if situated in that way—if we had no 
     <lb/>
     powerful and over-awing neighbor, such a 
     <lb/>
     political combination as we now propose 
     <lb/>
     might lead to practical independence. of 
     <lb/>
     England. If we were a mere congeries of 
     <lb/>
     small states, with no powerful neighbor, that 
     <lb/>
     result which we so much deprecate might 
     <lb/>
     possibly follow. We should, probably, in 
     <lb/>
     time aspire to have foreign relations of our 
     <lb/>
     own, to have our own army and navy, and to 
     <lb/>
     seek for that complete emancipation which 
     <lb/>
     with communities as with individuals, matu<lb break="no"/>rity prompts. But independence in a state 
     <lb/>
     must always be relative, and none of us can 
     <lb/>
     expect to live to see the day when the British 
     <lb/>
     dominions in this part of the world will be 
     <lb/>
     peopled to such an extent, and become so 
     <lb/>
     powerful, that they can afford to be indepen<lb break="no"/>dent of England. We must, from the 
     <lb/>
     necessities of our geographical position—so 
     <lb/>
     long as the United States continue to be as 
     <lb/>
     powerful as they are ; and even if they were 
     <lb/>
     divided into two or three portions—we must 
     <lb/>
     always find in them a source of danger 
     <lb/>
     which must force upon us a dependence on 
     <lb/>
     England. We find, I repeat, in our position 
     <lb/>
     towards the United States, and in the great 
     <lb/>
     preponderating power they possess, a 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that we need not apprehend that 
     <lb/>
     there will be anything like practical 
     <lb/>
     independence of England asserted by the 
     <lb/>
     colonies of North America ; because, from 
     <lb/>
     the very necessities of our position, we shall 
     <lb/>
     always have to look up to her for protection 
     <lb/>
     and aid. I say nothing of the sentiment of 
     <lb/>
     loyalty, of that attachment to the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown, that love for the person of the 
     <lb/>
     Sovereign which we all possess so strongly 
     <lb/>
     and try to instill into our children. I do 
     <lb/>
     not speak for the moment of the pride we all 
     <lb/>
     have in the constitution of England, and in  
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     our being identified, in all our associations 
     <lb/>
     and feelings, with the glory of the English 
     <lb/>
     name. I put aside, for the moment, the 
     <lb/>
     instinct of attachment to the Mother Country, 
     <lb/>
     and I put the case on this ground alone, 
     <lb/>
     that the necessity of self-preservation will 
     <lb/>
     for centuries—for generations at all events— 
     <lb/>
     prevent the possibility of these colonies 
     <lb/>
     asserting their independence of England, 
     <lb/>
     unless it were, indeed, to become a portion 
     <lb/>
     of the republic which adjoins us, and to 
     <lb/>
     which, I think, it is neither the interest nor 
     <lb/>
     the inclination of any member of this House 
     <lb/>
     to become united. (Hear, hear.) What<lb break="no"/>ever fate may be in store for us, that is a 
     <lb/>
     destiny to which no one looks with favor. 
     <lb/>
     The genius and instincts of our people are 
     <lb/>
     monarchical and conservative—theirs level<lb break="no"/>ling and democratic. But, sir, though I 
     <lb/>
     have said that I was disposed to look upon 
     <lb/>
     this question—the danger of Federation 
     <lb/>
     rendering us independent of England, quite 
     <lb/>
     apart from the considerations that spring out 
     <lb/>
     of sentiments of loyalty, yet I believe that 
     <lb/>
     those attachments will be increased tenfold 
     <lb/>
     by this proposed union. We will have a 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of nationality among ourselves ; 
     <lb/>
     and I consider it to be one of the first duties 
     <lb/>
     of a statesman to inculcate that national 
     <lb/>
     feeling that gives the people a strong interest 
     <lb/>
     in their country's welfare. We will feel that 
     <lb/>
     we have something here, in the way of 
     <lb/>
     constitutional blessings due to our union 
     <lb/>
     with England, and that we have stable 
     <lb/>
     material interests which we can transmit to 
     <lb/>
     our posterity. We shall feel very differently 
     <lb/>
     from what we now do as colonists, apart and 
     <lb/>
     alienated from each other, and in some 
     <lb/>
     respects jealous of one another. With a 
     <lb/>
     stable government and a strong central power 
     <lb/>
     controlling an immense territory, we shall be 
     <lb/>
     able to enter upon a well considered, well 
     <lb/>
     devised and attractive system of immigration. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We will be enabled shortly, 
     <lb/>
    I trust, to commence to bring from the 
     <lb/>Mother Country a constant stream of immigra<lb break="no"/>tion by which those sentiments of attachment 
     <lb/>to home and devotion to the Crown will be 
     <lb/>perpetuated. And in this continuous 
     <lb/>recruiting of our population I see one of 
     <lb/>the great elements we will have to look to 
     <lb/>for the perpetuation of the attachment of 
     <lb/>this country to the Crown. We have not, 
     <lb/>in time past, been able to devise or carry 
     <lb/>out any extensive system of immigration. 
     <lb/>We could not, in our divided and isolated 
     <lb/>condition, offer those attractions which we 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="397" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0397.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">397</fw>
          

     will be enabled to offer to emigrants when 
     <lb/>
     we can throw open to them the choice of a 
     <lb/>
     large country, a country which will have a 
     <lb/>
     name and a nationality—a country in which 
     <lb/>
     they and we can all feel an honest pride. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) They will not feel as we have 
     <lb/>
     hitherto done, doubtful how long our system 
     <lb/>
     of constitutional government, and the bless<lb break="no"/>ings flowing from it, were to last. I trust, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that the formation of a stable 
     <lb/>
     government, and the devising of a system 
     <lb/>
     of emigration that will be attractive to the 
     <lb/>
     people of England, Ireland and Scotland, 
     <lb/>
     will do a vast deal to keep up that constant 
     <lb/>
     attachment to the Mother County which we 
     <lb/>
     all desire to see strengthened. (H ear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We shall then not only have the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     motive to present to emigrants, of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     interest—the opportunity to make money 
     <lb/>
     merely, but the other interest of attachment 
     <lb/>
     in a permanent way, to the soil, without a 
     <lb/>
     desire to go back to the Mother Country after 
     <lb/>
     a competence shall have been gained—for 
     <lb/>
     the sentiment of nationality will soon take 
     <lb/>
     root among us. Now, sir, I think that so 
     <lb/>
     far as the danger of union leading to 
     <lb/>
     independence is concerned, those who are 
     <lb/>
     most earnest in desiring to perpetuate the 
     <lb/>
     union, need not have much apprehension. 
     <lb/>
     But, it may be said, that from the necessity 
     <lb/>
     of our position there is danger that we shall 
     <lb/>
     feel our material and commercial interests 
     <lb/>
     so strongly bound up with the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and feel so reliant in our own strength as a 
     <lb/>
     great country, that we will eventually form a 
     <lb/>
     closer alliance with that republic than any 
     <lb/>
     of us desire, and that the formation of the 
     <lb/>
     present union is the first step towards 
     <lb/>
     annexation. I do not think we need have 
     <lb/>
     any tears on that score. I do not think our 
     <lb/>
     interests would lead us in that direction. At 
     <lb/>
     the present time we are almost entirely 
     <lb/>
     dependent upon the United States commer<lb break="no"/>cially. We are dependent upon them for 
     <lb/>
     an outlet to the ocean during the winter 
     <lb/>
     months. If they choose to suspend the 
     <lb/>
     bonding system, or by a system of consular 
     <lb/>
     certificates make it practically useless ; if 
     <lb/>
     they abolish the reciprocity treaty, and 
     <lb/>
     carry the passport system to a greater degree 
     <lb/>
     of stringency, we should feel our dependence 
     <lb/>
     upon that country even in a greater and 
     <lb/>
     much more practical way than we do at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. And perhaps, sir, it is worth 
     <lb/>
     our while to consider whether this may not 
     <lb/>
     be the real motive which dictates the policy 
     <lb/>
     they are now pursuing! (Hear, hear.) But, 
     <lb/>
     give us this Intercolonial Railway, affording 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>


     us communication with Halifax and St 
     <lb/>
     John at all seasons of the year, and we 
     <lb/>
     shall be independent of the United States 
     <lb/>
     commercially as we now are politically. We 
     <lb/>
     may not find this route to the ocean more 
     <lb/>
     economical, especially in the winter season, 
     <lb/>
     than to go through the United States, but if 
     <lb/>
     we have a route of our own to which we may 
     <lb/>
     resort, in case of necessity, our neighbors 
     <lb/>
     will find it to their interest to give us the 
     <lb/>
     use of their channels of communication at 
     <lb/>
     a cheaper rate. (Hear, hear.) They will 
     <lb/>
     not do that if they find we have no other 
     <lb/>
     outlet ; but if we are prepared with an open<lb break="no"/>ing for our produce, all the year round, they 
     <lb/>
     will not act so foolishly as to deprive them<lb break="no"/>selves of the opportunity of carrying our 
     <lb/>
     goods through their territory. It we had  
     <lb/>
     this railway built, we should have no need 
     <lb/>
    to fear the withdrawal of the bonding system, 
     <lb/>or the continuance of the passport system, 
     <lb/>because they would be inflicting upon them<lb break="no"/>selves a greater injury by so doing than upon 
     <lb/>us. Let me say then once more that I can 
     <lb/>perceive no one element of danger to us in 
     <lb/>this union. I certainly did try, during the 
     <lb/>many months in which the process of incuba<lb break="no"/>tion of Federation, if I may so speak, was 
     <lb/>going on—I certainly did try to bring as 
     <lb/>unprejudiced and dispassionatc a considera<lb break="no"/>tion to its various phases as I possibly could. 
     <lb/>I looked upon it, I confess, with suspicion at 
     <lb/>the outset; I felt it was launching us into 
     <lb/>an unknown future, and that we were 
     <lb/>changing a system, that we got along with 
     <lb/>in comparatively a satisfactory manner, for 
     <lb/>one that was, in some of its aspects, new 
     <lb/>under the British Constitution. I say now, 
     <lb/>however, after giving to it the fullest consid<lb break="no"/>eration I am capable of giving, that I do not 
     <lb/>see, in any one respect, how the cementing 
     <lb/>of these colonies together in the bonds of 
     <lb/>government can tend to make us independent 
     <lb/>of Great Britain If I did, I should feel it 
     <lb/>my duty to offer it a most uncompromising 
     <lb/>opposition, and to endeavor to defeat it by 
     <lb/>every means in my power. But, sir, I do see 
     <lb/>a great danger the other way. I see that if 
     <lb/>we remain a mere congeries of isolated colo<lb break="no"/>nies, hostile in some degree to each others' 
     <lb/>interests, there is danger ahead. I see 
     <lb/>that danger existing and threatening us in 
     <lb/>the United States. I see that if we do not 
     <lb/>unite and form one Central Government, 
     <lb/>giving it the power to direct all the physical 
     <lb/>energies of this country in whatever direc<lb break="no"/>tion may be necessary, that we are liable to 
     <lb/>be overrun by that power. And this I con<lb break="no"/>

ceive to be one of the very strongest argu<lb break="no"/>ments in favor of the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, that it enables us to prepare 
     <lb/>
     appropriate defences along the whole frontier 
     <lb/>
     of our country. I believe I shall be able to 
     <lb/>
     show in a very few words, that if we are 
     <lb/>
     united, we shall afford to England sufficient 
     <lb/>
     inducements for undertaking those works of 
     <lb/>
     defence that are essential to our own security 
     <lb/>
     and to the maintenance of her flag on this 
     <lb/>
     continent for all time to come, and that if 
     <lb/>
     we do go into this union, as I believe we will 
     <lb/>
     we shall be placed in a position to defend our<lb break="no"/>selves snccessfully from attack. And this, 
     <lb/>
     sir, unfortunately, is not a contingency 
     <lb/>
     which we can hope will never occur. his 
     <lb/>
     not now a more vague possibility in a far 
     <lb/>
     distant future which we have to consider. 
     <lb/>
     So long as the present civil war continues, 
     <lb/>
     it is impossible for any man to foresee that 
     <lb/>
     such national complications will not arise as 
     <lb/>
     may at any day or hour involve us in 
     <lb/>
     actual hostilities. It is impossible for any 
     <lb/>
     prudent man to disregard that dark threat<lb break="no"/>ening cloud that has been gathering upon 
     <lb/>
     our borders, ready at almost any moment to 
     <lb/>
     burst upon us. It behoves us therefore to 
     <lb/>
     lose no time, if we believe that union offers 
     <lb/>
     a guarantee of safety against the dangers that 
     <lb/>
     threaten us—it becomes important that we 
     <lb/>
     lose no time to consummate the proposed 
     <lb/>
     union, in order that the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment may put us at once in a preper state of 
     <lb/>
     defence. The public opinion of England, 
     <lb/>
     as we unhappily know, does not at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time tend very much to warrant the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government in making any large 
     <lb/>
     expenditure for colonial purposes. There 
     <lb/>
     must be some reasonable prospect, that if 
     <lb/>
     expenditure is incurred in erecting necessary 
     <lb/>
     works of defence, those works will be actually 
     <lb/>
     available, when constructed, to protect the 
     <lb/>
     country upon whose frontier they are estab<lb break="no"/>lished. We cannot expect England to enter 
     <lb/>
     upon a course of expenditure for fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions on our frontier, unless she has the assu<lb break="no"/>rance of our ability with her aid to hold those 
     <lb/>
     works against attacks from a hostile power. 
     <lb/>
     I believe that if the proposed plan of union 
     <lb/>
     breaks down—fails to get the assent of the 
     <lb/>
     several provinces—and we go back to our 
     <lb/>
     old condition of separate colonies, we shall 
     <lb/>
     so discourage the statesmen of England in 
     <lb/>
     reference to us, that they will feel very much 
     <lb/>
     embarrassed with the prospect before them.

     formation of a government, having the power

     to direct the whole strength of five colonies 
     <lb/>
     would greatly add to our security. Who

     think the advantages of union for purposes

     another for Ireland, and another for Scot<lb break="no"/>land ; each directing its owns military and

     naval power ? If one national government 
     <lb/>
     had not called forth all the national materials

     and elements of strength, would the prowess 
     <lb/>
     of her fleet or of her armies have been what

     it is ? Is there no benefit in having a power

     that can bring to bear the whole military

     strength at any point desired ? If there is

     given to this proposition of Federation (and 
     <lb/>
     her statesmen see in this a great source of 
     <lb/>
     strength in enabling her to avert a war, and 
     <lb/>
     a ready means of defending the country)— 
     <lb/>
     do you believe that those statesmen will look 
     <lb/>
     kindly upon the act? Even my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from Hochelaga has admitted that 
     <lb/>
     there must be in that case a dissolution of 
     <lb/>
     the union between Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     That honorable gentleman stated in his 
     <lb/>
     speech the other night, that if this measure 
     <lb/>
     failed there must be Federation between the 
     <lb/>
     Canadas ; and what, I would ask, is that but 
     <lb/>
     a dissolution of the present union ? It is 
     <lb/>
     certainly a dissolution of the present union 
     <lb/>
     to adapt some new Federative system as be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada. But does 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman think that he will 
     <lb/>
     find in the separation of these provinces an 
     <lb/>
     element of strength ?

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—That is what you 
     <lb/>to do now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—No, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>do not propose to do anything of the kind, 
     <lb/>as my honorable friend will acknowledge, if 
     <lb/>he will but bring his mind, dispassionately 
     <lb/>and earnestly, to the consideration of the 
     <lb/>question. There is no one more capable of 
     <lb/>seeing and appreciating the important fea<lb break="no"/>tures of this scheme than he. But my hon. 
     <lb/>friend has strong feelings, and sometimes is 
     <lb/>led away by preconceived jealousies or fears; 
     <lb/>I say that if my honorable friend will bring 
     <lb/>his strong intellect to bear on this scheme, 
     <lb/>he will find in it none of those dangers 
     <lb/>which ordinarily attach to the Federal form 
     <lb/>of government. I must now say a few more 
     <lb/>words in reference to the question of our 
     <lb/>ability to provide for the defences of the 
     <lb/>country. I have already stated—and I 
     <lb/>must apologise to the House for the digres<lb break="no"/>sion which has been forced upon me—that 
     <lb/>I do not believe that, if we reverted back to 
     <lb/>our original condition, the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would be as much disposed to aid us 
     <lb/>in the construction of the works necessary 
     <lb/>for our defence, as if they found that in the 
     <lb/>presence of a common danger we were united 
     <lb/>together to repel the common enemy. I say 
     <lb/>the Imperial Government would not in such 
     <lb/>a case be actuated simply by a regard to 
     <lb/>the expense of constructing these works—in 
     <lb/>which I understand the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>will have to bear a share—but she would be 
     <lb/>deterred from so doing by the further con<lb break="no"/>sideration, that when built, these works 
     <lb/>would be less likely to serve the purpose 
     <lb/>they were designed to accomplish, namely, 
     <lb/>
           

    <cb/>
         

     to enable the country to be efficiently de<lb break="no"/>fended. It is one thing to have a population 
     <lb/>
     of four millions united under one common 
     <lb/>
     head, and enabled to direct all their ener<lb break="no"/>gies to the point of danger ; and it is another 
     <lb/>
     thing to have a number of separate units, 
     <lb/>
     with no common action—each under a 
     <lb/>
     different government, and distracted and 
     <lb/>
     separate at the very time when they ought 
     <lb/>
     to be most united. (Hear, hear.) What 
     <lb/>
     we have to guard against is this : a sudden 
     <lb/>
     conquest or surprise, for which we might be 
     <lb/>
     unprepared. I believe myself that, if works 
     <lb/>
     can be constructed, by means of which we 
     <lb/>
     can effectually defend the country against 
     <lb/>
     sudden attack, no one will grudge the ex<lb break="no"/>pense. Of course they will cost no incon<lb break="no"/>siderable sum ; but I hope, as I believe my 
     <lb/>
    hon. friend the Finance Minister, although 
     <lb/>he may be pressed for other purposes, will 
     <lb/>not hesitate to recommend the appropriation 
     <lb/>necessary for the purpose, and to impose 
     <lb/>increased taxation for that purpose. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) For I am sure that no member of 
     <lb/>this house, nor man in this country , would 
     <lb/>hesitate, if need were, to put their hands in 
     <lb/>their pockets and give a tenth of their sub<lb break="no"/>stance for the construction of the works re<lb break="no"/>quired to protect the country from the rav<lb break="no"/>ages of the aggressor, and to secure to 
     <lb/>ourselves a perpetuation of the inestimable 
     <lb/>blessings derived from our living under the 
     <lb/>British flag. (Hear, hear.) I am the more 
     <lb/>earnest in this question on account of the 
     <lb/>observations which have been made by my 
     <lb/>honorable friend the member for Hochelaga, 
     <lb/>(Hon. Mr. DORION) observations which I 
     <lb/>am sure he did not mean to have such an 
     <lb/>effect, but which nevertheless have a most 
     <lb/>mischievous tendency. That hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>stated that our true policy was, in fact, neu<lb break="no"/>trality ; that it was hopeless for us to attempt 
     <lb/>to defend ourselves against the overwhelming 
     <lb/>force which the United States could bring to 
     <lb/>bear against us, and that with our small 
     <lb/>population we would be very much in the 
     <lb/>same position as Denmark when opposed to 
     <lb/>the armies of Austria and Prussia. Indeed, 
     <lb/>he almost went as far as a gentleman who no 
     <lb/>longer holds a seat in this House, when he 
     <lb/>said that " the best armament for Canada 
     <lb/>was no armament at all." I am sure that 
     <lb/>had the honorable gentleman felt that any 
     <lb/>injury would he done—any false impression 
     <lb/>produced on the public mind—by the use of 
     <lb/>observations like these, he would not have 
     <lb/>employed them at all. But I may say that 
     <lb/>they all tended to this end—the taking  away 
     <lb/>

     of that - confidence we should have in our 
     <lb/>
     energy and resources, by telling us that the 
     <lb/>
     prospect before us is practically a hopeless 
     <lb/>
     one—that there is no use undertaking public 
     <lb/>
     works for our defence—no use in organizing, 
     <lb/>
     training, and arming our militia—that all 
     <lb/>
     attempts to hold our own would be fruitless 
     <lb/>
     on account of our inability to bring sufficient 
     <lb/>
     able-bodied men in the field to cope with the 
     <lb/>
     force to which we might be opposed. Why, 
     <lb/>
     sir, is it by such a tone as that, that you can 
     <lb/>
     keep up the spirit of the people for the 
     <lb/>
     defence of the country, by telling us that 
     <lb/>
     four millions of British subjects could offer 
     <lb/>
     no resistance whatever, even when backed 
     <lb/>
     by the power of England, against the United 
     <lb/>
     States or the greatest military nation on 
     <lb/>
     earth ? I assert that even were we to be put 
     <lb/>
     in the unfortunate position ot Denmark, 
     <lb/>
     ninety-nine out of every hundred of our 
     <lb/>
     population would be prepared to make a 
     <lb/>
     stand, hopeless though it might be far them, 
     <lb/>
     and to resist until the last foot of ground 
     <lb/>
     was wrested from us. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     if England, in case of war, should, for the 
     <lb/>
     first time in her history, decline to come to 
     <lb/>
     the aid of her colonies, future generations 
     <lb/>
     would not glory in the name of being English<lb break="no"/>men, as the past had such just reason to do. 
     <lb/>
     Sure I am, however, that we should occupy 
     <lb/>
     no hopeless or isolated position. It is in 
     <lb/>
     order that the observations of my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend the member for Hochelaga may in 
     <lb/>
     some respect be counteracted, that I would 
     <lb/>
    yet trespass upon the indulgence of the 
     <lb/>House for a few minutes more on this head. 
     <lb/>We know that in modern warfare, if you 
     <lb/>can erect certain works which will compel 
     <lb/>an enemy to sit down before them, so as to 
     <lb/>prevent him from making progress into the 
     <lb/>country, you may by such means defend it 
     <lb/>for many months. I do not know what the 
     <lb/>scheme of the defence commissioners may 
     <lb/>be. But it is well known that they express 
     <lb/>the conviction that by the construction of 
     <lb/>certain works at various points, the manning 
     <lb/>of which is quite within the compass of our 
     <lb/>power, we can arrest the progress of an 
     <lb/>invader for many months, we can compel 
     <lb/>him to expend and exhaust his strength 
     <lb/>before these works, and we could throw 
     <lb/>embarrassments in his way such as would 
     <lb/>take an invading force many months to over<lb break="no"/>come. Because honorable members must 
     <lb/>remember that it is impossible to have more 
     <lb/>than a six months' campaign in this country. 
     <lb/>And supposing you were to erect works 
     <lb/>
      


    
            <cb/>
        

     before which an enemy was compelled to sit 
     <lb/>
     down in the month of May, it would take 
     <lb/>
     him fully three months before he could 
     <lb/>
     bring up his supplies and siege train and 
     <lb/>
     protect his communications, and by the time 
     <lb/>
     he was ready to make a determined attack, 
     <lb/>
     he would be overtaken by winter, be com<lb break="no"/>pelled to raise the siege and go into winter 
     <lb/>
     quarters. In truth our winters are our 
     <lb/>
     safeguard and defence. Such, at any rate, 
     <lb/>
     is the opinion of military men. During six 
     <lb/>
     months only are military operations practi<lb break="no"/>cable in this country, and thus whatever is 
     <lb/>
     done one season has to be abandoned on the 
     <lb/>
     approach of winter and begun again the 
     <lb/>
     following spring. If therefore we can only, 
     <lb/>
     by manning certain salient points in the 
     <lb/>
     country, prevent the progress of invasion, we 
     <lb/>
     are safe. Sudden conquest would be impos<lb break="no"/>sible—delay and impediments are everything. 
     <lb/>
     Every one knows the history of the celebra<lb break="no"/>ted lines of Torres Vedras, which extended 
     <lb/>
     thirty miles, and by means of which the 
     <lb/>
     invasion with which Napoleon terrified Eu<lb break="no"/>rope was first rolled back. These lines 
     <lb/>
     were defended by but a small number of 
     <lb/>
     men, and they compelled Napoleon to retire 
     <lb/>
     before them. Then, on this continent we have 
     <lb/>
     the experience of Richmond, which has 
     <lb/>
     forced the army of General Grant to become 
     <lb/>
     a mere corps of observation, and of Charles<lb break="no"/>ton which has fallen at last, but after what 
     <lb/>
     delay and at what cost ! Going to the 
     <lb/>
     Crimea, we see Sebastopol defying for 
     <lb/>
     months and months the joint efforts of Eng<lb break="no"/>land and France. If we therefore can keep 
     <lb/>
     the invader from our doors for a certain 
     <lb/>
     number of months, our Canadian winter will 
     <lb/>
     do the rest, whilst English ships would be 
     <lb/>
     engaged in harassing their coasts and in the 
     <lb/>
     destruction of American commerce in every 
     <lb/>
     sea. I, therefore, entreat those who are dis<lb break="no"/>posed to take a desponding view of the 
     <lb/>
     question to consider these things. An ag<lb break="no"/>gressive warfare in this country is one thing, 
     <lb/>
     and a defensive warfare another, and a very 
     <lb/>
     different. (Hear, hear.) Our country is 
     <lb/>
     well adapted for defensive purposes, and it 
     <lb/>
     is next to impossible to subdue us. The 
     <lb/>
     badness of our roads, the difficulties presented 
     <lb/>
     by our winters, our deep, broad and unford<lb break="no"/>able rivers, and the means we could establish 
     <lb/>
     for keeping an enemy in check at certain 
     <lb/>
     points for the necessary time, would enable 
     <lb/>
     us to resist the United States with all their 
     <lb/>
     power and resources. No man can have a 
     <lb/>
    greater appreciation of the enormous re<lb break="no"/>

sources, of the courage , of the varied a appli<lb break="no"/>ances, of everything in fact which tends to 
     <lb/>
     success in war than I have of the American 
     <lb/>
     nation. I have seen them in the field, and 
     <lb/>
     seen them at sea. They certainly have come 
     <lb/>
     out as amilitary nation in such a way as 
     <lb/>
     almost to astonish the world. But, sir, let 
     <lb/>
     us consider a little more closely what their 
     <lb/>
     circumstances are in other respects. No 
     <lb/>
     doubt they have an enormous navy, but that 
     <lb/>
     very navy would not be more than sufficient 
     <lb/>
     to defend their harbors in case of a war with 
     <lb/>
     England. It is not because I imagine their 
     <lb/>
     ships could not cope singly with British 
     <lb/>
     ships—it is not because I believe their men 
     <lb/>
     are lacking in skill or courage, or that they 
     <lb/>
     are unable to build sufficient vessels—but 
     <lb/>
     they lack this—and it is a consideration 
     <lb/>
     which we cannot and ought not to forget— 
     <lb/>
     that they have not a single harbor in any 
     <lb/>
     sea, except on their own coast, to refit their 
     <lb/>
     vessels. (Hear, hear.) Supposing them to 
     <lb/>
     send a fleet of 20 or 30 ships to England.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—If they went to Ire<lb break="no"/>land, they would have a very warm reception 
     <lb/>
     indeed. (Hear, hear.) No doubt they could 
     <lb/>
     get there with the coal they could carry; 
     <lb/>
     but where would they get the coal to bring 
     <lb/>
     them back or to carry on operations there? 
     <lb/>
     Sailing vessels now-a-days can do nothing; 
     <lb/>
     all vessels of war have to be prepelled by 
     <lb/>
     steam; and there is no neutral port in the 
     <lb/>
     world where in time of war with England, 
     <lb/>
     the navy of the United States would be able 
     <lb/>
     to obtain assistance. For I take it for grant<lb break="no"/>ed that in the event of a war with England 
     <lb/>
     the United States would have few allies. 
     <lb/>
     And, as I before remarked, there is not a port 
     <lb/>
     in the world where they could get an ounce of 
     <lb/>
     coal or any addition to their armament. In this 
     <lb/>
     would consist our great safety. They have 
     <lb/>
     no ports in the Indian Sea, in the east Atlan<lb break="no"/>tic, the Mediterranean or China seas, and it is 
     <lb/>
     simply because men of war could not exist 
     <lb/>
     without coaling and refitting that the navy 
     <lb/>
     of the United States would be placed at so 
     <lb/>
     great disadvantage. It is contrary to interna<lb break="no"/>tional law, as the House is well aware, that 
     <lb/>
     the ships of a belligerent nation can be 
     <lb/>
     received in a neutral port and assisted, 
     <lb/>
     beyond what is required by the dictates 
     <lb/>
     of humanity, to enable them to face 
     <lb/>
     the elements. They would be unable, I say, 
     <lb/>
     to get a single man, a ton of coal, an 
     <lb/>
     ounce of gunpowder, or a pound of iron, in 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
       

     any neutral port, and I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     what the United States could do in a war 
     <lb/>
     with England so circumstanced? (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Well, air, this is one state of things. 
     <lb/>
     But there is yet another view to be taken of 
     <lb/>
     the question. Do we not know that in the 
     <lb/>
     event supposed, we should fled the Atlantic 
     <lb/>
     coast swarming with English vessels carrying 
     <lb/>
     m'oveable columns of troops, menacing and 
     <lb/>
     landing at every point. The navy of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, the arsenals of England, the purse of 
     <lb/>
     England, and all the appliances and require<lb break="no"/>ments of war would be brought to bear upon 
     <lb/>
     and be available to us in such a struggle. We 
     <lb/>
     should not suffer from the lack of the material 
     <lb/>
     of war, which is perhaps the ver thing of all 
     <lb/>
     other things the most essential. In all respects 
     <lb/>
     we should be in a very different position from 
     <lb/>
     the Confederate States at the present day. 
     <lb/>
     We should simply be required to hold our 
     <lb/>
     own, while the United States were being 
     <lb/>
     harassed on the seaboard, and then when 
     <lb/>
     the winter came we should be compara<lb break="no"/>tively safe. Think of the exhaustion to 
     <lb/>
     the United States of such a war! I have 
     <lb/>
     ventured to say thus much with a view 
     <lb/>
     of counteracting, so far as my feeble 
     <lb/>
     observations will enable me to do, the 
     <lb/>
     remarks of the hon. member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga the other night, because I think it 
     <lb/>
     was a most pernicious, unmanly, and un<lb break="no"/>patriotic view of the case to he allowed to 
     <lb/>
     be disseminated, when we ought to do all 
     <lb/>
     we can to encourage and evoke a military 
     <lb/>
     spirit on the part of the youth of this 
     <lb/>
     country. Neutrality has been spoken of. 
     <lb/>
     But how could neutrality be possible in a 
     <lb/>
     struggle between England and the United 
     <lb/>
     States? The country which cannot put 
     <lb/>
     forth an effort to defend itself occup'es a 
     <lb/>
     despicable position, and ti rfeits on the score 
     <lb/>
     ot' weakness, even the wretched privilege 
     <lb/>
     of being neutral. How is it possible, I 
     <lb/>
     again ask, that we could maintain a neutral 
     <lb/>
     position in such a war? We could not. 
     <lb/>
     We should have to make common cause 
     <lb/>
     with one or the other. Do you suppose 
     <lb/>
     the United States would allow us to stand 
     <lb/>
     aside?

     <lb/>and if it was on that consideration alone, I 
     <lb/>say that I find in this question of defence 
     <lb/>sufficient not only to justify me in voting 
     <lb/>for the scheme now before the House, but to 
     <lb/>demand of me every effort to carry it into 
     <lb/>effect. (Hear, hear.) If we show that we 
     <lb/>are in earnest on this question of defence, 
     <lb/>England will be encouraged to come to our 
     <lb/>assistance in time of danger, knowing that 
     <lb/>she can look to us not only to contribute 
     <lb/>towards the construction of works, but effec<lb break="no"/>tually to defend them. when constructed. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) If we show England that 
     <lb/>she can depend on a population of four mil<lb break="no"/>lions, with a strength wielded from a com<lb break="no"/>mon centre, she will be encouraged to aid-us 
     <lb/>with both men and material of war, and will 
     <lb/>lend us the assistance necessary to protect 
     <lb/>ourselves both now and in time to come. 
     <lb/>Let me repeat then, sir, that were there 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        

     nothing in addition to the great considera<lb break="no"/>tions to which I have adverted, I should go 
     <lb/>heartily for these resolutions, and I should 
     <lb/>be disposed to overlook many inequalities 
     <lb/>and some objectionable features which I see in 
     <lb/>the scheme. I do not intend to advert in 
     <lb/>detail to these, for I feel that I have to con<lb break="no"/>sider this question as a whole, and that 
     <lb/>unless I see objections to it, so great and 
     <lb/>numerous as to make me vote against it as a 
     <lb/>whole, it is useless to criticise that which I 
     <lb/>cannot mend. The scheme is in the nature 
     <lb/>of a treaty. It will not do to cavil at this 
     <lb/>or at that; we must either accept it or 
     <lb/>reject it. (Hear, hear.) I see the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties of the scheme, and the inequalities of 
     <lb/>it; but we must not complain if one colony 
     <lb/>gets a few thousand dollars more than 
     <lb/>another, or if one colony has to assume more 
     <lb/>of the debt than another. Unless I saw 
     <lb/>enough in the whole scheme to make me 
     <lb/>vote against it, I think it would be a mere 
     <lb/>waste of time to cavil at these small matters. 
     <lb/>Because without the consent of all the other 
     <lb/>colonies they cannot be altered, and on the 
     <lb/>whole there is no reason why the whole 
     <lb/>scheme should be rejected, and these slight 
     <lb/>inequalities will soon right themselves. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) There is one thing I would 
     <lb/>ask the House to consider —apart from the 
     <lb/>higher consideration of defence; apart from 
     <lb/>the cementing of our union with England, 
     <lb/>which I believe is involved in the adoption 
     <lb/>of this measure, and apart from the chance 
     <lb/>of our falling a prey to the United States— 
     <lb/>and it is this: are we prepared, looking at 
     <lb/>Canada alone, to go back to the old state 
     <lb/>of things of twelve or eighteen months ago ? 
     <lb/>Are we willing to revert to the chronic state 
     <lb/>of crisis in which we constantly found our<lb break="no"/>selves for years past? (Hear, hear.) This 
     <lb/>House and the whole Government had lost 
     <lb/>the confidence of the country, and the most 
     <lb/>lamentable recriminations and dificulties ex<lb break="no"/>istcd on the floor of this chamber. Indeed 
     <lb/>at the time of which I speak affairs were in 
     <lb/>such a state as to make every man with any 
     <lb/>feeling of self-respect disposed to abandon 
     <lb/>public life. I think we see in this alone 
     <lb/>enough to reconcile us to the change, and I 
     <lb/>believe I should see sufiicicnt cause in this 
     <lb/>to induce me to Vote for a change in our 
     <lb/>political system. The dread of going back 
     <lb/>to the past, the apprehension lest old party 
     <lb/>cries should be' revived, and the fear lest 
     <lb/>difficulties in which we found ourselves 
     <lb/>might be perpetuated, would impel me to vote 
     <lb/>for the scheme now in our ha nds. (Hear, hear.)

     Having said so much on the general 
     <lb/>
     policy of the union, I might have been dis<lb break="no"/>posed to enter at greater length into it, 
     <lb/>
     were it not that I wished to keep faith 
     <lb/>
     with my honorable friend from Lambton; 
     <lb/>
     but, having said so much on the higher 
     <lb/>
     grounds which recommend this scheme, 
     <lb/>
     I will now say a few words in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the objections which have been urged against 
     <lb/>
     its character, vis., because it embraces those 
     <lb/>
     elements of disruption which are to be found 
     <lb/>
     in every federal union. That is the objec<lb break="no"/>tion of many who, while they would be will<lb break="no"/>ing to go for a purely legislative union, object 
     <lb/>
     to one of a federal character. They see in it 
     <lb/>
     that which tends to a disruption, and collision 
     <lb/>
     with the Central Government. Now, sir, I 
     <lb/>
     do not deny that if a legislative union, pure 
     <lb/>
     and simple, had been practicable, I, for one, 
     <lb/>
     would have preferred it; but I cannot dis<lb break="no"/>guise from myself that it was, and is at pre<lb break="no"/>sent, utterly impracticable, and I cannot help 
     <lb/>
     expressing my astonishment and extreme 
     <lb/>
     gratification, that five colonies which had been 
     <lb/>
     for many years separate from each other, 
     <lb/>
     had so many separate and distinct interests 
     <lb/>
     and local differences, should come together and 
     <lb/>
     agree upon such a scheme. Remembering the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties that had to be encountered in the 
     <lb/>
     shape of local interests, personal ambition, and 
     <lb/>
     separate governments, I certainly am sur<lb break="no"/>prised at the result, and I cannot withheld 
     <lb/>
     from the gentlemen who conducted these 
     <lb/>
     negotiations, the highest praise for the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which they overcame the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     that met them at every step, and for the 
     <lb/>
     spirit in which they sunk their own personal 
     <lb/>
     differences and interests in preparing this 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     is remarkable that a proposition having so 
     <lb/>
     few of the objections of a Federal system, 
     <lb/>
     should have been assented to by the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of five distinct colonies, which had 
     <lb/>
     heretofore been alien, practically indepen<lb break="no"/>dent, not only of each other, but almost of 
     <lb/>
     and almost hostile to each other. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There had been very much 
     <lb/>
     to keep these colonies apart, and very little 
     <lb/>
     to bring them together, and the success 
     <lb/>
     which has attended their efforts speaks well 
     <lb/>
     for those statesmen who applied their minds 
     <lb/>
     earnestly to the work of union. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.)

            <cb/>
          

     but the work of Confederation was no less 
     <lb/>
     one of vital importance to the country. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot help saying that I had no sympathy 
     <lb/>
     with the hon. member for Hochelaga (H on. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. DORION), the other evening, in his 
     <lb/>
     historical detail of all the antecedent difficul<lb break="no"/>ties which existed in our political position. 
     <lb/>
     That honorable gentleman told us what were 
     <lb/>
     the opinions of this member and of that one 
     <lb/>
     at different periods,—commented on their 
     <lb/>
     inconsistency , and claimed that he himself 
     <lb/>
     had always been firm in his opposition to the 
     <lb/>
     project. Well, sir, I do not care what may 
     <lb/>
     have been the views of one member or of 
     <lb/>
     another, or how inconsistent he may have 
     <lb/>
     been. What we have to consider is the 
     <lb/>
     scheme which is now presented to us. Let 
     <lb/>
     us forget the past; let us forget former 
     <lb/>
     differences; do not let us revive former 
     <lb/>
     animosities! Let us consider that we are 
     <lb/>
     starting fresh in life, or as the term has 
     <lb/>
     been used, that we are entering upon a new 
     <lb/>
     era of national existence. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Let us cast aside past recriminations and look 
     <lb/>
     at the merits of this scheme. I have only 
     <lb/>
     to say that a man who does not change his 
     <lb/>
     opinions is a very unsafe man indeed to 
     <lb/>
     guide the affairs of a nation. Such a man 
     <lb/>
     is like an old sign-post on a road that is no 
     <lb/>
     longer used for travel. The sign-post is 
     <lb/>
     consistent enough, it remains where it had 
     <lb/>
     been placed, but through a type of consistency 
     <lb/>
     it is an emblem of error. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Hochelaga spoke of his 
     <lb/>
     consistency and the inconsistency of others, 
     <lb/>
     but he was like the sign-post which pointed 
     <lb/>
     out a road that existed twenty years ago, but 
     <lb/>
     which no one could now pass over. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) I think, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     that instead of endeavoring to find objections 
     <lb/>
     to this scheme because it does not give as a 
     <lb/>
     legislative instead of a federal union, we 
     <lb/>
     ought to acknowledge the sacrifices of those 
     <lb/>
     men who came together and prepared it. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Whatever may be said of our 
     <lb/>
     desire to get out of our own constitutional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties in Canada, that objection cannot 
     <lb/>
     be urged against the public men of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces. Newfoundland has not 
     <lb/>
     been in estate of crisis like us, and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick has been tolerably faithful to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. TILLEY for the last ten years ; a short 
     <lb/>
     time ago the Premier of Nova Scotia had a 
     <lb/>
     majority of thirty in a ver small house— 
     <lb/>
     everything went on swimmingly there, and 
     <lb/>
    even Prince Edward Island was not much 
     <lb/>embarrassed.

     motives, but rather give to every man who

     has had anything to do with this measure 
     <lb/>
     the credit of being actuated by the utmost 
     <lb/>
     patriotism and singleness of purpose. Such, 
     <lb/>
    believe, is the feeling of nine-tenths—yes, 
     <lb/>ninety-nine hundredths of the people of this 
     <lb/>country. What inducement, except those 
     <lb/>of a public kind, had my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>President of the Council, or the Attorney 
     <lb/>General West to enter the same Government, 
     <lb/>if it was not with a view to bring about a union 
     <lb/>of the colonies? And even if they had only in 
     <lb/>view to heal the constitutional difficulties of 
     <lb/>the past, we ought to be doeply thankful to 
     <lb/>them. (Hear, hear.) I stated that I would 
     <lb/>not criticise many of the features of this 
     <lb/>scheme; but there are two main features 
     <lb/>which to my judgment commend themselves 
     <lb/>to the attention of every one who has any 
     <lb/>doubts as to the stability of the system, and 
     <lb/>which give us a sufficient guarantee, that 
     <lb/>guarantee which federal unions have hereto<lb break="no"/>fore wanted, namely : that it establishes a 
     <lb/>central authority which it will not be within 
     <lb/>the power of any of the local governments 
     <lb/>to interfere with or rise up against. It 
     <lb/>appears to me that they have avoided the 
     <lb/>errors into which the framers of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Constitution not unnaturally fell. They 
     <lb/>have evidently learnt something from the 
     <lb/>teachings of the past, and profited by the 
     <lb/>experience afforded in the case of our Ame<lb break="no"/>rican neighbors. They have established 
     <lb/>this Central Government, giving it such 
     <lb/>powers, and so defining the powers of the 
     <lb/>local governments, that it will be impossible 
     <lb/>for any Local Parliament to interfere with 
     <lb/>the central power in such a manner as to be 
     <lb/>detrimental to the interests of the whole. 
     <lb/>The great advantage which I see in the 
     <lb/>scheme is this, that the powers granted to 
     <lb/>the local governments are strictly defined 
     <lb/>and circumscribed, and that the residuum 
     <lb/>of power lies in the Central Government. 
     <lb/>You have, in addition to that, the local 
     <lb/>governors named by the central authority— 
     <lb/>an admirable provision which establishes 
     <lb/>the connection of authority between the 
     <lb/>cental power and the different localities ; 
     <lb/>you have vested in it also the great questions 
     <lb/>of the customs, the currency, banking, trade 
     <lb/>and navigation, commerce, the appointment 
     <lb/>of the judges and the administration of the 
     <lb/>laws, and all those great and large questions 
     <lb/>which interest the entire community, and 
     <lb/>with which the General Government ought 
     <lb/>
       

    
            <cb/>
        


     to be entrusted. There can, therefore, be 
     <lb/>
     no difficulty under the scheme between the 
     <lb/>
     various sections—no clashing of authority 
     <lb/>
     between the local and central governments 
     <lb/>
     in this case, as there has been in the case of 
     <lb/>
     the Americans. The powers of the local 
     <lb/>
     governments are distinctly and strictly de<lb break="no"/>fined, and you can have no assertion of 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty on the part of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, as in the United States, and of powers 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent with their rights and security of the 
     <lb/>
     whole community. (Hear, hear.) Then, the 
     <lb/>
     other point which commends itself so strongly 
     <lb/>
     to my mind is this, that there is a veto 
     <lb/>
     power on the part of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment over all the legislation of the Local 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. That was a fundamental element 
     <lb/>
     which the wisest statesmen engaged in the 
     <lb/>
     framing of the American Constitution saw, that 
     <lb/>
     if it was not engrafted in it, must necessarily 
     <lb/>
     lead to the destruction of the Constitution. 
     <lb/>
     These men engaged in the framing of that 
     <lb/>
     Constitution at Philadelphia saw clearly, that 
     <lb/>
     unless the power of veto over the acts of the 
     <lb/>
     state legislatures was given to the Central 
     <lb/>
     Government, sooner or later a clashing of 
     <lb/>
     authority between the central authority and 
     <lb/>
     the various states must take place. What 
     <lb/>
     said Mr. MADISON in reference to this point ? 
     <lb/>
     I quote from <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Secret Debates upon the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Constitution</hi>, which took place in 
     <lb/>
     1787, and during which this important 
     <lb/>
     question was considered. On the motion of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. PINKNEY " that the National Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture shall have the power of negativing all 
     <lb/>
     laws to be passed by the state legislature, 
     <lb/>
     which they may judge improper," he stated 
     <lb/>
     that he considered " this as the corner stone 
     <lb/>
     of the system, and hence the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     retrenching the state authorities in order to 
     <lb/>
     preserve the good government of the National 
     <lb/>
     Council." And Mr. MADISON said, " The 
     <lb/>
     power of negativing is absolutely necessary 
     <lb/>
     —this is the only attractive principle which 
     <lb/>
     will retain its centrifuga1 force, and without 
     <lb/>
     this the planets will fly from their orbits." 
     <lb/>
     Now, sir, I believe this power of negative, 
     <lb/>
     this power of veto, this controlling power on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the Central Government is the 
     <lb/>
     best protection and safeguard of the system; 
     <lb/>
     and if it had not been provided, I would have 
     <lb/>
     felt it very difficult to reconcile it to my 
     <lb/>
     sense of duty to vote for the resolutions. 
     <lb/>
     But this power having been given to the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government, it is to my mind, in 
     <lb/>
     conjunction with the power of naming the 
     <lb/>
     local governors, the appointment and pay<lb break="no"/>ment of the judiciary, one of the best-futures 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="405" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0405.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">405</fw>
         

     of the scheme, without which it would cer<lb break="no"/>tainly, in my opinion, have been open to 
     <lb/>
     very serious objection. (Hear, hear?) I 
     <lb/>
     will not now criticize any other of the lead<lb break="no"/>ing features of the resolutions as they touch 
     <lb/>
     the fundamental conditions and principles of 
     <lb/>
     the union. I think there has been through<lb break="no"/>out a most wise and statesmanlike distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of powers, and at the same time that 
     <lb/>
     those things have been carefully guarded 
     <lb/>
     which the minorities in the various sections 
     <lb/>
     required for their protection, and the regu<lb break="no"/>lation of which each province was not 
     <lb/>
     unnaturally desirous of retaining for itself. 
     <lb/>
     So far then as the objection is concerned 
     <lb/>
     of this union being federative merely 
     <lb/>
     in its character, and liable to all the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties which usually surround federal 
     <lb/>
     governments, I think we may fairly consider 
     <lb/>
     that there has been a proper and satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     distribution of power, which will avert many 
     <lb/>
     of those difficulties. (Hear, hear.) But, 
     <lb/>
     sir, there is another objection made to it, 
     <lb/>
     and one upon which, from my stand-point, 
     <lb/>
     I desire to make some observations, and that 
     <lb/>
     is with reference to the manner in which the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the various minorities in the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have been protected. This is unques<lb break="no"/>tionably a grave and serious subject of con<lb break="no"/>sideration, and especially so to the minority 
     <lb/>
     in this section of the province, that is the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish-speaking minority to which I and many 
     <lb/>
     other members of this House belong, and 
     <lb/>
     with whose interests we are identified. I 
     <lb/>
     do not disguise that I have heard very 
     <lb/>
     grave and serious apprehensions by many 
     <lb/>
     men for whose opinions I have great 
     <lb/>
     respect, and whom I admire for the 
     <lb/>
     absence of bigotry and narrow-mindedness 
     <lb/>
   which they have always exhibited. They 
     <lb/>have expressed themselves not so much 
     <lb/>in the way of objection to specific features 
     <lb/>of the scheme as in the way of apprehension 
     <lb/>of something dangerous to them in it— 
     <lb/>apprehensions which they cannot state ex<lb break="no"/>plicitly or even define to themselves. They 
     <lb/>seem doubtful and distrustful as to the con<lb break="no"/>sequences, express fears as to how it will 
     <lb/>affect their future condition and interests, 
     <lb/>and in fact, they almost think that in view 
     <lb/>of this uncertainty it would be better if we 
     <lb/>remained as we are. Now, sir, I believe 
     <lb/>that the rights of both minorities—the 
     <lb/>French minority in the General Legislature 
     <lb/>and the English-speaking minority in the 
     <lb/>Local Legislature of Lower Canada—are 
     <lb/>properly guarded. I would admit at once 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
         

     that without this protection it would be e 
     <lb/>
     to the gravest objection ; I would admit that  
     <lb/>
     you were embodying in it an element of 
     <lb/>
     future difficulty, a cause of future dissension 
     <lb/>
     and agitation that might be destructive to 
     <lb/>
     the whole fabric ; and therefore it is a very 
     <lb/>
     grave and anxious question for us to consider 
     <lb/>
     —especially the minorities in Lower Canada ; 
     <lb/>
     —how far our mutual rights and interests 
     <lb/>
     are respected and guarded, the one in the 
     <lb/>
     General and the other in the Local Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. With reference to this subject, I 
     <lb/>
     think that I, and those with whom I have 
     <lb/>
     acted—the English speaking members from 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada—may in some degree congra<lb break="no"/>tulate ourselves at having brought about a 
     <lb/>
     state of feeling between the two races in 
     <lb/>
     this section of the province which has pro<lb break="no"/>duced some good effect. (Hear, hear.) There 
     <lb/>
     has been, ever since the time of the union, 
     <lb/>
     I am happy to say—and everybody knows it 
     <lb/>
     who has any experience in Lower Canada—a 
     <lb/>
     cordial understanding and friendly feeling 
     <lb/>
     between the two nationalities, which has 
     <lb/>
     produced the happiest results. Belonging 
     <lb/>
     to different races and professing a different 
     <lb/>
     faith, we live near each other ; we come in 
     <lb/>
     contact and mix with each other, and we 
     <lb/>
     respect each other ; we do not trench 
     <lb/>
     upon the rights of each other ; we have, 
     <lb/>
     not had those party and religious differ<lb break="no"/>ences which two races, speaking different 
     <lb/>
     languages and holding different religious be<lb break="no"/>liefs, might be supposed to have had ; and 
     <lb/>
     it is a matter of sincere gratification to us, I 
     <lb/>
     say, that this state of things has existed and 
     <lb/>
     is now found amongst us. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But if, instead of this mutual confidence ; if, 
     <lb/>
     instead of the English-speaking minority 
     <lb/>
     placing trust in the French majority in the 
     <lb/>
     Local Legislature, and the French minority 
     <lb/>
     placing the same trust in the English majo<lb break="no"/>rity in the General Legislature, no such feeling 
     <lb/>
     existed, how could this scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion he made to work successfully? Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I think it cannot be denied that 
     <lb/>
     there is the utmost confidence on both sides ; 
     <lb/>
     I feel assured that our confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     majority in the Local Government will not 
     <lb/>
     be misplaced, and I earnestly trust that the 
     <lb/>
     confidence they repose in us in the General 
     <lb/>
     Legislature will not be abused. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I hope that this mutual yielding of confidence 
     <lb/>
     will make us both act in a high-minded and 
     <lb/>
     sensitive manner when the rights of either 
     <lb/>
     side are called in question—if ever they 
     <lb/>
     should be called in question—in the respect<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="num">406</fw>
        
ive legislatures. This is an era in the history 
     <lb/>
     of both races—the earnest plighting of each 
     <lb/>
     other's faith as they embrace this scheme. 
     <lb/>
     It is remarkable that both should place such 
     <lb/>
     entire confidence in one another; and in 
     <lb/>
     future ages our posterity on both sides will 
     <lb/>
     be able to point with pride to the period 
     <lb/>
     when the two races had such reliance the 
     <lb/>
     one on the other as that each was willing to 
     <lb/>
     trust its safety and interest to the honor of 
     <lb/>
     the other. (Hear, hear.) This mutual confid<lb break="no"/>ence has not been brought about by any 
     <lb/>
     ephemeral or spasmodic desire for change on 
     <lb/>
     the part of either; it is the result of the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge each race possesses of the charac<lb break="no"/>ter of the other, and of the respect each en<lb break="no"/>tertains for the other. (Hear, hear.) It is 
     <lb/>
     because we have learnt to respect each other's 
     <lb/>
     motives and have been made to feel by expe<lb break="no"/>rience that neither must be aggressive, and 
     <lb/>
     that the interests of the one are safe in the 
     <lb/>
     keeping of the other. And I think I may 
     <lb/>
     fairly appeal to the President of the Council, 
     <lb/>
     that if, during the ten years in which he has 
     <lb/>
     agitated the question of representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, we the English in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     had listened to his appeals—appeals that he 
     <lb/>
     has persistently made with all the earnestness 
     <lb/>
     and vigor of his nature—if we had not turn<lb break="no"/>ed a deaf ear to them, but had gone with 
     <lb/>
     those of our own race and our own faith, the 
     <lb/>
     people of Upper Canada, who demanded this 
     <lb/>
     change, where, I would ask him, would have 
     <lb/>
     been our union to day? Would not a feeling 
     <lb/>
     of distrust have been established between the 
     <lb/>
     French and English races in the community, 
     <lb/>
     that would have rendered even the fair con<lb break="no"/>sideration of it utterly impracticable? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Would the French have in 
     <lb/>
     that case been ready now to trust themselves 
     <lb/>
     in the General Legislature, or the English in 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature of Lower Canada? No; 
     <lb/>
    and I pray God that this mutual confidence
     <lb/>between two races which have so high and 
     <lb/>noble a work to do on this continent, who are 
     <lb/>menaced by a common danger, and actuated 
     <lb/>by a common interest, may continue for all 
     <lb/>time to come! I pray that it may not be 
     <lb/>interrupted or destroyed by any act of either 
     <lb/>party; and I trust that each may continue 
     <lb/>to feel assured that if at any time here<lb break="no"/>after circumstances should arise calculated 
     <lb/>to infringe upon the rights of either, it will 
     <lb/>be sufficient to say, in order to prevent any 
     <lb/>aggression of this kind—" We trusted each 
     <lb/>other when we entered this union; we felt 
     <lb/>then that our rights would be sacred with 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     you; and our honor and good faith and in<lb break="no"/>tegrity are involved in and pledged to the 
     <lb/>
     maintenance of them." (Hear, hear.) I be<lb break="no"/>lieve this is an era in our history to which in 
     <lb/>
     after ages our children may appeal with pride, 
     <lb/>
     and that if there should be any intention 
     <lb/>
     on either side to aggress upon the other, the 
     <lb/>
     recollection that each trusted to the honor 
     <lb/>
     of the other will prevent that intention being 
     <lb/>
     carried out. (Hear, hear.) Feeling as I do 
     <lb/>
     thus strongly that our French follow-subjects 
     <lb/>
     are placing entire confidence in us—in our 
     <lb/>
     honor and our good faith—we, the English 
     <lb/>
     speaking population of Lower Canada, ought 
     <lb/>
     not to be behind hand in placing confidence 
     <lb/>
     in them. I feel that we have no reason as a 
     <lb/>
     minority to fear aggressions on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the majority. We feel that in the past we 
     <lb/>
     have an earnest of what we may reasonably 
     <lb/>
     expect the future relations between the two 
     <lb/>
     races to be. But although this feeling of 
     <lb/>
     mutual confidence may be strong enough in 
     <lb/>
     our breasts at this time, I am glad to see that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the Attorney General East, 
     <lb/>
     as representin the French majority in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and the Minister of Finance, as re<lb break="no"/>presenting the English speeking minority, 
     <lb/>
     have each carefully and prudently endeavored 
     <lb/>
     to place as fundamental conditions in this 
     <lb/>
     basis of union such safeguards and protection 
     <lb/>
     as the two races may respectively rely 
     <lb/>
     upon. (Hear, hear.) I feel that it has 
     <lb/>
     been carefully considered and carried out, 
     <lb/>
     and with the same amount of mutual con<lb break="no"/>fidence in the future working as in the past, 
     <lb/>
     we need not have any apprehension in trust<lb break="no"/>ing the interests of the two races either in 
     <lb/>
     the Federal or Local Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But although we here, and as members of 
     <lb/>
     this House, feel this confidence in each 
     <lb/>
     other, no doubt those who prepared these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions were conscious that the powers 
     <lb/>
     must be so distributed, and the reservations 
     <lb/>
     of power so made, as to commend them to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country at large. You 
     <lb/>
     must carry the people with you in this 
     <lb/>
     movement, for you cannot force a new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, a new state of political 
     <lb/>
     being, upon a people, unless their own judg<lb break="no"/>ment and their own convictions as to its 
     <lb/>
     safety go alon with it.

     satisfy them that their interests for all time 
     <lb/>
     to come are safe—that the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     minority are hedged round with such safe<lb break="no"/>guards, that those who come after us will 
     <lb/>
    feel that they are protected in all they hold 
     <lb/>dear ; and I think a few observations will 
     <lb/>enable me to show the House that that has 
     <lb/>been well and substantially done in this case. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Looking at the scheme, then, 
     <lb/>from the stand-point of an English Protestant 
     <lb/>in Lower Canada, let me see whether the 
     <lb/>interests of those of my own race and religion 
     <lb/>in that section are safely and properly guard<lb break="no"/>ed. There are certain points upon which 
     <lb/>they feel the greatest interest, and with 
     <lb/>regard to which it is but proper that they 
     <lb/>should be assured that there are sufficient 
     <lb/>safeguards provided for their preservation. 
     <lb/>Upon these points, I desire to put some 
     <lb/>questions to the Government. The first 
     <lb/>of these points is as to whether such 
     <lb/>provision has been made and will be car<lb break="no"/>ried out that they will not suffer at any 
     <lb/>future time from a system of exclusion 
     <lb/>from the federal or local legislatures, but 
     <lb/>that they will have a fair share in the re<lb break="no"/>presentation in both ; and the second is, 
     <lb/>whether such safeguards will be provided for 
     <lb/>the educational system of the minority in 
     <lb/>Lower Canada as will be satisfactory to them? 
     <lb/>Upon these points some apprehensions 
     <lb/>appear to exist in the minds of the English 
     <lb/>minority in Lower Canada, and although I 
     <lb/>am free to confess that I have not shared in 
     <lb/>my fear of injustice at the hands of the 
     <lb/>majority, as I consider that the action of the 
     <lb/>past forms a good guarantee for the future, 
     <lb/>yet I desire, for the full assurance of that 
     <lb/>minority, to put some questions to my hon. 
     <lb/>friends in the Government. I wish to know 
     <lb/>what share of representation the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>speaking population of Lower Canada will 
     <lb/>have in the Federal Legislature, and whether 
     <lb/>it will be in the same proportion as their 
     <lb/>representation in this Parliament ? This is 
     <lb/>one point in which I think the English in<lb break="no"/>habitants of Lower Canada are strongly in<lb break="no"/>terested. Another is with regard to their 
     <lb/>representation in the Local Legislature of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada—whether the same proportion 
     <lb/>will be given to them as is now given to them 
     <lb/>in this House, that is to say, about one-fourth 
     <lb/>of the Lower Canadian representation, which 
     <lb/>is the proportion of the English speaking to 
     <lb/>the French speaking population of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, the numbers being 260,000 and 
     <lb/>1,100,000 respectively. Now, the spirit of 
     <lb/>the resolutions as I understand them—and I 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
           

     will thank my hon. friend the Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral to correct me if I am in error in regard 
     <lb/>
     to them— provides that the electoral districts 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada for representatives in the 
     <lb/>
     first Federal Legislature shall remain intact as 
     <lb/>
     they now are; and, although the resolution 
     <lb/>
     is somewhat ambiguously expressed, I take 
     <lb/>
     that to be its spirit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Have the kindness 
     <lb/>
     to read it and see. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—The 23rd resolution 
     <lb/>
     reads : " The Legislature of each province 
     <lb/>
     shall divide such province into the proper 
     <lb/>
     number of constituencies, and define the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries of each of them." Then the 
     <lb/>
     24th resolution provides that " the Local 
     <lb/>
     Legislature may from time to time alter the 
     <lb/>
     electoral districts for the urpose of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in such Local Legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     distribute the representatives to which the 
     <lb/>
     province is entitled in such Local Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     in any manner such legislature may see fit." 
     <lb/>
     In these resolutions I presume that power is 
     <lb/>
     given to the Legislature of each province to 
     <lb/>
    divide the province into the proper number 
     <lb/>of constituencies for representation in the 
     <lb/>Federal Parliament, and to alter the electo<lb break="no"/>ral districts for representation in the Local 
     <lb/>Legislature. Now, to speak quite plainly, the 
     <lb/>apprehension which I desire to say again I 
     <lb/>do not personally share in, but which has 
     <lb/>been expressed to me by gentlemen in my 
     <lb/>own constituency, is this, that with respect 
     <lb/>to the Local Legislature, it will be competent 
     <lb/>for the French majority in Lower Canada to 
     <lb/>blot out the English-speaking minority from 
     <lb/>any share in the representation, and so to 
     <lb/>apportion the electoral districts that no Engl<lb break="no"/>ish speaking member can be returned to the 
     <lb/>Legislature. That is an apprehension upon 
     <lb/>which I would be very glad to have an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of opinion by my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>Attorney General East. As I read the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, if the Local Legislature exercised its 
     <lb/>powers in any such unjust manner, it would 
     <lb/>be competent for the General Government to 
     <lb/>veto its action, and thus prevent the intention 
     <lb/>of the Local Legislature being carried into 
     <lb/>effect—even although the power be one 
     <lb/>which is declared to be absolutely vested in 
     <lb/>the Local Government, and delegated to it as 
     <lb/>one of the articles of its constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—There is 
     <lb/>
     not the least doubt that if the Local Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada should apportion the electoral 
     <lb/>
     districts in such a way as to do injustice to 
     <lb/>
     the English-speaking population, the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government will have the right to vet 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="408" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0408.jpg"/>

     any law it might pass to this affect and set it

     at nought.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Would you ad<lb break="no"/>vise it?

     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Yes, I 
     <lb/>
     would recommend it myself in case of injus<lb break="no"/>tice. (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—I am quite sure my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend would do it rather than have an 
     <lb/>
     injustice perpetrated. There is another 
     <lb/>
     point upon which I would like to have from 
     <lb/>
     the Attorney General East an explicit state<lb break="no"/>ment of the views of the Government. I 
     <lb/>
     refer to the provision in the 23rd resolution 
     <lb/>
     which I have just read ; what I wish to know 
     <lb/>
     is whether the Legislature therein spoken of 
     <lb/>
     means the Legislature of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada as it is now constituted, and whether 
     <lb/>
     it is contemplated to have any change in the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries of the electoral districts for re<lb break="no"/>presentation in the first session of the Fede<lb break="no"/>ral Legislature? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName> — With 
     <lb/>
     regard to Lower Canada, it is not the inten<lb break="no"/>tion to make any alteration in the electoral 
     <lb/>
     districts, because there will be no change in 
     <lb/>
     the number of representatives sent to the 
     <lb/>
     General Parliament. But with regard to 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, there will be a change in the 
     <lb/>
     electoral districts, because there will be an 
     <lb/>
     increase of members from that section. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—So that I clearly un<lb break="no"/>derstand from the statement of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman that in Lower Canada the constitu<lb break="no"/>encies, for the purposes of the first election

     to the Federal Legislature, will remain as 
     <lb/>
     they are now ?

      <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Yes, as

     they are now.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—And that as regards

      assurances which, I feel persuaded, will re<lb break="no"/>move some apprehension felt in the country

     to let Upper Canada take care of itself,  
     <lb/>
     and I think its representatives are able to

     do so. One minority is quite enough for

     me to attend to at present. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     I trust the Attorney General East, from my

     that I have any doubt as to the fair dealing 
     <lb/>
     that will be accorded to the minority by 
     <lb/>
     the majority in Lower Canada. But it is 
     <lb/>
     very desirable, I think, that we should re<lb break="no"/>ceive a clear, emphatic, and distinct decla<lb break="no"/>ration of the spirit of the resolutions on 
     <lb/>
     those points, in order that the minority may 
     <lb/>
     see how well their rights and interests have

     been protected. (Hear, hear.) I am fully 
     <lb/>
     persuaded that in the past conduct of the

     majority in Lower Canada there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     which will cause the minority to look with 
     <lb/>
     doubt upon the future ; for I will do my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the justice of saying that in the 
     <lb/>
     whole course of his public life there has not 
     <lb/>
     been a single act on his part either of execu<lb break="no"/>tive, administrative, or legislative action, 
     <lb/>
     tinged with illiberality, intolerance, or 
     <lb/>
     bigotry. (Hear, hear.) I say this to ex<lb break="no"/>press my belief that in the future, wherever 
     <lb/>
    he has control, there will be no appearance 
     <lb/>of bigotry or illiberality, and I feel that the 
     <lb/>confidence I repose in him in this respect is 
     <lb/>shared in by many others in this House and 
     <lb/>throughout the country. (Hear, hear.)

     <lb/>question I have put once or twice touching 
     <lb/>the proposed measure of the Administration 
     <lb/>on the subject of education in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>as it affects the English-speaking minority.

     reference to that subject. What I wish to

     do now is to point out the objections I have

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     dread of evil rather than on anything that

     they actually now see obnoxious in the

     vague and undefined, and difficult therefore 
     <lb/>
     to combat. If I go among one class and ask

     them what they fear, I am told—" Oh, you

     they will have no power in the commu<lb break="no"/>nity ; and all the advantages we have 
     <lb/>
     gained during the past twenty-five years by 
     <lb/>
     our union with the people of our own race in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada will be entirely lost." I can 
     <lb/>
     but answer—" What are you afraid of ? 
     <lb/>
     Where is the interest affecting you that is 
     <lb/>
     imperilled ? You have, in conjunction with 
     <lb/>
     a majority of your own race, power in the 
     <lb/>
     General Legislature to appoint the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernors, administer justice and name the 
     <lb/>
     judges, to control the militia and all other 
     <lb/>
     means of defence, and to make laws respect<lb break="no"/>ing the post office, trade, commerce, naviga<lb break="no"/>tion ; and you have all the great and important 
     <lb/>
     interests that centre in the community I 
     <lb/>
     represent—all matters that affect the minority 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada—within your control in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Legislature. The French have sur<lb break="no"/>rendered the questions relating to usury, to 
     <lb/>
     marriage and divorce, on which they hold 
     <lb/>
     pretty strong opinions, to the Central Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. What, then, are you afraid of in the 
     <lb/>
     action of the Local Legislature ?" " Well," 
     <lb/>
     I am answered, " all that may be true enough ; 
     <lb/>
     but we shall not gets single appointment ; the 
     <lb/>
    administration of local affairs in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada will be entirely in the hands of the 
     <lb/>French majority, and they will control all the 
     <lb/>patronage." You say to them again—" ls it 
     <lb/>the exercise of patronage you are afraid of ? 
     <lb/>Is not the appointment of the judges, the 
     <lb/>patronage of the post office, the customs, the 
     <lb/>excise, the board of works, and all the other 
     <lb/>important branches of the administration in 
     <lb/>the hands of the Federal Government? 
     <lb/>What is there, then, but a few municipal 
     <lb/>officers to be appointed by the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures ; and for the sake of this petty patron<lb break="no"/>age, are you going to imperil the success of 
     <lb/>a scheme that is fraught with such important 
     <lb/>consequences to all the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>North America? Is it for this that you will 
     <lb/>oppose a measure that contains so many 
     <lb/>merits, that possesses so much good, and that 
     <lb/>is calculated to confer such lasting benefits 
     <lb/>upon these provinces, if not to lead to the 
     <lb/>formation of a territorial division of the 
     <lb/>British Empire here ?" Well, these ques<lb break="no"/>tions I have put, and these explanations I 
     <lb/>have made, but some still seemed to enter<lb break="no"/>tain an undefined dread that they could not 
     <lb/>realise to themselves—a dread which to a 
     <lb/>great extent appears to be shared by my hon. 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          

     friend opposite (Hon. Mr. DORION) in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the General Legislature. Well, if 
     <lb/>
     we look to the history of the past twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     five years and see how we have acted towards 
     <lb/>
     each other, I think neither party will have 
     <lb/>
     any cause for apprehension. Has there been 
     <lb/>
     a single set of aggression on the part of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the Attorney General East on us 
     <lb/>
     the English minority, or a single act of 
     <lb/>
     aggression on our part towards the race to 
     <lb/>
     which he belongs ? (Hear, hear.) Has 
     <lb/>
     there not been mutual respect and confidence, 
     <lb/>
     and has there been an act on either side to 
     <lb/>
     destroy that feeling? (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     think the past gives assurance to us that no 
     <lb/>
     such difficulty will arise in the future, and 
     <lb/>
     that we shall continue to live and work har<lb break="no"/>moniously together, each holding the other 
     <lb/>
     in respect and esteem. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     we are told—and it is urged as an objection 
     <lb/>
     against the scheme—that works of improve<lb break="no"/>ment will be obstructed by the Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in Lower Canada. Now, I think the 
     <lb/>
     day has long gone by when acts which were 
     <lb/>
     formerly committed could possibly be repeat<lb break="no"/>ed—when, for instance, before the union, 
     <lb/>
     the work carried on by the Montreal Harbor 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners could not he proceeded with 
     <lb/>
     because Mr. PAPINEAU opposed it. The days 
     <lb/>
     of progress and advancement have come since 
     <lb/>
     that time. This is an age of progress, the 
     <lb/>
     very spirit of which is hostile in the strong<lb break="no"/>est degree to such a state of things. It is 
     <lb/>
     impossible for either race to treat the other 
     <lb/>
     with injustice. Their interests are too much 
     <lb/>
     bound up together, and any injustice com<lb break="no"/>mitted by one would react quite as injuri<lb break="no"/>ously upon it elsewhere ; and I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the mutual confidence with which we are 
     <lb/>
     going into this union ought to and will in<lb break="no"/>duce us all to labor together harmoniously, 
     <lb/>
     and endeavor to work it out for the best. 
     <lb/>
    (Hear, hear.) I do not disguise from my<lb break="no"/>self that the minority in Lower Canada has 
     <lb/>always been on the defensive. That is a 
     <lb/>condition which is natural under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances ; for we cannot be in a minority 
     <lb/>without being more or less on the defensive. 
     <lb/>But I think that under this scheme the 
     <lb/>French minority in the General Legislature 
     <lb/>and the English minority in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>will both be amply and satisfactorily protect<lb break="no"/>ed. (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, I come to the 
     <lb/>question adverted to by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Chateauguay, in reference to the education 
     <lb/>measure which the Government has promised 
     <lb/>to bring down to the House. I believe this 
     <lb/>is the first time almost in the history of 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="410" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0410.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">410</fw>
         

     Lower Canada—and I call the attention of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friends from Upper Canada to the 
     <lb/>
     fact—that there has been any excitement, or 
     <lb/>
     movement, or agitation on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     English Protestant population of Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada in reference to the common school 
     <lb/>
     question. (Hear, hear.) It is the first time 
     <lb/>
     in the history of the country that there has 
     <lb/>
     been any serious apprehension aroused 
     <lb/>
     amongst them regarding the elementary edu<lb break="no"/>cation of their children. I am not aware 
     <lb/>
     that there has ever been any attempt in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada to deprive the minority of 
     <lb/>
     their just rights in respect to the education 
     <lb/>
     of their youth. I do not state this simply 
     <lb/>
     as my own opinion, or as the result of obser<lb break="no"/>vations which I have made alone. I have 
     <lb/>
     received letters from those who have been 
     <lb/>
     cognizant of the educational system in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada for many years, confirmatory of this 
     <lb/>
     in the strongest degree. It was also observ<lb break="no"/>ed and commented upon by the three com<lb break="no"/>missioners who came out from England to 
     <lb/>
     this country in 1837, and who in their re<lb break="no"/>port said it was one of the most remarkable 
     <lb/>
     circumstances that came under their notice, 
     <lb/>
     that they found two races, speaking different 
     <lb/>
     languages and holding different religious 
     <lb/>
     opinions, living together in harmony, and 
     <lb/>
     having no difference or ill-feeling in respect 
     <lb/>
     to the education of their children. Now we, 
     <lb/>
     the English Protestant minority of Lowe 
     <lb/>
     Canada, cannot forget that whatever right of 
     <lb/>
     separate education we have was accorded to 
     <lb/>
     us in the most unrestricted way before the 
     <lb/>
     union of the provinces, when we were in a 
     <lb/>
     minority and entirely in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     French population. We cannot forget that 
     <lb/>
     in no way was there any attempt to prevent 
     <lb/>
     us educating our children in the manner we 
     <lb/>
     saw fit and deemed best ; and I would be 
     <lb/>
     untrue to what is just if I forgot to state that 
     <lb/>
     the distribution of State funds for educational 
     <lb/>
     purposes was made in such a way as to cause 
     <lb/>
     no complaint on the part of the minority. 
     <lb/>
     I believe we have always had our fair 
     <lb/>
     share of the public grants in so far as the 
     <lb/>
     French element could control them, and not 
     <lb/>
     only the liberty, but every facility, for the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of separate dissentient schools 
     <lb/>
     wherever they were deemed desirable. A 
     <lb/>
     single person has the right, under the law, 
     <lb/>
     of establishing a dissentient school and 
     <lb/>
     obtaining a fair share of the educational 
     <lb/>
     grant, if he can gather together fifteen child<lb break="no"/>ren who desire instruction in it. Now, we 
     <lb/>
     cannot forget that in the past this liberality 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     has been shown to us, and that whatever we 
     <lb/>
     desired of the French majority in respect to 
     <lb/>
     education, they were, if it was at all reason<lb break="no"/>able, willing to concede. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     have thus, in this also, the guarantee of the 
     <lb/>
     past that nothing will be done in the future 
     <lb/>
     unduly to interfere with our rights and inter<lb break="no"/>ests as regards education, and I believe that 
     <lb/>
     everything we desire will be as freely given 
     <lb/>
     by the Local Legislature as it was before the 
     <lb/>
     union of the Canadas. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     from whence comes the practical difficulty of 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the uestion at the present mo<lb break="no"/>ment? We should not forget that it does 
     <lb/>
     not come from our French-Canadian brethren 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada, but that it arises in this 
     <lb/>
     way—and I speak as one who has watched 
     <lb/>
     the course of events and the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the country upon the subject—that the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant majority in Upper Canada are 
     <lb/>
     indisposed to disturb the settlement made 
     <lb/>
     a couple of years ago, with regard to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, and rather to hope that the  
     <lb/>
     French majority in Lower Canada should 
     <lb/>
     concede to the English Protestant minority 
     <lb/>
     there, nothing more than is given to the 
     <lb/>
     minority in the other section of the province. 
     <lb/>
     But still it must be conceded that there are 
     <lb/>
     certain points where the present educational 
     <lb/>
     system demands modification—points in 
     <lb/>
     which the English Protestant minority of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada expect a modification. I 
     <lb/>
     would ask my honorable friend the Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General East, whether the system of educa<lb break="no"/>tion which is in farce in Lower Canada at 
     <lb/>
     the time of the proclamation is to remain and 
     <lb/>
     be the system of education for all time to 
     <lb/>
     come ; and that whatever rights are given 
     <lb/>
     to either of the religious sections shall con<lb break="no"/>tinue to be guaranteed to them ? We are 
     <lb/>
     called upon to vote for the resolutions in 
     <lb/>
     ignorance, to some extent, of the guarantees 
     <lb/>
     to be given by subsequent legislation, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore my honorable friend will not take 
     <lb/>
     it amiss if I point out to him where the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant minority desire a change, with a 
     <lb/>
     view of ascertaining how far the Government 
     <lb/>
     is disposed to meet their views by coming 
     <lb/>
     down with a measure in which they may be 
     <lb/>
     embodied. The first thing I wish to men<lb break="no"/>tion has caused a good deal of difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     our present system, and that is, whether 
     <lb/>
     non-resident preprietors shall have the same 
     <lb/>
     right of designating the class of schools to 
     <lb/>
     which their taxes shall be given as actual 
     <lb/>
     residents. That is one point— whether a 
     <lb/>
     person living out of the district or township 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="411" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0411.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">411</fw>
        

     shall not have the same privilege of saying 
     <lb/>
     that his taxes shall be given to a dissentient 
     <lb/>
     school as if he resided upon the property. 
     <lb/>
     A second point is with reference to taxes on 
     <lb/>
     the property of incorporated companies. As 
     <lb/>
     it is now, such taxes go in a manner which 
     <lb/>
     is not considered satisfactory to the minority 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada. What I desire to ascertain 
     <lb/>
     is whether some equitable provision will be 
     <lb/>
     made, enabling the taxes on such property 
     <lb/>
     to be distributed in some way more satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory to the owners—perhaps in the same way 
     <lb/>
     that the Government money is. Some have 
     <lb/>
     urged that it should be left to the directors 
     <lb/>
     of such companies to indicate the schools to 
     <lb/>
     which such taxes should be given, while 
     <lb/>
     others think that each individual shareholder 
     <lb/>
     should have the power to say how the taxes 
     <lb/>
     on his property should be applied. I am 
     <lb/>
     inclined to think the latter method would be 
     <lb/>
     found utterly impracticable. I confess it is 
     <lb/>
     an extreme view, and I do not think we 
     <lb/>
     could expect that. But I do think there 
     <lb/>
     ought to be some more equitable way of 
     <lb/>
     appropriating the taxes on such property. 
     <lb/>
    These are two points, of perhaps inferior 
     <lb/>importance to the third, and that is, whether 
     <lb/>a more direct control over the administration 
     <lb/>and management of the dissentient schools 
     <lb/>in Lower Canada will not be given to the 
     <lb/>Protestant minority ; whether in fact they 
     <lb/>will not be left in some measure to them<lb break="no"/>selves. I am quite well aware that this is a 
     <lb/>question that concerns both Catholics and 
     <lb/>Protestants, for I believe that about one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>third of the dissentient schools are Catholic 
     <lb/>schools.

     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—The question relates 
     <lb/>
     to all dissentient schools, from whatever 
     <lb/>
     cause they may have been led to dissent. The 
     <lb/>
     remedy can be made to apply equally to all. 
     <lb/>
     I do not ask what precise measure will be

     brought down, but I do think they ought to

     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     as usual, I am ready to answer categorical 
     <lb/>
     questions, and I will answer my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     in such a way as to satisfy both the House 
     <lb/>
     and my hon. friend. With regard to the 
     <lb/>
     first point, respecting non-residents in the 
     <lb/>
     townships, I may say that it is the intention 
     <lb/>
     of the Government, in a measure which is 
     <lb/>
     to be introduced, to give those who are in a 
     <lb/>
     minority ower to designate to what dissenti<lb break="no"/>ent schools  their assessment shall be paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Only in 
     <lb/>
     townships ?  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName>—Everywhere. Not 
     <lb/>
     to Catholics alone either. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     the second question—the distribution of 
     <lb/>
     money raised from commercial companies—I 
     <lb/>
     am well aware that to this day there has been 
     <lb/>
     a complaint with regard to the distribution 
     <lb/>
     of those moneys. It is the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     Government to have in the measure a pro<lb break="no"/>vision which will secure a more equitable 
     <lb/>
     distribution of those moneys, distributing 
     <lb/>
     them in such a way as to satisfy everyone. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Now, with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the third enquiry, I am ready also 
     <lb/>
     to answer my honorable friend from Montreal 
     <lb/>
     Centre, that it is the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     Government that in that law there will be a 
     <lb/>
     provision that will secure to the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minority in Lower Canada such manage<lb break="no"/>ment and control over their schools as will 
     <lb/>
     satisfy them. (Laughter and cheers.) Now, 
     <lb/>
     with regard to my hon. frind from Chateau<lb break="no"/>guay, who said that there were dissentient 
     <lb/>
     schools on account of language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man must have misunderstood what I said. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member from Montreal Centre 
     <lb/>
     was saying that there were dissentient schools 
     <lb/>
     on account of religion. I merely suggested 
     <lb/>
     that there might be dissentient schools on 
     <lb/>
     account of language. There was nothing in 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Catholic dissentient schools in municipalities

     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—The manner and spirit

     in which the Government have given ex<lb break="no"/>planations on the subject ought to be satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory to the people of Lower Canada of the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     which they have been dealt with in the past

     gives us every reason to be convinced that 
     <lb/>
     we will receive justice. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     have no hesitation in saying that I have full

     confidence that the Lower Canada section of 
     <lb/>
     the Administration will deal with us in a fair 
     <lb/>
     and liberal spirit. I have confidence in my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the Minister of Finance, and in 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the Attorney General East, 
     <lb/>
     and I am glad to learn that he will give all 
     <lb/>
     proper consideration to that financial ques<lb break="no"/>tion, the distribution of the assessment of 
     <lb/>
     commercial companies in a satisfactory man<lb break="no"/>ner. I hope the Minister of Finance will 
     <lb/>
     be disposed to go further, and deal in a

     similar spirit with the endowment of col<lb break="no"/>leges.

     time, before the Confederation scheme comes 
     <lb/>
     to a vote.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—Well, it happens that 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend from Chateaugnay and 
     <lb/>
     myself hold very dissimilar views respect<lb break="no"/>ing the importance of Confederation. If 
     <lb/>
     I were disposed to follow such tactics, 
     <lb/>
     I might possibly profit by his advice. But 
     <lb/>
     I am inclined to overlook a great many 
     <lb/>
     things on which my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     would hesitate, for the purpose of seeing so 
     <lb/>
     important a measure carried out. While I 
     <lb/>
     have every confidence in the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I feel that we may expect as much 
     <lb/>
     justice at the hands of the Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     Local Parliament as from any Government 
     <lb/>
     of United Canada that we ever had. We 
     <lb/>
     have never yet had occasion to appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant majority of Upper Canada for help, 
     <lb/>
     and if we ever should deem it proper to do 
     <lb/>
     so, I have no reason to believe that we should 
     <lb/>
     receive more attention than our wants re<lb break="no"/>ceived at the hands of the Catholic majo<lb break="no"/>rity of Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
     <lb/>
     sir, so far as the three questions to which I 
     <lb/>
     have made allusion are concerned, the appre<lb break="no"/>hensions of being shut out from the General 
     <lb/>
     Government—being handed over to the 
     <lb/>
     French in the Local Parliament of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and our educational rights being 
     <lb/>
     interfered with, I feel every assurance that 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of the answers just given will be 
     <lb/>
     carried out. I will now say a few words 
     <lb/>
     respecting the argument presented by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DO<lb break="no"/>RION) in the course of his speech the other 
     <lb/>
     evening—that the plan for Federation would 
     <lb/>
     inflict great financial injustice upon Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and that it would, through the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway and works of defence, entail such 
     <lb/>
     enormous burdens upon the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="413" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0413.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">413</fw>
       

     as to ultimately lead them to rise up against 
     <lb/>
     and overthrow it. Well now, for the life of 
     <lb/>
     me I cannot see how it is to increase our 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. I cannot see how it can go 
     <lb/>
     beyond what the Minister of Finance stated 
     <lb/>
     —that it could not in any case add to the 
     <lb/>
     present cost more than the expenses of the 
     <lb/>
     General Government. The Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ments cannot be more expensive than the 
     <lb/>
     present Government, and therefore all we 
     <lb/>
     need to add at the very most is the expense 
     <lb/>
     of the General Government. I do not see 
     <lb/>
     how it is possible to add any more. I would, 
     <lb/>
     however, ask the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>
     another statement made the other evening 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member from Hochelaga. He 
     <lb/>
     said that we were making a mistake in sup<lb break="no"/>posing that we were discussing a question of 
     <lb/>
     colonial union. Confederation, he said, was 
     <lb/>
     simply tacked on to the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way at the suggestion of Mr. WATKIN, and 
     <lb/>
     that the whole arrangement was merely a 
     <lb/>
     nicely planned scheme for the benefit of the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk Railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:WALL5">MR. WALLBRIDGE</persName> —That was the very 
     <lb/>
     motive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—Well, does any one 
     <lb/>
     suppose that my hon. friend the President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council could be duped in that way? 
     <lb/>
     Is it possible that my hon. friend from Ho<lb break="no"/>chelaga believes he has so little astuteness 
     <lb/>
     as not to see through such an attempt as that? 
     <lb/>
     The argument was used to get the support 
     <lb/>
     of the opponents of railways in this House 
     <lb/>
     against the Federation. Sir, it would appear 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. President of the Council, and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Provincial Secretary and the other 
     <lb/>
     members of the Government, who are anti- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     railway in their views, have been altogether 
     <lb/>
     mistaken, and that we are merely going to 
     <lb/>
     build up another gigantic railway monopoly 
     <lb/>
     for fraudulent purposes. They may all be 
     <lb/>
     deceived by this imaginary project, and it 
     <lb/>
     would seem too, sir, that Mr. WATKIN, pos<lb break="no"/>sessing the wiles of MEPHISTOPHELES, had 
     <lb/>
     hoodwinked the Governor General, and the 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Secretary, and caused them to fall 
     <lb/>
     into the trap also. Nay, further, it would 
     <lb/>
     appear that his wiles had reached the Throne 
     <lb/>
     itself, for Her Majesty has expressed herself 
     <lb/>
     in the speech to Parliament in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. (Hear, hear.)

    nothing more than a Grand Trunk job? My

     hon. friend opposite sonorously cries "Order," 
     <lb/>
     when I come to deal with his late colleague's 
     <lb/>
     arguments as the only answer he can give. 
     <lb/>
     Does he suppose I am going to allow a grave 
     <lb/>
     charge of such a nature to go unanswered ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—If I clled "Order," 
     <lb/>
     it was because I considered that Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     ought not to have been mentioned in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the term " hoodwink." Her 
     <lb/>
     advisers were the responsible parties. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—I repeat that the Speech 
     <lb/>
     from the Throne which we have received to<lb break="no"/>day, and to which I have a perfect right to 
     <lb/>
     refer, does not treat this measure as anything 
     <lb/>
     akin to a Grand Trunk job. It is really presum<lb break="no"/>ing too much on the part of my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga to get up and say in effect to the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House : " You know nothing 
     <lb/>
     about this scheme ; you cannot see or under<lb break="no"/>stand what it really is; but my astuteness 
     <lb/>
     enables me to see that it is nothing more than 
     <lb/>
     a mere railway job." (Laughter.) Does 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member really believe what he 
     <lb/>
     has stated ? Does he really believe that the 
     <lb/>
     whole project is l'or the benefit of the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk ? It is a most unworthy course for him 
     <lb/>
     to pursue to endeavor to bring old prejudices 
     <lb/>
     against the Grand Trunk Company, to bear 
     <lb/>
     in the manner he has been doing ; prejudices 
     <lb/>
     and animosities based upon stories that have 
     <lb/>
     been repeated until a further reference to 
     <lb/>
     them seems almost childish. But it is not 
     <lb/>
     possible that any honorable member's judg<lb break="no"/>ment can be carried away by those little 
     <lb/>
     appeals to side issues, on a question of this

     important nature. What does the Speech

     greatest statesmen of England, whose names

     are identified with the history of the nation. 
     <lb/>
     What said Lord DERBY in reference to 
     <lb/>
     Confederation ? Does he consider it to 
     <lb/>
     emanate from a mere clique of railway 
     <lb/>
     speculators ? Speaking of the relation of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to the United States—and his remarks 
     <lb/>
     come in most opportunely in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the observations I made at the outset— 
     <lb/>
     speaking of defending the upper lakes with 
     <lb/>
     armed vessels, the noble lord says:—

     I do not ask Her Majesty's Government what

     will be deeply responsible if they are not fully 
     <lb/>
     awake to the position in which this country is 
     <lb/>
     placed by these two acts of the United States. If 
     <lb/>
     the preponderating force upon the lakes should be 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of the United States, it could only be 
     <lb/>
     used for purposes of aggression. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     An attack on the part of Canada upon the United

     <lb/>
     and assailable as it is by land, unless there be a

     this country, I should think it a matter of much

     more doubtful policy and advantage ; but I per<lb break="no"/>ceive with satisfaction that no such wish is enter<lb break="no"/>tained. Perhaps it is premature to discuss at this

     moment resolutions not yet submitted to the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent legislatures ; but hope I see in the terms 
     <lb/>
     of that Federation an earnest desire on the part 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces to maintain for themselves the 
     <lb/>
     blessing of the connection with this country, and 
     <lb/>
     a determined and deliberate preference for mon<lb break="no"/>archical over republican institutions.

     And yet my honorable friend from Hochelaga

     presumes to stand up here and tell us, in

     <lb/>
     are deceived with the idea that we are going 
     <lb/>
     to establish a great nation or Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and that there is nothing of that 
     <lb/>
     kind in it; and he appeals to prejudices for<lb break="no"/>merly entertained by members on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House, in order that he may induce them 
     <lb/>
     to withdraw their support from the important 
     <lb/>
     measure which the Government has brought 
     <lb/>
     down, and which the greatest statesmen of

     gamation of the Northern Provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     America. I heartily concur with all that has 
     <lb/>
     been said by my noble friend the mover of this 
     <lb/>
     address in his laudation of that project. It is, 
     <lb/>
     my lords, a most interesting contemplation that 
     <lb/>
     that project has arisen and has been approved by 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's Government. It is certainly con<lb break="no"/>trary to what might be considered the old 
     <lb/>
     maxims of government in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     colonies, that we should here express, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Crown itself should express satisfaction at a 
     <lb/>
     measure which tends to bind together in almost in<lb break="no"/>dependent power our colonies in North America. 
     <lb/>
     We do still believe that though thus banded 
     <lb/>
     together they will recognize the value of British 
     <lb/>
     connection, and that while they will be safer in 
     <lb/>
     this amalgamation we shall be as safe in their 
     <lb/>
     fealty. The measure will, no doubt, my lords, 
     <lb/>
     require much prudent consideration and great at<lb break="no"/>tention to prevent susceptibilities. It will have 
     <lb/>
     to deal with several British provinces, but with a 
     <lb/>
     race almost foreign in their habits and origin. I 
     <lb/>
     do hope it will ultimately succeed, and that the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians forming part of this great in<lb break="no"/>tegral North British American empire will have 
     <lb/>
     as much security and happiness as they can 
     <lb/>
     attain.

            <p>Those who say that the people throughout 
     <lb/>the country are opposed to this measure, I am 
     <lb/>satisfied, know very little what the sentiment 
     <lb/>of the country is. I believe there is a deep- 
     <lb break="yes"/>rooted sentiment of approbation of the steps 
     <lb/>that have been taken. I know that those 
     <lb/>who are perhaps most fearful with reference 
     <lb/>to it, and whose interests are perhaps most in 
     <lb/>jeopardy—the English speaking minority in 
     <lb/>Lower Canada—have considered it carefully, 
     <lb/>and with all their prejudices against it at the 
     <lb/>outset, are now warmly in its favor. I speak 
     <lb/>particularly of those who have great interests 
     <lb/>at stake in the community which I represent 
     <lb/>—the great and varied interests of commerce, 
     <lb/>trade, banking, manufactures and material 
     <lb/>progress generally, which are supposed to 
     <lb/>centre in the city of Montreal. These men— 
     <lb/>and there are none more competent in the 
     <lb/>province—have considered the scheme in a 
     <lb/>calm and business-like way, and have deliber<lb break="no"/>ately come to the conclusion that it is calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to promote the best interests and greatly 
     <lb/>enhance the prosperity of this country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Well knowing that they are to be in a 
     <lb/>minority in the Local Legislature, and to be cut 
     <lb/>off, as it were, from those of their own race 
     <lb/>and religion in Upper Canada, yet, after con<lb break="no"/>sidering how the change is to affect the im<lb break="no"/>portant interests which they have at stake, 
     <lb/>they are prepared to cast in their lot with the 
     <lb/>measure, and endeavor to make it work har<lb break="no"/>moniously. (Hear, hear.) And I believe, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, that we have not a day to lose 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     in carrying out the project. I believe the 
     <lb/>
     question of preparing for the defence of this 
     <lb/>
     country is an imminent one. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     There is not, I repeat, a day or an hour to be 
     <lb/>
     lost, and I believe that if this country is put 
     <lb/>
     into a proper condition of defence, the union 
     <lb/>
     will be the best safeguard we can have. If 
     <lb/>
     our neighbors see that we have the means of 
     <lb/>
     causing them to sit down on our frontier and 
     <lb/>
     spend a summer before they can hope to make 
     <lb/>
     any impression upon the country, we will then 
     <lb/>
     be in a pretty good condition to defend our<lb break="no"/>selves. I trust that the blessings of peace 
     <lb/>
     may long be preserved to us, that the good 
     <lb/>
     feeling which ought to subsist between Can<lb break="no"/>ada and the United States may never be in<lb break="no"/>terrupted ; that two kindred nations which 
     <lb/>
     have so many ties, so many interests, and so 
     <lb/>
     many associations in common, may never be<lb break="no"/>come enemies, and I think that we ought to make 
     <lb/>
     every honorable concession in order to avert 
     <lb/>
     the calamities of war. No man can appre<lb break="no"/>ciate the blessings of peace more than I do, 
     <lb/>
     and no one is more alive to the horrors of war 
     <lb/>
     than I am. But at the same time we cannot 
     <lb/>
     conceal from ourselves the fact that within 
     <lb/>
     the last three or four years we have sev<lb break="no"/>eral times been seriously threatened. It 
     <lb/>
     is not in the power any of any man to say 
     <lb/>
     when the cloud, which so darkly over<lb break="no"/>shadows us, may burst in full fury on our 
     <lb/>
     heads, and those who have the direction of 
     <lb/>
     the destinies of this country ought to be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to do all that in them lies to place it in 
     <lb/>
     a position to meet that event. We cannot 
     <lb/>
     recede from the position we have assumed. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot go back, we must go forward ; 
     <lb/>
     and it is certain to my mind that if what has 
     <lb/>
     now been undertaken is not consummated, we 
     <lb/>
     will regret it in years to come. I have but to 
     <lb/>
     add one word more, and I must apologize to 
     <lb/>
     the House for the time I have already occu<lb break="no"/>pied. (Cries of "Go on.") I am afraid I 
     <lb/>
     have very much transgressed the limits I had 
     <lb/>
     assigned to myself. There is but one point 
     <lb/>
     more, and I have done. My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     opposite (Hon. Mr. DORION) says that this 
     <lb/>
     scheme is ing to ruin us financially—that it 
     <lb/>
     is financially unfair. But he has failed to 
     <lb/>
     point out in what feature this can be regarded 
     <lb/>
     as financially injurious to any particular sec<lb break="no"/>tion. There can be nothing fairer to my 
     <lb/>
     mind than that, in forming a partnership be<lb break="no"/>tween these five provinces, the amount of the 
     <lb/>
     debt should be equalised at the time the part<lb break="no"/>nership is formed, and that whatever one is 
     <lb/>
     short should be made up by an annual grant 
     <lb/>
     to the other, not an increasing one but a fixed 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="416" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-22_Page_0416.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">416</fw>
        

     sum. There can be nothing unfair in the 
     <lb/>
     application of such a principle as that. Of 
     <lb/>
     course the interest on the debt, whatever it 
     <lb/>
     may be, must be met by taxation. " And," 
     <lb/>
     says my honorable friend, " the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are less able to pay taxation than we 
     <lb/>
     are, and therefore the great bulk of the taxa<lb break="no"/>tion will have to come out of the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of Upper and Lower Canada, and particularly 
     <lb/>
     the merchants of the city of Montreal." Well,  
     <lb/>
     sir, is not this just ? Is it not fair that the 
     <lb/>
     richest portion of the community should pay 
     <lb/>
     the most taxes ? Does my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     mean to say that those who consume most 
     <lb/>
     ought not to pay most to the revenue ? And 
     <lb/>
     if the people of Upper and Lower Canada are 
     <lb/>
     larger consumers than the people of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, ought they not to contribute ac<lb break="no"/>cording to their consumption to the revenue ? 
     <lb/>
     "But, oh," says my honorable friend, "the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Lower Provinces get their 
     <lb/>
     80 cents per head, and we get no more, 
     <lb/>
     although we are much larger contributors 
     <lb/>
     to the revenue." And, he adds, "the 
     <lb/>
     amount to be derived from the contribu<lb break="no"/>tions to the revenue by the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will be very infinitesimal." But grant<lb break="no"/>ed, for argument's sake, that this is so, I think 
     <lb/>
     we ought not to undervalue in this discussion 
     <lb/>
      the collateral advantage which the control of 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries will give to the united govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the union to be formed. Remember 
     <lb/>
      that these fisheries will form an important 
     <lb/>
     part in the future negotiations with the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States in reference to reciprocity, which 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada attaches so much importance 
     <lb/>
     to. Hence Canada in this union will have 
     <lb/>
     the control of the policy in regard to the con<lb break="no"/>cession of fishing rights to the American 
     <lb/>
     Government. And it is in this respect that 
     <lb/>
     the future commercial position of the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada farmer and the Lower Canada mer<lb break="no"/>chant will be enhanced by the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     concession of the fisheries will procure for 
     <lb/>
     them advantages in other branches of trade ; 
     <lb/>
     for I repeat that the future policy will be di<lb break="no"/>rected in a great measure by the influence 
     <lb/>
     wielded by Canada in the Confederation.— 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) My honorable friend, however, 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say, "But you are about to incur a 
     <lb/>
     large amount of debt. Lower Canada entered 
     <lb/>
     into the present union with a debt of only 
     <lb/>
     $300,000 or $400,000, and the united debt 
     <lb/>
     of the two provinces is now $67,000,000." 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, this is quite true. But Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, when she entered the union, had only 
     <lb/>
     a population of 600,000, and Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     a population of 400,000. There was not at 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
      

     that time a mile of railway ; now there are 
     <lb/>
     upwards of 2,000. (Hear, hear.) There was 
     <lb/>
     hardly a light-house, and see how the St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence and lakes are lighted now from Lake 
     <lb/>
     Superior to Belleisle. (Hear, hear.) She went 
     <lb/>
     into the union without a canal, and she has 
     <lb/>
     now the finest canal system in the world. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)  She had no educational sys<lb break="no"/>tem, and look at the state of education among 
     <lb/>
     us at the present time. (Hear, hear.) She 
     <lb/>
     was without a municipal system, and look at 
     <lb/>
     the municipal institutions of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     as they are to be found to-day. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     She went into the union with the seigniorial 
     <lb/>
     tenure grinding as it were the people, and 
     <lb/>
     weighing down the industry and enterprise of 
     <lb/>
     the country ; and has not the seigniorial tenure 
     <lb/>
     been abolished ? (Hear, hear.) Does not my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend see the advantages of all 
     <lb/>
     these reforms and improvements ? And does 
     <lb/>
     not my honorable friend know that of the 
     <lb/>
     $62,000,000 which is regarded as Canada's 
     <lb/>
     proportion of the joint debt, $49,000,000 and 
     <lb/>
     more have been actually expended in and are 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     friend think we can safely continue in our 
     <lb/>
     present position of commercial dependence on 
     <lb/>
     the United States? Shall we be denied ac<lb break="no"/>cess to the seaboard for a bale of goods or a 
     <lb/>
     bag of letters ? Are we to be for all time to 
     <lb/>
     come dependent on the fiscal legislation of the 
     <lb/>
     United States ? Is it to come to this, that in 
     <lb/>
     the winter season the Upper Canada farmer 
     <lb/>
     shall have no means whereby he can send a 
     <lb/>
     barrel of flour, or the Lower Canada mer<lb break="no"/>chant a bale of goods, to the seaboard, with<lb break="no"/>out the leave of the United States ? Is my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend disposed to leave us in this 
     <lb/>
     condition of commercial d dency for ever ? 
     <lb/>
     I can hardly believe he will deliberately say 
     <lb/>
     that we are to continue in such circumstances 
     <lb/>
     as these—that under no conditions shall the 
     <lb/>
     expense of constructing the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way be incurred. I believe with him that 
     <lb/>
     that work is a great and grave undertaking, 
     <lb/>
     and one that will involve a serious charge  on 
     <lb/>
     the wealth of the country. But then I con<lb break="no"/>tend that it is one which we cannot avoid— 
     <lb/>
     it is a necessity. We must have it. It is 
     <lb/>
     called for by military reasons and commercial 
     <lb/>
     necessity, and the date of its construction can<lb break="no"/>not safely be postponed. Why, what have we 
     <lb/>
     not seen within a very recent period ? Re<lb break="no"/>strictions have been put on goods sent through 
     <lb/>
     the United States, by the establishment of 
     <lb/>
     consular certificates, to such an extent that 
     <lb/>
     you could not send a bale of goods through 
     <lb/>
     the States without accompanying it with one 
     <lb/>
     of these certificates, the cost of which I am 
     <lb/>
     told was nearly $2—perhaps more than the 
     <lb/>
     worth of the package, or more than the cost 
     <lb/>
     of the freight. (Hear, hear.) Still further, 
     <lb/>
     the Senate of the United States had also be<lb break="no"/>fore them a motion to consider under what 
     <lb/>
     regulations foreign merchandise is allowed to 
     <lb/>
    pass in bond through the neighbouring coun<lb break="no"/>   
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
         

     try ; and this was evidently done with an in 
     <lb/>
     tention of abolishing the system under which 
     <lb/>
     goods were permitted to pass in bond from 
     <lb/>
     England through the United States. I do 
     <lb/>
     not hesitate to say that if the bonding system 
     <lb/>
     were done away with, half the merchants 
     <lb/>
     in Canada would be seriously embarrassed 
     <lb/>
     if not ruined for the time. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     In the winter season you could not send a 
     <lb/>
     barrel of flour to England—you could not 
     <lb/>
     receive a single package of goods therefrom. 
     <lb/>
     The merchants would have to lay in a twelve 
     <lb/>
     months' stock of goods, and the farmer would 
     <lb/>
     be dependent on the condition of the market 
     <lb/>
     in spring, and would be compelled to force 
     <lb/>
     the sale of his produce at that moment, 
     <lb/>
     whether there was a profitable market for it 
     <lb/>
     then or not, instead of having as now a mar<lb break="no"/>ket at all seasons, as well in England as the 
     <lb/>
     United States. So that whatever sacrifices 
     <lb/>
     attach to the construction of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway, we must have it, seeing that it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible for us to remain in our present 
     <lb/>
     position of isolation and suspense. It is one 
     <lb/>
     of the unfortunate incidents of our position 
     <lb/>
     which we cannot get rid of. It will be a 
     <lb/>
     costly undertaking, but it is one we must 
     <lb/>
     make up our minds to pay for, and the sooner 
     <lb/>
     we set about its construction the better. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">HON. MR. ROSE</persName>—I have just done. I do 
     <lb/>
     not hope to convert my honorable friend ; but 
     <lb/>
     I desired to show how indispensable and how 
     <lb/>
     desirable those communications are, and how 
     <lb/>
     necessary it is that they should be effected. 
     <lb/>
     No one can foresee what the future of the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring States will be—whether they will 
     <lb/>
     be reconstructed as one union, or split up into 
     <lb/>
     two or more confederacies. They have a 
     <lb/>
     dark and uncertain future before them, for 
     <lb/>
     no one can doubt that no matter what their 
     <lb/>
     condition as regards reconstruction may be, 
     <lb/>
     they will have an enormous load of debt 
     <lb/>
     weighing upon them, and that they will have 
     <lb/>
     to encounter great difficulties before they 
     <lb/>
     finally settle down into the same state of per<lb break="no"/>manent security as formerly. If we are alive 
     <lb/>
     to the natural advantages of our position, 
     <lb/>
     unless we deliberately throw them away, we 
     <lb/>
     can, whatever that future may be, secure a 
     <lb/>
     profitable intercourse with them. Unless the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence and Ottawa cease to flow, and 
     <lb/>
     the lakes dry up, those roads to the ocean are 
     <lb/>
     the natural outlets for the west, and we can 
     <lb/>
     turn them to good account. We know some<lb break="no"/>

thing of the great productiveness of the West<lb break="no"/>ern States. There is, in fact, no limit to that 
     <lb/>
     productiveness, and the necessity of their hav<lb break="no"/>ing another outlet to the sea, without being 
     <lb/>
     altogether dependent upon New York and Bos<lb break="no"/>ton, is to my mind very plain. This neces<lb break="no"/>sity of the powerful western interests must 
     <lb/>
     have a controlling influence in the commer<lb break="no"/>cial policy of the United States ; and if we 
     <lb/>
     can direct the trade of the Western States 
     <lb/>
     down the St. Lawrence by giving them ad<lb break="no"/>ditional facilities, it cannot be doubted that 
     <lb/>
     we shall find therein a great element of secu<lb break="no"/>rity for the future peace of the two countries. 
     <lb/>
     This House will remember the resolutions, of 
     <lb/>
     a couple of years ago, of the states of Wis<lb break="no"/>consin and Illinois in reference to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. These resolutions contained one or two 
     <lb/>
     facts which are of the greatest importance, 
     <lb/>
     as showing the necessity existing in the Wes<lb break="no"/>tern States for a channel of communication 
     <lb/>
     through the St. Lawrence. The memorial 
     <lb/>
     founded on it stated these facts :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     With one-tenth of the arable surface under cul<lb break="no"/>tivation, the product of wheat of the North-Wes<lb break="no"/>tern States in 1862 is estimated at 150,000,000 
     <lb/>
     of bushels ; and from our own State of Illinois 
     <lb/>
     alone there has been shipped annually for the 
     <lb/>
     last two years, a surplus of food sufficient to feed 
     <lb/>
     ten millions of people. For several years past a 
     <lb/>
     lamentable waste of crops actually harvested has 
     <lb/>
     occurred in consequence of the inability of the 
     <lb/>
     railways and canals leading to the seaboard to 
     <lb/>
     take off the excess. The North-West seems al<lb break="no"/>ready to have arrived at a point of production 
     <lb/>
     beyond any possible capacity for transportation 
     <lb/>
     which can be provided, except by the great na<lb break="no"/>tural outlets. It has for two successive years 
     <lb/>
     crowded the canals and railways with more 
     <lb/>
     than 100,000,000 of bushels of rain, besides 
     <lb/>
     immense quantities of other provisions, and vast 
     <lb/>
     numbers of cattle and hogs. This increasing 
     <lb/>
     volume of business cannot be maintained without 
     <lb/>
     recourse to the natural outlet of the lakes. The 
     <lb/>
     future prosperity of these states bordering on the 
     <lb/>
     great lakes depends in a great measure on cheap 
     <lb/>
     transportation to foreign markets ; hence they 
     <lb/>
     are virtally intemsted in the question of opening 
     <lb/>
     the St. Lawrence, the great natural thoroughfare 
     <lb/>
     from the lakes to the ocean, through, and by 
     <lb/>
     which the people of England may enlarge their 
     <lb/>
     supplies o breadstuffs and provisions, greatly ex<lb break="no"/>ceeding the quantity heretofore received from 
     <lb/>
     the United States, at one-fourth less cost than it 
     <lb/>
     has heretofore been obtained. From actual ex<lb break="no"/>perience derived from shipments of Indian corn 
     <lb/>from Chicago to Liverpool, it is shown that the 
     <lb/>freight charges often covered seven-eighths of the 
     <lb/>value of the bushel of corn at Liverpool ; more 
     <lb/>than one-half of the cost of wheat is also often 
     <lb/>consumed by the present very inadequate means 
     <lb/>of transportation. The European customer for 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
  

     our breadstuffs determines their price in all our 
     <lb/>
     markets. The surplus of grain derived from the 
     <lb/>
     North-West is fifty or sixty millions of bushels 
     <lb/>
     beyond the demand of the Eastern States, and 
     <lb/>
     when that surplus is carried to their markets, the 
     <lb/>
     foreign quotations establish the value of the en<lb break="no"/>tire harvest. The interior of North America is 
     <lb/>
     drained by the St. Lawrence, which furnishes for 
     <lb/>
     the country bordering upon the lakes a natural 
     <lb/>
     highway to the sea. Through its deep channel 
     <lb/>
     must pass the agricultural productions of the 
     <lb/>
     vast lake region. The commercial spirit of the 
     <lb/>
     age forbids that international jealousy should in<lb break="no"/>terfere with great natural thoroughfares, and the 
     <lb/>
     governments of Great Britain and the United 
     <lb/>
     States will appreciate this spirit and cheerfully 
     <lb/>
     yield to its influence. The great avenue to the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic through the St. Lawrence being once 
     <lb/>
     opened to its largest capability, the laws of 
     <lb/>
     trade, which it has now been the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government to obstruct, will carry the 
     <lb/>
     commerce of the North-West through it.

     I say, then, give us the Intercolonial Railway, 
     <lb/>
     give us the command of the St. Lawrence, 
     <lb/>
     give us a government by which we can direct 
     <lb/>
     our national policy, give us the control of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, and we will be able to secure such 
     <lb/>
     reciprocal trade with the United States for 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada as it requires. But if we are 
     <lb/>
     disunited—if the Lower Provinces retain the 
     <lb/>
     control of the fisheries, and Canada has nothing 
     <lb/>
     to give in exchange for the concession she 
     <lb/>
     seeks from the United States in the way of 
     <lb/>
     commercial intercourse, in breadstuffs and 
     <lb/>
     otherwise—I say that in such a case as this 
     <lb/>
     we are very much hampered indeed. I have 
     <lb/>
     detained the House very much longer than I 
     <lb/>
     intended, and I fear that I have exhausted 
     <lb/>
     the patience of honorable members. (Cries 
     <lb/>
     of " No, no," and "go on.") I have fallen 
     <lb/>
     into the same error which has been attributed 
     <lb/>
     to others. But there is a single observation 
     <lb/>
     I desire to offer in conclusion, and it has 
     <lb/>
     reference to the demand made by some honor<lb break="no"/>able members, that there should be a dissolu<lb break="no"/>tion before the question is finally decided. 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, time presses. We have, and I can<lb break="no"/>not repeat it too often, not a day or an hour 
     <lb/>

     a railway from such point as shall be con<lb break="no"/>sidered on the whole best, both in reference

     regard to the question of an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people, I would just ask, is there a single 
     <lb/>
     member of this House who does not already 
     <lb/>
     know what is the feeling of his constituents 
     <lb/>
     on this question, who is not aware whether 
     <lb/>
     they are or the union or against the union ? 
     <lb/>
     Is there a member who does not know what 
     <lb/>
     his constituents desire in respect to it, and 
     <lb/>
     who is not himself prepared to take the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of his vote ? I believe there is 
     <lb/>
     not. And does any honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     think that if there was to be a dissolution and 
     <lb/>
     an appeal to the country on this question, the 
     <lb/>
     elections would turn upon the scheme itself, 
     <lb/>
     that there would not be individual predilec<lb break="no"/>tions, personal questions, and local questions 
     <lb/>
     affecting the elections, far more than Confed<lb break="no"/>eration ? And would it not be most anomalous 
     <lb/>
     to elect a Parliament, the first vote given by 
     <lb/>
     which would be its own death ? The sole 
     <lb/>
     business of the new Parliament would be to 
     <lb/>
     agree upon a Constitution which should 
     <lb/>
     annihilate itself. There is something so 
     <lb/>
     anomalous, almost unconstitutional and absurd 
     <lb/>
     in such a step, that I think it could not com<lb break="no"/>mend itself to the common sense of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I think we are already sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     aware of what the feeling—the mature and 
     <lb/>
     dispassionate feeling—the calm conviction 
     <lb/>
     and views of the country are, and that too 
     <lb/>
     after an intelligent appreciation of it in all its 
     <lb/>
     bearings, and I do not think there is anything 
     <lb/>
     to be gained, but on the contrary much to be 
     <lb/>
     imperilled by the expense and delay of an 
     <lb/>
     election. I know that in my own constituency 
     <lb/>
     —not the least important in the province—this 
     <lb/>
     conclusion has been come to, not from any in<lb break="no"/>considerate love of change—not from any 
     <lb/>
     ardent and temporary impulse or vague aspir<lb break="no"/>ations to be part in name of a future nation, 
     <lb/>
     at the risk of imperilling their relations with 
     <lb/>
     England or of injury to their interests, but I 
     <lb/>
     believe the scheme is stamped with their ap<lb break="no"/>proval, because their reason and judgment 
     <lb/>
     convince them that it is not only desirable but 
     <lb/>
     a necessity of our condition. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I again apologise for the time I have occupied 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House, and express my 
     <lb/>
     thanks for the kind consideration honorable 
     <lb/>
     members have extended to me. (Loud cheers.)

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I would like to say 
     <lb/>
     a word, and only a word, before the motion 
     <lb/>
     to adjourn the debate is put. I have listened 
     <lb/>
     with very great attention to the speech of my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Montreal Centre, a 
     <lb/>
     large portion of which was devoted to the

            <fw type="num">420</fw>
        

     subject of the defences of the country. I ad<lb break="no"/>mit to the full the importance of that subject, 
     <lb/>
     but I maintain that as yet we are not in a 
     <lb/>
     position to give the proper weight to the ar<lb break="no"/>guments of my honorable friend and of other 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen on that question, that 
     <lb/>
     in fact we are hardly in a position to consider 
     <lb/>
     the subject at all ; and I do maintain that it 
     <lb/>
     is hardly fair to introduce it as an element 
     <lb/>
     into this discussion, so long as the Government 
     <lb/>
     withhold from us the official information 
     <lb/>
     which may be assumed to be in their posses<lb break="no"/>sion on that subject. I have risen, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     to express the hope that the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the Treasury benches will see the 
     <lb/>
     propriety of submitting to this House the 
     <lb/>
     fullest possible information on that subject. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I am sure my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     who has just taken his seat will himself admit 
     <lb/>
     the force of what I am now urging, and that 
     <lb/>
     we cannot give the consideration he asks to 
     <lb/>
     that branch of the general subject of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration without having the amplest inform<lb break="no"/>ation that the Government can give us with 
     <lb/>
     regard to it. I would, therefore, express the 
     <lb/>
     desire—which I am sure is shared by a large 
     <lb/>
     number of the honorable members who sit 
     <lb/>
     around me—that at once, before we proceed 
     <lb/>
     further in this debate, this important inform<lb break="no"/>ation should be submitted to the House in a 
     <lb/>
     distinct form. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—My <choice><sic>honor<lb break="no"/>rable</sic><corr>honorable</corr></choice> friend from Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     HOLTON) has very properly called the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Government to the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     having laid before this House information as 
     <lb/>
     to the amount we shall have to appropriate 
     <lb/>
     for the defences of the country. It is well 
     <lb/>
     known that Imperial officers were sent out 
     <lb/>
     some time ago to make a survey, and report 
     <lb/>
     on the defensive condition of this country, 
     <lb/>
     and the best points at which to build fortifi<lb break="no"/>cations—the <hi rendition="simple:italic">points d'appui</hi>, where in cases of 
     <lb/>
     disaster we should be obliged to take shelter, 
     <lb/>
     if the enemy drove us into our garrisons. The 
     <lb/>
     report of these offficers was made before I left 
     <lb/>
     office, more than a year ago. Surely during 
     <lb/>
     that time, with such a loyal administration as 
     <lb/>
     that composed of the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     now on the Treasury benches, the secret of 
     <lb/>
     the amount of the appropriation that will be 
     <lb/>
     required at our hands has not been kept from 
     <lb/>
     them. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me that 
     <lb/>
     this is a branch of the question to which we 
     <lb/>
     must address ourselves, before we are in a 
     <lb/>
     condition to deal satisfactorily with the gen<lb break="no"/>eral subject. It is a principle of the British 
     <lb/>
     Constitution that the appropriation of any 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
         

     moneys from the taxes paid by the people, 
     <lb/>
    shall be at the disposal of Parliament. We 
     <lb/>have a right therefore to know, at the earliest 
     <lb/>possible period, before we go blindly into this 
     <lb/>scheme of Confederation, what we are called 
     <lb/>upon to appropriate in connection with this 
     <lb/>matter. (Hear, hear.) And there is another 
     <lb/>point on which, as yet, we have had no infor<lb break="no"/>mation, beyond what was given tonight when 
     <lb/>the hon. member for South Oxford answered 
     <lb/>me in his curt way. The Government may as 
     <lb/>well at an early date—I mean the portion of 
     <lb/>the Government who will have to speak for 
     <lb/>Upper Canada, and who are especially respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the acts of the Administration with 
     <lb/>reference to that section of the province— 
     <lb/>give their attention to the question how far 
     <lb/>the Catholics of Upper Canada are to be 
     <lb/>placed in the position of maintaining their 
     <lb/>schools and claiming their portion of the 
     <lb/>public funds, and enjoying generally the 
     <lb/>same privileges which are to be enjoyed, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the declaration of the Honorable 
     <lb/>Attorney General East, by the Protestants of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada. I express no opinion at this 
     <lb/>time as to the propriety of the demands made 
     <lb/>by the Protestants of Lower Canada, or as to 
     <lb/>what I shall be prepared to do when that ques<lb break="no"/>tion comes up. Nor do I express now any 
     <lb/>opinion as to the propriety of giving the Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics of Upper Canada more rights than 
     <lb/>they have got. But I say the Government 
     <lb/>ought to address themselves at once to the 
     <lb/>question, whether they are to make the same 
     <lb/>provision for the Catholics of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>as for the Protestants of Lower Canada. This 
     <lb/>is a matter which comes home to the feelings 
     <lb/>of the Catholics of Upper Canada, and they 
     <lb/>have here at this moment delegates to express 
     <lb/>their opinions. No doubt, to enforce what 
     <lb/>they conceive to be their own rights, they 
     <lb/>will use as a lever the proposition to extend 
     <lb/>to the Protestants of Lower Canada the priv<lb break="no"/>ileges which they claim as their due. And 
     <lb/>depend upon it, that when the time comes for 
     <lb/>the Protestants of Lower Canada to ask what 
     <lb/>they assert to be their rights, they will be ex<lb break="no"/>pected to stand up also for the Catholics of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada, and to deal out to them the 
     <lb/>same justice which they expect the Catholics 
     <lb/>of Lower Canada to extend to them.

     MR. A. MACKENZIE resumed the ad<lb break="no"/>journed debate. He said — Before proceed<lb break="no"/>ing, Mr. SPEAKER, to discuss the measure of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation itself, I think it desirable to 
     <lb/>
     revert for a moment to the position which 
     <lb/>
     we have occupied, in discussing those con<lb break="no"/>stitutional questions that have so long separ<lb break="no"/>ated parties, and involved the two sections 
     <lb/>
     of the province in serious dissensions. I do 
     <lb/>
     this to meet the charges of inconsistency 
     <lb/>
     brought against myself and others, because 
     <lb/>
     we support the present Coalition Government 
     <lb/>
     with a view to obtain the solution of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties with which we have had to 
     <lb/>
     contend—in a way not perhaps hitherto 
     <lb/>
     advocated very extensively, especially in that 
     <lb/>
     part of the province to which I myself 
     <lb/>
     belong. Since I had the honor of having a 
     <lb/>
     seat in this House, I have never advocated 
     <lb/>
     representation by population as the sole 
     <lb/>
     measure I would accept as a settlement of 
     <lb/>
     those difficulties. In the first speech I ever 
     <lb/>
     made in this House, I used the following 
     <lb/>
     language :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not myself bound down to representation 
     <lb/>
     by population as the only possible measure. If 
     <lb/>
     the opponents of that measure can suggest any 
     <lb/>
     other remedy, I am quite willing to give it a can<lb break="no"/>did consideration ; and I am quite sure that the 
     <lb/>
     large constituency I represent will support me in 
     <lb/>
     considering any measure which will place it out of 
     <lb/>
     the power of the Government of the day to per<lb break="no"/>petrate sectional injustice ; but until such a 
     <lb/>
     remedy is suggested, I feel bound to advocate 
     <lb/>
