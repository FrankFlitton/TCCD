            <!-- <p>
     respect to Upper Canada or the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     HON. MR. CAMPBELL said it was out of 
     <lb/>
     deference to the interests of the British Cana<lb break="no"/>dians of Lower Canada, who had some fear 
     <lb/>
     that they might not be sufficiently protected 
     <lb/>
     otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. RYAN objected to this mode of 
     <lb/>
     selection, as calculated to perpetuate differences 
     <lb/>
     of nationality and creed, and thought it would 
     <lb/>
     be better to leave the selection unconditionally 
     <lb/>
     to the Crown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [After this a number of questions were put 
     <lb/>
     to Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL upon various points 
     <lb/>
     of detail, and a cross fire was kept up from 
     <lb/>
     both sides of the House, which made it next to 
     <lb/>
     impossible to keep track of the proceedings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Among the questions asked was one as to 
     <lb/>
     whether the local governments should be con<lb break="no"/>stituted before the Constitution of the Confe<lb break="no"/>deration became law. The resolution concern<lb break="no"/>ing this point seemed involved and contradic<lb break="no"/>tory, as it supposed some part of the plan to 
     <lb/>
     be in force, which depended upon the action 
     <lb/>
     of local governments not themselves in exist<lb break="no"/>ence.]<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     HON. MR. CAMPBELL promised to give 
     <lb/>
     an explanation at the next sitting of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. SANBORN then addressed the 
     <lb/>
     House for a few minutes, it being then nearly 
     <lb/>
     six o'clock. He did not declare himself directly 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the scheme as a whole, but believed 
     <lb/>
     that the abandonment of the elective principle 
     <lb/>
     in respect of the Legislative Council was a step 
     <lb/>
     backward and an unwise one. He quoted as 
     <lb/>
     a proof the opinion of the Premier of the 
     <lb/>
     Government expressed two years ago, and 
     <lb/>
     thought it not a little strange he should so 
     <lb/>
     readily have changed his views<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>Cries of six o'clock. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Further debate was then postponed until 
     <lb/>
     the morrow, and the House immediately 
     <lb/>
     afterwards adjourned. 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
               
     in one Government, with provisions based on 
     <lb/>
     certain Resolutions, which were adopted at 
     <lb/>
     a Conference of Delegates from the said 
     <lb/>
     Colonies, held at the city of Quebec, on the 
     <lb/>
               10th October, 1864."<ref target="#fn_01">*</ref> He said:— Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, in fulfilment of the promise made 
     <lb/>
     by the Government to Parliament at its last 
     <lb/>
     session, I have moved this resolution. I 
     <lb/>
     have had the honor of being charged, on 
     <lb/>
     behalf ot the Government, to submit a scheme 
     <lb/>
     for the Confederation of all the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces—a scheme which has 
     <lb/>
    been received, I am glad to say, with general, 
     <lb/>if not universal, approbation in Canada. 
     <lb/>The scheme, as propounded through the 
     <lb/>press, has received almost no opposition. 
     <lb/>While there may be occasionally, here and 
     <lb/>there, expressions of dissent from some of 
     <lb/>the details, yet the scheme as a whole has 
     <lb/>met with almost universal approval, and the 
     <lb/>Government has the greatest satisfaction in 
     <lb/>presenting it to this House. This subject, 
     <lb/>which now absorbs the attention of the 
     <lb/>ple of Canada, and of the whole of British 
     <lb/>North America, is not a new one. For years 
     <lb/>it has more or less attracted the attention of 
     <lb/>every statesman and politician in these prov<lb break="no"/>inces, and has been looked upon by many 
     <lb/>far-seeing politicians as being eventually the 
     <lb/>means of deciding and settling very many 
     <lb/>of the vexed questions which have retarded 
     <lb/>the prosperity of the colonies as a whole, 
     <lb/>and particularly the prosperity of Canada. 
     <lb/>The subject was pressed upon the public at<lb break="no"/>tention by a great many writers and politi<lb break="no"/>cians; but I believe the attention of the 
     <lb/>Legislature was first formally called to it by 
     <lb/>my honorable friend the Minister of Finance. 
     <lb/>Some years ago, in an elaborate speech, my 
     <lb/>hon. friend, while an independent member 
     <lb/>of Parliament, before bein connected with 
     <lb/>any Government, pressed his views on the 
     <lb/>Legislature at great length and with his 
     <lb/>usual force. But the subject was not taken 
     <lb/>up by any party as a branch of their policy, 
     <lb/>until the formation of the CARTIER-MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD Administration in 1858, when the 
     <lb/>Confederation of the colonies was announced 
     <lb/>as one of the measures which they pledged 
     <lb/>themselves to attempt, if possible, to bring 
     <lb/>to a satisfactory conclusion. In pursuance 
     <lb/>of that promise, the letter or despatch, which 
     <lb/>has been so much and so freely commented 
     <lb/>upon in the press and in this House, was 
     <lb/>addressed by three of the members of that 
     <lb/>Administration to the Colonial Office. The

            <p> subject, however,
though looked upon with <lb/>
favor by the country, and though there were <lb/>
no distinct expressions of opposition to it <lb/>
from any party, did not begin to assume its <lb/>
present proportions until last session. Then, <lb/>
men of all parties and all shades of politics <lb/>
became alarmed at the aspect of affairs.
<lb/>
They found that such was the opposition <lb/>
between the two sections of the province, <lb/>
such was the danger of impending anarchy, <lb/>
in consequence of the irreconcilable differ<lb break="no"/>ences of opinion, with respect to representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population, between Upper and <lb/>
Lower Canada, that unless some solution of <lb/>
the dificulty was arrived at, we would suffer <lb/>
under a succession of weak governments,<lb break="no"/>weak in numerical support, weak in force, <lb/>
and weak in power of doing good. All were <lb/>
alarmed at this state of affairs. We had <lb/>
election after election,—we had ministry <lb/>
after ministry,—with the same result. Par<lb break="no"/>ties were so equally balanced, that the vote <lb/>
of one member might decide the fate of the <lb/>
Administration, and the course of legislation <lb/>
for a year or a series of years. This con<lb break="no"/>dition of things was well calculated to arouse <lb/>
the earnest consideration of every lover of <lb/>
his country, and I am happy to say it had <lb/>
that effect.
None were more impressed by <lb/>
this momentous state of affairs,
and the <lb/>
grave apprehensions that existed of a state <lb/>
of anarchy destroying our credit, destroying <lb/>
our prosperity, destroying our progress, than <lb/>
were the members of this present House; <lb/>
and the leading statesmen on both sides <lb/>
seemed to have come to the common con<lb break="no"/>clusion, that some step must be taken to re<lb break="no"/>lieve the country from the dead-lock and <lb/>
inpending anarchy that hung over us.<lb break="no"/>With that view, my colleague, the Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council, made a motion founded <lb/>
on the despatch addressed to the Colonial <lb/>
Minister, to which I have referred, and a <lb/>
committee was struck, composed of gentlemen <lb/>
of both sides of the House, of all shades of <lb/>
political opinion, without any reference to <lb/>
whether they were supporters of the Admin<lb break="no"/>istration of the day or belonged to the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, for the purpose of taking into calm and <lb/>
full deliberation the evils which threatened <lb/>
the future of Canada. That motion of my <lb/>
honorable friend resulted most happily. <lb/>
The committee, by a wise provision,—and in <lb/>
order that each member of the committee <lb/>
might have an opportunity of expressing his <lb/>
opinions without being in any way compro<lb break="no"/>mised before the public, or with his party, in <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               regard either to his
political friends or to his <lb/>
political foes,—agreed that the discussion  <lb/>
should be freely entered upon without refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the political antecedents of any of <lb/>
them, and that they should sit with closed <lb/>
doors, so that they might be able to approach <lb/>
the subject frankly and in a spirit of compro<lb break="no"/>mise. The committee included most of the <lb/>
leading members of the House,—I had the <lb/>
honor myself to be one of the number,—and <lb/>
the result was that there was found an ardent <lb/>
desire—a creditable desire, I must say,—dis<lb break="no"/>played by all the members of the committee <lb/>
to approach the subject honestly, and to at<lb break="no"/>tempt to work out some solution which might <lb/>
relieve Canada from the evils under which she <lb/>
labored. The report of that committee was <lb/>
laid before the House, and then came the <lb/>
political action of the leading men of the two <lb/>
parties in this House, which ended in the <lb/>
formation of the present Government. The <lb/>
principle upon which that Government was <lb/>
formed has been announced, and is known to <lb/>
all. It was
formed for the very purpose of <lb/>
carrying out the object which has now re<lb break="no"/>ceived to a certain degree its completion, by <lb/>
the resolutions I have had the honor to place <lb/>
in your hands. As has been stated, it was not <lb/>
without a great deal of difficulty and reluct<lb break="no"/>ance that that Government was formed. The <lb/>
gentlemen who compose this Government had <lb/>
for many years been engaged in political hos<lb break="no"/>tilities to such an extent that it affected even <lb/>
their social relations. But the crisis
was <lb/>
great, the danger was imminent, and the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who now form the present Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration found it to be their duty to lay aside all <lb/>
personal feelings, to sacrifice in some degree <lb/>
their position, and even to run the risk of <lb/>
having their motives impugned, for the sake <lb/>
of arriving at some conclusion that would be <lb/>
satisfactory to the country in general. The <lb/>
present resolutions were the result. And, as <lb/>
I said before, I am proud to believe that the <lb/>
country has sanctioned, as I trust that the re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of the people in this House will <lb/>
sanction, the scheme which is now submitted <lb/>
for the future government of British North <lb/>
America. (Cheers.) Everything seemed to <lb/>
favor the project, and everything seemed to <lb/>
show that the present was the time, if ever, <lb/>
when this great union between all Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty's subjects dwelling in British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica, should be carried out. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
When the Government,
was formed, it was <lb/>
felt that the difficulties
in the way of effecting <lb/>
a union between all the British North Amer<lb break="no"/><pb n="27" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0027.jpg"/><fw type="num">27</fw>ican Colonies were great—so
great as almost, <lb/>
in the opinion of many, to make it hopeless. <lb/>
And with that view it was the policy of the <lb/>
Government, if they could not succeed in pro<lb break="no"/>curing a union between all the British North <lb/>
American Colonies, to attempt to free the <lb/>
country from the dead-lock in which we were <lb/>
placed in Upper and Lower Canada, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the
difference of opinion between <lb/>
the two sections, by having a severance to a <lb/>
certain extent of the present union between <lb/>
the two provinces of Upper and Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and the substitution of a Federal Union <lb/>
between them.   Most of us, however, I may <lb/>
say, all of us, were agreed—and I believe every <lb/>
thinking man will agree—as to the expedi<lb break="no"/>ency of effecting a union between all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and the superiority of such a design, <lb/>
if it were only practicable, over the smaller <lb/>
scheme of having a Federal
Union between <lb/>
Upper and Lower Canada alone.  By a happy <lb/>
concurrence of events, the time came when <lb/>
that proposition could be made with a hope of <lb/>
success.   By a fortunate coincidence the de<lb break="no"/>sire for union existed in the Lower Provinces, <lb/>
and a feeling of the necessity of strengthening <lb/>
themselves by collecting together the scat<lb break="no"/>tered colonies on the sea-board, had induced <lb/>
them to form a convention of their own for <lb/>
the purpose of effecting a union of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, and Prince Edward Island, the legisla<lb break="no"/>tures of those colonies having formally autho<lb break="no"/>rized their respective governments to send a <lb/>
delegation to Prince Edward Island for the <lb/>
purpose of attempting to form a union of some <lb/>
kind.   Whether the union should be federal <lb/>
or legislative was not then indicated, but a <lb/>
union of some kind was sought for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of making of themselves one people in<lb break="no"/>stead of three.   We, ascertaining that they <lb/>
were about to take such a step, and knowing <lb/>
that if we allowed the occasion to pass, if they <lb/>
did indeed break up all their present political<lb/>
organizations and form a new one, it could <lb/>
not be expected that they would again readily <lb/>
destroy the
new organization which they had <lb/>
formed,—the union of the three provinces on <lb/>
the sea-board,—and form another with Can<lb break="no"/>ada.   Knowing this, we availed ourselves of <lb/>
the opportunity, and asked if they would re<lb break="no"/>ceive a deputation from Canada, who would <lb/>
go to meet them at Charlottetown, for the <lb/>
purpose of laying before them the advantages <lb/>
of a larger and more extensive union, by the <lb/>
junction of all the provinces in one great gov<lb break="no"/>ernment under our common Sovereign. They <lb/>
            <cb/>
               at once kindly
consented to receive and hear <lb/>
us.  They did receive us cordially and gener<lb break="no"/>ously, and asked us to lay our views before <lb/>
them. We did so at some length, and so sat<lb break="no"/>isfactory to them were the reasons we gave ; so <lb/>
clearly, in their opinion, did we shew the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages of the greater union over the lesser, <lb/>
that they at once set aside their own project, <lb/>
and joined heart and hand with us in entering <lb/>
into the larger scheme, and trying to form, as <lb/>
far as they and we could, a great nation and a <lb/>
strong government.  (Cheers.)
 Encouraged <lb/>
by this arrangement, which, however, was al<lb break="no"/>together unofficial and unauthorised, we re<lb break="no"/>turned to Quebec, and then the Government <lb/>
of Canada invited the several governments of <lb/>
the sister colonies to send a deputation here <lb/>
from each of them for the
purpose of consid<lb break="no"/>ering the question, with something like au<lb break="no"/>thority from their respective governments. <lb/>
The result was, that when we met here on the <lb/>
10th of October, on the first day on which we <lb/>
assembled, after the full and free discussions <lb/>
which had taken place at Charlottetown, the <lb/>
first resolution now before this House was <lb/>
passed unanimously, being received with ac<lb break="no"/>clamation as, in the opinion of every one who<lb/>
           heard it, a
proposition which ought to receive, <lb/>
and would receive, the sanction of each gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and each people. The resolution is, <lb/>
" That the best interests and present and fu<lb break="no"/>ture prosperity of British North America <lb/>
will be promoted by a Federal Union under <lb/>
the Crown of Great Britain, provided such <lb/>
union can be effected on principles just to <lb/>
the several provinces."   It seemed to all the <lb/>
statesmen assembled—and there are great <lb/>
statesmen in the Lower Provinces, men who <lb/>
would do honor to any government and to any <lb/>
legislature of any free country enjoying re<lb break="no"/>presentative institutions—it was
clear to them <lb/>
all that the best interests and present and fu<lb break="no"/>ture prosperity of British North America <lb/>
would be promoted by a Federal Union under <lb/>
the Crown of Great Britain.   And it seems to <lb/>
me, as to them, and I think it will so appear to <lb/>
the people of this country, that, if we wish to <lb/>
be a great peeple ; if we wish to form—using <lb/>
the expression which was sneered at the other <lb/>
evening—a great nationality, commanding <lb/>
the respect of the world, able to hold our own <lb/>
against all opponents, and to defend those <lb/>
institutions we prize : if we wish to have one <lb/>
system of government, and to establish a com<lb break="no"/>mercial union,  with unrestricted free trade, <lb/>
between people of the five provinces, belong<lb break="no"/>ing, as they do, to the same nation, obeying
<lb/>
     
            <pb n="28" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0028.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">28</fw>
  
  the same Sovereign,
owning the same alle<lb break="no"/>giance, and being, for the most part, of the <lb/>
same blood and lineage : if we wish to be able <lb/>
to afford to each other the means of mutual <lb/>
defence and support against aggression and <lb/>
attack—this can only be obtained by a union <lb/>
of some kind between the scattered and weak <lb/>
boundaries composing the British North <lb/>
American Provinces. (Cheers). The very <lb/>
mention of the scheme is fitted to bring with it <lb/>
its own approbation.   Supposing that in the <lb/>
spring of the year 1865, half a million of people <lb/>
were coming from the United Kingdom to <lb/>
make Canada their home, although they <lb/>
brought only their strong arms and willing <lb/>
hearts ; though they brought neither skill nor <lb/>
experience nor wealth, would we not receive <lb/>
them with open arms, and hail their presence <lb/>
in Canada as an important addition to our <lb/>
strength ?   Butwhen , by the proposed union, <lb/>
we not only get nearly a million of people to <lb/>
join us—when they contribute not only their <lb/>
numbers, their physical strength, and their <lb/>
desire to benefit their position, but when we <lb/>
know that they consist of old-established com<lb break="no"/>munities, having a large amount of realised <lb/>
wealth, — composed of people possessed of <lb/>
skill, education and experience in the ways <lb/>
of the New World — people who are as <lb/>
much Canadians, I may say, as we are<lb break="no"/>people who are imbued with the same feelings <lb/>
of loyalty to the Queen, and the same desire <lb/>
for the continuance of the connection with <lb/>
the Mother Country as we are, and at the <lb/>
same time, have a like feeling of ardent at<lb break="no"/>tachment for this, our common country, for <lb/>
which they and we would alike fight and <lb/>
shed our blood, if necessary.   When all this <lb/>
is considered, argument is needless to prove <lb/>
the advantage of such a union. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
There were only three modes,—if I may re<lb break="no"/>turn for a moment to the difficulties with <lb/>
which Canada was surrounded,—only three <lb/>
modes that were at all suggested, by which <lb/>
the dead lock in our affairs, the anarchy we <lb/>
dreaded, and the evils which retarded our <lb/>
prosperity, could be met or averted.   One <lb/>
was the dissolution of the union between <lb/>
Upper and Lower Canada, leaving them <lb/>
as they were before the union of 1841.
<lb/>
I believe that that proposition, by itself <lb/>
had no supporters.   It was felt by every <lb/>
one that, although it was a course that <lb/>
would do away with the sectional difficulties <lb/>
which existed,—though
it would
remove the <lb/>
               pressure on
the part of the people of Upper <lb/>
     Canada for the
representation based upon<lb/>
            <cb/>
               
population,—and the jealousy of the people <lb/>
of Lower Canada lest their institutions should <lb/>
be attacked and prejudiced by that principle <lb/>
in our representation ; yet it was felt by <lb/>
every thinking man in the province that it <lb/>
would be a retrograde step, which would  <lb/>
throw back the country to nearly the same <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>position as it
occupied before the union,-<lb/>that it would lower the credit enjoyed by <lb/>
United Canada,—that it would be the break<lb break="no"/>ing up of the connection which had existed <lb/>
for nearly a quarter of a century, and, under <lb/>
which, although it had not been completely <lb/>
successful, and had not allayed altogether the <lb/>
local jealousies that had their root
in circum<lb break="no"/>stances which arose before the union, our <lb/>
province, as a
whole, had nevertheless pros<lb break="no"/>pered and increased.   It was felt that a dis<lb break="no"/>solution of the union would have destroyed <lb/>
all the credit that we had gained by being a <lb/>
united province, and would have left us two <lb/>
weak and ineffective governments, instead of <lb/>
one powerful and united peeple. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.)   The next mode suggested, was the <lb/>
granting of representation by population. <lb/>
Now, we all know the manner in which that <lb/>
question was
and is regarded by Lower <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Canada ; that while in
Upper Canada the <lb/>
desire and cry for it was daily augmenting, <lb/>
the resistance to it in Lower Canada was pro<lb break="no"/>portionably increasing in strength.   Still, if <lb/>
some such means of relieving us from the <lb/>
sectional jealousies which existed between the <lb/>
two Canadas, if some such solution of the <lb/>
difficulties
as Confederation had not been <lb/>
found, the representation by population must <lb/>
eventually have been carried ; no matter <lb/>
though it might have been felt in Lower <lb/>
Canada, as being a breach of the Treaty of <lb/>
Union, no matter how much it might have <lb/>
been felt by the Lower Canadians that it <lb/>
would sacrifice their local interests, it is cer<lb break="no"/>tain that in the progross
of events represen<lb break="no"/>tation by population would have been car<lb break="no"/>ried ; and, had it been carried — I speak <lb/>
here my own individual sentiments—I do <lb/>
not think it would have been for the inter<lb break="no"/>est of Upper Canada.   For though Upper <lb/>
Canada would have felt that it had received <lb/>
what it claimed as a right, and had succeed <lb/>
in establishing its ight, yet it would have <lb/>
left the Lower Province with a sullen feel<lb break="no"/>ing of injury and injustice.   The Lower <lb/>
Canadians would not have worked cheer<lb break="no"/>fully under such a change of system, but <lb/>
would have ceased to be what they are <lb/>
now— a nationality, with representatives <lb/>
        
            <pb n="29" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0029.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">29</fw>
               
           in Parliament,
governed by general principles, <lb/>
and dividing according to their political opin<lb break="no"/>ions—and would have been in great danger <lb/>
of becoming a faction, forgetful of national <lb/>
obligations, and only actuated by a desire to <lb/>
defend their own sectional interests, their own <lb/>
laws, and their own institutions. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
The third and only means of solution for our <lb/>
difficulties was the junction of the provinces <lb/>
either in a Federal or a Legislative Union. <lb/>
Now, as regards the comparative advantages <lb/>
of a Legislative and a Federal Union, I have <lb/>
never hesitated to state my own opinions. I <lb/>
have again and again stated in the House, <lb/>
that, if practicable, I thought a Legislative <lb/>
Union would be preferable.  (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
I have always contended that if we could <lb/>
agree to have one government and one par<lb break="no"/>liament, legislating for the whole of these <lb/>
peoples, it would be the best, the cheapest, <lb/>
the most vigorous, and the strongest
system <lb/>
of government we could adopt. ( Hear, hear.) <lb/>
But, on looking at the subject in the Con<lb break="no"/>ference, and discussing the matter as we did, <lb/>
most unreservedly, and with a desire to ar<lb break="no"/>rive at a satisfactory conclusion, we found <lb/>
that such a system was impracticable. In <lb/>
the first place, it would not meet the assent <lb/>
of the people
of Lower Canada, because they <lb/>
felt that in their peculiar position—being <lb/>
in a minority, with a different language, <lb/>
nationality and religion from the majority,<lb break="no"/>in case of a junction with the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, their institutions and their laws <lb/>
might be assailed, and their ancestral
asso<lb break="no"/>ciations, on which they prided themselves, <lb/>
attacked and prejudiced; it was found that <lb/>
any proposition which involved the absorp<lb break="no"/>tion of the individuality of Lower Canada<lb break="no"/>if I may use the expression—would not be <lb/>
received with favor by her people.   We <lb/>
found too, that though their people speak <lb/>
the same language and enjoy the same sys<lb break="no"/>tem of law as the people of Upper Canada, <lb/>
a system founded on the common law of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, there was as great a disinclination on the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>part of the various
Maritime Provinces to <lb/>
lose their individuality, as separate political <lb/>
organizations, as we observed in the case of <lb/>
Lower Canada
herself. (Hear, hear.) There<lb break="no"/>fore, we were forced to the conclusion that <lb/>
we must either abandon the idea of Union <lb/>
altogether, or devise a system of union in <lb/>
which the separate provincial organizations <lb/>
would be in some degree preserved. So that <lb/>
those who were, like myself, in favor of a </p>
            <p>Legislative Union,
were obliged to modify<lb/>
            <cb/>
               their views and
accept the project of a <lb/>
Federal Union as the only scheme prac<lb break="no"/>ticable, even for the Maritime Provinces. <lb/>
Because, although the law of those prov<lb break="no"/>inces is founded on the common law of <lb/>
England, yet every one of them has a large <lb/>
amount of law of its own—colonial law <lb/>
framed by itself, and affecting every relation <lb/>
of life, such as the laws of property, muni<lb break="no"/>cipal and assessment laws; laws relating to <lb/>
the liberty of the subject, and to all the <lb/>
great interests contemplated in legislation ; <lb/>
we found, in short, that the statutory law <lb/>
of the different provinces was so varied and <lb/>
diversified that it was almost impossible to <lb/>
weld them into a Legislative Union at once. <lb/>
Why, sir, if you only consider the innumer<lb break="no"/>able subjects of legislation peculiar to new <lb/>
countries, and that every one of those five <lb/>
colonies had particular laws of its own, to <lb/>
which its people have been accustomed and <lb/>
are attached, you will see the difficulty
of <lb/>
effecting and
working a Legislative Union, <lb/>
and bringing about an assimilation of the <lb/>
local as well as general laws of the whole of <lb/>
the provinces.   (Hear, hear.)   We in <lb/>
Upper Canada understand from the nature <lb/>
and operation of our peculiar municipal <lb/>
law, of which we know the value, the diffi<lb break="no"/>culty of framing a general system of legisla<lb break="no"/>tion on local matters which would meet the <lb/>
wishes and fulfil the requirements of the sev<lb break="no"/>eral provinces. Even the laws considered the <lb/>
least important, respecting private rights in <lb/>
timber, roads, fencing, and innumerable other <lb/>
matters, small in themselves, but in the ag<lb break="no"/>gregate of great interest to the agricultural <lb/>
class, who form the great body of the people, <lb/>
are regarded as of great value by the portion <lb/>
of the community affected
by them. And <lb/>
when we consider that every one of the <lb/>
colonies has a body of law of this kind, and <lb/>
that it will take years before those laws can <lb/>
be assimilated, it was felt that at first, at all <lb/>
events, any united legislation would be almost <lb/>
impossible. I am happy to state—and indeed <lb/>
it appears on the face of the resolutions them<lb break="no"/>selves—that as regards the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, a great desire was evinced for the final <lb/>
assimilation of our laws.   One of the re<lb break="no"/>solutions provides that an attempt shall <lb/>
be made to assimilate the laws of the <lb/>
Maritime Provinces and those of Upper <lb/>
Canada, for the purpose of eventually estab<lb break="no"/>lishing one body of statutory law, founded <lb/>
on the common law of England, the parent of <lb/>
the laws of all those provinces. One great ob<lb break="no"/><pb n="30" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0030.jpg"/><fw type="num">30</fw>jection made to a
Federal Union was the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of an
increased number of legislatures. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I will not enter at
any length into that sub<lb break="no"/>ject, because my honorable friends, the Fi<lb break="no"/>nance Minister and the President of the <lb/>
Council, who are infinitely more competent <lb/>
than myself to deal with matters of this kind<lb break="no"/>matters of account—will, I think, be able to <lb/>
show that the expenses under a Federal Union <lb/>
will not be greater than those under the exist<lb break="no"/>ing system of separate governments and legis<lb break="no"/>latures. Here, where we have a joint legislature <lb/>
for Upper and Lower Canada, which deals not <lb/>
only with subjects of a general interest com<lb break="no"/>mon to all Canada, but with all matters of pri<lb break="no"/>vate right and of sectional interest, and with <lb/>
that class of measures known as "private bills," <lb/>
we find that one of the greatest sources <lb/>
of expense to the country is the cost <lb/>
of legislation. We find, from the admix<lb break="no"/>ture of subjects of a general, with those <lb/>
of a private character in legislation, that <lb/>
they mutually interfere with each other ; <lb/>
whereas, if the attention of the Legislature <lb/>
was confined to measures of one kind or the <lb/>
other alone, the session of Parliament would <lb/>
not be so protracted and therefore not so <lb/>
expensive as at present.   In the proposed <lb/>
Constitution all matters of general interest <lb/>
are to be dealt with by the General Le<lb break="no"/>gislature ; while the local legislatures
will <lb/>
deal with matters of local interest, which <lb/>
do not affect the Confederation as a whole, <lb/>
but are of the greatest importance to their <lb/>
particular sections. By such a division <lb/>
of labor the sittings of the General Le<lb break="no"/>gislature would not be so protracted as <lb/>
even those of Canada alone. And so with the <lb/>
local legislatures, their attention being con<lb break="no"/>fined to subjects pertaining to their own <lb/>
sections, their sessions would be shorter and <lb/>
less expensive.   Then, when we consider <lb/>
the enormous saving that will be effected <lb/>
in the administration of affairs by one General <lb/>
Government — when we reflect that each <lb/>
of the five colonies have a government <lb/>
of its own with a complete
establishment <lb/>
of public departments
and all the machinery <lb/>
required for the transaction of the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the
country—that each have a separ<lb break="no"/>ate executive, judicial and militia system<lb break="no"/>that each
province has a separate min<lb break="no"/>istry, including a Minister of Militia, with <lb/>
a complete Adjutant General's Department<lb break="no"/>that each have a Finance Minister with a <lb/>
full Customs and Excise staff—that each <lb/>
Colony has as large and complete an adminis<lb break="no"/><cb/>trative organization,
with as many Executive <lb/>
officers as the General Government will have <lb/>
—we can well understand the enormous <lb/>
saving that will result from a union of all <lb/>
the colonies, from their having but one head <lb/>
and one central system  
We, in Canada, <lb/>
already know something of the advantages <lb/>
and disadvantages of a Federal Union. <lb/>
Although we have nominally a Legislative <lb/>
Union in Canada—although we sit in one <lb/>
Parliament, supposed constitutionally to re<lb break="no"/>present the people without regard to sections <lb/>
or localities, yet we know, as a matter of fact, <lb/>
that since the union in 1841, we have had a <lb/>
Federal Union ; that in matters affecting <lb/>
Upper Canada solely, members from that <lb/>
section claimed and generally exercised the <lb/>
right of exclusive legislation, while mem<lb break="no"/>bers from Lower Canada legislated in mat<lb break="no"/>ters affecting only their own section. We <lb/>
have had a Federal Union in fact, though <lb/>
a Legislative Union in name ; and in the <lb/>
hot contests of late years, if on any <lb/>
occasion a measure affecting any one sec<lb break="no"/>tion were interfered with by the members <lb/>
from the other—if, for instance, a mea<lb break="no"/>sure locally affecting Upper Canada were <lb/>
carried or defeated against the wishes <lb/>
of its majority, by one from
Lower <lb/>
Canada,—my honorable friend the Pres<lb break="no"/>ident of the Council, and his friends <lb/>
denounced with all their energy and ability <lb/>
such legislation as an infringement of the <lb/>
rights of the Upper Province.   (Hear, <lb/>
hear, and cheers).   Just in the same way, if <lb/>
any act concerning Lower Canada were <lb/>
pressed into law against the wishes of the <lb/>
majority of her representatives, by those from <lb/>
Upper Canada, the Lower Canadians would <lb/>
rise as one man and protest against such a <lb/>
violation of their peculiar rights. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.)   The relations between England and <lb/>
Scotland are very similar to that which ob<lb break="no"/>tains between the Canadas.   The union be<lb break="no"/>tween them, in matters of legislation, is of a <lb/>
federal character, because the Act of Union <lb/>
between the two countries provides that the <lb/>
Scottish law cannot be altered, except for the <lb/>
manifest advantage of the people of Scotland. <lb/>
This stipulation has been held
to be so <lb/>
obligatory on the Legislature of Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain, that no measure affecting the law of <lb/>
Scotland is
passed unless it receives the <lb/>
sanction of a majority of the Scottish mem<lb break="no"/>bers in Parliament. No matter how import<lb break="no"/>ant it may be for the interests of the empire <lb/>
as a whole to alter the laws of Scotland—no <lb/>
         
            <pb n="31" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0031.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">31</fw>
      
      matter how much it may
interfere with the <lb/>
symmetry of the general law of the United <lb/>
Kingdom, that law is not altered, except <lb/>
with the consent of the Scottish people, <lb/>
as expresssed
by their representatives in Par<lb break="no"/>liament.   (Hear, hear.)   Thus, we have, in <lb/>
Great Britain, to a limited extent, an ex<lb break="no"/>ample of the working and effects of a Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Union, as we might expect to witness <lb/>
them in our own Confederation.   The whole <lb/>
scheme of Confederation, as propounded by <lb/>
the Conference, as agreed to and sanctioned <lb/>
by the Canadian Government, and as now <lb/>
presented for the consideration of the people, <lb/>
and the Legislature, bears upon its face the <lb/>
marks of compromise.   Of necessity there <lb/>
must have been a great deal of mutual con<lb break="no"/>cession.   When we think of the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of five colonies, all supposed to have <lb/>
different interests, meeting together, charged <lb/>
with the duty of protecting those interests <lb/>
and of pressing
the views of their own locali<lb break="no"/>ties and sections, it must be admitted that <lb/>
had we not met in a spirit of conciliation, and <lb/>
with an anxious desire to promote this union ; <lb/>
if we had not been impressed with the idea <lb/>
contained in the words of the resolution—<lb/>
" That the best interests and present and fu<lb break="no"/>ture prosperity of British North America <lb/>
would be promoted by a Federal Union under <lb/>
the Crown of Great Britain,"—all our efforts <lb/>
might have proved to be of no avail.   If <lb/>
we had not felt that, after coming to this <lb/>
conclusion, we were bound to set aside our <lb/>
private opinions on matters of detail, if we <lb/>
had not felt ourselves bound to look at what <lb/>
was practicable, not obstinately rejecting the <lb/>
opinions of others nor adhering to our own ; <lb/>
if we had not
met, I say, in a spirit of concili<lb break="no"/>ation, and with an anxious, overruling de<lb break="no"/>sire to form one people under one government, <lb/>
we never would have succeeded. With these <lb/>
views, we press the question on this House <lb/>
and the country.   I say to this House, if you <lb/>
do not believe that the union of the colonies <lb/>
is for the advantage of the country, that the <lb/>
joining of these five peoples into one nation, <lb/>
under one sovereign, is for the benefit of all, <lb/>
then reject the scheme.   Reject it if you do <lb/>
not believe it to be for the present advantage <lb/>
and future prosperity of yourselves and your <lb/>
children.   But if, after a calm and full con<lb break="no"/>sideration of this scheme, it is believed, as a <lb/>
whole, to be for the advantage of this pro<lb break="no"/>vince—if the House and country believe this <lb/>
union to be one which will ensure for us Bri<lb break="no"/>tish laws,
British connection, and British <lb/>
       
            <cb/>
    
    freedom—and
increase and develope the so<lb break="no"/>cial, political and material prosperity of the <lb/>
country, then I implore this House and the <lb/>
country to lay aside all prejudices, and accept <lb/>
the scheme which we offer.
I ask this House <lb/>
to meet the question in the same spirit in which <lb/>
the delegates met it.   I ask each member of <lb/>
this House to lay aside his own opinions as <lb/>
to particular details, and to accept the scheme <lb/>
as a whole if he think it beneficial as a whole. <lb/>
As I stated in the preliminary discussion, we <lb/>
must consider this scheme in the light of a <lb/>
treaty.   By a happy coincidence of circum<lb break="no"/>stances, just when an Administration had been <lb/>
formed in Canada for the purpose of attempt<lb break="no"/>ing a solution of the difficulties
under which <lb/>
we laboured, at the same time the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, actuated by a similar feeling, appoint- <lb break="yes"/>
ted a Conference with a view to a union <lb/>
among themselves, without being cognisant <lb/>
of the position the government was taking in <lb/>
Canada.   If it had not been for this fortunate <lb/>
coincidence of events, never, perhaps, for a <lb/>
long series of years would we have been able <lb/>
to bring this scheme to a practical conclusion. <lb/>
But we did succeed.   We made the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment, agreed upon the scheme, and the depu<lb break="no"/>tations from the several governments repre<lb break="no"/>sented at the Conference went back pledged <lb/>
to lay it before their governments, and to <lb/>
ask the legislatures and people of their <lb/>
respective provinces to assent to it.   I trust <lb/>
the scheme will be assented to as a whole. <lb/>
I am sure this House will not seek to alter it <lb/>
in its unimportant details ; and, if altered in <lb/>
any important provisions,
the result must be <lb/>
that the whole will be set aside, and we must <lb/>
               begin <hi rendition="simple:italic">de novo</hi>.
If any important changes <lb/>
are made, every one of the colonies will feel <lb/>
itself absolved from the implied obligation to <lb/>
deal with it as a Treaty, each province will <lb/>
               feel itself at liberty to amend it <hi rendition="simple:italic">ad
libitum</hi> so <lb/>
as to suit its own views and interests ; in fact, <lb/>
the whole of our labours will have been <lb/>
for nought, and we will have to renew our <lb/>
negotiations with all the colonies for the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>purpose of
establishing some new scheme. <lb/>
I hope the
House will not adopt any such <lb/>
a course as will postpone, perhaps for ever, <lb/>
or at all events for a long period, all chances <lb/>
of union.   All the statesmen and public <lb/>
men who have written or spoken on the <lb/>
subject admit the advantages of a union, <lb/>
if it were practicable : and now when it is <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>proved to be
practicable, if we do not em<lb break="no"/>brace this
opportunity the present favor<lb break="no"/>able time will pass away, and we may never <lb/>
           
            <pb n="32" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0032.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">32</fw>
 
 have it again.
Because, just so surely as <lb/>
this scheme is defeated, will be revived the <lb/>
original proposition for a union of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces, irrespective of Canada ; they <lb/>
will not remain as they are now, powerless, <lb/>
scattered, helpless communities ; they will <lb/>
form themselves into a power, which, though <lb/>
not so strong as if united with Canada, will, <lb/>
nevertheless, be a powerful and considerable <lb/>
community, and it will be then too late for <lb/>
us to attempt to strengthen ourselves by this <lb/>
scheme, which, in the words of the resolution, <lb/>
"is for the best interests, and present and <lb/>
future prosperity of British North America.'' <lb/>
If we are not blind to our present position, <lb/>
we must see the hazardous situation in <lb/>
which all the great interests of Canada stand <lb/>
in respect to the United States.   I am no <lb/>
alarmist.   I do not believe in the prospect of <lb/>
immediate war.   I believe that the common <lb/>
sense of the two nations will prevent a war ; <lb/>
still we cannot trust to probabilities.   The <lb/>
Government and Legislature would be want<lb break="no"/>ing in their duty to the people if they ran <lb/>
any risk.   We know that the United States <lb/>
at this moment are engaged in a war of <lb/>
enormous dimensions—that the occasion of a <lb/>
war with Great Britain has again and again <lb/>
arisen, and may at any time in the future <lb/>
again arise.   We cannot foresee what may <lb/>
be the result
; we cannot say but that the <lb/>
two nations may drift into a war as other <lb/>
nations have done before.   It would then <lb/>
be too late when war had commenced to think <lb/>
of measures for strengthening ourselves, or <lb/>
to begin negociations for a union with the <lb/>
sister provinces.   At this moment, in con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the ill-feeling which has arisen <lb/>
between England and the United States<lb break="no"/>a feeling of which Canada was not the cause <lb/>
—in consequence of the irritation which now <lb/>
exists, owing to the unhappy state of affairs <lb/>
on this continent, the Reciprocity Treaty,
<lb/>
it seems probable, is about to be brought <lb/>
to an end—our trade is hampered by the <lb/>
passport system, and at any moment we may <lb/>
be deprived of
permission to carry our goods <lb/>
through United States channels—the bonded <lb/>
goods system may be done away with, and the <lb/>
winter trade through the United States put <lb/>
an end to.   Our merchants may be obliged <lb/>
to return to the old system of bringing in <lb/>
during the summer months the supplies for <lb/>
the whole year.   Ourselves already threat<lb break="no"/>ened, our trade interrupted, our intercourse, <lb/>
political and commercial, destroyed, if we do <lb/>
not take warning now when we have the op<lb break="no"/><cb/>portunity, and while
one avenue is threat<lb break="no"/>ened to be closed, open another by taking ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of the present arrangement and the <lb/>
desire of the Lower Provinces to draw closer <lb/>
the alliance between us, we may suffer
com<lb break="no"/>mercial and political disadvantgaes it may <lb/>
take long for us to overcome.   The Confer<lb break="no"/>ence having come to the conclusion that a <lb/>
legislative union, pure and simple, was im<lb break="no"/>practicable, our next attempt was to form a <lb/>
government upon federal principles, which <lb/>
would give
to the General Government the <lb/>
strength of a legislative and administrative <lb/>
union, while at the same time it preserved <lb/>
that liberty of action for the different sec<lb break="no"/>tions which is allowed by a Federal Union. <lb/>
And I am strong in the belief—that we <lb/>
have hit upon the happy medium in those <lb/>
resolutions, and that we have formed a scheme <lb/>
of government which unites the advantages <lb/>
of both, giving us the strength of a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive union and the sectional freedom of a <lb/>
federal union, with protection to local inter<lb break="no"/>ests.   In doing so we had the advantage of <lb/>
the experience of the United States.  It is <lb/>
the fashion now to enlarge on the defects of <lb/>
the Constitution of the United States, but I <lb/>
am not one of those who look upon it as a <lb/>
failure. (Hear,
hear.)   I think and believe <lb/>
that it is one of the most skillful works <lb/>
which human intelligence ever created ; is <lb/>
one of the most perfect organizations that <lb/>
ever governed a free people.   To say that it <lb/>
has some defects is but to say that it is not <lb/>
the work of Omniscience, but of human in<lb break="no"/>tellects.   We are happily situated in having <lb/>
had the opportunity of watching its ope<lb break="no"/>ration, seeing its working from its infancy <lb/>
till now.   It was in the main formed on the <lb/>
model of the Constitution of Great Britain, <lb/>
adapted to the circumstances of a new coun<lb break="no"/>try, and was perhaps the only practicable sys<lb break="no"/>tem that could have been adopted under the <lb/>
circumstances existing at the time of its
<lb/>
formation.   We can now take advantage of <lb/>
the experience of the last seventy-eight years, <lb/>
during which that Constitution has existed, <lb/>
and I am strongly of the belief that we have, <lb/>
in a great measure, avoided in this system <lb/>
which we propose for the adoption of the <lb/>
people of Canada, the defects which time <lb/>
and events have shown to exist in the Amer<lb break="no"/>ican Constitution.   In the first place, by a <lb/>
resolution which meets with the universal <lb/>
approval of the peeple of this country, we <lb/>
have provided that for all time to come, so <lb/>
far as we can legislate for the future, we <lb/>
          
            <pb n="33" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0033.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">33</fw>
          
          shall have as the
head of the executive pow<lb break="no"/>er, the Sovereign of Great Britain.   (Hear, <lb/>
hear.)   No one can look into futurity and <lb/>
say what will be the destiny of this country. <lb/>
Changes come over nations and peoples in <lb/>
the course of ages.   But, so far as we can <lb/>
legislate, we provide that, for all time to <lb/>
come, the Sovereign of Great Britain shall <lb/>
be the Sovereign of British North America. <lb/>
By adhering to the monarchical principle, <lb/>
we avoid one defect inherent in the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the United States.   By the <lb/>
election of the President by a majority and <lb/>
for a short period, he never is the sovereign <lb/>
and chief of
the nation. He is never looked <lb/>
up to by the whole people as the head and <lb/>
front of the nation.   He is at best but the <lb/>
successful leader of a party.   This defect is <lb/>
all the greater on account of the practice of <lb/>
re-election.
  During his first term of office, <lb/>
he is employed in taking steps to secure his <lb/>
own re-election, and for his party a continu<lb break="no"/>ance of power.   We avoid this by adhering <lb/>
to the monarchical principle—the Sovereign <lb/>
whom you respect and love.   I believe that <lb/>
it is of the utmost importance to have that <lb/>
principle recognized, so that we shall have <lb/>
a Sovereign who is placed above the region <lb/>
of party—to whom all parties look up—who <lb/>
is not elevated by the action of one <lb/>
party nor depressed by the action of an<lb break="no"/>other, who is the common head and sover<lb break="no"/>eign of all.   (Hear, hear and cheers.) <lb/>
In the Constitution we propose to continue <lb/>
the system of Responsible Government, which <lb/>
has existed in this province since 1841; and <lb/>
which has long obtained in the Mother <lb/>
Country.   This is a feature of our Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion as we have it now, and as
we shall have <lb/>
it in the Federation, in which, I think, we <lb/>
avoid one of the great defects in the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the United States.   There the Pre<lb break="no"/>sident, during his term of office, is in a great <lb/>
measure a
despot, a one-man power, with the <lb/>
command of the naval and military forces<lb break="no"/>with an immense amount of patronage as <lb/>
head of the
Executive, and with the veto <lb/>
power as a branch of the legislature, perfect<lb break="no"/>ly uncontrolled by responsible advisers, his <lb/>
cabinet being
departmental officers merely, <lb/>
whom he is not obliged by the Constitution <lb/>
to consult with, unless he chooses to do so. <lb/>
With us the Sovereign, or in this country the <lb/>
Representative
of the Sovereign, can act only <lb/>
on the advice of his ministers, those ministers <lb/>
being responsible
to the people through Par<lb break="no"/>liament. Prior
to the formation of the Amer<lb break="no"/><cb/>ican Union, as we all
know, the different <lb/>
states which entered into it were separate col<lb break="no"/>onies. They had no connection with each <lb/>
other further than that of having a common <lb/>
sovereign, just as with us at present.   Their <lb/>
constitutions and their laws were different. <lb/>
They might and did legislate against each <lb/>
other, and when they revolted against the <lb/>
Mother Country they acted as separate sove<lb break="no"/>reignties, and carried on the war by a kind <lb/>
of treaty of alliance against the common ene<lb break="no"/>my.   Ever since the union was formed the <lb/>
difficulty of what is called "State
Rights" <lb/>
has existed, and this had much to do in <lb/>
bringing on the present unhappy war in the <lb/>
United States.   They
commenced, in fact, at <lb/>
the wrong end.   They declared by their Con<lb break="no"/>stitution that each state was a sovereignty in <lb/>
itself, and that all the powers incident to a <lb/>
sovereignty belonged to each state, except <lb/>
those powers which, by the Constitution, <lb/>
were conferred upon the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Congress.   Here we have adopted <lb/>
a different system.   We have strengthened <lb/>
the General Government.   We have given <lb/>
the General Legislature all the great subjects <lb/>
of legislation.   We have conferred on them, <lb/>
not only specifically and in detail, all the <lb/>
powers which are incident to sovereignty, but <lb/>
we have expressly declared that all subjects of <lb/>
general interest not distinctly and exclusively <lb/>
conferred upon the local governments and <lb/>
local legislatures, shall be conferred upon the <lb/>
General Government and Legislature.—We <lb/>
have thus avoided that great source of weak<lb break="no"/>ness which has been the cause of the disrup<lb break="no"/>tion of the United States.  We have avoided <lb/>
all conflict of jurisdiction and authority, and <lb/>
if this Constitution is carried out, as it will <lb/>
be in full
detail in the Imperial Act to be <lb/>
passed if the colonies adopt the scheme, we <lb/>
will have in fact, as I said before, all the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages of a legislative union under one ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, with, at the same time the guar<lb break="no"/>antees for local institutions and for local laws, <lb/>
which are insisted upon by so many in the <lb/>
provinces now, I hope, to be united. I think <lb/>
it is well that, in framing our Constitution-<lb/>although my honorable friend the member <lb/>
for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION) sneered <lb/>
at it the other day, in the discussion on the <lb/>
Address in reply to the speech from the <lb/>
Throne—our first act should have been to <lb/>
recognize the sovereignty of Her Majesty. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.)   I believe that, while England <lb/>
has no desire to lose her colonies, but wishes <lb/>
to retain them, while I am satisfied that the <lb/>
          
            <pb n="34" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0034.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">34</fw>
       
       public mind of
England would deeply regret <lb/>
the loss of these provinces—yet, if the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of British North
America after full de<lb break="no"/>liberation had
stated that they considered it <lb/>
was for their interest, for the advantage of <lb/>
the future of British North America to sever <lb/>
the tie, such is the generosity of the people <lb/>
of England, that, whatever
their desire to <lb/>
keep these colonies, they would not seek to <lb/>
compel us to remain unwilling subjects of the <lb/>
British Crown.   If therefore, at the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, we had arrived at the conclusion, that <lb/>
it was for the interest of these provinces that a <lb/>
severance should take place, I am sure that Her <lb/>
Majesty and the Imperial Parliament would <lb/>
have sanctioned that severance. We accord<lb break="no"/>ingly felt that there was a propriety in giving <lb/>
a distinct declaration of opinion on that point, <lb/>
and that, in framing the Constitution,
its first <lb/>
sentence should declare, that " The Execu<lb break="no"/>tive authority or government shall be vested <lb/>
in the Sovereign of the United Kingdom of <lb/>
Great Britain and Ireland, and be adminis<lb break="no"/>tered according to the well understood prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the British Constitution, by the <lb/>
Sovereign personally, or by the Representa<lb break="no"/>tive of the Sovereign
duly authorised." That <lb/>
resolution met with the unanimous assent of <lb/>
the Conference.   The desire to remain con<lb break="no"/>nected with Great Britain and to retain our <lb/>
allegiance to Her Majesty was unanimous. <lb/>
Not a single suggestion was made, that it <lb/>
could, by any possibility, be for the interest <lb/>
of the colonies, or of any section or portion of <lb/>
them, that there should be a severance <lb/>
of our connection.   Although we knew it to <lb/>
be possible that Canada, from her position, <lb/>
might be exposed to all the horrors of war, <lb/>
by reason of causes of hostility arising <lb/>
between Great Britain and the United States <lb/>
—causes over which we had no control, and <lb/>
which we had no hand in bringing about<lb break="no"/>yet there was a unanimous feeling of <lb/>
willingness to run all the hazards of war, if <lb/>
war must come, rather than lose the con<lb break="no"/>nection between the Mother Country and <lb/>
these colonies.   (Cheers)   We provide that <lb/>
" the Executive authority shall be ad<lb break="no"/>ministered by the Sovereign personally, or <lb/>
by the Representative of the Sovereign duly <lb/>
authorized."   It is too much to expect <lb/>
that the Queen should vouchsafe us her <lb/>
personal governance or presence, except to <lb/>
pay us, as the heir apparent of the Throne, <lb/>
our future Sovereign has already paid us, </p>
            <p>the graceful compliment of a visit.   The <lb/> Executive authority must therefore be
                     ad<lb break="no"/><cb/>ministered by Her Majesty's Represen<lb break="no"/>tative.   We place no restriction on Her <lb/> Majesty's prerogative in the
                  selection of <lb/> her representative.   As it is now, so <lb/> it will be if this
                  Constitution is adopt<lb break="no"/>ed. The Sovereign has unrestricted free<lb break="no"/>dom of choice.   Whether in making her <lb/> selection she may send
                  us one of her own <lb/> family, a Royal Prince, as a Viceroy to rule <lb/>over us,
                  or one of the great statesmen of <lb/> England to represent her, we know not.
                  <lb/> We leave that to Her Majesty in all confi<lb break="no"/>dence.   But we may
                  be permitted to <lb/> hope, that when the union takes place, <lb/> and we become
                  the great country which <lb/> British North America is certain to be, <lb/> it
                  will be an object worthy the ambition <lb/> of the statesmen of England to be
                  charged <lb/> with presiding over our destinies.   (Hear, <lb/> hear.)   Let me
                  now invite the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the House to the provisions in <lb/>
                  the Constitution respecting the legisla<lb break="no"/>tive power. The sixth
                  resolution says, <lb/> " There shall be a general legislature or parlia<lb break="no"/>ment for the federated provinces, composed of <lb/> a Legislative
                  Council and a House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons."   This resolution has been
                  cavilled <lb/> at in the English press as if it excluded the <lb/> Sovereign as a
                  portion of the legislature. <lb/> In one sense, that stricture was just—be<lb break="no"/>cause in strict constitutional language, the <lb/> legislature of
                  England consists of King, <lb/> Lords and Commons. But, on the other <lb/> hand,
                  in ordinary parlance we speak of <lb/> " the King and his Parliament," or "the
                  <lb/> King summoning his Parliament,"   the <lb/> three estates—Lords spiritual,
                  temporal <lb/> Lords, and the House of Commons, and I <lb/> observe that such a
                  writer as Hallam occa<lb break="no"/>sionally uses the word Parliament in that
                  <lb/> restricted sense.   At best it is merely a <lb/> verbal criticism.   The
                  legislature of British <lb/> North America will be composed of <lb/> King, Lords,
                  and Commons.   The Legi<lb break="no"/>slative Council will stand in the same
                  <lb/> relation to the Lower House, as the <lb/> House of Lords to the House of
                  Commons <lb/> in England, having the same power of <lb/> initiating all matters of
                  legislation, except the <lb/>granting of money.   As regards the Lower House, it
                  may not appear to matter much, <lb/> whether it is called the House of Commons
                  <lb/> or House of Assembly.   It will hear what<lb break="no"/>ever name the
                  Parliament of England may <lb/> choose to give it, but "The House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons" is the name we should prefer, as <lb/> showing that it
                  represents the Commons of <lb/>
                  <pb n="35" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0035.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">35</fw> Canada, in the same way that the English <lb/> House of
                  Commons represents the Commons <lb/> of England, with the same privileges, the
                  <lb/> same parliamentary usage, and the same <lb/> parliamentary authority.   In
                  settling the <lb/> constitution of the Lower House, that which <lb/> peculiarly
                  represents the people, it was <lb/> agreed that the principle of representation
                  <lb/> based on population should be adopted, and <lb/>
               </p>
            <p> the mode of applying
that principle is fully <lb/>
            developed in these
resolutions.   When I
<lb/>
           speak of
representation by population, the <lb/>
House will of course understand, that univer<lb break="no"/>sal suffrage is not
in any way sanctioned, or <lb/>
admitted by these resolutions, as the basis <lb/>
            on which the
constitution of the popular <lb/>
             branch should rest.
  In order to protect <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> local interests, and
to prevent sectional <lb/>
          jealousies, it was
found requisite that the <lb/>
three great divisions into which British <lb/>
           North America is
separated, should be <lb/>
         represented in the
Upper House on the <lb/>
            principle of
equality.   There are three great <lb/>
            sections, having
different interests, in this <lb/>
            proposed
Confederation.   We have Western <lb/>
            Canada, an
agricultural country far away <lb/>
            from the sea, and
having the largest popu<lb break="no"/>lation who have
agricultural interests prin<lb break="no"/>cipally to guard.
  We have Lower Canada, <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> with other and
separate interests, and espe<lb break="no"/>cially with
institutions and laws which she <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> jealously guards
against absorption by any <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> larger, more
numerous, or stronger power. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> And we have the
Maritime Provinces, hav<lb break="no"/>ing also different
sectional interests of their <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> own, having , from
their position, classes and <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> interests which we do
not know in Western <lb/>
Canada.   Accordingly, in the Upper House, <lb/>
—the controlling and regulating, but not the <lb/>
initiating, branch (for we know that here as <lb/>
in England, to the Lower House will practic<lb break="no"/>ally belong the initiation of matters of great <lb/>
public interest), in the House which has the <lb/>
sober second-thought in legislation—it is <lb/>provided that each of
those great sections <lb/>
shall be represented equally by 24 members. <lb/>
The only exception to that condition of <lb/>
equality is in the case of Newfoundland, <lb/>
which has an
interest of its own, lying, as it <lb/>
does, at the
mouth of the great river St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence, and more connected, perhaps, with <lb/>
Canada than with the Lower Provinces.   It <lb/>
has, comparatively speaking, no common in<lb break="no"/>terest with the other Maritime Provinces, <lb/>
but has sectional interests and sectional <lb/>
claims of its own to be protected.   It, there<lb break="no"/>fore has been dealt with
separately, and <lb/>
            <cb/>
               is to have a separate
representation in the <lb/>
Upper House, thus varying from the equality <lb/>
established between the other sections.-<lb/>As may be well conceived, great difference <lb/>
of opinion at first existed as to the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Legislative Council.   In Canada <lb/>
the elective principle prevailed ; in the <lb/>
Lower Provinces, with the exception of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island, the nominative prin-</p>
            <p>ciple was the rule.
  We found a general <lb/>
disinclination on the part of the Lower <lb/>
Provinces to adopt the elective principle ; <lb/>
indeed, I do not think there was a dissent<lb break="no"/>ing voice in the Conference against the adop<lb break="no"/>tion of the nominative principle,
except from <lb/>
Prince Edward Island. The delegates from <lb/>
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, as one man, were in favor of nom<lb break="no"/>ination by the Crown.   And nomination by <lb/>
the Crown is of course the system which is <lb/>
most in accordance with the British Con<lb break="no"/>stitution.   We resolved then, that the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the Upper House should be in <lb/>
accordance with the British system as nearly <lb/>
as circumstances would allow.   An hereditary <lb/>
Upper House is impracticable in this young <lb/>
country. Here we have
none of the elements <lb/>
for the formation of a landlord aristocracy-<lb/>no men of large territorial positions—no <lb/>
class separated from the mass of the people. <lb/>
An hereditary body is altogether unsuited to <lb/>
our state of society, and would soon dwindle <lb/>
into nothing. The only mode of adapting <lb/>
the English system to the Upper House, is <lb/>
by conferring the power of appointment on <lb/>
the Crown (as the English peers are appoint<lb break="no"/>ed), but that
the appointments should be
for <lb/>
life.   The arguments for an elective Council <lb/>
are numerous and strong; and I ought to say <lb/>
so, as one of the Administration responsible <lb/>
for introducing the elective principle into <lb/>
Canada. (Hear, hear.) I hold that this prin<lb break="no"/>ciple has not been a failure in Canada ; but <lb/>
there were causes—which we did not take <lb/>
into consideration at the time—why it did <lb/>
not so fully succeed in Canada as we had <lb/>
expected. One great cause was the enormous <lb/>
extent of the constituencies and the immense <lb/>
labor which consequently devolved on those <lb/>
who sought the suffrages of the people for <lb/>
election to the Council. For the same reason <lb/>
the expense—(laughter)—the legitimate <lb/>
expense was so enormous that men of stand<lb break="no"/>ing in the country, eminently fitted for such <lb/>
a position, were prevented from coming <lb/>
forward.   At first, I admit, men of the <lb/>
first standing did come forward, but we <lb/>
       
            <pb n="36" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0036.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">36</fw>
  
  have seen that in
every succeeding election <lb/>
in both Canadas there has been an in<lb break="no"/>creasing disinclination, on the part of <lb/>
men of standing and political experience <lb/>
and weight in the country, to become can<lb break="no"/>didates ; while, on the other hand, all the <lb/>
            young men, the active
politicians, those who <lb/>
have resolved
to embrace the life of a <lb/>
statesman, have sought entrance to the <lb/>
House of Assembly.   The nominative system <lb/>
in this country, was to a great extent success<lb break="no"/>ful, before the introduction of responsible <lb/>
government. Then the Canadas were to a <lb/>
great extent Crown colonies, and the upper <lb/>
branch of the legislature consisted of gentle<lb break="no"/>men chosen from among the chief judicial <lb/>
and ecclesiastical dignitaries, the heads of <lb/>
departments, and other men of the first <lb/>
position in the country.   Those bodies com<lb break="no"/>manded great respect from the character, <lb/>
standing, and weight of the individuals com<lb break="no"/>posing them, but they had little sympathy <lb/>
with the people or their representatives, and <lb/>
coillisions with the Lower House frequently <lb/>
occurred, especially in Lower Canada. When <lb/>
responsible government was introduced, it <lb/>
became necessary for the Governor of the <lb/>
day to have a body of advisers who had the <lb/>
confidence of the House of Assembly <lb/>
which could make or unmake ministers <lb/>
as it chose.   The Lower House in effect<lb/>
pointed out who should be nominated to the <lb/>
Upper House ; for the ministry, being de<lb break="no"/>pendent altogether on the lower branch of <lb/>
the legislature for support, selected members <lb/>
for the Upper House from among their poli<lb break="no"/>tical friends at the dictation of the House of <lb/>
Assembly.   The Council was becoming less <lb/>
and less a substantial check on the legislation <lb/>
of the Assembly ; but under the system now <lb/>
proposed, such will not be the case.   No <lb/>
ministry can in future do what they have <lb/>
done in Canada before,—they cannot, with <lb/>
the view of carrying any measure, or of <lb/>
strengthening the party, attempt to overrule <lb/>
the independent opinion of the Upper House, <lb/>
by filling it with a number of its partisans <lb/>
and political supporters. The provision in <lb/>
the Constitution, that the Legislative Council <lb/>
shall consist of a limited number of members <lb/>
—that each of the great sections shall appoint <lb/>
twenty-four members and no more, will <lb/>
prevent the Upper House from being <lb/>
swamped from time to time by the ministry <lb/>
of the day, for the purpose of carrying out <lb/>
their own schemes or pleasing their parti<lb break="no"/>sans. The fact of the government being <lb/>
            <cb/>
               prevented from
exceeding a limited number <lb/>
will preserve the independence of the <lb/>
Upper House, and make it, in reality, <lb/>
a separate and distinct chamber, having a <lb/>
legitimate and controlling influence in the <lb/>
legislation of the country. The objection has <lb/>
been taken that in consequence of the Crown <lb/>
being deprived of the right of unlimited <lb/>
appointment, there is a chance of a dead <lb/>
lock arising between the two branches of <lb/>
the legislature ; a chance that the Upper <lb/>
House being altogether independent of the <lb/>
Sovereign, of the Lower House, and of the <lb/>
advisers of the Crown, may act indepen<lb break="no"/>dently, and so independently as to produce <lb/>
a dead lock.   I do not anticipate any such <lb/>
result.   In the first place we know that in <lb/>
England it does not arise.   There would <lb/>
be no use of an Upper House, if it did <lb/>
not exercise, when it thought proper, the <lb/>
right of opposing or amending or postponing <lb/>
the legislation of the Lower House.   It <lb/>
would be of no value whatever were it a mere <lb/>
chamber for registering the decrees of the <lb/>
Lower House.   It must be an independent <lb/>
House, having a free action of its own, for it <lb/>
is only valuable as being a regulating body, <lb/>
calmly considering the legislation initiated <lb/>
by the popular branch, and preventing any <lb/>
hasty or ill considered legislation which may <lb/>
come from that body, but it will never set <lb/>
itself in opposition against the deliberate <lb/>
and understood
wishes of the people.   Even <lb/>
the House of Lords, which as an hereditary <lb/>
body, is far more independent than one <lb/>
appointed for life can be, whenever it <lb/>
ascertains what is the calm, deliberate <lb/>
will of the people of England, it <lb/>
yields, and never in modern times has <lb/>
there been, in fact or act, any attempt to <lb/>
overrule the decisions of that House by the <lb/>
appointment ot new peers, excepting, per<lb break="no"/>haps, once in the reign of Queen Anne.   It <lb/>
is true that in 1832 such an increase was <lb/>
threatened in consequence of the reiterated <lb/>
refusal of the House of Peers to pass the <lb/>
Reform Bill.   I have no donbt the threat <lb/>
would have been carried into effect, if neces<lb break="no"/>sary ; but every one, even the Ministry who <lb/>
advised that step, admitted that it would be <lb/>
a revolutionary act, a breach of the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution to do so, and it was because of the <lb/>
necessity of preventing the bloody revolution <lb/>
which hung over the land, if the Reform Bill <lb/>
had been longer refused to the people of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, that they consented to the bloodless <lb/>
revolution of overriding the independent <lb/>
         
            <pb n="37" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0037.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">37</fw>
     
     opinion of the House
of Lords on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear, hear.) Since that time it has <lb/>
never been attempted, and I am satisfied it <lb/>
will never be attempted again.   Only a <lb/>
year or two ago the House of Lords rejected <lb/>
the Paper Duties Bill, and they acted quite <lb/>
constitutionally,
according to the letter and <lb/>
as many think, according to the spirit of the <lb/>
Constitution in doing so. Yet when they <lb/>
found they had interfered with a subject <lb/>
which the people's house claimed as belong<lb break="no"/>ing of right to themselves, the very next <lb/>
session they abandoned their position, not <lb/>
because they were convinced they had done <lb/>
wrong, but because they had ascertained <lb/>
what was the deliberate voice of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people on the subject.   In <lb/>
this country, we must remember, that the <lb/>
gentlemen who
will be selected for the Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Council stand on a very different <lb/>
footing from the peers of England.   They <lb/>
have not like them any ancestral associations <lb/>
or position derived from history. They have <lb/>
not that direct influence on the people them<lb break="no"/>selves, or on the popular branch of the legis<lb break="no"/>lature, which the peers of England exercise, <lb/>
from their great wealth, their vast territo<lb break="no"/>rial possessions, their numerous tenantry, <lb/>
and that prestige with which the exalted <lb/>
position of their class for centuries has in<lb break="no"/>vested them.   (Hear, hear.)   The members <lb/>
of our Upper House will be like those of <lb/>
the Lower, men of the people,
and from <lb/>
the people. The man put into the Upper <lb/>
House is as much a man of the people the <lb/>
day after, as the day before his elevation. <lb/>
Springing from the people, and one of them, <lb/>
he takes his seat in the Council with all the <lb/>
sympathies and feelings of a man of the <lb/>
people, and when he returns home, at the <lb/>
end of the session, he mingles with them <lb/>
on equal terms, and is influenced by the same <lb/>
feelings and associations, and events, as <lb/>
those which affect
the mass around him. <lb/>
And is it,
then, to be supposed that the <lb/>
members of the upper branch of the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture will set themselves deliberately at work <lb/>
to oppose what they know to be
the settled <lb/>
opinions and
wishes of the people of the <lb/>
country? They will not do it. There is <lb/>
no fear of a dead lock between the two houses. <lb/>
There is an infinitely greater chance of a <lb/>
dead lock between the two branches of the <lb/>
legislature,
should the elective principle <lb/>
be adopted, than with a nominated chamber <lb/>
—chosen
by the Crown,
and having no mis<lb break="no"/>sion from the people.   The members of the <lb/>
            <cb/>
               Upper Chamber would
then come from the <lb/>
people as well as those of the Lower House, <lb/>
and should any difference ever arise between <lb/>
both branches, the former could say to the <lb/>
members of the popular branch—" We as <lb/>
much represent the feelings of the people as <lb/>
you do, and even more so ; we are not elect<lb break="no"/>ed from small localities and for a short pe<lb break="no"/>riod ; you as a body were elected at a par<lb break="no"/>ticular time, when the public mind was run<lb break="no"/>ning in a particular channel ; you were re<lb break="no"/>turned to Parliament, not so much repre<lb break="no"/>senting the general views of the country, <lb/>
on general questions, as upon the particular <lb/>
subjects which happened to engage the minds <lb/>
of the people when they went to the polls. <lb/>
We have as much right, or a better right, <lb/>
than you to be considered as representing the <lb/>
deliberate will of the people on general <lb/>
questions, and therefore we will not give <lb/>
way."   (Hear, hear.)   There is, I repeat,
<lb/>
a greater danger of an irreconcilable differ<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion between the two branches <lb/>
of the legislature, if the upper be elective, <lb/>
than if it holds its commission from the <lb/>
Crown. Besides, it must be remembered that <lb/>
an Upper House, the members
of which are to <lb/>
be appointed for life, would not have the same <lb/>
quality of permanence as the House of Lords; <lb/>
our members would die; strangers would suc<lb break="no"/>ceed them, whereas son succeeded father in <lb/>
the House of Lords.   Thus the changes in <lb/>
the membership and state of opinion in our <lb/>
Upper House would always be more rapid <lb/>
than in the House of Lords.   To show how <lb/>
speedily changes have occurred in the Upper <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> House, as regards life members, I will call <lb/> the attention of the House to the
                  following <lb/> facts :—At the call of the House, in Febru<lb break="no"/>ary,
                  1856, forty-two life members responded ; <lb/> two years afterwards, in 1858, only
                     thirty-<lb break="yes"/> five answered to their names ; in 1862 there <lb/>
                  were only twenty-five life members left, and <lb/> in 1864, but twenty-one.  
                  (Hear, hear.) <lb/> This shows how speedily changes take place <lb/> in the life
                  membership.  But remarkable as <lb/> this change has been, it is not so great as
                  <lb/> that in regard to the elected members. <lb/> Though the elective principle
                  only came into <lb/> force in 1856, and although only twelve <lb/> men were
                  elected that year, and twelve more <lb/> every two years since, twenty-four
                  changes <lb/> have already taken place by the decease of <lb/> members, by the
                  acceptance of office, and <lb/> by resignation.   So it is quite clear that, <lb/>
                  should there be on any question a difference <lb/> of opinion between the Upper
                  and Lower<lb/>
                  <pb n="38" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0038.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">38</fw> Houses, the government of the day being <lb/> obliged to
                  have the confidence of the <lb/> majority in the popular branch—would, <lb/> for
                  the purpose of bringing the former into <lb/> accord and sympathy with the latter,
                  fill up <lb/> any vacancies that might occur, with men of <lb/> the same political
                  feelings and sympathies <lb/> with the Government, and consequently with <lb/>
                  those of the majority in the popular branch ; <lb/> and all the appointments of
                  the Administra<lb break="no"/>tion would be made with the object of <lb/>
                  maintaining the sympathy and harmony be<lb break="no"/>tween the two houses.  
                  (Hear, hear.)   There <lb/> is this additional advantage to be expected <lb/> from
                  the limitation. To the Upper House is <lb/> to be confided the protection of
                  sectional <lb/> interests ; therefore is it that the three great <lb/> divisions
                  are there equally represented, for <lb/> the purpose of defending such interests
                  <lb/> against the combinations of majorities in the <lb/> Assembly.   It will,
                  therefore, become the <lb/> interest of each section to be represented <lb/> by
                  its very best men, and the members of <lb/> the Administration who belong to each
                     sec<lb break="no"/>tion will see that such men are chosen, in <lb/> case of a
                  vacancy in their section.   For the <lb/> same reason each state of the American
                  <lb/> Union sends its two best men to represent <lb/> its interests in the Senate.
                    (Hear, hear.) <lb/> It is provided in the Constitution that in the <lb/> first
                  selections for the Council,   regard <lb/> shall be had to those who now hold
                  similar <lb/> positions in the different colonies.   This, it <lb/> appears to me,
                  is a wise provision.   In all the <lb/> provinces, except Prince Edward,   there
                  are <lb/> gentlemen who hold commissions for the <lb/> Upper House for life.   In
                  Canada, there are <lb/> a number who hold under that commission ; <lb/> but the
                  majority of them hold by a com<lb break="no"/>mission, not, perhaps, from a
                  monarchical <lb/> point of view so honorable, because the <lb/> Queen is the
                  fountain of honor,—but still, <lb/> as holding their appointment from the <lb/>
                  people, they may be considered as standing <lb/> on a par with those who have Her
                  Majesty's <lb/> commission.   There can be no reason suggest<lb break="no"/>ed why
                  those who have had experience in <lb/> legislation, whether they hold their
                  positions <lb/> by the election of the people or have received <lb/> preferment
                  from the Crown—there is no <lb/> valid reason why those men should be passed <lb/>
                  over, and new men sought for to form the <lb/> Legislative Council of the
                  Confederation. <lb/> It is, therefore, provided that the selection <lb/> shall be
                  made from those gentlemen who are <lb/> now members of the upper branch of the
                  <lb/> Legislature in each of the colonies, for seats <lb/>
                  <cb/> in the Legislative Council of the General <lb/> Legislature.   The
                  arrangement in this re<lb break="no"/>spect is somewhat similar to that by which
                  <lb/> Representative Peers are chosen from the <lb/> Peers of Scotland and
                  Ireland, to sit in the <lb/> Parliament of the United Kingdom.   In <lb/> like
                  manner, the members of the Legislative <lb/> Council of the proposed Confederation
                  will <lb/> be first selected from the existing Legislative <lb/> Councils of the
                  various provinces.   In the <lb/> formation of the House of Commons, the <lb/>
                  principle of representation by population <lb/> has been provided for in a manner
                  equally <lb/> ingenious and simple.   The introduction of <lb/> this principle
                  presented at first the apparent <lb/> difficulty of a constantly increasing body
                  <lb/> until, with the increasing population, it <lb/> would become inconveniently
                  and expen<lb break="no"/>sively large.   But by adopting the represen<lb break="no"/>tation of Lower Canada as a fixed standard <lb/> —as the pivot on
                  which the whole would <lb/> turn—that province being the best suited for <lb/> the
                  purpose, on account of the compara<lb break="no"/>tively permanent character of
                  its population, <lb/> and from its having neither the largest nor <lb/> least
                  number of inhabitants—we have been <lb/> enabled to overcome the difficulty I have
                  <lb/> mentioned.   We have introduced the system <lb/> of representation by
                  population without the <lb/> danger of an inconvenient increase in the <lb/>
                  number of representatives on the recurrence <lb/> of each decennial period.   The
                  whole thing <lb/> is worked by a simple rule of three.   For <lb/> instance, we
                  have in Upper Canada 1,400,000 <lb/> of a population ; in Lower Canada 1,100,000.
                  <lb/> Now, the proposition is simply this—if Lower <lb/> Canada, with its
                  population of 1,100,000, has <lb/> a right to 65 members, how many members <lb/>
                  should Upper Canada have, with its larger <lb/> population of 1,400,000? The same
                  rule <lb/> applies to the other provinces—the propor<lb break="no"/>tion is always
                  observed and the principle of <lb/> representation by population carried out,
                  <lb/> while, at the same time, there will not be <lb/> decennially an inconvenient
                  increase in the <lb/> numbers of the Lower House.   At the same <lb/> time, there
                  is a constitutional provision that <lb/> hereafter, if deemed advisable, the total
                  <lb/> number of representatives may be increased <lb/> from 194, the number fixed
                  in the first <lb/> instance.   In that case, if an increase is <lb/> made, Lower
                  Canada is still to remain the <lb/> pivot on which the whole calculation will
                  <lb/> turn.   If Lower Canada, instead of sixty-<lb break="yes"/> five, shall have
                  seventy members, then the <lb/> calculation will be, if Lower Canada has <lb/>
                  seventy members, with such a population, <lb/>
                  <pb n="39" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0039.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">39</fw> how many shall Upper Canada have with a <lb/> larger
                  population?   I was in favor of a larg<lb break="no"/>er House than one hundred
                  and ninety-four, <lb/> but was overruled.   I was perhaps singular <lb/> in the
                  opinion, but I thought it would be <lb/> well to commence with a larger
                     representa<lb break="no"/>tion in the lower branch.  The arguments <lb/>
                  against this were, that, in the first place, it <lb/> would cause additional
                  expense ; in the next <lb/> place, that in a new country like this, we <lb/> could
                  not get a sufficient number of qualified <lb/> men to be representatives.   My
                  reply was <lb/> that the number is rapidly increasing as <lb/> we increase in
                  education and wealth ; that <lb/> a larger field would be open to political am<lb break="no"/>bition by having a larger body of represen<lb break="no"/>tatives ;
                  that by having numerous and small<lb break="no"/>er constituencies, more people
                  would be in<lb break="no"/>terested in the working of the union, and that <lb/>
                  there would be a wider field for selection for <lb/> leaders of governments and
                  leaders of parties. <lb/> These are my individual sentiments,—which, <lb/>
                  perhaps, I have no right to express here-<lb/> but I was overruled, and we fixed
                  on the <lb/> number of one hundred and ninety-four, <lb/> which no one will say is
                  large or extensive, <lb/> when it is considered that our present <lb/> number in
                  Canada alone is one hundred <lb/> and thirty.   The difference between one <lb/>
                  hundred and thirty and one hundred and <lb/> ninety-four is not great, considering
                  the large <lb/> increase that will be made to our population <lb/> when
                  Confederation is carried into effect. <lb/> While the principle of representation
                  by popu<lb break="no"/>lation is adopted with respect to the popular <lb/> branch
                  of the legislature, not a single mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Conference, as I
                  stated before, not <lb/> a single one of the representatives of the <lb/>
                  government or of the opposition of any one <lb/> of the Lower Provinces was in
                  favor of <lb/> universal suffrage.   Every one felt that in <lb/> this respect the
                  principle of the British Con<lb break="no"/>stitution should be carried out, and
                  that class<lb break="no"/>es and property should be represented as well <lb/> as
                  numbers.   Insuperable difficulties would <lb/> have presented themselves if we
                  had attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to settle now the qualification for the elec<lb break="no"/>tive franchise. We have different laws in each <lb/> of the
                  colonies fixing the qualification of elec<lb break="no"/>tors for their own local
                  legislatures ; and we <lb/> therefore adopted a similar clause to that <lb/> which
                  is contained in the Canada Union Act <lb/> of 1841, viz., that all the laws which
                     affect<lb break="no"/>ed the qualification of members and of voters, <lb/>
                  which affected the appointment and conduct <lb/> of returning offcers and the
                  proceedings at <lb/> elections, as well as the trial of controverted <lb/>
                  <cb/> elections in the separate provinces, should <lb/> obtain in the first
                  election to the Confederate <lb/> Parliament, so that every man who has now <lb/>
                  a vote in his own province should continue <lb/> to have a vote in choosing a
                  representative <lb/> to the first Federal Parliament.   And it was <lb/> left to
                  the Parliament of the Confederation, <lb/> as one of their first duties, to
                  consider and <lb/> to settle by an act of their own the qualifica<lb break="no"/>tion for the elective franchise, which would <lb/> apply to the whole
                  Confederation.   In consid<lb break="no"/>ering the question of the duration of
                     Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, we came to the conclusion to recom<lb break="no"/>mend a period of five years. I was in favor of <lb/> a longer period.   I
                  thought that the duration <lb/> of the local legislatures should not be short<lb break="no"/>ened so as to be less than four years, as at pre<lb break="no"/>sent, and that the General Parliament should <lb/> have as long a duration as
                  that of the United <lb/> Kingdom.   I was willing to have gone to the <lb/> extent
                  of seven years ; but a term of five years <lb/> was preferred, and we had the
                  example of the <lb/> New Zealand carefully considered, not only <lb/> locally, but
                  by the Imperial Parliament, and <lb/> which gave the provinces of those islands
                  <lb/> a general parliament with a duration of five <lb/> years.   But it was a
                  matter of little import<lb break="no"/>ance whether five years or seven years was
                  <lb/> the term, the power of dissolution by the <lb/> Crown having been reserved.
                    I find, on look<lb break="no"/>ing at the duration of parliaments since the
                  <lb/> accession of George III. to the Throne, that <lb/> excluding the present
                  parliament, there have <lb/> been seventeen parliaments, the average pe<lb break="no"/>riod of whose existence has been about <lb/> three years and a
                  half.   That average is less <lb/> than the average duration of the parliaments
                  <lb/> in Canada since the union, so that it was <lb/> not a matter of much
                  importance whether we <lb/> fixed upon five or seven years as the period <lb/> of
                  duration of our General Parliament.   A <lb/> good deal of misapprehension has
                  arisen from <lb/> the accidental omission of some words from <lb/> the 24th
                  resolution.   It was thought that by <lb/> it the local legislatures were to have
                  the <lb/> power of arranging hereafter, and from time <lb/> to time of readjusting
                  the different constitu<lb break="no"/>encies and settling the size and boundaries
                  <lb/> of the various electoral districts. The mean<lb break="no"/>ing of the
                  resolution is simply this, that for <lb/> the first General Parliament, the
                     arrange<lb break="no"/>ment of constituencies shall be made by the <lb/>
                  existing local legislatures ; that in Canada, <lb/> for instance, the present
                  Canadian Parliament <lb/> shall arrange what are to be the constituen<lb break="no"/>cies of Upper Canada, and to make such <lb/> changes as may be
                  necessary in arranging <lb/>
                  <pb n="40" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0040.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">40</fw> for the seventeen additional members given <lb/> to it by
                  the Constitution ; and that it may <lb/> also, if it sees fit, alter the
                  boundaries of the <lb/> existing constituencies of Lower Canada. <lb/> In short,
                  this Parliament shall settle what <lb/> shall be the different constituencies
                  electing <lb/> members to the first Federal Parliament. <lb/> And so the other
                  provinces, the legislatures <lb/> of which will fix the limits of their several
                  <lb/> constituencies in the session in which they <lb/> adopt the new
                  Constitution.   Afterwards the <lb/> local legislatures may alter their own
                     electo<lb break="no"/>ral limits as they please, for their own local <lb/>
                  elections.   But it would evidently be un<lb break="no"/>proper to leave to the
                  Local Legislature the <lb/> power to alter the constituencies sending <lb/>
                  members to the General Legislature after <lb/> the General Legislature shall have
                  been <lb/> called into existence.   Were this the case, a <lb/> member of the
                  General Legislature might <lb/> at any time find himself ousted from his seat
                  <lb/> by an alteration of his constituency by the <lb/> Local Legislature in his
                  section.   No, after <lb/> the General Parliament meets, in order that <lb/> it
                  may have full control of its own legislation, <lb/> and be assured of its
                  position, it must have <lb/> the full power of arranging and re-arranging <lb/>
                  the electoral limits of its constituencies as it <lb/> pleases, such being one of
                  the powers essen<lb break="no"/>tially necessary to such a Legislature. (Hear,
                  <lb/> hear.)   I shall not detain the House by <lb/> entering into a consideration
                  at any length <lb/> of the different powers conferred upon <lb/> the General
                  Parliament as contradistin<lb break="no"/>guished from those reserved to the <lb/>
                  local legislatures; but any honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber on examining the list
                  of different <lb/> subjects which are to be assigned to the <lb/> General and
                  Local Legislatures respectively, <lb/> will see that all the great questions which
                  <lb/> affect the general interests of the Confederacy <lb/> as a whole, are
                  confided to the Federal Par<lb break="no"/>liament, while the local interests and
                  local <lb/> laws of each section are preserved intact, <lb/> and entrusted to the
                  care of the local <lb/> bodies.   As a matter of course, the General <lb/>
                  Parliament must have the power of dealing <lb/> with the public debt and property
                  of the <lb/> Confederation.   Of course, too, it must have <lb/> the regulation of
                  trade and commerce, of <lb/> customs and excise.   The Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment must have the sovereign power of rais<lb break="no"/>ing money
                  from such sources and by such <lb/> means as the representatives of the people
                  <lb/> will allow.   It will be seen that the local <lb/> legislatures have the
                  control of all local <lb/> works ; and it is a matter of great importance, <lb/>
                  <cb/> and one of the chief advantages of the Federal <lb/> Union and of local
                  legislatures, that each <lb/> province will have the power and means of <lb/>
                  developing its own resources and aiding its <lb/> own progress after its own
                  fashion and in its <lb/> own way.   Therefore all the local improve<lb break="no"/>ments, all local enterprizes or undertakings of <lb/> any kind, have been left
                  to the care <lb/> and management of the local legislatures <lb/> of each
                  province.  (Cheers.)  It is pro<lb break="no"/>vided that all "lines of steam or
                  other <lb/> ships, railways, canals and other works, <lb/> connecting any two or
                  more of the prov<lb break="no"/>inces together or extending beyond the <lb/>
                  limits of any province," shall belong to the <lb/> General Government, and be
                  under the con<lb break="no"/>trol of the General Legislature.   In like <lb/>
                  manner "lines of steamships between the <lb/> Federated Provinces and other
                  countries, <lb/> telegraph communication and the incorpor<lb break="no"/>ation of
                  telegraph companies, and all such <lb/> works as shall, although lying within any
                  <lb/> province, be specially declared by the Acts <lb/> authorizing them, to be
                  for the general ad<lb break="no"/>vantage," shall belong to the General Go<lb break="no"/>vernment.   For instance, the Welland Canal, <lb/> though lying
                  wholly within one section, and <lb/> the St. Lawrence Canals in two only, may
                  <lb/> be properly considered national works, and <lb/> for the general benefit of
                  the whole Feder<lb break="no"/>ation.   Again, the census, the ascertaining <lb/>
                  of our numbers and the extent of our re<lb break="no"/>sources, must, as a matter
                  of general interest, <lb/> belong to the General Government.   So also <lb/> with
                  the defences of the country.   One of <lb/> the great advantages of Confederation
                  is, that <lb/> we shall have a united, a concerted, and <lb/> uniform system of
                  defence. (Hear.) We are <lb/> at this moment with a different militia <lb/> system
                  in each colony—in some of the <lb/> colonies with an utter want of any system
                  <lb/> of defence.   We have a number of separate <lb/> staff establishments,
                  without any arrange<lb break="no"/>ment between the colonies as to the means,
                  <lb/> either of defence or ofienee.   But, under <lb/> the union, we will have one
                  system of defence <lb/> and one system of militia organization.   In <lb/> the
                  event of the Lower Provinces being <lb/> threatened, we can send the large militia
                  <lb/> forces of Upper Canada to their rescue. <lb/> Should we have to fight on our
                  lakes against <lb/> a foreign foe, we will have the hardy seamen <lb/> of the
                  Lower Provinces coming to our as<lb break="no"/>sistance and manning our vessels.
                    (Hear, <lb/> hear.)   We will have one system of defence <lb/> and be one
                  people, acting together alike in <lb/> peace and in war.   (Cheers.)   The
                  criminal <lb/>
                  <pb n="41" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0041.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">41</fw> law too—the determination of what is a <lb/> crime and what
                  is not and how crime shall <lb/> be punished—is left to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.   This is a matter almost of necessity. <lb/> It is of great
                  importance that we should have <lb/> the same criminal law throughout these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—that what is a crime in one part of <lb/> British America,
                  should be a crime in every <lb/> part—that there should be the same pro<lb break="no"/>tection of life and property as in another. <lb/> It is one of the
                  defects in the United States <lb/> system, that each separate state has or may
                  <lb/> have a criminal code of its own,—that what <lb/> may be a capital offence in
                  one state, may <lb/> be a venial offence, punishable slightly, in <lb/> another.  
                  But under our Constitution we <lb/> shall have one body of criminal law, based on
                  <lb/> the criminal law of England, and operating <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>equally throughout
British America, so that <lb/>
a British American, belonging to what <lb/>
province he may, or going to any other <lb/>
part of the Confederation, knows what his <lb/>
rights are in that respect, and what his <lb/>
punishment will be if an offender
against the <lb/>
criminal laws of the land.   I think this is one <lb/>
of the most marked instances in which <lb/>
we take
advantage of the experience derived <lb/>
from our observations of the defects in the <lb/>
Constitution of the neighboring Republic. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.)   The 33rd provision is of very <lb/>
great importance to the future well-being of <lb/>
these colonies.   It commits to the General <lb/>
Parliament the " rendering uniform all or <lb/>
any of the laws relative to property and civil <lb/>
rights in Upper Canada, Nova Scotia, New <lb/>
Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, and rendering uniform the pro<lb break="no"/>cedure of all or any of the courts in these <lb/>
provinces."   The great principles which <lb/>
govern the laws of all the provinces, with <lb/>
the single exception of Lower Canada, are <lb/>
the same, although there may be a divergence <lb/>
in details; and it is gratifying to find, on the <lb/>
part of the Lower Provinces, a general de<lb break="no"/>sire to join together with Upper Canada in <lb/>
this matter, and to procure, as soon as possi<lb break="no"/>ble, an assimilation of the statutory laws and <lb/>
the procedure in the courts, of all these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.   At present there is a good deal of <lb/>
diversity.   In one of the colonies, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, they have no municipal system at all. <lb/>
In another, the municipal system is merely <lb/>
permissive, and has not been adopted to any <lb/>
extent.   Although, therefore, a legislative <lb/>
union was found to be almost impracticable, <lb/>
it was understood, so far as we could influence <lb/>
the future, that the first act of the Confeder<lb break="no"/><cb/>ate Government should
be to procure an as<lb break="no"/>similation of the statutory law of all those <lb/>
provinces, which has, as its root and founda<lb break="no"/>tion, the common law of England.
  But to <lb/>
prevent local interests from being over-ridden, <lb/>
the same section makes provision, that, while <lb/>
power is given to the General Legislature to <lb/>
deal with this subject, no change in this <lb/>
respect should have the force and authority <lb/>
of law in any province until sanctioned by <lb/>
the Legislature of that province.   (Hear, <lb/>
hear.)   The General Legislature is to have <lb/>
power to establish a general Court of Appeal <lb/>
for the Federated Provinces.   Although the <lb/>
Canadian Legislature
has always had the <lb/>
power to establish a Court of Appeal, to <lb/>
which appeals may be made from the
courts <lb/>
of Upper and Lower Canada, we have never <lb/>
availed ourselves of the power.   Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada has its own Court of Appeal, so has <lb/>
Lower Canada.   And this system will con<lb break="no"/>tinue until a General Court of Appeal shall <lb/>
be established by the General Legislature. <lb/>
The Constitution does not provide that such <lb/>
a court shall be established.
There are many <lb/>
arguments for and against the establishment <lb/>
of such a court.   But it was thought wise <lb/>
and expedient to put into the Constitution a <lb/>
power to the General Legislature, that, if <lb/>
after full consideration they think it advisa<lb break="no"/>ble to establish a General Court of Appeal <lb/>
from all the Superior Courts of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, they may do so. (Hear, hear.)   I <lb/>
shall not go over the other powers that are <lb/>
conferred on the General Parliament.  Most <lb/>
of them refer to matters of financial and <lb/>
commercial interest, and I leave those sub<lb break="no"/>jects in other and better hands.   Besides <lb/>
all the powers that are specifically given in <lb/>
the 37th and last item of this portion of the <lb/>
Constitution, confers on the General Legis<lb break="no"/>lature the general mass of sovereign legisla<lb break="no"/>tion, the power to legislate on " all matters <lb/>
of a general character, not specially and ex<lb break="no"/>clusively reserved for the local governments <lb/>
and legislatures."   This is precisely the <lb/>
provision which is wanting in the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the United States. It is here that we <lb/>
find the weakness of the American system<lb break="no"/>the point where the American Constitution <lb/>
breaks down. (Hear, hear.)   It is in itself a <lb/>
wise and necessary provision.   We thereby <lb/>
strengthen the Central Parliament, and make <lb/>
the Confederation one people and one govern<lb break="no"/>ment, instead of five peoples and five govern<lb break="no"/>ments, with merely a point of authority con<lb break="no"/>necting us to a limited and insufficient extent. <lb/>

   With respect to the
local governments, it is <lb/>
provided that each shall be governed by a <lb/>
chief executive officer, who shall be nomin<lb break="no"/>ated by the General Government.   As this is <lb/>
to be one united province, with the local <lb/>
governments and legislatures subordinate to <lb/>
the General Government and Legislature, it is <lb/>
obvious that the chief executive officer in <lb/>
each of the provinces must be subordinate <lb/>
as well.   The General Government assumes <lb/>
towards the
local governments
precisely the <lb/>
same position as the Imperial Government <lb/>
holds with respect to each of the colonies <lb/>
now ; so that as the Lieutenant Governor of <lb/>
each of the different
provinces is now ap<lb break="no"/>pointed directly by the Queen, and is direct<lb break="no"/>ly responsible, and reports directly to Her, <lb/>
so will the executives of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments hereafter be subordinate to the Rep<lb break="no"/>resentative of the Queen, and be responsible <lb/>
and report to him.   Objection has been tak<lb break="no"/>en that there is an infringement of the <lb/>
Royal prerogative in giving the pardoning <lb/>
power to the local governors, who are not <lb/>
appointed directly by the Crown, but only <lb/>
indirectly by the Chief Executive of the <lb/>
Confederation, who is appointed by the <lb/>
Crown.   This provision was inserted in the <lb/>
Constitution on account of the practical dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty which must arise if the power is <lb/>
confined to the Governor General.   For ex<lb break="no"/>ample, if a question arose about the dis<lb break="no"/>charge of a prisoner convicted of a minor <lb/>
offence, say in Newfoundland, who might be <lb/>
in imminent danger of losing his life if he <lb/>
remained in confinement, the exercise of the <lb/>
pardoning power might come too late if it <lb/>
were necessary to wait for the action of the <lb/>
Governor General.   It must be remembered <lb/>
that the pardoning power not only extends <lb/>
to capital cases, but to every case of convic<lb break="no"/>tion and sentence, no matter how trifling-<lb/>even to the case of a fine in the nature of a <lb/>
sentence on a criminal conviction. It extends <lb/>
to innumerable cases, where, if the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility for its exercise were thrown on the <lb/>
General Executive, it could not be so satis<lb break="no"/>factorily discharged,   Of course there must <lb/>
be, in each province, a legal adviser of the <lb/>
Executive, occupying the position of our <lb/>
Attorney General, as there is in every state of <lb/>
the American Union.   This officer will be <lb/>
an
officer of the Local Government ; but, if <lb/>
the pardoning power is reserved for the <lb/>
Chief Executive, there must,
in every case <lb/>
where the exercise of the pardoning power is <lb/>
sought, be a
direct communication and report <lb/>
from the local law officer to the Governor <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               General. The
practical inconvenience of <lb/>
this was felt to be so great, that it was <lb/>
thought well to propose the arrangement we <lb/>
did, without any desire to infringe upon the <lb/>
prerogatives of the Crown, for our whole ac<lb break="no"/>tion shews that the Conference, in every step <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> they took, were
actuated by a desire to guard <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> jealously these
prerogatives.   (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
It is a subject, however, of Imperial interest, <lb/>
and if the Imperial Government and Imperial <lb/>
Parliament are not convinced by the argu<lb break="no"/>ments we will be able to press upon them for <lb/>
the continuation of that clause, then, of <lb/>
course, as the over-ruling power, they may <lb/>
set it aside.   (Hear, hear.)   There are nu<lb break="no"/>merous subjects which belong, of right, both <lb/>
to the Local and the General Parliaments. <lb/>
In all these cases it is provided, in order <lb/>
to prevent a conflict of authority, that <lb/>
where there is concurrent jurisdiction in the <lb/>
General and Local Parliaments, the same rule <lb/>
should apply as now applies in cases where <lb/>
there is concurrent jurisdiction in the Im<lb break="no"/>perial and in the Provincial Parliaments, and <lb/>
that when the legislation of the one is adverse <lb/>
to or contradictory of the legislation of the. <lb/>
other, in all such cases the action of the <lb/>
General Parliament must overrule, ex-neces<lb break="no"/>sitate, the action of the Local Legislature. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.)   We have introduced also all <lb/>
those provisions which are necessary in order <lb/>
to the full working out of the British Consti<lb break="no"/>tution in these provinces.   We provide that <lb/>
there shall be no money votes, unless those <lb/>
votes are introduced in the popular branch <lb/>
of the Legislature on the authority of the <lb/>
responsible advisers of the Crown—those <lb/>
with whom the responsibility rests of equal<lb break="no"/>izing revenue and expenditure—thnt ere <lb/>
can be no expenditure or authorization of <lb/>
expenditure by Address or in any other way <lb/>
unless initiated by the Crown on the advice <lb/>
of its responsible advisers.   (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
As regards the financial features of the <lb/>
scheme, the arrangements made as to the <lb/>
present liabilities of the several provinces, <lb/>
and the future liabilities of the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, on these and kindred matters, I have <lb/>
no doubt that my honorable friends, the <lb/>
Finance Minister and the President of the <lb/>
Council, will speak at full length, and that <lb/>
they will be able to show you that this branch <lb/>
of the subject has received the fullest con<lb break="no"/>sideration.   I feel I would be intruding <lb/>
myself unnecessarily on the House if, with <lb/>
my inferior knowledge of those subjects I <lb/>
were to detain you by venturing to speak of <lb/>
them, when I
know that they will be
so ably <lb/>
          
            <pb n="43" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0043.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">43</fw>
       
       and fully gone into
by my two honorable <lb/>
friends.   The last resolution of any import<lb break="no"/>ance is one which, although not affecting the <lb/>
substance of the Constitution, is of interest to <lb/>
us all.   It is that " Her Majesty the Queen <lb/>
be solicited to determine the rank and name <lb/>
of the federated provinces."   I do not know <lb/>
whether there will be any expression of <lb/>
opinion in this House on this subject<lb break="no"/>whether we are to be a vice-royalty, or whether <lb/>
we are still to retain our name and rank as a <lb/>
province.   But I have no doubt Her Majesty <lb/>
will give the matter Her gracious considera<lb break="no"/>tion, that She will give us a name satisfactory <lb/>
to us all, and that the rank She will confer <lb/>
upon us will be a rank worthy of our position, <lb/>
of our resources, and of our future. (Cheers.)
<lb/>
Let me again, before I sit down, impress
upon <lb/>
this House the necessity of meeting this <lb/>
question in a spirit of compromise, with
a <lb/>
disposition to judge the matter as a whole, <lb/>
to consider whether really it is for the benefit <lb/>
and advantage of the country to form a Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the provinces ; and if <lb/>
honorable gentlemen, whatever may have <lb/>
been their preconceived ideas as to the <lb/>
merits of the details of this measure, whatever <lb/>
ma still be their opinions as to these details, <lb/>
if they really believe that the scheme is one <lb/>
by which the prosperity of the country will <lb/>
be increased, and its future progress secured, <lb/>
I ask them to yield their own views, and to <lb/>
deal with the scheme according to its merits <lb/>
as one great whole.   (Hear, hear.)   One <lb/>
argument, but not a strong one, has been <lb/>
used against
this Confederation, that it is an <lb/>
advance towards independence.   Some are <lb/>
apprehensive that the very fact of our forming <lb/>
this union will hasten the time when we shall <lb/>
be severed from the mother country. I have <lb/>
no apprehension of that kind.   I believe it <lb/>
will have the contrary effect.   I believe that <lb/>
as we grow stronger, that, as it is felt in <lb/>
England we have become a people, able from <lb/>
our union, our strength, our population, and <lb/>
the development of our resources, to take <lb/>
our position among the nations of the world, <lb/>
she will be less willing to part with us than <lb/>
she would be now, when we are broken up <lb/>
into a number of insignificant colonies, sub<lb break="no"/>ject to attack piece-meal without any con<lb break="no"/>certed action or common organization of <lb/>
defence.   I am strongly of opinion that <lb/>
year by year, as we grow in population and <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> strength, England will more see the advan<lb break="no"/>tages of maintaining the alliance between <lb/>
British North America and herself.  
Does <lb/>
            <cb/>
               any one imagine that,
when our population <lb/>
           instead of three and
a-half, will be seven <lb/>
            millions, as it will
be ere many years pass, <lb/>
             we would be one whit
more willing than now <lb/>
            to sever the
connection with England!
<lb/>
            Would not those seven
millions be just as <lb/>
             anxious to maintain
their allegiance to the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Queen and their
connection with the <lb/>
           Mother Country, as we
are now?   Will the <lb/>
             addition to our
numbers of the people of <lb/>
the Lower Provinces, in any way lessen our <lb/>
desire to continue our connection with the <lb/>
            Mother Country ? I
believe the people of <lb/>
Canada East and West to be truly loyal. <lb/>
But, if they can by possibility be exceeded <lb/>
             in loyalty, it is by
the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            Maritime Provinces.
  Loyalty with them is <lb/>
an overruling passion.   (Hear, hear.)   In <lb/>
all parts of the Lower Provinces there is a <lb/>
rivalry between the opposing political parties <lb/>
as to which shall most strongly express and <lb/>
most effectively carry out the principle of <lb/>
loyalty to Her Majesty, and to the British <lb/>
Crown.   (Hear, hear.)   When this union <lb/>
takes place, we will be at the outset no incon<lb break="no"/>siderable people.   We find ourselves with a <lb/>
population approaching four millions of souls. <lb/>
Such a population in Europe
would make a <lb/>
second, or at least, a third rate power.   And <lb/>
with a rapidly increasing population—for I a <lb/>
satisfied that under this union our popula<lb break="no"/>tion will increase in a still greater ratio than <lb/>
ever before—with increased credit—with a <lb/>
higher position in the eyes
of Europe—with <lb/>
the increased security we can offer to immi<lb break="no"/>grants, who would naturally prefer to seek a <lb/>
new home in what is known to them as a <lb/>
great country, than in any one little colony <lb/>
or another—with all this I am satisfied that, <lb/>
great as has been our increase in the last <lb/>
twenty-five years since the union between <lb/>
             Upper and Lower
Canada, our future pro<lb break="no"/>gress, during the next quarter of a century, <lb/>
will be vastly greater.   (Cheers.)   And <lb/>
when, by means of this rapid increase, we <lb/>
become a nation of eight or nine millions of <lb/>
inhabitants, our alliance will be worthy of <lb/>
being sought by the great nations of the <lb/>
earth.   (Hear, hear.)   I am proud to believe <lb/>
that our desire for a permanent alliance will <lb/>
be reciprocated in England.   I know that <lb/>
there is a party in England—but it is in<lb break="no"/>considerable in numbers, though strong in <lb/>
intellect and power—which speaks of the <lb/>
desirability of getting rid of the colonies ; but <lb/>
I believe such is not the feeling of the states<lb break="no"/>men and the people
of England.   I believe <lb/>
           
            <pb n="44" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0044.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">44</fw>
       
       it will never be the
deliberately expressed <lb/>
determination of the Government of Great <lb/>
Britain.   (Hear, hear.)   The colonies are <lb/>
now in a transition state.   Gradually a dif<lb break="no"/>ferent colonial system is being developed<lb break="no"/>and it will become, year by year, less a case <lb/>
of dependence on our part, and of overruling <lb/>
protection on the part of the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try, and more a case of a healthy and cordial <lb/>
alliance.   Instead of looking upon us as a <lb/>
merely dependent colony, England will have <lb/>
in us a friendly nation—a subordinate but <lb/>
still a powerful people—to stand by her in <lb/>
North America in peace or in war. (Cheers.) <lb/>
The people of Australia will be such another <lb/>
subordinate nation.   And England will have <lb/>
this advantage, if her colonies pragress <lb/>
under the new colonial system, as I believe <lb/>
they will, that, though at war with all the <lb/>
rest of the world, she will be able to look to <lb/>
the subordinate nations in alliance with her, <lb/>
and owning allegiance to the same Sovreign, <lb/>
who will assist in enabling her again to <lb/>
meet the whole world in arms, as she has <lb/>
done before. (Cheers.) And if, in the great <lb/>
Napoleonic war, with every port in Eurcpe <lb/>
closed against her commerce, she was yet <lb/>
able to hold her own, how much more will <lb/>
that be the case when she has a colonial em<lb break="no"/>pire rapidly increasing in power, in wealth, <lb/>
in influence, and in position. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
It is true that we stand in danger, as we <lb/>
have stood in danger again and again in <lb/>
Canada, of being plunged into war and suf<lb break="no"/>fering all its dreadful consequences, as the <lb/>
result of causes over which we have no con<lb break="no"/>trol, by reason of their connection.   This, <lb/>
however, did not intimidate us.   At the <lb/>
very mention of the prospect of a war some <lb/>
time ago, how were the feelings of the people <lb/>
aroused from one extremity of British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica to the other, and preparations made for <lb/>
meeting its worst consequences.   Although <lb/>
the people of this country are fully aware <lb/>
of the horrors of war—should a war arise, <lb/>
unfortunately, between the United States <lb/>
and England, and we all pray it never may <lb/>
—they are still ready to encounter all perils <lb/>
of that kind, for the sake of the connection <lb/>
with England.   There is not one adverse <lb/>
voice, not one adverse opinion on that point. <lb/>
We all feel the advantages we derive from <lb/>
our connection with England.   So long as <lb/>
that alliance is maintained, we enjoy, under <lb/>
her protection, the privileges of constitu<lb break="no"/>tional liberty according to the British sys<lb/>tem.   We
will enjoy here that which is the <lb/>
            <cb/>
               great test of
constitutional freedom—we will <lb/>
have the rights of the minority respected <lb/>
(Hear, hear.)   In all countries the rights <lb/>
of the majority take care of themselves, but <lb/>
it is only in countries like England, enjoy<lb break="no"/>ing constitutional liberty, and safe from the <lb/>
tyrany of a single despot or of an unbridled <lb/>
democracy, that the rights of minorities are <lb/>
regarded.   So long, too, as we form a portion <lb/>
of the British Empire, we shall have the ex<lb break="no"/>ample of her free institutions, of the high <lb/>
standard of the character of her statesmen <lb/>
and public men, of the purity of her legis<lb break="no"/>lation, and the upright administration of <lb/>
her laws.   In this
younger country one <lb/>
great advantage of our connection with <lb/>
Great Britain will be, that, under her <lb/>
auspices, inspired by her example, a portion <lb/>
of her empire, our public men will be actu<lb break="no"/>ated by principles similar to those which <lb/>
actuate the statesmen at home.   These al<lb break="no"/>though not material, physical benefits, of <lb/>
which you can make an arithmetical calcu<lb break="no"/>lation, are of such overwhelming advantage <lb/>
to our future interests and standing as a <lb/>
nation, that to obtain them is well worthy <lb/>
of any sacrifices we may be called upon to <lb/>
make, and the people of this country are <lb/>
ready to make them.  (Cheers.)  We should <lb/>
feel, also, sincerely grateful to benificent <lb/>
Providence that we have had the opportun<lb break="no"/>ity vouchsafed us of calmly considering this <lb/>
great constitutional change, this peaceful <lb/>
revolution—that we have not been hurried <lb/>
into it, like the United States, by the ex<lb break="no"/>igencies of war—that we have not had a <lb/>
violent revolutionary period forced on us, as <lb/>
in other nations, by hostile action from with<lb break="no"/>out, or by domestic dissensions within. Here <lb/>
we are in peace and prosperity, under the <lb/>
fostering government of Great Britain-<lb/>a dependent people, with a government <lb/>
having only a limited and delegated
au<lb break="no"/>thority, and yet allowed, without restric<lb break="no"/>tion, and without jealousy on the part of <lb/>
the Mother Country , to legislate
for our<lb break="no"/>selves, and peacefully and deliberately to <lb/>
consider and determine the future of Cana<lb break="no"/>da and of British North America.   It is <lb/>
our happiness to know the expression of the <lb/>
will of our Gracious Sovereign, through Her <lb/>
Ministers, that we have her full sanction for <lb/>
our deliberations, that Her only solicitude is <lb/>
that we shall adopt a system which shall be <lb/>
really for our advantage, and that She prom<lb break="no"/>ises to sanction whatever conclusion after full <lb/>
deliberation we may arrive at as to the best <lb/>
          
            <pb n="45" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-06_Page_0045.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">45</fw>
        
        mode of securing the
well-being,—the present <lb/>
and future prosperity of British America.<lb break="no"/>(Cheers.)   It is our privilege and happiness <lb/>
to be in such a position, and we cannot be <lb/>
too grateful for the blessings thus conferred <lb/>
upon us.   (Hear, hear.)   I must apologize <lb/>
for having detained you so long— for having <lb/>
gone perhaps too much into tedious details <lb/>
with reference to the questions bearing on <lb/>
the Constitution now submitted to this <lb/>
House. —(Cries of " no, no" and " go
on.") <lb/>
—In conclusion, I would again implore the <lb/>
House not to let this opportunity to pass. <lb/>
It is an opportunity that may never recur. <lb/>
At the risk of repeating myself, I would say, <lb/>
it was only by a happy concurrence of cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, that we were enabled to bring <lb/>
this great question to its present position. <lb/>
If we do not take advantage of the time, if we <lb/>
show ourselves unequal to the occasion, it <lb/>
may never return, and we shall hereafter <lb/>
bitterly and unavailingly regret having failed <lb/>
to embrace the happy opportunity now <lb/>
offered of founding a great nation under the <lb/>
fostering care of Great Britain, and our <lb/>
Sovereign Lady, Queen Victoria.   (Loud <lb/>
cheers, amidst which the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man resumed
his seat). <lb/>
The House, at eleven, P.M., adjourned. <lb/>

            <p> HON. MR. CAMPBELL
said that yester<lb break="no"/>day he had promised to give to the House <lb/>
to-day an explanation of the provision con<lb break="no"/>tained in the 14th resolution relating to the <lb/>
selection of members for the Legislative <lb/>
Council of the General Legislature. This <lb/>
resolution read as follows :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>l4.  The
first selection of the Members of the <lb/>
Legislative Council shall be made, except as re<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>gards Prince Edward
Island, from the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Councils of the various Provinces, so far as <lb/>
a sufficient
number be found qualitied and wil<lb break="no"/>ling to serve ;
such Members shall be appointed <lb/>
by the Crown at the recommendation of the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>General Executive Government, upon the
nomi<lb break="no"/>nation of the respective Local Governments, and<lb/>
in such nomination due regard shall be had to <lb/>
the claims of the Members of the Legislative <lb/>
Council of the Opposition in each Province, so <lb/>
that all political parties may
as nearly as
possible <lb/>
be fairly represented. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> And under it the
first recommendation
for <lb/>
the appointment
of Legislative Councillors <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> from Canada would,
should the Confederation <lb/>
scheme be adopted, come from the existing <lb/>
Government of this province.   In making <lb/>
such recommendations, the spirit of the reso<lb break="no"/>lution would be carefully observed, and both <lb/>
sides in this House and as well life as elected <lb/>
members, be equally considered and fairly re<lb break="no"/>presented in the new Parliament. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. MR.FLINT begged
to inquire whether <lb/>
the resolutions before House were in all <lb/>
respects the
same as those sent to the members. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON. MR. CAMPBELL said
they were not <lb/>
in one particular precisely as first printed, <lb/>
there being a clause in those before the House <lb/>
to allow New Brunswick to impose a duty on <lb/>
timber and logs, and Nova Scotia
on coal, <lb/>
which was not found in the first ; as for the <lb/>
other provinces, the imposition of such duties <lb/>
was reserved to the General Legislature. <lb/>
(Hear, hear, from Mr. CURRIE.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. MR.CAMPBELL said he
hoped that <lb/>
honorable members would rather aid in f urther- <lb break="maybe"/>
ing the scheme than take pleasure in detect<lb break="no"/>ing the supposed causes of opposition.  (Hear.) <lb/>
HON. MR. CURRIE asked
whether the dif<lb break="no"/>ference between the two sets of resolutions <lb/>
was merely a misprint. <lb/>
HON. MR.
CAMPBELL could not say <lb/>
whether it was owing to a misprint or to an <lb/>
error in the manuscript.
<lb/>
HON. MR. CURRIE again asked whether <lb/>
the members of the Conference had not signed <lb/>
the instrument containing its resolutions ? <lb/>
HON. MR. CAMPBELL could only say that <lb/>
the resolutions now before the House truly <lb/>
and expressly represented the conclusions the <lb/>
Conference had
arrived at.   (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
Those conclusions had not been changed. <lb/>
HON. MR. CURRIE then rose and said <lb/>
that the measure now before the House was <lb/>
the most important one ever submitted to a <lb/>
Colonial Legislature, and he hoped to be able <lb/>
to approach it with entire freedom from party  <lb/>
spirit, and without the purpose
of finding out <lb/>
unnecessary objections.   He hoped he would, <lb/>
at all times, be able to judge of the measures <lb/>
presented with the fairness and candour of a <lb/>
Canadian and a British subject.   At the out<lb break="no"/>set he would, however, say, that the project <lb/>
now before the House had taken the country <lb/>
by surprise.   The first time he had ever ad<lb break="no"/>dressed the House he
was reported to have <lb/>
spoken thus :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>That by a course of
legislation alike moderate, <lb/>
prudent and upright, it will yet be the lot of some <lb/>
present to
live and see the day when Canada will<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>be the centre of a
noble British North American <lb/>
Confederecy extending from the Atlantic to the <lb/>
