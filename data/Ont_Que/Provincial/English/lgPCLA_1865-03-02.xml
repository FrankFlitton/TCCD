            <!--<p>
     swer is, that we do not enough count upon 
     <lb/>
     men's good sense, good feeling, forbearance, 
     <lb/>
     and all that sort of thing. But, sir, if the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of this scheme is so to improve our 
     <lb/>
     position, is to make everything so smooth, 
     <lb/>
     to make all our public men so wise, so pru<lb break="no"/>dent, and so conscientious, I should like to 
     <lb/>
     know why a something of the same kind may 
     <lb/>
     not by possibility be hoped for, even though 
     <lb/>
     this project should be set aside. If we are to 
     <lb/>
     be capable of the far harder task of working 
     <lb/>
     out these projected unworkable political in<lb break="no"/>stitutions, why is it that we must be incap<lb break="no"/>able of the easier task of going on without 
     <lb/>
     them ? I know well that in all time the tem<lb break="no"/>per of those who do not think has been to put 
     <lb/>
     faith rather in the great thing one cannot do, 
     <lb/>
     than in the smaller thing one can. " If the 
     <lb/>
     prophet had bid thee do some great thing, 
     <lb/>
     wouldest thou not have done it? " And here 
     <lb/>
     too, air, as so often before, if the truth must 
     <lb/>
     be told, the one thing truly needed is what 
     <lb/>
     one may call the smaller thing—not perhaps 
     <lb/>
     easy, but one must hope not impossible—the 
     <lb/>
     exercise by our public men and by our people 
     <lb/>
     of that amount of discretion, good temper and 
     <lb/>
     forbearance which sees something larger and 
     <lb/>
     higher in public life than mere party struggles 
     <lb/>
     and crises without end; of that political saga<lb break="no"/>city or capacity, call it which you will, with 
     <lb/>
     which they will surely find the institutions 
     <lb/>
     they have to be quite good enough for 
     <lb/>
     them to use and quietly make better, with<lb break="no"/>out which they will as surely find any 
     <lb/>
     that may anyhow be given them, to be 
     <lb/>
     quite bad enough for them to fight over 
     <lb/>
     and make worse.- Mr. SPEAKER, I feel that 
     <lb/>
     I have taken up a great deal of the time of 
     <lb/>
     the House, and that I have presented but 
     <lb/>
     imperfectly the views I am anxious to impress 
     <lb/>
     upon it as to this great question. But for 
     <lb/>
     sheer want of strength, I might have felt it 
     <lb/>
     necessary, at whatever risk of wearying the 
     <lb/>
     House, to go into some matters more thor<lb break="no"/>oughly, and more especially into that branch 
     <lb/>
     of the subject which relates to what I may 
     <lb/>
     call the alternative policy I myself prefer to 
     <lb/>
     this measure, and would wish to see adopted 
     <lb/>
     and carried out. As it is, I have but to say 
     <lb/>
     in conclusion, while warmly thanking the 
     <lb/>
     House for the attention and patience with 
     <lb/>
     which it has for so many hours listened to 
     <lb/>
     me, that I have said nothing but what I 
     <lb/>
     firmly believe, and felt myself bound to say, 
     <lb/>
     and that I trust the sober good sense of the 
     <lb/>
     people of these provinces, after full reflection 
     <lb/>
     and discussion, will decide rightly upon this 
     <lb/>
     the largest question by far that has ever been 
     <lb/>
     before them for decision. (Cheers)

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ARCH1">MR. ARCHAMBEAULT</persName>—In rising on 
     <lb/>this occasion, sir, my intention is not to 
     <lb/>occupy the attention of the House for a 
     <lb/>long time, nor to discuss the merits of the 
     <lb/>measure which is now before us. I intend 
     <lb/>merely to explain my own motives for the 
     <lb/>vote which I shall give, and this I shall do 
     <lb/>as briefly as possible. I am bound to ac<lb break="no"/>knowledge at once that when I arrived in 
     <lb/>Quebec, at the commencement of the session, 
     <lb/>I was opposed to the plan of Confederation, 
     <lb/>and so strongly opposed to it, that I was 
     <lb/>fully determined to vote against it. But 
     <lb/>alter a more serious consideration of the 
     <lb/>question, and after hearing the explanations 
     <lb/>which have been afforded to us of the 
     <lb/>scheme of the Government, I have arrived 
     <lb/>at the conviction that I had decided, if not 
     <lb/>wrongly, at least hastily, and that I ought 
     <lb/>not to aid in the rejection of the measure, 
     <lb/>merely because it did not quite coincide 
     <lb/>with all my opinions. After listening to 
     <lb/>the discussion, and the explanations of the 
     <lb/>members of the Administration, I perceived 
     <lb/>that the plan was one of compromise and 
     <lb/>could not, therefore, be adapted to suit all 
     <lb/>views, nor shaped even to meet those of the 
     <lb/>men who framed it. I can understand that 
     <lb/>those persons who are opposed to any degree 
     <lb/>of Confederation, and who would rather 
     <lb/>have representation based on poulation or 
     <lb/>the annexation of Canada to the United 
     <lb/>States, may be opposed to the project of the 
     <lb/>Government, and reject it accordingly ; but 
     <lb/>those who, like myself, are not opposed to it
     <lb/>under any circumstances, and are capable of 
     <lb/>appreciating the necessity of it at the present 
     <lb/>conjuncture, together with the advantages it 
     <lb/>may produce to the country, ought not, can<lb break="no"/>not, I think, reject it, only because some of 
     <lb/>its details are not exactly to their mind. It 
     <lb/>is our business first to enquire whether some 
     <lb/>constitutional changes are not necessary, 
     <lb/>and none I think will deny that they are. 
     <lb/>The political leaders of the two parties into 
     <lb/>which this House is divided, have acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged this as a necessity. It remains, 
     <lb/>therefore, only to consider what changes 
     <lb/>should be made. The members of the 
     <lb/>Government have decided this question, and 
     <lb/>proposed a Confederation of all the Provinces 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="545" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0545.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">545</fw>
           
     of British North America. They have come 
     <lb/>
     to an understanding with the sister provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and now lay before you their scheme of a 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. We are not now to inquire 
     <lb/>
     whether all the details of the scheme per<lb break="no"/>fectly agree in every point with our particu<lb break="no"/>lar ideas, but whether the change is neces<lb break="no"/>sary, whether the proposed scheme is good 
     <lb/>
     and fit to be accepted as a whole ; for, as 
     <lb/>
     the scheme is a compromise between differ<lb break="no"/>ent parties, whose interests are at variance 
     <lb/>
     with each other, the Government who now 
     <lb/>
     move its adoption must be held to be respon<lb break="no"/>sible for all its details. Any amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the plan passed by this House would really 
     <lb/>
     be a vote of want of confidence in the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and you must therefore either 
     <lb/>
      adopt the plan as laid before you, or pass a vote 
     <lb/>
     of want of confidence in the present Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration. Now, I for my part am not prepared 
     <lb/>
     to vote a want of confidence in the men now 
     <lb/>
     in power. To induce me to do that, I must 
     <lb/>
     see in their opponents a better security for 
     <lb/>
     good government, and its advantages to the 
     <lb/>
     country, than they are able to show ; I 
     <lb/>
     must hope to find in the latter something 
     <lb/>
     better than what I find in those whose 
     <lb/>
     measures they withstand. So far, I do 
     <lb/>
     not find that they have offered, nor do 
     <lb/>
     I find that they now offer, such security 
     <lb/>
     or such hope. Far from it ; if we are to 
     <lb/>
     judge them by their former acts, we must 
     <lb/>
     confess that we cannot give them our con<lb break="no"/>fidence, that they have displayed great want 
     <lb/>
     of capacity for the government and manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the affairs of the country. When 
     <lb/>
     they were in  power they had no decided 
     <lb/>
     policy, they were incapable of dealing with 
     <lb/>
     any important question : they lived from 
     <lb/>
     hand to mouth. Their acts in the Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration were stamped with a spirit of resent<lb break="no"/>ment and injustice towards their adversaries. 
     <lb/>
     They instituted commissions of inquiry, for 
     <lb/>
     instance, against public officers, in order to 
     <lb/>
     get a pretext for dismissing them and making 
     <lb/>
     room for their hungry partisans. Again, 
     <lb/>
     have they any better plan to propose to us 
     <lb/>
     than that of the Government ? No ! They 
     <lb/>
     might offer us, perhaps, representation based 
     <lb/>
     on population, or annexation to the United 
     <lb/>
     States ; but I do not think such remedies 
     <lb/>
     would suit our taste. In these circum<lb break="no"/>stances, I have no hesitation in declaring  
     <lb/>
      that I shall vote for the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, as presented to us by the Government, 
     <lb/>
     although it does not meet all my views, and 
     <lb/>
     does not promise all the guarantees which I 
     <lb/>
     should be glad to find in it, and although I 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     do not consider it as likely, in its present 
     <lb/>
     form, to afford a sufficient safeguard for the 
     <lb/>
     interests of the different provinces, and to 
     <lb/>
     secure stability in the working of the pro<lb break="no"/>posed union.  As I am not in a position to 
     <lb/>
     influence public opinion, so as to oblige the 
     <lb/>
     Government to modify their plan to suit my 
     <lb/>
     views, I take sides with the men who have 
     <lb/>
      always had my confidence, and with whom I 
     <lb/>
     have always acted, because I have confidence 
     <lb/>
     in their honesty and their patriotism. I 
     <lb/>
     cherish a belief that in this all-important 
     <lb/>
     question, which affects our best interests and 
     <lb/>
     our national existence and social welfare, 
     <lb/>
     they have been actuated by the same love 
     <lb/>
     for their country which has ever guided 
     <lb/>
     them in times past. (Cheers.)

               <persName ref="pers:BLAN1">Mr. BLANCHET</persName> said - Mr. Speaker, <lb/>as no one is disposed to take the floor just<lb/>now, and it would seem as if all who intend<lb/>to discuss this question are bent on having<lb/>a large audience in the galleries, I shall<lb/>take upon me to say a few words. Those<lb/>who moved to have the speeches of this<lb/>House printed in official form certainly did<lb/>no good service to the country ; for all are<lb/>trying which shall make the longest speech,<lb/>and I do not think it is altogether just to<lb/>the public purse. Each one would speak at<lb/>a particular hour, and to the ears of a cer<lb break="no"/>tain audience ; but the history of the Par<lb break="no"/>liament of England shews that her great<lb/>statesmen and orators did not concern them<lb break="no"/>selves about that. The greatest and most<lb/>important speeches were delivered in the<lb/>House of Commons at a very late hour of<lb/>the night ; thus Fox delivered his great<lb/>speech on the East India Bill at two o'clock<lb/>in the morning ; Pitt his on the abolition of<lb/>the slave trade at four o'clock in the morn<lb break="no"/>ing ; and we should lose nothing by speaking<lb/>before half-past seven in the evening. But<lb/>as the honorble member for Montmorency<lb/>(Hon. Mr. CAUCHON) is to speak this evening,<lb/>and I wish to explain my way of thinking<lb/>on the question, I rise to do so. This<lb/>question of Confederation is not a new one.<lb/>It has already agitated men's minds and<lb/>been a subject of debate for a great many<lb/>years. Now public opinion is completely<lb/>made up concerning it. I have no occasion<lb/>to enter into details respecting the scheme<lb/>which we have before us. It has been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed with much more of knowledge and<lb/>precision than I bring to the consideration<lb/>of the subject, by the members of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and the honorable members on the<lb/>opposite side of the House. I need not say<lb/>

     that the territory intended to be included

     in the Confederacy is nearly as large as 
     <lb/>
     all Europe, that it will contain four mil<lb break="no"/>lions of souls, and that having confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, we shall become the fourth power in

     the world in respect of merchant shipping. 
     <lb/>
     We have only to compare the statement of

     our present imports and exports with that of

     the United States a few years ago, and we

     written by Mr. BIGELOW, at present <hi rendition="simple:italic">chargé 
     <lb/>
     d' affaires</hi> from the American Government 
     <lb/>
     to the Tuileries, containing valuable statistics 
     <lb/>
     of the commerce,  manufactures and resources 
     <lb/>
     of the United States, as well as of the war 
     <lb/>
     at present raging in that country. In the 
     <lb/>
     chapter devoted to commerce, he writes as 
     <lb/>
     follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         After the reorganization of the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     government in 1798, commerce speedily  grew to 
     <lb/>
     vast proportions. The tonnage, which, in l792, was 
     <lb/>
     564,437 tons, had reached 1,032,219 in 1801 ; the 
     <lb/>
     imports valued in 1792 at 31,500,000 dollars 
     <lb/>
     (157,500,000 francs), were in 1801, 111,363,511 
     <lb/>
     dollars (556,817,555 francs) ; the exports had in 
     <lb/>
     the same period risen from 20,753,098 dollars 
     <lb/>
     (103,765,490 francs) to 94,115,925 dollars (470, 
     <lb/>
     579,625 francs). In  1807 the tonnage was 1,268,<lb break="no"/>548 ; the imports 138,500,000 dollars (692,500,<lb break="no"/>000 francs) ; and the exports 108,343, 150 dollars 
     <lb/>
      (541,715,750 francs). At that period, American 
     <lb/>
     commerce received a blow from which it did not 
     <lb/>
     recover for several years. The measures of the 
     <lb/>
     English Parliament, followed by Napoleon's 
     <lb/>
     decrees, issued from Berlin and Milan, and by the 
     <lb/>
     embargo of 1807, produced a deep stagnation in 
     <lb/>
     the commercial affairs of the Union, and although 
     <lb/>
     the amount of tonnage did not very perceptibly 
     <lb/>
     diminish during the fifteen following years, the 
     <lb/>
     imports fell in 1808 to 56,990,000 dollars (284,<lb break="no"/>950,000 francs), and exports 22,430,960 dollars 
     <lb/>
     (112,154,000 francs). The war of 1812-'16 gave 
     <lb/>
     employment to the shipping which would other<lb break="no"/>wise have rotted in the docks, and occasioned 
     <lb/>
     some clipper privateers to be built ; but the 
     <lb/>
      trade of the country continued to decline, so 
     <lb/>
     that in 1814 the imports rose only to 12,965,000 
     <lb/>
     dollars (64,825,000 francs), and the exports 
     <lb/>
     6,927,441 dollars (34,637,205 francs.) The end<lb break="no"/>ing of the war gave activity to commercial pur<lb break="no"/>suits. In 1815 the imports reached 113,041,274 
     <lb/>
     dollars (565,206,370 francs) and in 1816, 147, 
     <lb/>
     103,000 dollars (735,515,000 francs); the exports 
     <lb/>
     of these same years were 52,557,753 dollars 
     <lb/>
     (262,788,765 francs) and 81,905,452 dollars 
     <lb/>
     (409,602,250 francs). This amount of imports, 
     <lb/>
     which was in excess of the requirements of the 
     <lb/>
     country at that time, fell the  following year to 
     <lb/>
     99,250,000 dollars (496,250 ,000 francs), and from 
     <lb/>
     that period to 1830, excepting the year 1818, the 
     <lb/>
      average amount of the imports did not exceed 78 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     millions of dollars (390 millions of francs), and 
     <lb/>
     the exports reached about the same amount. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Thus we find that the average amount of the 
     <lb/>
     imports and exports did not exceed $78,000,<lb break="no"/>000 at that time. We are only a few years 
     <lb/>
     behind the United States in that respect. I 
     <lb/>
     said a moment ago that the question of a 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of all the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     North America was not a new one, and in 
     <lb/>
     fact we find that it was mooted at a somewhat 
     <lb/>
     remote period of the history of the country. In 
     <lb/>
     1821, the leader of the Upper Canada Radi<lb break="no"/>cals, Mr. W. L. MacKenzie, declared that he 
     <lb/>
     wished with his whole heart that there could 
     <lb/>
     be a Confederation of the British Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Ten years later the scheme became a special 
     <lb/>
     question of debate, and the discussion 
     <lb/>
     established it as a positive fact, as it will 
     <lb/>
     soon be an historical one. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Others besides the members on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House are in favor of a Federal union ; 
     <lb/>
      some incline to a Confederation of all the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, others to a Federal union of the 
     <lb/>
     two Canadas only—all are well disposed to a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union of one kind or other. At the 
     <lb/>
     time of the crisis of 1858, the Brown-Dorion  
     <lb/>
     Government were to settle the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     then besetting us, and if I understood the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of one of the members of that 
     <lb/>
     Government, who went to meet his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents in order that they might ratify his 
     <lb/>
     acceptance of a portfolio in that Adminis 
     <lb/>
     tration, the remedy intended to be applied 
     <lb/>
     to the existing evils by that Cabinet was a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union of the two Canadas ; but he 
     <lb/>
     said also that, although the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Government to which he belonged was not 
     <lb/>
     yet clearly defined, he thought they would 
     <lb/>
     take up, at some future day, the question of 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation of all the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. That hon. member 
     <lb/>
     was the Hon. F. Lemieux, and he was re<lb break="no"/>turned by the county of Lévis immediately 
     <lb/>
     after making these declarations. Nearly 
     <lb/>
     about the same time Mr. J. C. Taché,   
     <lb/>
     present Secretary of the Board of Agricul<lb break="no"/>ture, wrote a work which was almost prophe<lb break="no"/>tic of the question of a Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     British North American Provinces. It is 
     <lb/>
     unnecessary to remark that that gentleman 
     <lb/>
     had acquired much experience in his travels, 
     <lb/>
     and much information by hard study and 
     <lb/>
     presevering labor, and was therefore perfectly 
     <lb/>
     qualified to form a judgment on the question. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Taché has written a work of some 
     <lb/>
     length, in which he roughly sketches the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of a Confederation of the Provinces,

     of which I trust the House will permit me 
     <lb/>
     to cite a few lines. These will show that 
     <lb/>
     his predictions are speedily to be realized :—

     What hopes may we not be allowed to indulge

     satisfied, moreover, with sketching with a

     astonishing to say—although I have no

     doubt that the members of the Conference

     I consider that under the present plan of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation the local legislatures are su<lb break="no"/>preme in respect of the powers which are 
     <lb/>
     attributed to them, that is to say, in respect 
     <lb/>
     of local matters. In this respect it goes 
     <lb/>
     even further than the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga himself was prepared to go in 
     <lb/>
     1859, for he proposed to leave to the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government the right of legislating upon 
     <lb/>
     the French civil laws, &amp;c., of Lower Canada; 
     <lb/>
     but, as his Government was not very long- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     lived, I know that the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga can deny all this. Very nearly 
     <lb/>
     at the same time another Government ad<lb break="no"/>dressed to the Imperial Government a 
     <lb/>
     memorial, in which it asked for the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces; but the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     replied that it was not prepared to give a 
     <lb/>
     decided reply; and as there had been no 
     <lb/>
     agreement between the provinces, the matter 
     <lb/>
     remained in abeyance for the time. Thence<lb break="no"/>forward no steps were taken in the matter 
     <lb/>
     until last year—until the crisis, with the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances connected with which every one 
     <lb/>
     is perfectly well acquainted. Different gov<lb break="no"/>ernments had been defeated, and the country 
     <lb/>
     was already weary of that state of aflairs, 
     <lb/>
     when the honorable member for Hochelaga 
     <lb/>
     moved his vote of censure upon the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in relation to the $100,000 affair, and 
     <lb/>
     the Government then finding itself in a

     minority, was compelled to seek a remedy

     for the existing state of affaire, and the

     ence, and finally the plan of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     although he does not now choose to acknow<lb break="no"/>ledge his offspring.  (Hear, hear.) That 
     <lb/>
     conduct releases the latter from any debt of 
     <lb/>
     gratitude. (Hear.) It is not my intention 
     <lb/>
     to discuss the question of Confederation in a 
     <lb/>
     commercial point of view, nor in a financial 
     <lb/>
     point of view, nor in a political point of view, 
     <lb/>
     for in these several aspects it has been ably 
     <lb/>
     discussed by those who have preceded me. 
     <lb/>
     I shall confine myself to making a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks upon the question in respect of 
     <lb/>
     defence. Every one acknowledges that in 
     <lb/>
     order to defend a country effectually there 
     <lb/>
     must be unity of action, uniformity of system, 
     <lb/>
     and a combination of the means of defence. 
     <lb/>
     Without uniformity, without unity, it is im<lb break="no"/>possible to make any serious attempt at 
     <lb/>
     defence in case of attack, and the divided 
     <lb/>
     country falls an easy prey to the enemy. So 
     <lb/>
     general is this rule that history shews us 
     <lb/>
     that weak nations have always united 
     <lb/>
     together, have always coalesced when they 
     <lb/>
     were attacked or were in fear of being 
     <lb/>
     attacked by a powerful enemy. The North 
     <lb/>
     American colonies did so in 1775, when they 
     <lb/>
     wished to  offer resistance to the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country. They organized themselves into 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation, and it was in consequence 
     <lb/>
     of their so doing that they were able to 
     <lb/>
     resist what they considered as an act of 
     <lb/>
     oppression on the part of England. Had 
     <lb/>
     those colonies, instead of organizing them<lb break="no"/>selves as they did, had each of them a 
     <lb/>
      different system of defence, and had there 
     <lb/>
     been no uniformity in their tactics, England 
     <lb/>
     would have had an easy bargain of them. 
     <lb/>
     And is it to be supposed, if they had not band<lb break="no"/>ed themselves together, so as to possess a cer<lb break="no"/>tain amount of strength, that they would have 
     <lb/>
     obtained the alliance and the assistance of 
     <lb/>
     France ? When a feeble power is attacked 
     <lb/>
     by a powerful enemy, it should seek to ally 
     <lb/>
     itself with other states which have interests 
     <lb/>
     in common with it, in order that they may 
     <lb/>
     defend themselves in common. So far as 
     <lb/>
     we are concerned, if we are desirous of 
     <lb/>
     assisting the Mother Country in offering an 
     <lb/>
      effectual resistance to invasions by the 
     <lb/>
     American people, we ought to have unity of 
     <lb/>
     command, in order that we might be able to 
     <lb/>
     send the militia from the centre and cause 
     <lb/>
     them to extend towards the circumference. 
     <lb/>
     In case of war with our neighbors, we should, 
     <lb/>
     of necessity, be compelled, by the very force 
     <lb/>
     of circumstances, to unite with the other 
     <lb/>
      provinces. That being the case, why not 
     <lb/>
    do so at once, in time of peace, while we 
     <lb/>
         
    
            <cb/>
           
     have time to devote to it that calm and 
     <lb/>
     deliberate consideration which the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of the subject demands. Confederation 
     <lb/>
     is the sole means of offering resistance to 
     <lb/>
     attempts at invasion by our enemies. The 
     <lb/>
     Federal system is the normal condition of 
     <lb/>
     American populations ; for there are very 
     <lb/>
     few American nations which have not a 
     <lb/>
     political system of that nature. The Federal 
     <lb/>
     system is a state of transition which allows 
     <lb/>
     the  different races inhabiting the same part 
     <lb/>
    of the globe to unite, with the view of 
     <lb/>attaining national unity and homogeneous<lb break="no"/>ness. Spain, Belgium, France, and several 
     <lb/>other European countries were formerly 
     <lb/>peopled by different races, who constituted 
     <lb/>so many different communities ; but they 
     <lb/>became united, they entered into confedera<lb break="no"/>tions, and in the course of ages all the 
     <lb/>communities were consolidated into those 
     <lb/>which we now see—into everything that is 
     <lb/>held to be beautiful, noble and great 
     <lb/>throughout the whole world. When the 
     <lb/>Federal system has been put in practice in 
     <lb/>an enlightened manner, it has always sufficed 
     <lb/>for the requirements of those who adapted 
     <lb/>it. The case of Greece has been cited by 
     <lb/>an hon. member of this House, to show the 
     <lb/>fatal nature of this system to the nations 
     <lb/>who adopted it ; but he ought to know that 
     <lb/>the decadence of Greece only began from 
     <lb/>the moment when she abandoned the Federal 
     <lb/>system. The hon. member for Lotbinière 
     <lb/>sought to prove that confederations were the 
     <lb/>source of all sorts of  disturbances ; and in 
     <lb/>support of what he said, he read out to us 
     <lb/>the table of contents of the history of  
     <lb/>America, in which he found a long list of 
     <lb/> <hi rendition="simple:italic">échauffourées</hi>, movements, agitations, risings,  
     <lb/>civil wars and revolutions. It is not my wish  
     <lb/>to deny the facts quoted by the honorable 
     <lb/>member, but I must say that his con<lb break="no"/>clusions are not correct, and that it  
     <lb/>is not right to draw conclusions adverse to a 
     <lb/>system from merely perusing the table of 
     <lb/>contents of any work whatsoever. The his<lb break="no"/>tory of all nations will  afford tables of con<lb break="no"/>tents, which, if they were taken as indicating 
     <lb/>the normal and habitual condition of a  
     <lb/>people, would cause us to make strange mis<lb break="no"/>takes and to draw strange historical conclu<lb break="no"/>sions. Even the present history of England,  
     <lb/>the history of the reign of Her Majesty  
     <lb/>Queen Victoria, might afford to a person, 
     <lb/>who was desirous of forming a judgement  
     <lb/>respecting it from the table of contents  
     <lb/>alone, some facts which might induce him to  
     <lb/>believe in the complete disorganization of 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="549" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0549.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">549</fw>
            
     the British Empire ; for in it he would find 
     <lb/>
     allusion made to the Chinese war, the several 
     <lb/>
     insurrections in India, the insurrectional 
     <lb/>
     movement in Ireland, the Russian war, the 
     <lb/>
     Sepoy rebellion, and a large number of other 
     <lb/>
     matters ; but all this would prove nothing 
     <lb/>
     against the prosperity of the empire under 
     <lb/>
     the rule of Her Majesty. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But, without losing time over the reply 
     <lb/>
     which may be made to this style of reasoning, 
     <lb/>
     I say that it does not follow that the Federal 
     <lb/>
     system is impracticable, because it has not 
     <lb/>
     succeeded among certain peeple who were 
     <lb/>
     not in a suficiently advanced condition for 
     <lb/>
     the application of the system. No constitu<lb break="no"/>tion suits every people equally well; constitu<lb break="no"/>tions are made for the people, and not the 
     <lb/>
     peeple for the constitution. When a people 
     <lb/>
     is sufficiently enlightened and sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     educated and civilized, a constitution ensur<lb break="no"/>ing their liberty may be given them ; but it 
     <lb/>
     is necessary to wait until they are able to 
     <lb/>
     appreciate and enjoy it, before giving it to 
     <lb/>
     them. A free constitution entrusted to an 
     <lb/>
     unenlightened peeple is like an edged tool 
     <lb/>
     placed in the hands of a child ; it is a dan<lb break="no"/>gerous instrument, with which it may chance 
     <lb/>
     to wound itself. Besides, certain forms of 
     <lb/>
     government are better suited to certain 
     <lb/>
     people than others. Thus, to endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     give the English Constitution to the French 
     <lb/>
     people would be to commit a great mistake, 
     <lb/>
     for the French people are not adapted to the 
     <lb/>
     working of the political institutions of Eng<lb break="no"/>land. Again, try to give the English people 
     <lb/>
     the French Constitution, and the English 
     <lb/>
     people will revolt. Before giving a consti<lb break="no"/>tution to a people, that people must be taught 
     <lb/>
     how to use it. It cannot be said that a table 
     <lb/>
     of contents is not history, but certainly one 
     <lb/>
     would not seek in that part of the volume for 
     <lb/>
     the philosophy of history. Let us suppose 
     <lb/>
     that some one is desirous of reading the 
     <lb/>
     history of the Celestial Kingdom, and that 
     <lb/>
     on taking up the book he finds, in the table 
     <lb/>
     of contents, that at a certain period there 
     <lb/>
     was a terrible battle between the good and 
     <lb/>
     the wicked angels; if he shared the ideas of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Lotbinière, he would 
     <lb/>
     say to himself: " This country cannot have a 
     <lb/>
     good government, and it is not advisable to 
     <lb/>
     live in it." When aperson draws historical 
     <lb/>
     conclusions from a table of contents, it shews 
     <lb/>
     that he has not derived much benefit from 
     <lb/>
     his states. Those who are now opposing 
     <lb/>
     Confederation are not agreed as to their 
     <lb/>
     mode of attack, any more than they are upon 
     <lb/>
     the means to be adopted to meet the dificul<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
            
     ties of the position in which we are now 
     <lb/>
     placed. The hon. member for Hochelaga 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. DORION) is in favor of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the two Canadas, and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Lotbinière (Mr. JOLY) is against 
     <lb/>
     any Confederation at all. They do not even 
     <lb/>
     agree as to their reasons for opposition. 
     <lb/>
     Some are opposed to Confederation because 
     <lb/>
     it grants too much to Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     others because it grants too much to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Yet Confederation cannot be dis<lb break="no"/>advantageous to everybody, and, for my part, 
     <lb/>
     I am of opinion that everyone may find some<lb break="no"/>thing good in it, it he is only reasonable in 
     <lb/>
     his expectations. If the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga were called upon to arrange the 
     <lb/>
     diflicultics in which the country is at present 
     <lb/>
     situated, I am satisfied that he would not 
     <lb/>
     bring forward any other plan than some 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation or other; and if he 
     <lb/>
     did not succeed with the scheme for the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the Canadas, he would try 
     <lb/>
     the more extended plan of a great Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of all the provinces. There is indeed, 
     <lb/>
     it is true, another remedy which would be 
     <lb/>
     more likely to meet the views of certain 
     <lb/>
     members—annexation to the United States ; 
     <lb/>
     but I, for my part, am resolutely opposed to 
     <lb/>
     it, and am prepared to fight against it by 
     <lb/>
     every possible means, and to take up arms, 
     <lb/>
     if necessary, to resist it. If we are ever 
     <lb/>
     invaded by the United States. I shall ever 
     <lb/>
     be ready to take up arms to drive the 
     <lb/>
     invaders out of the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     A great outcry which is raised against Con<lb break="no"/>federation is that about direct taxation. 
     <lb/>
     For my part, I consider that the honorable 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance (Hon. Mr. GALT) has 
     <lb/>
     proved clearly that we shall not require to 
     <lb/>
     have recourse to it. But even supposing 
     <lb/>
     that such should turn out to be the case, we 
     <lb/>
     should not be any worse off than we should 
     <lb/>
     be with the gentlemen on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House in power ; for it is perfectly well 
     <lb/>
     known that the hon. member for Chateau<lb break="no"/>guay's plan is to establish direct taxation. 
     <lb/>
     With them, therefore, we should not have 
     <lb/>
     to wait for Confederation before we got it. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable members on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House have also taken occasion to find 
     <lb/>
     fault with the Speech from the Throne having 
     <lb/>
     contained an allusion to the peace and gene<lb break="no"/>ral prosperity of the country. " Why," they 
     <lb/>
     say, "the Speech from the Throne states 
     <lb/>
     that trade is prospering, that the peeple are 
     <lb/>
     happy and contented, that the harvests have 
     <lb/>
     been magnificent, and that great contentment 
     <lb/>
     and great prosperity everywhere prevail ; 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="550" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0550.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">550</fw>
           
     and yet constitutional changes are proposed 
     <lb/>
     in order to soothe the discontent of the 
     <lb/>
     people and the agitation of the country." 
     <lb/>
     Well ! let us suppose that the gentlemen are 
     <lb/>
     right—for it is true that the year has not 
     <lb/>
     been a good one in respect of business, and 
     <lb/>
     it is natural that such should be the case, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the position of the crisis through 
     <lb/>
     which America is now passing, and but little 
     <lb/>
     else can be expected ; the harvest has not been 
     <lb/>
     a very good one,—however, allowing that 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen are right, it is not the less 
     <lb/>
     true that we are relatively in a state of quiet<lb break="no"/>ude and great  prosperity, and it is just at 
     <lb/>
     the present time, when we are in a state of 
     <lb/>
     tranquillity and can do it in perfect liberty, 
     <lb/>
     that we should adopt means to settle our 
     <lb/>
     internal dificulties. It is not during a time 
     <lb/>
     of trouble or a civil war that we can do it, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore we ought to profit by the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity which is now  offered us. A Con<lb break="no"/>stitution will not last unless it is elaborated 
     <lb/>
     with the care, the deliberation and the calm 
     <lb/>
     consideration which can be devoted to it 
     <lb/>
     only in time of peace. We are now at peace 
     <lb/>
     with our neighbors, our friends are in a large 
     <lb/>
     majority, the question is known to the 
     <lb/>
     country and has been considered for several 
     <lb/>
     months past, and our duty is to do now in 
     <lb/>
     time of peace, what it is impossible to do in 
     <lb/>
     time of trouble. We ought also to labor to 
     <lb/>
     enlighten public opinion on the subject of 
     <lb/>
     this plan of Confederation, not by appeals to 
     <lb/>
     its prejudices, but by free and open discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and by wise counsel based on that truth 
     <lb/>
     which should always be our guiding star. 
     <lb/>
     I am, therefore, disposed to vote in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions which are submitted to us. 
     <lb/>
     When I became aware that the Government 
     <lb/>
     were bringing forward this scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, I said to myself that we were 
     <lb/>
     about to be liberated from colonial leading- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     strings, and that we were about to become a 
     <lb/>
     people, and I expected the House would 
     <lb/>
     approach the question with due regard to 
     <lb/>
     its greatness ; some hon. members have un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly done so, but I regret that many 
     <lb/>
     others have not been able to raise themselves 
     <lb/>
     above the narrow considerations of party. 
     <lb/>
     The question has been discussed by states<lb break="no"/>men on this side of the House at least ; but 
     <lb/>
     on the other side it has been made a miser<lb break="no"/>able question of party and of taxation. 
     <lb/>
     With these few remarks, I shall conclude by 
     <lb/>
     stating that it is my determination to vote 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the scheme submitted to us.— 
     <lb/>
     (Applause.)

            <p>
          <persName ref="pers:BEAU1">Mr. BEAUBIEN</persName>—Mr.  Speaker, I do 
     <lb/>
     not rise to make a long speech, for I freely 
     <lb/>
     acknowledge that it is not in my power to 
     <lb/>
     do so ; and besides, the question which is 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us has been so well discussed 
     <lb/>
     by those who have preceded me, and who 
     <lb/>
     are in a better position than myself to judge 
     <lb/>
     of the condition and requirements of the 
     <lb/>
     country, that the subject is almost exhausted. 
     <lb/>
     I only wish, by rising on this occasion, to 
     <lb/>
     record my presence at the debates which are 
     <lb/>
     in progress on this question, and to state in 
     <lb/>
     a few words what the reasons are which in<lb break="no"/>duce me to support this measure. The 
     <lb/>
     peculiar position of the British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rican colonies and their proximity to the 
     <lb/>
     United States, call upon them to unite 
     <lb/>
     together in  order to form a stronger nation, 
     <lb/>
     and one more able to withstand the onslaught 
     <lb/>
     of an enemy, should it be necessary so to do, 
     <lb/>
     and to increase their prosperity in a mater<lb break="no"/>ial point of view. There is one fact which 
     <lb/>
     must not be forgotten, and which I must 
     <lb/>
     mention—it is that when France abandoned 
     <lb/>
     this country, and England took possession 
     <lb/>
     of it, from that moment French immigration 
     <lb/>
     entirely ceased and gave way to immigration 
     <lb/>
     of persons of foreign origin—of British 
     <lb/>
     origin. From that period the English popu<lb break="no"/>lation increased from day to day in this 
     <lb/>
     country, and at the present time the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians are in a minority in United 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Under these circumstances, I am 
     <lb/>
     of opinion that it would be at once an act of 
     <lb/>
     imprudence and one characterised by a lack 
     <lb/>
     of generosity on our parts to wish to prevent 
     <lb/>
     the  majority of the population of the country 
     <lb/>
     from displaying greater aspirations for our 
     <lb/>
     common country, and from desiring its ad<lb break="no"/>vancement and more rapid progress in an 
     <lb/>
     onward direction, at the same time drawing 
     <lb/>
     closer the bonds which unite us to the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country. I have reflected on these 
     <lb/>
     matters, and although I am not disposed to 
     <lb/>
     submit to injustice to my country or my 
     <lb/>
     countrymen, yet I am ready to enter into a 
     <lb/>
     compromise with persons of other origins. 
     <lb/>
     I consider, moreover, that since we are 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with our position as English sub<lb break="no"/>jects, and with the Constitution which we 
     <lb/>
     are allowed freely to exercise, we should 
     <lb/>
     do all in our power to increase England's 
     <lb/>
     interest in her colonies ; and for my part, I 
     <lb/>
     consider that the means of so doing is to 
     <lb/>
     accept the Confederation which is proposed 
     <lb/>
     to us. Not long since discontent was mani<lb break="no"/>fested in England among a part of the com<lb break="no"/>
          
            <pb n="551" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0551.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">551</fw>
     mercial class, in consequence of the liberty 
     <lb/>
     which we took of imposing high duties on 
     <lb/>
     English merchandize imported into this 
     <lb/>
     country ; but the English Government did 
     <lb/>
     not share that discontent, I am happy to 
     <lb/>
     say, and did not choose to interfere. This 
     <lb/>
     fact, however, was of a nature to cast a chill 
     <lb/>
     upon the interest with which we were re<lb break="no"/>garded in England ; but when the news of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation reached England, that interest 
     <lb/>
     was revived, and has ever since continued 
     <lb/>
     to increase. If we desire to interest 
     <lb/>
     England in our fate, we must draw 
     <lb/>
     closer the bonds that unite us to her, 
     <lb/>
     and we must do it by means of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation now proposed to us, because 
     <lb/>
     that measure once carried out, she will 
     <lb/>
     undoubtedly put forth her whole strength 
     <lb/>
     for our defence if we should be attacked. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, in view of the events which have 
     <lb/>
     recently occurred in the southern portion of 
     <lb/>
     this continent, if we reflect that it seems to 
     <lb/>
     be the policy of France and of England 
     <lb/>
     to establish a balance of power similar to 
     <lb/>
     what exists in Europe, if we consider that it 
     <lb/>
     is for this end that France has established 
     <lb/>
     an empire in Mexico, it is clear that England 
     <lb/>
     cannot but view with a favorable eye the 
     <lb/>
     movement now in progress here for the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. It is not at such a time as this, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that England would be disposed 
     <lb/>
     to abandon her colonies, as it has been pre<lb break="no"/>tended by some. I stated, a moment ago, 
     <lb/>
     that we should not resist the just demands 
     <lb/>
     of the British population of this country, 
     <lb/>
     provided they do not ask anything involving 
     <lb/>
     injustice towards French-Canadians. If we 
     <lb/>
     were guilty of injustice towards them, they 
     <lb/>
     would complain, and propose a plan of con<lb break="no"/>stitution humiliating to the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, and they would no longer entertain 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of esteem and consideration for 
     <lb/>
     us. I do not refer to this matter for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of discouraging my own fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen, but because I believe it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary that they should take this view of 
     <lb/>
     the matter into account in the position in 
     <lb/>
     which we now  find ourselves placed. To-day 
     <lb/>
     our position is an excellent  one ; we are 
     <lb/>
     strong as a party, we have statesmen at the 
     <lb/>
     head of the  affairs of our country who are 
     <lb/>
     devoted to its interest—they have proved it 
     <lb/>
      again and again—and united together by 
     <lb/>
     the ties of interest and friendship ; and 
     <lb/>
     above all, we have ever had confidence in 
     <lb/>
     those who prepared the project of a Constitu<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     tion now submitted for our consideration ; 
     <lb/>
     it is evident, then, that a more favorable 
     <lb/>
     opportunity could not possibly be found for 
     <lb/>
     eflecting constitutional changes than the 
     <lb/>
     present circumstances  afford. These men, 
     <lb/>
     who are surely possessed of as much diplo<lb break="no"/>matic skill as the representatives of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces can exhibit, will undoubtedly look 
     <lb/>
     after the interests of Lower Canada ; and 
     <lb/>
     their opinion, based upon justice, will prevail 
     <lb/>
     with those to whom the preparation of our 
     <lb/>
     new Constitution is to be entrusted. More<lb break="no"/>over, what I  have just stated is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     understood by every  influential class in the 
     <lb/>
     country, by all men who help to form public 
     <lb/>
     oinion, who are the guides of the people, 
     <lb/>
     and who have hitherto managed to lead them 
     <lb/>
     aright, and to bring them into a safe harbor 
     <lb/>
     at the last.  To-day these men and these 
     <lb/>
     influences are in favor of the present plan, and 
     <lb/>
     all are convinced of its necessity. But, on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand, what are the influences opposed 
     <lb/>
     to Confederation in Lower Canada ? They 
     <lb/>
     are confined to a party which has existed for 
     <lb/>
     the past fifteen years in Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     which has always been remarkable for its 
     <lb/>
     opposition to all measures demanded and 
     <lb/>
     supported by the party representing in this 
     <lb/>
     House the vast majority of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. This persistent opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the measures of the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     party savoured of revolution—for your revo<lb break="no"/>lutionist is by nature incapable of sub<lb break="no"/>mitting to the majority ; it is the same party 
     <lb/>
     which in other countries forms secret so<lb break="no"/>cieties, by means of which society is thrown 
     <lb/>
     into disorder—and it is admitted that every<lb break="no"/>where, in Europe as well as in America, 
     <lb/>
     these secret societies are composed of men 
     <lb/>
     who are invariably opposed to everything 
     <lb/>
     calculated to secure the peace and happiness 
     <lb/>
     of the people. Is it not true that in 1856 
     <lb/>
     or 1857 a place in the Administration was 
     <lb/>
      offered to one of the leaders of that party 
     <lb/>
     by the present Attorney General, and that 
     <lb/>
     an opening was repeatedly made for them, 
     <lb/>
     because it was thought that they were acting 
     <lb/>
     in good faith ? Now, did they not invariably 
     <lb/>
     refuse the alliance offered them ? And did 
     <lb/>
     they not even refuse to give a cordial sup<lb break="no"/>port to the  Macdonald-Sicotte <choice><sic>Adminis<lb break="no"/>stration</sic><corr>Administration</corr></choice>, which was composed of Liberal- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Conservatives ? And the reason was, that 
     <lb/>
     that Administration was not exclusively 
     <lb/>
     composed of the democratic element.

     <persName ref="pers:BEAU1">MR. BEAUBIEN</persName>—It is true that the 
     <lb/>
     actual vote by which that government was 
     <lb/>
     upset was given by us, because there was in 
     <lb/>
     that Government an excess of the element I 
     <lb/>
     have just referred to, and for other reasons; 
     <lb/>
     but it was that party that betrayed and 
     <lb/>
     spurned those who had enabled them to 
     <lb/>
     carry their elections. (Hear, hear.) Is 
     <lb/>
     that not the truth? Then, that persistent 
     <lb/>
     and constant opposition to everything, shows 
     <lb/>
     that the members of that party were inspired 
     <lb/>
     by passions, not to be found in the generality 
     <lb/>
     of men. The Conservative party has always 
     <lb/>
     opposed representation by population under 
     <lb/>
     the present union, because under this union 
     <lb/>
     we are face to face with the population of a 
     <lb/>
     country of which the products are different 
     <lb/>
     from ours, and of which the interests are 
     <lb/>
     not always identical with ours. This question 
     <lb/>
     was strongly agitated. The whole people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada resisted that demand, and 
     <lb/>
     the whole Conservative party firmly refused 
     <lb/>
     to consent to it, while the other party—the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition party—held out hopes to those 
     <lb/>
     who demanded that measure, and allied 
     <lb/>
     themselves with them. This is a statement, 
     <lb/>
     the truth of which cannot be denied, for 
     <lb/>
     documents proving the facts exist, and have 
     <lb/>
     been laid before this House and the country. 
     <lb/>
     This cause of dissension has always existed, 
     <lb/>
     and will always exist in Upper Canada, not 
     <lb/>
     because it is necessary to the support of 
     <lb/>
     such or such a party, but because it is the 
     <lb/>
     result of a provision of the Constitution, and 
     <lb/>
     because the interests of Upper Canada are 
     <lb/>
     not the same as ours. And if we do not 
     <lb/>
     effect a settlement of this question now, 
     <lb/>
     these dissensions will, ere long, be renewed 
     <lb/>
     and the difficulties increased. Here is an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of removing these difficulties by 
     <lb/>
     uniting ourselves with the Lower Provinces; 
     <lb/>
     and I think Lower Canada would do well 
     <lb/>
     not to lose the opportunity. Under Con<lb break="no"/>federation, the political parties into which 
     <lb/>
     the provinces will be divided will find it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to form alliances, and our alliance 
     <lb/>
     will be courted by all, so that we shall in 
     <lb/>
     reality hold the balance of power. More<lb break="no"/>over, I am quite convinced that we have no 
     <lb/>
     grounds for fear in that respect. I have 
     <lb/>
     always remarked that material interests are 
     <lb/>
     of great weight in the formation of parties, 
     <lb/>
     and the conduct of the French-Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     with reference to their religious institutions, 
     <lb/>
     never inspired any uneasiness or distrust in 
     <lb/>
     our fellow-countrymen of a different origin 
     <lb/>
     from ours, when they found it their interest 
     <lb/>
     to form an alliance with us; and I am 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     certain that we shall find, under like circum<lb break="no"/>stances, the same disposition among the 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of the Lower Provinces The 
     <lb/>
     plan proposed to us being based upon the 
     <lb/>
     principle of justice and equity to all, it is 
     <lb/>
     deserving of the support of all parties. It 
     <lb/>
     presents a remedy for the evils of which 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada complains, at the same time 
     <lb/>
     that it affords guarantees for the protection 
     <lb/>
     of the interests of the other provinces; and 
     <lb/>
     inasmuch as it is founded on just bases, it 
     <lb/>
     will be found—more especially among a 
     <lb/>
     people such as that of this country, who are 
     <lb/>
     peaceable and well-disposed, who are, for the 
     <lb/>
     most part, owners of land, and have many 
     <lb/>
     interests to protect—it will be found, I say, that 
     <lb/>
     a sentiment of justice will prevail, and that 
     <lb/>
     every one will do his best to promote the 
     <lb/>
     working of the new Constitution in such a 
     <lb/>
     manner as to give full satisfaction to all the 
     <lb/>
     parties interested. Notwithstanding what 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Lotbinière has said in 
     <lb/>
     the course of a speech, with which he him<lb break="no"/>self seemed to be so intensely amused, the 
     <lb/>
     sound sense and judgment of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada will satisfy them that they 
     <lb/>
     will find in the project which has been sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us, guarantees for all their interests 
     <lb/>
     and for everything they hold dear, and that 
     <lb/>
     the measure will meet all their wants; and 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, the sound sense and judg<lb break="no"/>ment of the people of the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     will prevent them from committing any 
     <lb/>
     excess or any act of injustice towards Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, if the latter should happen to be in 
     <lb/>
     a minority, or if the alliance I have referred 
     <lb/>
     to should not be made. And, moreover, as 
     <lb/>
     regards our being in a minority, are we not 
     <lb/>
     exposed to it under the present system? And 
     <lb/>
     I prefer facing the larger majority, since it 
     <lb/>
     will be less hostile to Lower Canada As 
     <lb/>
     matters now stand, we should find ourselves 
     <lb/>
     at the mercy of the Upper Canada majority, 
     <lb/>
     if they wished to commit any injustice 
     <lb/>
     towards us; but, under the Confederation, I 
     <lb/>
     believe we shall have better guarantees than 
     <lb/>
     we now possess against any attempt at injus<lb break="no"/>tice on the part of the Federal Government, 
     <lb/>
     for the policy of England is to aflord her 
     <lb/>
     colonies every possible reason for content<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon. member for Richelieu has 
     <lb/>
     spoken of the events which occurred prior to 
     <lb/>
     1837, to convince us that we have every 
     <lb/>
     reason to distrust the sentiments of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish population. Why refer to matters so 
     <lb/>
     long forgotten? The hon. member ought to 
     <lb/>
     know that the policy which circumstances 
     <lb/>
     have induced England to adopt, is no longer 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="553" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0553.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">553</fw>
           
     the policy which then prevailed. Does any 
     <lb/>
     one believe that England would now encour<lb break="no"/>age any section of the British population in 
     <lb/>
     doing an injustice to the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada? It will be said that the 
     <lb/>
     national life of Lower Canada is so deeply 
     <lb/>
     rooted, that it is impossible to destroy it; 
     <lb/>
     but, if we desire to secure its safety, we must 
     <lb/>
     accept the present scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     under which all the religious interests of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, her educational institutions, 
     <lb/>
     her public lands, in fact everything that con<lb break="no"/>stitutes a people's nationality, will find protec<lb break="no"/>tion and safety. With the control of 
     <lb/>
     our public lands in our own hands, we 
     <lb/>
     can attract the tide of emigration, retain 
     <lb/>
     our own people in the country, and advance 
     <lb/>
     in prosperity as rapidly as the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. And all this is secured to us under 
     <lb/>
     the plan of Confederation. Every impartial 
     <lb/>
     man will admit that great care has been 
     <lb/>
     taken, in the drawing up of this project of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, to protect all our interests. 
     <lb/>
     It may be true that it is not quite free from 
     <lb/>
     defect, but every one must acknowledge 
     <lb/>
     that it is the most perfect system that could 
     <lb/>
     possibly be obtained, and the system best 
     <lb/>
     calculated to aford us security. All the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen who have spoken on the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition side say that the expenses will 
     <lb/>
     Be extraordinary, and that the revenue will 
     <lb/>
     not be suficient to support the governments 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederation. But they base their 
     <lb/>
     calculations upon the revenue as it now 
     <lb/>
     stands, and they do not reflect that the pre<lb break="no"/>sent debt of the province has been contracted 
     <lb/>
     in carrying out the vast public works we 
     <lb/>
     now possess, and that these public works 
     <lb/>
     have not as yet produced a revenue, but will 
     <lb/>
     hereafter do so. These public works were 
     <lb/>
     essentially necessary for the development of 
     <lb/>
     our resources; and if at this moment the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance is able to present a 
     <lb/>
     budget shewing a surplus of revenue over 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, we are justified in hoping that 
     <lb/>
     within a few years our revenue will be 
     <lb/>
     more than sufficient to enable us to meet 
     <lb/>
     all the expenses of the different governments, 
     <lb/>
     and to extinguish our present debt. For 
     <lb/>
     my own part, I do not think that our 
     <lb/>
     expenses will be greater under Confederation 
     <lb/>
     than they are at present. If the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government works well, our expenses will 
     <lb/>
     be less than they are at present, for we shall 
     <lb/>
     end of factious sectional jealousies, and 
     <lb/>
     the system of equivalents, which have done 
     <lb/>
     so much injury to the country, and which 
     <lb/>have so greatly impeded the working of the<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     Government in times past. It is ridiculous 
     <lb/>
     to fancy that the Government of Canada can 
     <lb/>
     continue to work and maintain itself with a 
     <lb/>
     majority of one or two votes in this House, 
     <lb/>
     as we have witnessed for some years past; 
     <lb/>
     for a government so placed is at the mercy 
     <lb/>
     of every member who has a local interest to 
     <lb/>
     serve, or a particular favor to obtain; and 
     <lb/>
     it is thus forced to grant favors which it 
     <lb/>
     would refuse if it were stronger. This 
     <lb/>
     was the cause of all the useless expenditure; 
     <lb/>
     and almost every one of our governments 
     <lb/>
     has been in that position. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But under Confederation we may hope that 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government will generally have 
     <lb/>
     the support of a large majority, and will con<lb break="no"/>sequently not be compelled to yield to the 
     <lb/>
     demands of a small number of members. 
     <lb/>
     The resources at the disposal of the local 
     <lb/>
     governments being limited, they will practise 
     <lb/>
     a degree of economy which will serve as an 
     <lb/>
     example to the Fe eral Government itself. 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, when left to herself, will be<lb break="no"/>come highly prosperous in a few years—and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps Upper Canada also—provided her 
     <lb/>
     expenses be kept within bounds; and I am 
     <lb/>
     convinced that her Local Government will be 
     <lb/>
     a model for the Federal Government; for men 
     <lb/>
     formed in the school of the Local Government, 
     <lb/>
     and who will be habituated to the practice of 
     <lb/>
     economy, will exert a salutary influence on 
     <lb/>
     the members of the Federal Legislature, to 
     <lb/>
     whom they will impart, and on whom they 
     <lb/>
     will impress, their ideas of economy and good 
     <lb/>
     government. (Hear, hear.) It is well that 
     <lb/>
    . the means at the disposal of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments should be limited, but at the same 
     <lb/>time amply sufficient, for they must then feel 
     <lb/>that they cannot enter into too large expen<lb break="no"/>diture, and they will adopt a perfect system 
     <lb/>of economy. (Hear, hear.) Before conclud<lb break="no"/>ing I must pay a tribute of justice to the 
     <lb/>British population of Lower Canada. We 
     <lb/>have always gone along hand in hand like 
     <lb/>good friends, acknowledging each other's 
     <lb/>rights, and each party invariably making it a 
     <lb/>rule to accede to the just claims of the other. 
     <lb/>This will be our safety also under the Federal 
     <lb/>Government. For my part I should be sorry 
     <lb/>to see the present plan of Confederation fail, 
     <lb/>at all events through any action of ours, for 
     <lb/>that would justly dissatisfy the British popu<lb break="no"/>lation of this country, who desire to see it 
     <lb/>carried out, and to whom we should not re<lb break="no"/>fuse it. We know that the British have al<lb break="no"/>ways done everything in their power to pro<lb break="no"/>mote the material prosperity of the country, 
     <lb/>and it is our duty to respect them and to ac<lb break="no"/>cede to their just demands. With these few

            <fw type="num">554</fw>
          
     remarks, Mr. SPEAKER, I shall conclude 
     <lb/>
     by stating that I am in favor of the present 
     <lb/>
     plan of Confederation, not because I trust 
     <lb/>
     solely to the evidence of my own judgment, 
     <lb/>
     but because I see at the head of the movement 
     <lb/>
     the most enlightened men in the country, and 
     <lb/>
     because all the men of influence, all the men 
     <lb/>
     of property in the country, are in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     project. (Hear, hear.) And I am convinced, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding all that may have been said, 
     <lb/>
     that the country is sufficiently familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     project, and that the people now know all they 
     <lb/>
     will ever know about it. In every parish 
     <lb/>
     there are men who are the leaders of public 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and we know that these men are in 
     <lb/>
     favor of this plan. We have all these influ<lb break="no"/>ences with us, and for my part I attach but 
     <lb/>
     little importance to the opinion expressed at 
     <lb/>
     certain public meetings held to oppose Con<lb break="no"/>federation, or to the petitions presented 
     <lb/>
     against the project, for it is always easy to 
     <lb/>
     obtain signatures to petitions. And, more<lb break="no"/>over, let any one compare the signatures to 
     <lb/>
     these petitions with the poll-books kept at 
     <lb/>
     elections, and it will be found that they are 
     <lb/>
     the names of those who have always been op<lb break="no"/>posed to everything proposed by the great 
     <lb/>
     national party, which has ever represented the 
     <lb/>
     interests of Lower Canada. (Applause.) 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName> (of Montcalm)—Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, I do not rise to speak on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion now before the House, but simply to 
     <lb/>express my surprise that after six weeks of 
     <lb/>discussion the Opposition pretend that we re<lb break="no"/>fuse them time to discuss the measure, and 
     <lb/>that nevertheless they refuse to discuss it 
     <lb/>during the afternoon sittings, and will only 
     <lb/>take it up in the evening. For my part, I am 
     <lb/>prepared to vote at once upon this matter, 
     <lb/>and I believe that the question is perfectly 
     <lb/>mastered and well understood by every mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this House. Why are the Opposition 
     <lb/>unwilling to speak during the afternoon sit<lb break="no"/>tings? Their object in speaking is to kill 
     <lb/>time, rather than to discuss the merits of 
     <lb/>the question. And why is this? Is it 
     <lb/>because they are waiting for a few more peti<lb break="no"/>tions, a few more names, in order to protest 
     <lb/>against Confederation ? But we know the 
     <lb/>value of these petitions-we know what the 
     <lb/>Rouges are, and that they will sign any and 
     <lb/>every petition, provided it be against the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and its policy. The Opposition is 
     <lb/>like a sulky child ; if you refuse him a play<lb break="no"/>thing he cries for it, and then if you offer it 
     <lb/>to him he refuses to take it. The Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation is in reality the plan of those gentlemen 
     <lb/>themselves, and yet to-day they will not hear 
     <lb/>
           <cb/>
               
     of it; they reject it as something horrible. 
     <lb/>
     The country is watching them, and I hold the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition responsible for the loss of time we 
     <lb/>
     are now undergoing. If they have any 
     <lb/>
     reasons to advance, let them do so, but let us 
     <lb/>
     come to a vote. Their conduct will receive 
     <lb/>
     its due reward at the hands of the people. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName> said—Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, when so many eloquent voices have spoken

     <lb/>
     seriously, which stands preëminent over all 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     limits all British North America, which in<lb break="no"/>cludes within its immense scope two oceans 
     <lb/>
     and nearly half a continent, and which is 
     <lb/>
     pregnant with the destinies of a great people 
     <lb/>
     and a great country—when the whole of the 
     <lb/>
     motives which can be advanced for and against 
     <lb/>
     the project have been so luminously discussed, 
     <lb/>
     when I myself have, elsewhere, at such con<lb break="no"/>siderable length and so completely developed, 
     <lb/>
     with the feeble abilities which Providence has 
     <lb/>
     conferred upon me, the considerations which 
     <lb/>
     militate for or against the entirety and the 
     <lb/>
     details of the work of the Quebec Conference, 
     <lb/>
     I might—perhaps I should—have remained a 
     <lb/>
     simple spectator of these solemn debates, while 
     <lb/>
     awaiting the hour at which I should be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to record my vote in accordance with

     my convictions. considered, however, that 
     <lb/>
     as one of the oldest representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     people, after having spoken elsewhere, I 
     <lb/>
     should speak again within the parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     precinct, in order to accomplish to the letter 
     <lb/>
     my trust, and in order to obey that voice 
     <lb/>
     which has a right to command me. I have 
     <lb/>
     therefore come this evening in order to bring 
     <lb/>
     my feeble tribute of ideas to the decisive 
     <lb/>
     ordeal which is being accomplished. For my 
     <lb/>
     part I should have wished for the bringing 
     <lb/>
     forward of fewer personal questions, fewer 
     <lb/>
     criminations and reeriminations, fewer allu<lb break="no"/>sions to the past; in a word, I should have 
     <lb/>
     wished to see the debate rising at its very 
     <lb/>
     outset to the dignity of the question itself, 
     <lb/>
     so as to place as in a position to judge of 
     <lb/>
     it on its own merits, without considering 
     <lb/>
     the names or the antecedents of those who 
     <lb/>
     may defend or may oppose it; I should 
     <lb/>
     have wished to see the conscience of our pub<lb break="no"/>lic men in harmony with the public con— 
     <lb/>
     science,- and that under such grave circum<lb break="no"/>stances, men had forgotten that they were 
     <lb/>
     party men, in order to remember only their

     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) I seem to de<lb break="no"/>fend here my past opinions on Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     I wrote from conviction in 1858, just as I 
     <lb/>
     have written from conviction in 1865. My 
     <lb/>
     two works are there—provoking discussion, 
     <lb/>
     and throwing down the gauntlet to those who 
     <lb/>
     may desire to take it up. It will soon be a 
     <lb/>
     third of a century since I commenced to 
     <lb/>
     write, and if I had no other recommendation 
     <lb/>
     to public attention than that of being the 
     <lb/>
      oldest journalist in the country, it appears 
     <lb/>
     to me that people ought, if they could, not 
     <lb/>
     to have  allowed me to pass without asking 
     <lb/>
     me the reason of my present doctrines. How 
     <lb/>
     is it, then, that from the midst of the de<lb break="no"/>mocratic and opposition press not a single 
     <lb/>
    voice has been heard against the long commen<lb break="no"/>tary of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journal</hi> on the scheme of the 
     <lb/>
      Quebec Conference ? (Hear, hear.) Is it in<lb break="no"/>ability ? Is it that talent is wanting among 
     <lb/>
      this phalanx which believes itself to have 
     <lb/>
    been specially ushered into existence in order 
     <lb/> to enlighten and govern the country ? Even 
     <lb/>if I had not written under a strong sense of 
     <lb/>duty, I should feel sufficiently strengthened 
     <lb/>by the high and disinterested approbation 
     <lb/>which greeted my humble work, to bear un<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     disturbed the scratches and pin pricks of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Lotbinère,  and, all un<lb break="no"/>worthy though it may be, I should not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate to place it in the balance against, I will 
     <lb/>
     not say the episode, but the speech by which 
     <lb/>
     he seems to hope to arrive at the position of a 
     <lb/>
     statesman, to which he aspires. It is to be 
     <lb/>
     regretted also that the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga kept himself almost constantly, 
     <lb/>
     during three hours and a half, in the lowest 
     <lb/>
     level of personal recriminations. Was he 
     <lb/>
     unable to raise himself to a more dignified 
     <lb/>
     ground, or is it the natural level of his talents 
     <lb/>
     and his habits ? It seems to me that the 
     <lb/>
     occasion required more serious debate, larger 
     <lb/>
     views, wiser appreciation drawn from more 
     <lb/>
     profound thoughts, a truer idea of the situa<lb break="no"/>tion, greater truth in the statement of facts, 
     <lb/>
     greater exactness, more sequence, and more 
     <lb/>
     logic in the reasoning. But, instead of this, 
     <lb/>
     we have had a jumble of ideas and assertions, 
     <lb/>
     dates which give each other the lie, and a his<lb break="no"/>tory sadly made and sadly told. The honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman challenged me, and I must 
     <lb/>
     accept this challenge before entering upon the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the question which is now 
     <lb/>
     before us. The honorable gentleman (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. DORION) said the other evening :—

         This speech has been tortured and twisted in 
     <lb/>
     every possible sense. I have seen it quoted in

     <lb break="yes"/>
     DORION Government was formed, and it was 
     <lb/>
     agreed between the members that the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional question should be met and settled, either 
     <lb/>
     by means of a Confederation of  Upper and Lower

     local institutions of each section of the country

     being my views ; but I can show clearly that the

     proposition which it contains is exactly the same 
     <lb/>
     as that which was made in 1858, that is to say, 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the two provinces, with some 
     <lb/>
     joint authority for the management of affairs 
     <lb/>
     common to both. My speeches have been lately

     I now hold. A French journal has said "that I

     <lb/>
     and as I stated in 1861, that I have always been 
     <lb/>
     and am still opposed to Confederation. I find

     by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror of Parliament</hi>, which contains a

     report of my speech, although an exceedingly bad

     come when it will be necessary to have a Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the provinces; * * * but the

     time has not yet come for such a scheme." This 
     <lb/>
     was the speech which was misrepresented as

     meaning that I was calling loudly for Confeder<lb break="no"/>tion, and that nothing would give me greater

     pleasure. And yet I explicitly stated on that

     occasion that although a time might come when 
     <lb/>
     Confederation would become necessary, it was

     not desirable under actual circumstances.

     things with which he has been charged—re<lb break="no"/>presentation on the basis of population, with 
     <lb/>
     checks, guarantees and assurances, and the

     Confederation of Upper and Lower Canada.

         Mr. Dorion argued that when Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     had the preponderance of population, complaints 
     <lb/>
     were of the inequality of the representation of 
     <lb/>
     that section. The union of Belgium and Hol<lb break="no"/>land, which was somewhat similar to that at 
     <lb/>
     present existing between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada was dissolved when it was found it did 
     <lb/>
     not work advantageously to both countries. He 
     <lb/>
     instanced a number of questions on which it was 
     <lb/>
     impossible for Upper and Lower Canada to agree ; 
     <lb/>
     public feeling being quite dissimilar—subjects pop<lb break="no"/>ular in one section being the reverse in the other. 
     <lb/>
     He warned Lower Canada members, that when 
     <lb/>
     the time came that the whole of the representa<lb break="no"/>tives from the western portion of the province 
     <lb/>
     would be banded together on the question, they 
     <lb/>
     would obtain representation by population, and 
     <lb/>
     secure the assistance of the Eastern Township 
     <lb/>
     members in so doing. He regarded a Federal 
     <lb/>
     union of Upper and Lower Canada as a nucleus 
     <lb/>
     of the great confederation of the North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces to which all looked forward. He con<lb break="no"/>cluded by saying he would vote for the resolution, 
     <lb/>
     as the only mode by which the two sections of 
     <lb/>
     the province could get  out of the difficulties in 
     <lb/>
     which they now are. He thought the union ought 
     <lb/>
     to be dissolved, and a Federal union of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces would in due time follow.

     is " to which all looked forward." Thus, 
     <lb/>
     instead of rendering the desire for a Confed<lb break="no"/>eration of the provinces, as his own he made 
     <lb/>
     it general. Instead of speaking for himself, 
     <lb/>
     he spoke for all, and as the whole comprises 
     <lb/>
     the part, in expressing the general thought he

     had most naturally expressed his own thought. 
     <lb/>
      (Hear, hear.) I take this opportunity of

     And the other day, in this House he stated :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         Necessarily, I do not mean to say that I shall 
     <lb/>
     always be opposed to Confederation. The popu<lb break="no"/>lation may extend itself, and cover the virgin 
     <lb/>
     forests which exist between Canada and the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces, and commercial relations may 
     <lb/>
     increase in such a manner as to render Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion necessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
         It is, therefore, in every respect merely a 
     <lb/>
     question of time, and of expediency as 
     <lb/>
     between the majority of the House and the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Hochelaga. But he has 
     <lb/>
     not thought proper to tell us why Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of all the provinces of British North America 
     <lb/>
     is to-day a crime, an anti-national act, yet 
     <lb/>
     would have at one period, been good and accept<lb break="no"/>able to Lower Canada. In the same manner he 
     <lb/>
     has also preserved silence on the character which 
     <lb/>
     Confederation should possess, in order to merit 
     <lb/>
     the sanction of his word and his vote. Al<lb break="no"/>ways to condemn, always to  destroy, never 
     <lb/>
     to build up—this appears to be the motto of 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Hochelaga, and 
     <lb/>
     those who follow his lead on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     this House. (Hear, hear.) They always 
     <lb/>
     keep to themselves the easiest share of sacri<lb break="no"/>fice and patriotism—the task of casting blame 
     <lb/>
     and censure upon others. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman thinks that the union 
     <lb/>
     proposed to us, that is to say Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     is without precedent in Colonial history . He 
     <lb/>
     has, therefore, not read the Federal history, 
     <lb/>
     scarcely accomplished, of the colonies of 
     <lb/>
     Australia. But if it be true that the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the six colonies is without pre<lb break="no"/>cedent in Colonial history, will the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman at least tell us where he found his 
     <lb/>
     precedent for the Confederation of the two 
     <lb/>
     provinces ? (Hear, hear, and laughter.) In 
     <lb/>
     order to get out of the diflicnlty  again this 
     <lb/>
     time, the honorable gentleman  will hardly 
     <lb/>
     deny that which be affirmed so categorically 
     <lb/>
     only the other evening. It is evident that 
     <lb/>
     logic and recollection of facts are not among 
     <lb/>
     the most prominent features of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member's eloquence. Since he desires so much 
     <lb/>
     to establish that he was at all times in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a Confederation of the two Canadas as 
     <lb/>
     an alternative for representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation, it appears to me, and it ought to be 
     <lb/>
     evident to the House and to the country 
     <lb/>
     which we represent, that he should have 
     <lb/>
     stated the motives of such a deep and constant 
     <lb/>

     conviction. Why conceal from us the fruits 
     <lb/>
     of so many and such serious meditations ? 
     <lb/>
     Why, setting aside the facile and convenient 
     <lb/>
     task of censor, does he not come forward as 
     <lb/>
     the architect of a political edifice capable of 
     <lb/>
     sheltering and protecting against tempest from 
     <lb/>
     without, our nationality and the institutions 
     <lb/>
     of which it is composed. It is because " if 
     <lb/>
     criticism is easy, art is diflicult." This truth 
     <lb/>
     enunciated by a poet, nearly two thousand 
     <lb/>
     years ago, evidently belongs to all ages, and it 
     <lb/>
     finds, today more particularly, its application 
     <lb/>
     in the person of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga. (Hear, hear.) <hi rendition="simple:italic">Tempora mutan<lb break="no"/>tur et nos mutamur in illis</hi>—and behold, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman told us on the 16th 
     <lb/>
     February, 1865 :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         Representation based upon population was 
     <lb/>
     one of the least causes of this project. [And 
     <lb/>
     further on]: But, as soon as the Government 
     <lb/>
     found itself, after its defeat, obliged either to 
     <lb/>
     resign or to appeal to the people, gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House, without there being 
     <lb/>
     the slightest agitation on this question, prepared 
     <lb/>
     to embrace their most violent adversaries, and 
     <lb/>
     said to themselves : " We are going to forget

     emphasis and apparently with so much con<lb break="no"/>viction in 1858 :—

     It has become evident to all those who, for

         The proposition for the formation of a Confed<lb break="no"/>eration of the two Canadas is not a new one. It 
     <lb/>
     has frequently been agitated in Parliament and 
     <lb/>
     in the press for several years past. The example 
     <lb/>
     of the neighboring states, in which the applica<lb break="no"/>tion of the Federal system has shewn us how fit<lb break="no"/>ting it was to the government of an immense ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, inhabited by people of different origins, 
     <lb/>
     creeds, laws and customs, has no doubt suggested 
     <lb/>
     the idea ; but it was only in 1856 that this pro<lb break="no"/>position was enunciated before the Legislature by 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Canadian Opposition, as offering, in 
     <lb/>
     its opinion, the only effective remedy for the 
     <lb/>
     abuses produced by the present system.

            <p>
         Lower Canada wishes to maintain intact the 
     <lb/>
     present union of the provinces. If she will not 
     <lb/>
     consent to a dissolution nor to Confederation, it 
     <lb/>
     is difficult to conceive what plausible reasons she 
     <lb/>
     can advance for refusing representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation. Up to the present time she has opposed 
     <lb/>
     it by alleging the anger which might result to 
     <lb/>
     some of the institutions which are most dear to 
     <lb/>
     her ; but this reason would be no longer sustain<lb break="no"/>able if it resisted a proposition the effect of which 
     <lb/>
     would be to leave to the inhabitants of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada the absolute control of those same insti<lb break="no"/>tutions and to surround them with the most 
     <lb/>
     efficient protection which it is possible to im<lb break="no"/>agine—that which would procure for them the 
     <lb/>
     formal dispositions of a written constitution, 
     <lb/>
      which could not be changed without their consent.

            </p>

    
   
            <p>
         lt appears therefore that the only alternative 
     <lb/>
     which now  offers itself to the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada is a choice between dissolution 
     <lb/>
     pure and simple, or Confederation on one side,  
     <lb/>
     and representation by population on the other. 
     <lb/>
     And however opposed Lower Canada may be to  
     <lb/>
     representation by population, is there not immin<lb break="no"/>ent danger  that it may be finally imposed upon 
     <lb/>
     it, if it resist all measures of reform, the object 
     <lb/>
     of which is to leave to the local authorities of 
     <lb/>
     each section the control of its own interests and

     institutions.

         We should not forget that the same authority  
     <lb/>
     which imposed on us the Act of Union, or which 
     <lb/>
     altered it without our consent, by repealing the 
     <lb/>
     clause which required the concurrence of two-  
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thirds of the members of both Houses in order to 
     <lb/>
     change the representation respecting the two sec<lb break="no"/>tions, may again intervene to impose upon us this

     left to the local government the powers of

     <lb/>
     General Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         Your Committee believes that it is easy to 
     <lb/>
     prove that the expenses absolutely necessary for 
     <lb/>
     the  support of the  Federal Government and the 
     <lb/>
     several local governments ought not to exceed 
     <lb/>
     those of the present system, while the enormous 
     <lb/>
     indirect expenses occasioned by the latter system 
     <lb/>
     would be avoided by the new—both on account 
     <lb/>
     of the additional restrictions which the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion would place upon all public expenditure, and 
     <lb/>
     of the more immediate responsibility of the 
     <lb/>
     several officers of the Government towards the 
     <lb/>
     people who are interested in restraining them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         The Federal Legislature having only to occupy 
     <lb/>
     itself with a limited number of affairs, might, in 
     <lb/>
     a short time every year, perform all necessary 
     <lb/>
     legislation ; and, as the number of members 
     <lb/>
     would not be very great, the expenses of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government would not, therefore, be a 
     <lb/>
     fraction of the present expenses, which, added to 
     <lb/>
     the cost of the  local governments, if they were on 
     <lb/>
      the plan of those of the United States, which are 
     <lb/>
     the best and the most economically administered, 
     <lb/>
     could not exceed the figure of the present 
     <lb/>
     budget. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         The system proposed could not in any way 
     <lb/>
     diminish the importance of this colony, nor 
     <lb/>
     damage its credit, inasmuch as it offers the great 
     <lb/>
     advantage of being able to suit itself to any ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial extension which circumstances might, in 
     <lb/>
     future, render desirable, without troubling the 
     <lb/>
     general economy of the Confederation.

         <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Mr. PERREAULT</persName>—I rise to a question 
     <lb/>
     of order. We have listened with much plea<lb break="no"/>sure to the excellent pamphlet which the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member has been reading out to us for 
     <lb/>
     half an hour past. I can understand that 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member having written a pam<lb break="no"/>phlet in 1858 against Confederation, and an<lb break="no"/>other in 1865 in favor of Confederation, now 
     <lb/>
     feels the necessity of writing a third pamph<lb break="no"/>let to make the two others agree. But, as 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Montmorency pos<lb break="no"/>sesses great powers of improvisation, the 
     <lb/>
     House, I think, ought not to be more indul<lb break="no"/>gent to him than to other members, who are 
     <lb/>
     compelled to speak under all the disadvanta<lb break="no"/>ges of improvisation, which is always difficult. 
     <lb/>
     I have, therefore, to ask whether the honora<lb break="no"/>ble member for Montmorency is in order in 
     <lb/>
     reading his magnificent speech from begin<lb break="no"/>ning to end ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:CART2">Hon. Atty. Gen. CARTIER</persName> — I see 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     nothing extraordinary in this particular case. 
     <lb/>
     I see that my honorable friend the member 
     <lb/>
     for Montmorency has notes before him to 
     <lb/>
     which he refers, but I do not see any speech. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member for Richelieu, with 
     <lb/>
     his eccentric genius, requires no notes when 
     <lb/>
     he makes those splendid speeches with which 
     <lb/>
     he regales us from time to time. I can easily 
     <lb/>
     understand that for such lucubrations no very 
     <lb/>
     lengthy preparation is necessary. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
          <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">Hon. Mr. CAUCHON</persName>—Every one has

     not the genius of the honorable member for

     <lb/>
     those who can talk a long time, because they 
     <lb/>
     do not always know what they are saying. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) The honorable member may 
     <lb/>
     talk as long as he likes, without being afraid 
     <lb/>
     of my interrupting him, for his speeches can 
     <lb/>
     do no harm except to the person who utters 
     <lb/>
     them. (Laughter.)

          The SPEAKER said it was not exactly in

     order for an honorable member to read a

     speech quite through, but he might make use 
     <lb/>
     of notes.

     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">Hon. Mr. CAUCHON</persName>—From all these 
     <lb/>
     extracts one must conclude that either the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Hochelaga was ready 
     <lb/>
     to sacrifice everything in order to attain 
     <lb/>
     power in 1858, or else that in 1858, as in 
     <lb/>
     1859, he was deeply convinced that nothing 
     <lb/>
     but representation by population or a Federal 
     <lb/>
     union of the two Canadas could prevent the 
     <lb/>
     storm then lowering on the horizon. We find 
     <lb/>
     therein, firstly, that we were rapidly reaching 
     <lb/>
     a state of things which would necessitate mod<lb break="no"/>ifications in the relations between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada ; secondly, that the proposal to 
     <lb/>
     form a Federation of the Canadas was not 
     <lb/>
     new ; thirdly, that the example of the neigh<lb break="no"/>boring States, where the application of the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral system shewed how suitable it was to the 
     <lb/>
     government of an immense territory, inhabited 
     <lb/>
     by people of different origin, belief, laws and 
     <lb/>
     customs, had suggested the idea ; fourthly, 
     <lb/>
     that Lower Canada would not have any legi<lb break="no"/>timate motive to resist representation based 
     <lb/>
     upon population if it refused a written Consti<lb break="no"/>tution, under which it would have protection 
     <lb/>
     for and control of its institutions ; fifthly, 
     <lb/>
     that it would be in imminent danger of see<lb break="no"/>ing imposed upon it representation based upon 
     <lb/>
     population, if the Confederation of the two 
     <lb/>
     Canadas were obstinately resisted, and that 
     <lb/>
     those who imposed the Union Act upon us, and 
     <lb/>
     afterwards altered it to our detriment, could 
     <lb/>
     oblige us to accept the former; sixthly, that

     the substitution of a purely Federal Government 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     solution of our difficulties, and that such substi<lb break="no"/>tution would free us from the inconveniences,

     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) At the same 
     <lb/>
      period the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pays</hi>, with a conviction as profound 
     <lb/>
     as that of the honorable gentleman whose 
     <lb/>
     organ it is, thought that if we did not make 
     <lb/>
     some constitutional concessions we should not 
     <lb/>
     be able to resist the torrent of public opinion 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada, which threatened to break 
     <lb/>
     through the feeble barrier opposed to it by the 
     <lb/>
     Union Act of 1840. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Hochelaga went on with his fears and his 
     <lb/>
     convictions to the time when, by an accident 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate for the country, he again came 
     <lb/>
     into power. (Hear, hear.) It is not then 
     <lb/>
     merely the holding of a ministerial portfolio 
     <lb/>
     which is cast up to us to-day. The time 
     <lb/>
     has then arrived when constitutional changes 
     <lb/>
     become necessary—the question of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration under any form is, therefore, not 
     <lb/>
     new. (Hear, hear.) To take the United 
     <lb/>
     States, as the honorable member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga has done, for example, I will say that the 
     <lb/>
     Federal system is suitable for the government 
     <lb/>
     of an immense territory, inhabited by people 
     <lb/>
     of different races, laws and customs, and con<lb break="no"/>sequently more suitable to the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of the British North American Provinces than 
     <lb/>
     to the smaller one of Upper and Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada. Lower Canada, " unless she wish re<lb break="no"/>presentation based upon population, should 
     <lb/>
     not reject a written Constitution under which 
     <lb/>
     she has protection for and control of her pecu<lb break="no"/>liar institutions." (Hear, hear.) Finally, 
     <lb/>
     the expenses of the federal and local govern<lb break="no"/>ments and legislatures will not exceed those 
     <lb/>
     of the present system. According to the 
     <lb/>
     Montreal manifesto of 1859, the Federal Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and Parliament, having very little to 
     <lb/>
     do, ought to cost but little, so as to leave more 
     <lb/>
     to be done by the local legislatures. Accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the scheme of the Conference held at 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, the tables are turned, and it will be 
     <lb/>
     the local legislatures that, having but local 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
          
     affairs to attend to, will have to practise econ<lb break="no"/>omy for the benefit of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It is therefore evident that the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Hochelaga is not more of a 
     <lb/>
     conjuror than others. It is again still more 
     <lb/>
     evident that the honorable member would be 
     <lb/>
     less hostile to this project, had he been the 
     <lb/>
     author of it, or if he had been sitting on the 
     <lb/>
     right instead of on the left side of the House; 
     <lb/>
     for after all it is but a question of expediency, 
     <lb/>
     at least as regards principle. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga also told us :—

     (Hear.) I do not wish to doubt his sin<lb break="no"/>cerity, but has he not also said, " I know that 
     <lb/>
     the possession of power leads to despotism?" 
     <lb/>
     Did he not say, before the events of 1858, 
     <lb/>
     that were he in power, never, no never, would 
     <lb/>
     he consent to govern Lower Canada with the 
     <lb/>
     help of an Upper Canada majority, and yet 
     <lb/>
     how did he act in 1862? How did he act on 
     <lb/>
     coming into power in 1863, after having 
     <lb/>
     ejected in such a loyal and sympathising man<lb break="no"/>ner his illustrious predecessor and chief, Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SICOTTE? (Hear, hear.) It was not 
     <lb/>
     despotism, but thirst for power, which made 
     <lb/>
     him adopt means to attain that end, which I 
     <lb/>
     shall not designate by their proper name in 
     <lb/>
     this solemn debate. (Hear, hear.) How 
     <lb/>
     did he act? Forgetting his declarations of 
     <lb/>
     1858, he governed Lower Canada with a 
     <lb/>
     weak minority of its representatives, and as, 
     <lb/>
     according to his ideas, "power led to des<lb break="no"/>potism," he ruled it with that rod of iron 
     <lb/>
     which the radicals alone know how to wield. 
     <lb/>
     But happily those days of painful memories 
     <lb/>
     are passed, and the level of the political soil, 
     <lb/>
     which had sunk down, from some of those 
     <lb/>
     secret causes known to Providence alone, again 
     <lb/>
     suddenly rose up to escape from the over<lb break="no"/>flowing torrents of demagogic principles which 
     <lb/>
     threatened society at large. What the Op<lb break="no"/>position detest the most in the project of the

     We move in a different circle of ideas from

     that in which the Opposition moves. We wish 
     <lb/>
     in America, as elsewhere, for a monarchy tem<lb break="no"/>pered by parliamentary system and minister<lb break="no"/>ial responsibility, because, without interfering 
     <lb/>
     with liberty, it renders institutions more solid 
     <lb/>
     and secure. We have all seen British democ<lb break="no"/>racy holding its existence under the protec<lb break="no"/>tion of the immutable ægis of Royal Majesty, 
     <lb/>
     and exercising over the destinies of the coun<lb break="no"/>try that salutary control which has made 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain so rich, so powerful and so free. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have also seen, not far 
     <lb/>
     from our own homes, that same democracy 
     <lb/>
     wrapped in the mantle of republicanism, mov<lb break="no"/>ing at a rapid pace towards demagogy, and 
     <lb/>
     from demagogy to an intolerable despotism. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear. ) We have seen military rule 
     <lb/>
     extending over the entire face of the great 
     <lb/>
     neighboring republic, lately so proud of its 
     <lb/>
     popular institutions. And we have also seen 
     <lb/>
     that people, so proud of their liberty, humbly 
     <lb/>
     bend their necks to the sword of the soldier, 
     <lb/>
     allow their press to be muzzled, after having 
     <lb/>
     condemned the system of censorship legalized 
     <lb/>
     in France, and suffer their writers to be im<lb break="no"/>prisoned without a protest. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     M. DE TOCQUEVILLE has lived too long ; his 
     <lb/>
     admirable work on democracy in America 
     <lb/>
     produces upon our minds, at the present day, 
     <lb/>
     only the effect of an heroic poem ; it is the 
     <lb/>
     Isle of Calypso, so admirably sung by FENE<lb break="no"/>LON, but which fades away when you have 
     <lb/>
     closed <hi rendition="simple:italic">Telemachus</hi>. (Laughter.) Instead of 
     <lb/>
     those institutions, framed with such mathe<lb break="no"/>matical precision, and that mechanism so fin<lb break="no"/>ished and so regular in its course, there is to 
     <lb/>
     be seen but violent and jerking motions, over<lb break="no"/>turnings, and the collision and smashing of 
     <lb/>
     the component parts of the disconnected ma<lb break="no"/>chinery of state ; instead of peace and har<lb break="no"/>mony we find civil war on a  gigantic scale, 
     <lb/>
     universal desolation, formidable battles, and 
     <lb/>
     the blood of brothers mingling in streams on 
     <lb/>
     the soil of their common country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) What has become of that race of 
     <lb/>
     giants who, after seven years of a glorious 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     struggle, laid the foundation, in 1783, of the 
     <lb/>
     American republic ? Disdaining to use the 
     <lb/>
     means employed by the smaller spirits of the 
     <lb/>
     age to grasp at the helm of the state, they 
     <lb/>
     have retired from the public arena, so as to 
     <lb/>
     live in an honorable and dignified manner in 
     <lb/>
     private retirement—for the genius of the 
     <lb/>
     American people is not dead, and the country 
     <lb/>
     which still produces great judges and learned 
     <lb/>
     jurists could also, under another order of 
     <lb/>
     things, and in a different moral condition, 
     <lb/>
     give birth to new WASHINGTONS, FRANKLINS, 
     <lb/>
     HAMILTONS, ADAMS, and MADISONS. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) They did not act wrongly then, those 
     <lb/>
     forty chosen men of British North America ' 
     <lb/>
     who came to Quebec to erect a new nation on 
     <lb/>
     the monarchical basis, and as much as possible 
     <lb/>
     on the principles of the Parliament of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. It seems to us that that authority 
     <lb/>
     was imposing enough to merit the respect of 
     <lb/>
     men of much less experience, and much less 
     <lb/>
     versed in the science of government. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And yet when the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Joliette asked with much reason of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Lotbinière why he did 
     <lb/>
     not speak of Confederation based upon mon<lb break="no"/>archical principles, the latter gentleman an<lb break="no"/>swered that he could not speak of what did 
     <lb/>
     not exist, and of what was absurd. He was 
     <lb/>
     like the French <hi rendition="simple:italic">savant</hi> who, in 1836, proved 
     <lb/>
     by arguments not to be refuted, that it was 
     <lb/>
     impossible to cross the ocean with steam as 
     <lb/>
     the motive power. But while he was thus 
     <lb/>
     floundering through his powerful and learned 
     <lb/>
     arguments, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sirius</hi> was steaming majesti<lb break="no"/>cally across the Atlantic as if to mock the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom of science. Facts are stubborn and 
     <lb/>
     positive things. (Hear, hear.) We are not 
     <lb/>
     here, like COLUMBUS, looking for an unknown 
     <lb/>
     world ; yet the honorable member who went 
     <lb/>
     as far back as the heroic times of Greece to 
     <lb/>
     find arguments against all Confederations, who 
     <lb/>
     unfolded pompously to our gaze Roman his<lb break="no"/>tory to prove to us that what was strong and 
     <lb/>
     durable was formed piece by piece, and that 
     <lb/>
     even what is actually strong must also perish, as 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Empire had ended by succumbing 
     <lb/>
     under the weight of its own power ; who, bent 
     <lb/>
     on finding out Confederations in confusion, and 
     <lb/>
     in the midst of <hi rendition="simple:italic">pronunciamentos</hi>, of <hi rendition="simple:italic">movimen<lb break="no"/>tos</hi> and of <hi rendition="simple:italic">échauffourées</hi>, travelled through with<lb break="no"/>out seeing them, those non-federative Spanish- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     American republics, so irritable and so agi<lb break="no"/>tated ; who, to be faithful to this system, at<lb break="no"/>tributed the five hundred years' existence of 
     <lb/>
     the Swiss Confederation to every other cause 
     <lb/>
     than to the stability of its principle, and to 
     <lb/>
     the conservative and national character of its

     inhabitants ; and who, in his enthusiasm for 
     <lb/>
     his doctrines, did not see that the European 
     <lb/>
     equilibrium would have been secure just as 
     <lb/>
     well by the existence of one or more distinct 
     <lb/>
     states as with a Confederation in the Helvetic 
     <lb/>
     Mountains — he failed to see not far from 
     <lb/>
     the native land of his ancestors, the noble 
     <lb/>
     Helvetia which conquered and maintained 
     <lb/>
     for five centuries its independence in the 
     <lb/>
    midst of the most terrible conflicts which 
     <lb/>shook the soil of Europe, which overturned 
     <lb/>thrones and transformed nations—he has not 
     <lb/>seen, in flesh and blood, a Confederation rest<lb break="no"/>ing almost entirely on the monarchical prin<lb break="no"/>ciple—the Germanic Confederation—of which 
     <lb/>Austria is the head, and for which this latter 
     <lb/>power and Prussia alone can decide questions 
     <lb/>of peace and war. (Hear, hear.) This was 
     <lb/>preceded by the Confederation of the Rhine, 
     <lb/>which had found like it its elements and its 
     <lb/>mode of being in the ancient empire found<lb break="no"/>ed by CHARLEMAGNE, " the strongest hand 
     <lb/>that ever existed," to use the splendid 
     <lb/>expression of OZANAM ; the Germanic Em<lb break="no"/>pire, a true confederation of princes, be<lb break="no"/>coming really independent in the course of 
     <lb/>centuries, and kings in their respective states 
     <lb/>under the Imperial suzerainty. The Golden 
     <lb/>Bull promulgated by the Emperor CHARLES 
     <lb/>IV., in 1356, gives us some useful in<lb break="no"/>formation on this subject. I would refer 
     <lb/>the honorable member for Lotbinière to it. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) But why should we ransack 
     <lb/>history to establish a fact which is as clear 
     <lb/>as day ? Is it not sufficient to open the first 
     <lb/>dictionary at hand to know that the word 
     <lb/>" confederation " means simply " league," 
     <lb/>union of states or sovereigns, of nations, or 
     <lb/>even of armies for a common object. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) The honorable member has there<lb break="no"/>fore ill-chosen his time to be witty at the 
     <lb/>expense of a man of sense. He declared 
     <lb/>himself by turns against the Federal prin<lb break="no"/>ciple and against legislative unity. Appealing 
     <lb/>alternately to every prejudice to attain his 
     <lb/>object, he said to the French-Canadian 
     <lb/>Catholics—" Resist Confederation, because it 
     <lb/>will leave you without protection in the 
     <lb/>Federal Government and Parliament." Then, 
     <lb/>turning towards English Protestants, and 
     <lb/>reading complacently to them an extract from 
     <lb/>Lord DURHAM'S report, he said :—" Do not 
     <lb/>vote for Confederation ; you would be at the 
     <lb/>mercy of a French and Catholic majority in 
     <lb/>the Local Government and Parliament." 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Although the direct reverse 
     <lb/>in every  other respect of the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Hochelaga, his conduct proves 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     that he believes with that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman " that power engenders des<lb break="no"/>potism." But, in his place, at the outset of 
     <lb/>
     my public career, full of youth and of the 
     <lb/>
     generous sentiments which it inspires, in<lb break="no"/>stead of setting the torch to such inflammable 
     <lb/>
     elements as national and religions preju<lb break="no"/>dices, I should have imitated the example 
     <lb/>
     of the honorable member for Montreal 
     <lb/>
     Centre ; and in order to calm mutual distrust, 
     <lb/>
     I should have endeavored to fulfil my duty 
     <lb/>
     by recalling the eminently honorable, chris<lb break="no"/>tian and civilising history of the last quarter 
     <lb/>
     of a century. (Cheers ) But the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman was evidently incapable of so 
     <lb/>
     doing. He had just emerged terrified from 
     <lb/>
     amidst the <hi rendition="simple:italic">pronunciamentos</hi>, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">echauffourées</hi> 
     <lb/>
    and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">movimentos</hi> of the very civilized 
     <lb/>
     Spanish Confederations of Central America, 
     <lb/>
     and full of feverish agitation, he launched 
     <lb/>
     himself on spreading pinions towards the 
     <lb/>
     rain-bow and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">aurora borealis</hi>. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) We know what the rainbow is 
     <lb/>
     physically. It is composed of drops of 
     <lb/>
     water, which, placed at a certain angle facing 
     <lb/>
     the sun, refract and reflect its light with 
     <lb/>
     all the colors of which it is composed 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) As to the  <hi rendition="simple:italic">aurora borealis</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     some attribute it to the reverberations of 
     <lb/>
     solar light on the snows of the North Pole, 
     <lb/>
     whither the honorable gentleman proceeded 
     <lb/>
     in order to find the vast territory with which 
     <lb/>
     he wishes us to form the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     domain. But the opinion most generally 
     <lb/>
     accepted is that it is, in a manner, some<lb break="no"/>thing imponderable and unsubstantial. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) Our people, seeing them 
     <lb/>
     moving in all directions with the most 
     <lb/>
     prodigious rapidity, rising, falling, doubling 
     <lb/>
     backward and forward on each other with 
     <lb/>
     such inconceivable rapidity, have given them 
     <lb/>
     the true and picturesque name of dancing 
     <lb/>
     puppets (<hi rendition="simple:italic">marionnettes</hi>). (Hear, and laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) It is, therefore, easily seen that if they 
     <lb/>
     hold in horror the prejudices which are pro<lb break="no"/>ductive of so much evil, their mind is at least 
     <lb/>
     not so torpid as the hon. member for Lotbi<lb break="no"/>nière believes, and it is at least not necessary 
     <lb/>
     to arouse them in this manner. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We know what invariably happens to all 
     <lb/>
     these luminous meteors. Jack o' the Lanterns 
     <lb/>
     and Will o' the Wisps having complacently 
     <lb/>
     expanded themselves on the confines of the] 
     <lb/>
     infinite horizon, after having gambolled at 
     <lb/>
     their ease, become serious and solemn—they 
     <lb/>
     are seized with the ambition of ascending to 
     <lb/>
     the zenith. But as they have, " with the 
     <lb/>
     stature of a giant, but the strength of a 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">563</fw>
           
     child," they soon diminish and disappear, 
     <lb/>
     to be, in the words of BOSSUET, <hi rendition="simple:italic">" qu'un je 
     <lb/>
     ne sais quoi qui n'a plus de nom dans aucune 
     <lb/>
     langue</hi> (a thing which has no name in any 
     <lb/>
     tongue)." (Hear, hear.) On close exami<lb break="no"/>nation, however, it would be seen that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member was not so sarcastic as might 
     <lb/>
     have been at first supposed, when he 
     <lb/>
     suggested the iris as the emblem of the new 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. The rainbow, from a figura<lb break="no"/>tive point of view, is the emblem of alliance, 
     <lb/>
     and consequently of strength and durability— 
     <lb/>
     it is the symbol of peace and calm after a long 
     <lb/>
     day of storm and tempest—it is the pledge of 
     <lb/>
     promise that, in future, the flood-gates of 
     <lb/>
     demagogy will no longer be opened on 
     <lb/>
     the country, to leave upon its surface that 
     <lb/>
     morbid sediment, the fetid odors of which 
     <lb/>
     still offend the moral sense of the people 
     <lb/>
     after their unwholesome waters have retired. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) It is the unity of many-colored 
     <lb/>
     rays which, combined, produces light and 
     <lb/>
     heat and fecundity. I should, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     advise those who will be charged at a future 
     <lb/>
     day with our new destinies to adopt the 
     <lb/>
     rainbow as our national emblem, and to give 
     <lb/>
     credit to the hon. member for Lotbinière, 
     <lb/>
     who will doubtless be astonished to find that 
     <lb/>
     he has been so wonderfully inspired. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) If there were never to 
     <lb/>
     be any mutual confidence among men ; if we 
     <lb/>
     were for ever destined to fear and suspect each 
     <lb/>
     other reciprocally, we would be obliged to 
     <lb/>
     renounce all idea of government as well as 
     <lb/>
     all the relations of social life The very 
     <lb/>
     laws which protect persons and property 
     <lb/>
     would be without value, because they are 
     <lb/>
     expounded by men. (Hear, hear.) For<lb break="no"/>tunately such is not the case, as our own 
     <lb/>
     history sufficiently proves. Before the 
     <lb/>
     union. the parliamentary majority in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada was Catholic, and although it was 
     <lb/>
     long involved in a struggle with power, was 
     <lb/>
     it ever guilty of an injustice towards the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant minority ? (Hear, hear.) On 
     <lb/>
     the contrary, did it not emancipate the 
     <lb/>
     latter, civilly and religiously, and did it not 
     <lb/>
     give that minority privileges which it had 
     <lb/>
     not hitherto possessed? If our people 
     <lb/>
     are inflexibly attached to our faith, it is 
     <lb/>
     also full of toleration, of good-will towards 
     <lb/>
     those who are not of the same belief. Since 
     <lb/>
     the union the parts have changed. Protes<lb break="no"/>tantism dominates in the government and in 
     <lb/>
     the legislature, and yet has not Catholicity 
     <lb/>
     been better treated, and has it not been 
     <lb/>
     better developed, with more liberty and more 
     <lb/>
     prosperity than under the regime of the Con<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
      stitution of 1791. (Hear, hear.) Living 
     <lb/>
     and laboring together we have learned to 
     <lb/>
     know, to respect, to esteem each other, and 
     <lb/>
     to make mutual concessions for the common 
     <lb/>
     weal. We Catholics have therefore no fear 
     <lb/>
     of the ill-will of a Protestant majority in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government and Legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     we are certain that the Protestants of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada need not fear for themselves in the 
     <lb/>
     local legislature. (Hear, hear, and cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Hochelaga has declared 
     <lb/>
     that he was willing to accord to the Protest<lb break="no"/>ants the guarantees of protection which they 
     <lb/>
     sought for the education of their children ; 
     <lb/>
     but in this he has been forestalled by the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference and by the unanimous 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of the Catholic population of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. If the present law be in<lb break="no"/>sufficient. let it be changed. Justice demands 
     <lb/>
     that the Protestant minority of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     shall be protected in the same manner as the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of Upper Canada, and that 
     <lb/>
     the rights acquired by the one and the other 
     <lb/>
     shall not be assailed either by the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Parliament or the local legislatures. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) This is all I feel called upon to say, 
     <lb/>
     on this occasion, respecting a question which 
     <lb/>
     will again arise in the course of the debate. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Lotbinière has attacked 
     <lb/>
     the scheme as being too federal, and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga has condemned it as 
     <lb/>
     not being sufficiently federal, and as tending 
     <lb/>
     too much towards unity. Neither one nor 
     <lb/>
     the other is strictly accurate—it is not ab<lb break="no"/>solute unity, nor the federal principle in the 
     <lb/>
     American sense. In the American Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, supreme authority proceeded at the 
     <lb/>
     outset from the delegation of the states, 
     <lb/>
     which nevertheless divested themselves of it 
     <lb/>
     forever—at least according to the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the Northern jurisconsults, who hold that no 
     <lb/>
     state is free to break the compact of 1788. 
     <lb/>
     In the scheme of the Quebec Conference 
     <lb/>
     there was no delegation of the supreme 
     <lb/>
     authority, either from above or below, inas<lb break="no"/>much as the provinces, not being independ<lb break="no"/>ent states, received, their political organiza<lb break="no"/>tions from the Parliament of the Empire. 
     <lb/>
     There are only distinct attributes for the one 
     <lb/>
     and the others. (Hear, hear.) Unity does 
     <lb/>
     not obtain in an absolute sense, because local 
     <lb/>
     interests and institutions required in the local 
     <lb/>
     constitutions, guarantees and protections 
     <lb/>
     which they feared they would not find in the. 
     <lb/>
     united Parliament and Government. But it is 
     <lb/>
     as complete as possible, inasmuch as unity gives 
     <lb/>
     to institutions chances of duration, and an 
     <lb/>
     initiatory force which is not given, which 
     <lb/>

            <pb n="564" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0564.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">564</fw>
           
     cannot be given, by confederacies in which 
     <lb/>
     authority is scattered, and where it is con<lb break="no"/>sequently without value and without real 
     <lb/>
     existence. Every constitutional mode of 
     <lb/>
     existence has its advantages ; but assuredly 
     <lb/>
     that state of existence which gives perman<lb break="no"/>ence and stability to institutions should be 
     <lb/>
     preferred to others. Let us bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     that the Constitution of the United States 
     <lb/>
     has been but a compromise between state 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty and the need of a supreme 
     <lb/>
     authority to ensure the working of the state 
     <lb/>
     machinery, and that it was not perfect even 
     <lb/>
     in the opinion of its authors. In order to 
     <lb/>
     prove this statement, I shall call to my assist<lb break="no"/>ance words of greater weight than my own— 
     <lb/>
     those of JOSEPH STOREY, probably the 
     <lb/>
     greatest constitutional authority of the 
     <lb/>
     United States :—

            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Any survey, however slight, of the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation will impress the mind with the intrinsic 
     <lb/>
     difficulties which attended the formation of its prin<lb break="no"/>cipal features. It is well known that upon three 
     <lb/>
     important points touching the common rights and 
     <lb/>
     interests of the several states, much diversity of 
     <lb/>
     opinion prevailed, and many animated discussions 
     <lb/>
     took place. The first was as to the mode of 
     <lb/>
     voting in Congress, whether it should be by 
     <lb/>
     states or according to wealth or population. The 
     <lb/>
     second, as to the rule by which the expenses of 
     <lb/>
     the Union should be apportioned among the 
     <lb/>
     states. And the third, as has been already seen, 
     <lb/>
     relative to the disposal of the vacant and unappro<lb break="no"/>priated lands in the western territory. But that 
     <lb/>
     which strikes us with most force is the increasing 
     <lb/>
     jealousy and watchfulness everywhere betrayed 
     <lb/>
     in respect to the powers to be confided to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government. For this several causes 
     <lb/>
     may be assigned. The colonies had been long 
     <lb/>
     engaged in struggles against the superintending 
     <lb/>
     authority of the Crown, and had practically felt 
     <lb/>
     the inconveniences of the restrictive legislation 
     <lb/>
     of the parent country. These struggles 
     <lb/>
     had naturally led to a general feeling of resis<lb break="no"/>tance of all external authority, and these in<lb break="no"/>conveniences to extreme doubts, if not to dread 
     <lb/>
     of any legislation, not exclusively originating in 
     <lb/>
     their domestic assemblies, They had, as yet, 
     <lb/>
     not felt the importance or necessity of union 
     <lb/>
     among themselves, having been hitherto con<lb break="no"/>nected with the British sovereignty in all their 
     <lb/>
     foreign relations. What would be their fate, as 
     <lb/>
     separate and independent communities ; how far 
     <lb/>
     their interests would coincide or vary from each 
     <lb/>
     other as such ; what would be the effects of the 
     <lb/>
     union upon their domestic peace, their territorial 
     <lb/>
     interests, their external commerce, their political 
     <lb/>
     security, or their civil liberty, were points to them 
     <lb/>
     wholly of a speculative character, in regard to 
     <lb/>
     which various opinions might be entertained, and 
     <lb/>
     various and even opposite conjectures formed, 
     <lb/>
     upon grounds apparently of equal plausibility. 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     Nothwithstanding the declaration of the articles, 
     <lb/>
     that the union of the states was to be perpetual, 
     <lb/>
     an examination of the powers confided to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government would easily satisfy us that 
     <lb/>
     they looked principally to the existing revolu<lb break="no"/>tionary state of things. The principal powers 
     <lb/>
     respected the operations of war, and would be 
     <lb/>
     dormant in times of peace. In short, Congress 
     <lb/>
     in peace was possessed of but a delusive and 
     <lb/>
     shadowy sovereignty, with little more than the 
     <lb/>
     empty pageantry of office. They were indeed 
     <lb/>
     clothed with the authority of sending and receiving 
     <lb/>
     ambassadors ; of entering into treaties and allian<lb break="no"/>ces ; of appointing courts for the trial of piracies 
     <lb/>
     and felonies on the high seas ; of regulating the 
     <lb/>
     public coin ; of fixing the standard of weights and 
     <lb/>
     measures ; of regulating trade with Indians, of 
     <lb/>
     establishing post offices ; of borrowing money and 
     <lb/>
     emitting bills on the credit of the United 
     <lb/>
     States ; of ascertaining and appropriating the 
     <lb/>
     sums necessary for defraying the public ex<lb break="no"/>penses, and of disposing of the western ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. And most of these powers required for 
     <lb/>
     their exercise the assent of nine states. But they 
     <lb/>
     possessed not the power to raise any revenue, 
     <lb/>
     to levy any tax, to enforce any law, to secure 
     <lb/>
     any right, to regulate any trade, or even the poor 
     <lb/>
     prerogative of commanding means to pay its own 
     <lb/>
     ministers at a foreign court. They could contract 
     <lb/>
     debts, but they were without means to discharge 
     <lb/>
     them. They could pledge the public faith, but 
     <lb/>
     they were incapable of redeeming it. They could 
     <lb/>
     enter into treaties, but every state in the union 
     <lb/>
     might disobey them with impunity. They could 
     <lb/>
     contract alliances, but could not command men 
     <lb/>
     or money to give them vigor. They could insti<lb break="no"/>tute courts for piracies and felonies on the high 
     <lb/>
     seas, but they had no means to pay either the 
     <lb/>
     judges or the jurors. In short, all powers which 
     <lb/>
     did not execute themselves were at the mercy of 
     <lb/>
     the states, and might be trampled upon at will 
     <lb/>
     with impunity.

     with unusual significancy on the same sub<lb break="no"/>ject. " In a word," says he," the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration appears to me to be little more than 
     <lb/>
     a shadow without the substance, and Con<lb break="no"/>gress a nugatory body, their ordinances being

     may be found in many public documents. 
     <lb/>
     One of the most  humiliating proofs of the 
     <lb/>
     utter inability of Congress to enforce even 
     <lb/>
     the exclusive powers vested in it, is to be 
     <lb/>
     found in the argumentative circular addressed 
     <lb/>
     by it to the several states, in April, 1787, 
     <lb/>
     entreating them in the most supplicating  
     <lb/>
     manner to repeal such of their laws as inter<lb break="no"/>fered with the treaties with foreign nations. 
     <lb/>
     " If in theory,"says the biographer of WASH<lb break="no"/>INGTON, " the treaties formed by Congress

     were obligatory, yet it had been demonstra<lb break="no"/>ted that in practice that body was absolutely 
     <lb/>

         In this state of things, the embarrassments of 
     <lb/>
     the country in its financial concerns, the general 
     <lb/>
      pecuniary distress among the people from the ex<lb break="no"/>hausting operations of the war, the total prostra<lb break="no"/>tion of commerce and the languishing unthriftiness 
     <lb/>of agriculture, gave new impulses to the already 
     <lb/>marked political divisions in the Legislative  
     <lb/>Councils. Efforts were made on our side to re<lb break="no"/>lieve the pressure of the public calamities by a 
     <lb/>resort to the issue of paper money, to tender 
     <lb/>laws, and instalment and other laws, having for 
     <lb/>their object the postponement of the payment of 
     <lb/>private debt, and a diminution of the public taxes. 
     <lb/>On the other side, public as well as private credi<lb break="no"/>tors became alarmed from the increased dangers 
     <lb/>to property, and the increased facility of perpe<lb break="no"/>trating frauds, to the destruction of all private 
     <lb/>faith, and credit. And  they insisted strenuously 
     <lb/>upon the establishment of a government and sys<lb break="no"/>tem of laws which should preserve the public 
     <lb/>faith and redeem the country from that ruin 
     <lb/>which always follows upon the violation of the 
     <lb/>principles of justice and the moral obligation of 
     <lb/>contracts. " At length," we are told, " two great 
     <lb/> parties were formed in every state, which were 
     <lb/>distinctly marked and which pursued distinct ob<lb break="no"/>jects with systematic arrangement." The wonder 
     <lb/>indeed is, not under such circumstances, that the 
     <lb/>constitution should have encountered the most 
     <lb/>ardent opposition, but that it should ever have 
     <lb/>been adopted at all by the majority of the states. 
     <lb/>In the convention itself which framed it, there 
     <lb/> was a great diversity of  judgement, and upon some 
     <lb/> vital subjects an intense  and irreconcilable hostil<lb break="no"/>ity of opinion. It is understood that, at several 
     <lb/> periods the convention were upon the point of 
     <lb/>breaking up without accomplishing  anything. On 
     <lb/>the other hand, if the votaries of the national 
     <lb/> government are fewer in number, they are likely 
     <lb/> to enlist in its favor men of ardent ambition, 
     <lb/>comprehensive views and powerful genius. A 
     <lb/>love of the union, a sense of its importance—nay, 
     <lb/>of its necessity to secure permanence and safety

     calculated to preserve peace at home and dignity 
     <lb/>
     abroad, and to give value to property, and system 
     <lb/>
     and harmony to the great interests of agriculture, 
     <lb/>
     commerce and manufactures ; a consciousness, 
     <lb/>
     too, that the restraints which it imposes upon the 
     <lb/>
     states are the only efficient means to preserve 
     <lb/>
     public and private  justice, and to ensure tranquil<lb break="no"/>ity amidst the conflicting interests and rivalries of 
     <lb/>
     the states—these will doubtless combine many 
     <lb/>
     sober and reflecting minds in its support. If to 
     <lb/>
     this number we are to add those whom the larger 
     <lb/>
     rewards of fame or emolument or influence con<lb break="no"/>nected with a wider sphere of action may allure 
     <lb/>
     to the national councils, there is much reason to

     presume that the union will not be without reso<lb break="no"/>lute friends. .

     The events now occurring in the United 
     <lb/>
     States sufficiently prove, I think, that the 
     <lb/>
     fears of the illustrious founders of the Union 
     <lb/>
     were not without some foundation. The 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Constitution which is submitted 
     <lb/>
      to us is also a compromise, but a compro<lb break="no"/>mise in the best conditions of existence, and 
     <lb/>
     in those least dangerous to the stability and 
     <lb/>
     the strength of the nation to which it is to 
     <lb/>
     give being. Unity moves more at ease, and 
     <lb/>
     the checks placed therein for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     the sections are placed in such a manner as 
     <lb/>
     not to obstruct the general action. It is not 
     <lb/>
     so much against the Federal principle that 
     <lb/>
     the greater number of the arguments of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Hochelaga are directed. 
     <lb/>
     For him it is a party question which he puts 
     <lb/>
     to himself in this manner :—" How shall we 
     <lb/>
     find ourselves, my friends and myself, in this  
     <lb/>
     Confederation ? Shall we be strong or weak ? 
     <lb/>
     May we hope to regain power, or shall we be 
     <lb/>
     lost like so many drops of water in the 
     <lb/>
     ocean ?" In order to convince the House 
     <lb/>
     that I have correctly appreciated the motive 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman's (Hon. Mr. DORION'S) 
     <lb/>
     opposition, I shall quote from his speech of 
     <lb/>
     the l6th inst. :—

          Hon. Mr.  DORION—But, sir, I may be asked, 
     <lb/>
     admitting all that—admitting that the scheme 
     <lb/>
     now submitted to us is not that which has been 
     <lb/>
     promised us, what  difference will the immediate 
     <lb/>
     admission of the Provinces into the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     make ? I will try to explain it. When the 
     <lb/>
     ministers consented to the votes in the Conference 
     <lb/>
     being taken by provinces, they gave a great ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to the Maritime Provinces. This mode 
     <lb/>
     of procedure had for its result the most conserva<lb break="no"/>tive measure that was ever submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     House. The members of the Upper House are 
     <lb/>
     no longer to be elected, but nominated—and by 
     <lb/>
     whom ? By a Tory or Conservative Government 
     <lb/>
     for Canada, by a Conservative Government in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, by a Conservative Government in 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, and by a Conservative

     Government in Newfoundland, the only Liberal 
     <lb/>
     Government concerned in the nomination of the 
     <lb/>
     Upper House being that of New Brunswick, where 
     <lb/>
     there is a Liberal Administration, whose fate 
     <lb/>
     depends on the result of the elections now taking 
     <lb/>
     place in that province. A similar scheme would 
     <lb/>
     never have been adopted by the Liberal members 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada, the people of which section, 
     <lb/>
     to the number of 1,400,000, with those in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Province, making in all 2,500,000, have 
     <lb/>
     been controlled by the 900,000 people of the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. Have we not been told in 
     <lb/>
     set terms that it was the Lower Provinces which 
     <lb/>
     did not want an elective Legislative Council ? If, 
     <lb/>
     instead of inviting to a Conference the delegates 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Provinces, our Government had 
     <lb/>
     done what it engaged to do, namely— had itself 
     <lb/>
     prepared a Constitution, it would never have 
     <lb/>
     dared to draw up a proposal like this now laid 
     <lb/>
     before us ; it would never have proposed a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council nominated for 1ife,  with a limited 
     <lb/>
     membership, and which has to be named by four 
     <lb/>
     Tory Governments. Reckoning 15 to 20 years, 
     <lb/>
     as the average of the time each Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Councillor will hold his seat, a century would 
     <lb/>
     elapse before its composition could be entirely 
     <lb/>
     changed ! We will have, thus, a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council lasting for ever—at least as regards this, 
     <lb/>
     and the next generation—controlled by the in<lb break="no"/>fluence which  today preponderates in our Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and in those of the  Maritime Provinces ; 
     <lb/>
     and are we going to believe, as the present docu<lb break="no"/>ment promises us, that a government like that 
     <lb/>
     which we possess now, will employ itself in get<lb break="no"/>ting the Qpposition represented in the Legislative  
     <lb/>
     Council ? (Hear, hear, and laughter.) I thank 
     <lb/>
     the delegates for their  solicitude as regards the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, but I rely but little on their promises. 
     <lb/>
      Did we not hear the  Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West say the other day, turning towards his sup<lb break="no"/>porters : " If I had the recommending of the 
     <lb/>
     nominations, I would advise the choice of the 
     <lb/>
     most qualified—but of course, of my own party. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It would be done in this way, sir ; 
     <lb/>
     and, if this precious scheme is put into operation, 
     <lb/>
     we shall have a Legislative Council divided in the 
     <lb/>
     following manner : for Upper Canada, we shall 
     <lb/>
     probably have Liberals in the proportion of 3 to 
     <lb/>
     9, for I suppose that the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford (Honorable Mr. BROWN) has made 
     <lb/>
     enough sacrifices to deserve at least this conces<lb break="no"/>sion, and as his friends constitute a fourth of the 
     <lb/>
     Executive Council, I suppose we shall have also 
     <lb/>
     one-fourth of the  Executive Councillors for Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Liberals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:MACD1">Hon. Attorney General MACDONALD</persName>—Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">Hon. Mr.  HOLTON</persName>—25 Exactly 25 per cent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:DORI1">Hon. Mr. DORION</persName>—Yes; precisely 25 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     Besides, we shall have for Nova Scotia ten Con<lb break="no"/>servatives, from Prince Edward Island four 
     <lb/>
     more, and four from Newfoundland. Thus we 
     <lb/>
     are to have eighteen Conservatives from the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, who, added to the thirty-six 
     <lb/>
     from Canada, will make fifty-four Conservatives, 
     <lb/>
     against twenty-two Liberals, supposing that the ten 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
          
     Legislative Councillors from New Brunswick will 
     <lb/>
     all be Liberals. Now, supposing that the average 
     <lb/>
     of deaths amounted to three per cent. in a year, it 
     <lb/>
     would need a term of thirty years to bring about a 
     <lb/>
     change in the character of the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, taking it for granted that the additions 
     <lb/>
     which might be made to it would be taken from 
     <lb/>
     the ranks of the Liberal party. Yet that would 
     <lb/>
     be scarcely possible. In some of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces there would be from time to time Con<lb break="no"/>servative Governments, and there might be also 
     <lb/>
     a Conservative Government in Canada. (Hear,  
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) And the present gen<lb break="no"/>eration will have passed away before the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of the Liberal party will have any in<lb break="no"/>fluence in the divisions of the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. MACKENZIE</persName> —That makes no difference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:DORI1">Hon. Mr. DORION</persName>—The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Lambton says that makes no difference ! The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member is ready to accept everything. 
     <lb/>
     but for those who are not so well disposed the 
     <lb/>
     difference would be that we would be bound by 
     <lb/>
     this constitution which will permit the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council to throw obstacles in the way of all  
     <lb/>
     measures of reform wished for by the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party. If the hon. member for Lambton thinks 
     <lb/>
     that that makes no diflerence, I will take the 
     <lb/>
     liberty of differing from him, and I think that 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party generally will differ from him 
     <lb/>
     also. The Government told us that they were 
     <lb/>
     obliged to consent to the introduction of certain 
     <lb/>
     measures in the project of Confederation which 
     <lb/>
     did not altogether please them, so as to come to 
     <lb/>
     an understanding with the Lower Province dele<lb break="no"/>gates, and that they bound themselves to cause  
     <lb/>
     the scheme to be adopted by this House without 
     <lb/>
     amendment. Does the hon. gentleman not see a 
     <lb/>
     difference now ? If the two Canadas were the 
     <lb/>
     only interested parties, the majority would act 
     <lb/>
     as they pleased, would examine minutely the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, and erase all measures which did 
     <lb/>
     not suit them, and a proposition such as that 
     <lb/>
     relative to the Legislative Council would have no 
     <lb/>
     chance of being adopted—it is too short a time 
     <lb/>
     ago since this House voted, by a crushing 
     <lb/>
     majority, the substitution of an elective Council 
     <lb/>
     for a Council nominated by the Crown. In fact, 
     <lb/>
     the Council named by the Crown had so fallen in 
     <lb/>
     public estimation—I do not say so on account of the 
     <lb/>
     men who composed it, but still such was the fact, 
     <lb/>
     that it exercised no influence ; it was even difficult 
     <lb/>
     to assemble a quorum of members—a change 
     <lb/>
     had become absolutely necessary, and up to the 
     <lb/>
     present time the elective system has worked well 
     <lb/>
     —the elected members are equal in every respect  
     <lb/>
     to those nominated by the Crown. Well, it is 
     <lb/>
     just as public attention commences to be bestowed 
     <lb/>
     upon the  proceedings of the Upper House, that 
     <lb/>
     we are to change its constitution to give it the 
     <lb/>
     place of the same one we so short a time ago 
     <lb/>
     condemned. I said same Constitution—I mis<lb break="no"/>take, Mr. SPEAKER, we want to substitute for the 
     <lb/>
     present Constitution one much worse than the 
     <lb/>
     old one, and one for which it is impossible to find 
     <lb/>
     a precedent.

     Here, then, is the solution of the enigma; 
     <lb/>
     here, then, is the reason why Federal union 
     <lb/>
     is worthless—without us there is no country 
     <lb/>
       —it is no longer the doctrine: <hi rendition="simple:italic">"Let the country 
     <lb/>
     perish rather than a principle be abandoned,"</hi> 
     <lb/>
     but, <hi rendition="simple:italic">"let the country perish rather than a polit<lb break="no"/>ical party should succumb"</hi>. It is less absurd, 
     <lb/>
     but at the same time less noble, and if it be 
     <lb/>
     not cynical in words, it is so undoubtedly in 
     <lb/>
     conception. (Hear, hear.) What ! must we 
     <lb/>
     resist in future all progress, all strength and 
     <lb/>
    national greatness, solely because a party, 
     <lb/>which exhausted itself almost at its birth, 
     <lb/>thinks it cannot discern in the new order of 
     <lb/>things the stepping stones to power? But 
     <lb/>is it our fault that the doctrines and the acts 
     <lb/>of that party are not in accordance with the 
     <lb/>feelings of the country, and that the country 
     <lb/>persists in discountenancing them? The hon. 
     <lb/>member for Hochelaga would hope more for 
     <lb/>his party in a Confederation of the two 
     <lb/>Canadas only; he has said to himself, no doubt, 
     <lb/>"In this last order of things the increase 
     <lb/>of the Upper Canadian representation would 
     <lb/>augment the Radical majority of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada, and that majority, added to the 
     <lb/>small minority I command, would have 
     <lb/>placed me in a position to rule Lower Canada 
     <lb/>as I have already done, against its will, and 
     <lb/>in spite of my former declarations." Either 
     <lb/>he must think us very blind, or else he 
     <lb/>must expect that placing the question in 
     <lb/>a party point of view, he would rally around 
     <lb/>him only those who, leaving aside all na<lb break="no"/>tional sentiments, follow him nevertheless. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) But the extract which I 
     <lb/>have just now read brings us naturally to 
     <lb/>the question of an elective Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, to which system the honorable member 
     <lb/>for Hochelaga grants a great degree of 
     <lb/>superiority over the nominative one. Just 
     <lb/>now he told us that the Council nominated 
     <lb/>by the Crown had fallen into imbecility, 
     <lb/>and had lost public respect. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Now, to prove how logical he is, he tells us:

     It is true that the House of Lords, Conser<lb break="no"/>vative though it be, finds itself removed from 
     <lb/>
     all popular influence; but its numbers may be 
     <lb/>
     increased upon the recommendation of the respon<lb break="no"/>sible advisers of the Crown, if such a measure 
     <lb/>
     were to become necessary to obtain the concur<lb break="no"/>rence of both Houses, or to prevent a collision 
     <lb/>
     between them. The position which its members 
     <lb/>
     occupy in it establishes a sort of compromise 
     <lb/>
     between the Crown and the popular element. 
     <lb/>
     But this new House, after Confederation, will be

     a perfectly independent body; its members will

     Be kind enough to observe, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     that under the old system, the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council possessed the same elements of 
     <lb/>
     existence as the House of Lords, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Crown could increase its numbers at 
     <lb/>
     need; it augmented it in 1849, as it threat<lb break="no"/>ened to augment the House of Lords in 
     <lb/>
     1832. Observe, again, that it is precisely 
     <lb/>
     this control exercised by the Crown over 
     <lb/>
     the Upper House that the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     found so fatal to legislation previous to 1856. 
     <lb/>
     But there is a more rational manner of 
     <lb/>
     appreciating the part sustained by the House 
     <lb/>
     of Lords in the British Constitution. No 
     <lb/>
     one denies to the Sovereign the abstract 
     <lb/>
     right of increasing at will the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords; but such right has never been exer<lb break="no"/>cised but for the purpose of rewarding men 
     <lb/>
     distinguished for great national services? 
     <lb/>
     and when, in 1832, WILLIAM IV. granted 
     <lb/>
     Earl GREY the tremendous power to swamp 
     <lb/>
     the representative body of the great landed 
     <lb/>
     nobility, it was because the country was 
     <lb/>
     moving with rapid strides towards revolu<lb break="no"/>tion, and because there remained to the 
     <lb/>
     Sovereign but two alternatives, either to 
     <lb/>
     lessen the moral weight of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords, or to see his own throne knocked to 
     <lb/>
     pieces from under his feet. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     To convince the House that I do not exag<lb break="no"/>gerate, I will read an extract from LINGARD'S 
     <lb/>
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">History of England</hi> :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     It is known that justice and common sense 
     <lb/>
     were wounded by the electoral system of England, 
     <lb/>
     when such a rock, such a building, such a hamlet 
     <lb/>
     belonging to noble families sent representatives 
     <lb/>
     to Parliament, where cities of 100,000 inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants were not represented, where corporations 
     <lb/>
     of twenty or thirty individuals had a right to elect 
     <lb/>
     members for large cities, and so forth. All this 
     <lb/>
     was the consequence of a social order, founded 
     <lb/>
     on privilege, and in which preperty was the mis<lb break="no"/>tress of all power. To reform the electoral 
     <lb/>
     system was then to make an attempt not only on 
     <lb/>
    the Constitution, but society. And the Tories 
     <lb/>offered a desperate resistance. Such was their 
     <lb/>attitude, that the Ministry proclaimed Parliament 
     <lb/>dissolved on the 11th May, 1831, a course which 
     <lb/>was joyfully welcomed by the people. New elec<lb break="no"/>tions were bad and results in a ministerial 
     <lb/>majority. The Reform Bill was adopted by the 
     <lb/>Commons, but the House of Lords threw it out 
     <lb/>by a majority of forty-one votes. The intel<lb break="no"/>ligence o this result was received throughout the 
     <lb/>three kingdom with the most lively agitation.

     Petitions were sent in from all parts, praying for the 
     <lb/>
     upholding of the Ministry, and for a new creation 
     <lb/>
     of peers; reform associations were formed, and 
     <lb/>
     serious disturbances took place at London, Bris<lb break="no"/>tol, Nottingha  &amp;c. Parliament was prorogued, 
     <lb/>
     and at its re-assembling the Reform Bill was 
     <lb/>
     again presented with some alterations. The 
     <lb/>
     Commons accepted it; it passed a first and a second 
     <lb/>
     reading in the House of Lords, but the third 
     <lb/>
     reading was adjourned, and WELLINGTON and 
     <lb/>
     seventy-four peers protested. Agitation became 
     <lb/>
     almost universal ; societies met, petitions took a 
     <lb/>
     threatening character ; everything was tending 
     <lb/>
     towards armed insurrection. England never 
     <lb/>
     before presented such a spectacle. Meantime 
     <lb/>
     the Ministry had demanded of the king a new 
     <lb/>
     creation of peers to change the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     Upper Chamber. It was refused,—they immediate<lb break="no"/>ly resigned on the 9th May, 1832. The Duke of 
     <lb/>
     WELLINGTON and his friends were then called in 
     <lb/>
     to form a Ministry ; he tried it several days in 
     <lb/>
     vain. The nation was astir ; whole armies were 
     <lb/>
     being created ; riots broke out everywhere ; the 
     <lb/>
     lives of the principal Tories were threatened, and 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons seemed disposed to sup<lb break="no"/>port a measure which would have overturned 
     <lb/>
     both the Government and the aristocracy. The 
     <lb/>
     King called back the GREY Ministry, and the 
     <lb/>
     Bill was presented to the House of Lords for a 
     <lb/>
     third reading, on which the Tories, knowing that 
     <lb/>
     the Cabinet had decided to create an unlimited 
     <lb/>
     number of peers, so as to obtain a majority, 
     <lb/>
     abstained from attending the discussion, and the 
     <lb/>
     Bill passed by 106 votes against 22. The Par<lb break="no"/>liament was immediately dissolved, and new elec<lb break="no"/>tions took place according to the new electoral 
     <lb/>
     law, and on the 5th of February, 1833, the first 
     <lb/>
     Reformed Parliament was opened.

     It must then have been a real revolution, 
     <lb/>
     this nomination of one hundred new peers. 
     <lb/>
     a revolution as real as that which menaced 
     <lb/>
     the Throne ; and do we not feel persuaded 
     <lb/>
     that if one day our Federal Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council were to place itself obstinately and 
     <lb/>
     systematically in opposition to popular will, 
     <lb/>
     matured and strengthened by ordeals, it 
     <lb/>
     would not be swept away by a revolutionary 
     <lb/>
     torrent such as threatened to sweep away 
     <lb/>
     the House of Lords in 1832 ? This Council, 
     <lb/>
     limited as to numbers, because the provinces 
     <lb/>
     insist on maintaining in it an equilibrium 
     <lb/>
     without which they would never have con<lb break="no"/>sented to a union, this Council, sprung from 
     <lb/>
     the people—having the same wants, hopes 
     <lb/>
     and even passions, would resist less the pop<lb break="no"/>ular will in America, where it is so prompt 
     <lb/>
     and active, than could the House of Lords 
     <lb/>
     in England, where the masses are inert be<lb break="no"/>cause they have not political rights ; reason 
     <lb/>
     tells us thus because they would be a 
     <lb/>
     less powerful body socially or politically. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member for Hochelaga has 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
 
     spoken to us of the elected senate of Bel<lb break="no"/>gium, which he says works admirably. But 
     <lb/>
     let us examine the manner of its construc<lb break="no"/>tion and the reasons of its organization. We 
     <lb/>
     find in a note under the 53rd article of the 
     <lb/>
     Belgian Constitution, section 2 of the Senate 
     <lb/>
    in: HAVARD'S <hi rendition="simple:italic">Public and Administrative 
     <lb/>
     Law,</hi> vol. I :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
    89. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Elected by the People.</hi>—Three principal 
     <lb/>
     Opinions divided the Congress on the question of 
     <lb/>
     the senate. One wanted no kind of senate. 
     <lb/>
     Another wished the senate named with or with<lb break="no"/>out conditions, by the head of the state ; and 
     <lb/>
     another wished for the senate but elected by the 
     <lb/>
     people. These two last opinions carried the exis<lb break="no"/>tence of the Chamber to be admitted, but it was 
     <lb/>
     difficult to fix the majority on the mode of nomi<lb break="no"/>nating the senators. Among the members who 
     <lb/>
     desire a senate, the greater number sustained 
     <lb/>
     nomination by the king, as being more in harmony 
     <lb/>
     with the nature of the institution ; but those who 
     <lb/>
     wished only one Chamber directly elected being 
     <lb/>
     in despair, and in order to popularize an institu<lb break="no"/>tion which they accused of not being sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     so, joined with those favoring senators elect, 
     <lb/>
     named without the intervention of the royal 
     <lb/>
     power, so that this opinion prevailed. The 
     <lb/>
     senate and its mode of existence was not, there<lb break="no"/>fore, the result either of the same opinion or of 
     <lb/>
     the same majority. The central section proposed, 
     <lb/>
     with a majority of sixteen against four, nomina<lb break="no"/>tion by the king without presentation and in un<lb break="no"/>limited number. The question was discussed at 
     <lb/>
     the sitting of the 15th, 16th and 17th December. 
     <lb/>
     Nomination by the king was rejected by 96 
     <lb/>
     against 77. Two leading opinions still divided 
     <lb/>
     the partisans of election. One would confide it 
     <lb/>
     to the ordinary electoral colleges, and others to 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Council or States. " We desire," 
     <lb/>
     said M. BLARGNIES in proposing the last mode 
     <lb/>
     of election "a neutral power which can resist the 
     <lb/>
     dangers which might result from the preponder<lb break="no"/>ance of the head of the state or from an elective 
     <lb/>
     Chamber. It is, therefore, necessary that this 
     <lb/>
     power should emanate neither from the same 
     <lb/>
     elements as the elective Chamber, nor from the 
     <lb/>
     chief of the state." To confide election to a parti<lb break="no"/>cular class, was said on the other side, is to create 
     <lb/>
     privileged electors with a double vote, and to in<lb break="no"/>troduce into our country all the inconveniences 
     <lb/>
     of the division of electors which has just been 
     <lb/>
     abolished in France. Provincial Councils should, 
     <lb/>
     moreover, be administrative bodies. The system 
     <lb/>
     of article 53 was adapted by 136 votes against 
     <lb/>
     40. The opinion which was in favor of only 
     <lb/>
     one Chamber, and consequently only one mode of 
     <lb/>
     election, determined the majority.

     Thus we find that the constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     senate is a compromise similar to that of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government of the United States. 
     <lb/>
     But let us go on a little further :—

     Is not this last provision of the Belgian

     Constitution a hundred times more con<lb break="no"/>servative than all the provisions of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, which the honorable member con<lb break="no"/>demns ? What !  No one can be a senator 
     <lb/>
     in Belgium without paying $500 direct

     taxes, over and above indirect taxes, muni<lb break="no"/>cipal and local impositions of all sorts.

     calls that a popular House ! Who but men

         <persName ref="pers:DORI1">Hon. Mr. DORION</persName>—What is the quali<lb break="no"/>fication of the electors of the Belgian House

     <lb/>
     against the honorable member ; for if, in a 
     <lb/>
     country like Belgium, in which every fourth 
     <lb/>
     person you meet is a beggar, it has been 
     <lb/>
     found requisite to make the elective franchise 
     <lb/>
     and the electoral qualification of the senators 
     <lb/>
     so high, it is a proof that he has made a 
     <lb/>
     bad selection of examples ;  it is a proof that 
     <lb/>
     the tendencies of Belgium are conservative. 
     <lb/>
     Why, then, should we adopt another course

         <persName ref="pers:EVAN1">Hon. Mr. EVANTUREL</persName>—Will the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montmorency allow 
     <lb/>
     me to interrupt him in his argument 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the qualifications and ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of the legislative councillors. 
     <lb/>
     Like him, I am quite of opinion that the con<lb break="no"/>servative element ought, of necessity, to be 
     <lb/>
     the basis of the Legislative Council, to coun<lb break="no"/>terbalance the popular element. This princi<lb break="no"/>ple governed the constitution of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords in England, that of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council in Belgium, and that of every well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     organized representative government. It is 
     <lb/>
     that element of conservatism which I desire 
     <lb/>
     to see introduced into the Constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation now before us ; but the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Montmorency will allow 
     <lb/>
     me to remark that the whole of his argument 
     <lb/>
     applies only to the antagonism which might 
     <lb/>
     arise between the two branches of the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, in a monarchical government like that of 
     <lb/>
     Belgium, which is not based on a Federative 
     <lb/>
     system like that now submitted to us by the 
     <lb/>
     Government. But we have not only to avoid 
     <lb/>
     the differences which might arise between 
     <lb/>
     the conservative and the popular elements ; 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     we have also to protect the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     several provinces which are to form part 
     <lb/>
     of the proposed Confederation. That is 
     <lb/>
     the all important question we have to con<lb break="no"/>sider. We have accorded the principle of 
     <lb/>
     representation based upon poulation in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons of the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that is without doubt a great sacri<lb break="no"/>fice ; but we ought only to make so important 
     <lb/>
     a concession on the condition that we shall 
     <lb/>
     have equality of representation in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council, and the right reserved to our<lb break="no"/>selves to appoint our twenty-four legislative 
     <lb/>
     councillors, in order that they may be respon<lb break="no"/>sible to the public opinion of the province and 
     <lb/>
     independent of the Federal Government.— 
     <lb/>
     Without this essential guarantee I affirm that 
     <lb/>
     the rights of Lower Canada are in danger. 
     <lb/>
     For my part I am ready, on behalf of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, to give up her right to elect directly 
     <lb/>
     her twenty-four legislative councillors, al<lb break="no"/>though the retention of the elective principle 
     <lb/>
     might perhaps be the surest means of pre<lb break="no"/>serving our institutions ; but I am anxious 
     <lb/>
     that the new Constitution now proposed 
     <lb/>
     should give us adequate guarantees that the 
     <lb/>
     legislative councillors to be appointed for 
     <lb/>
     life should, at all events, be selected by the 
     <lb/>
     Local Government of Lower Canada, which 
     <lb/>
     would be responsible to the  people. These 
     <lb/>
     not ill-grounded sources of anxiety I should 
     <lb/>
     like to see removed. I would bespeak the 
     <lb/>
     earnest attention of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency to this point, which is of the 
     <lb/>
     very highest importance to us Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>dians ; and I hope that he will pardon me for 
     <lb/>
     having interrupted him, and that he will be 
     <lb/>
     in a position to give me such an answer as 
     <lb/>
     will dissipate the anxiety which I am aware 
     <lb/>
     has been evinced on this subject. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         Hon. Mr. CAUCHON—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has not understood me ; my object 
     <lb/>
     has not been to attack the representative system 
     <lb/>
     of Belgium as being too conservative ; on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary I use it as an argument in my favor, 
     <lb/>
     because the qualification there is so high, that 
     <lb/>
     hardly one in six thousand can be found who 
     <lb/>
     can aspire to the post of senator. Parties 
     <lb/>
     having been unable to come to any under<lb break="no"/>standing at the time of the revolution of 
     <lb/>
     1830, and neither the hereditary peerage or the 
     <lb/>
     life peerage having been able to prevail, the 
     <lb/>
     most conservative principle next to these was 
     <lb/>
     adopted, viz., that of a  large property qualifi<lb break="no"/>cation. All those who have drawn up consti<lb break="no"/>tutions, either theoretical or for practical pur<lb break="no"/>poses, have never omitted to provide counter<lb break="no"/>poises to prevent, on the one hand, too 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="570" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0570.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">570</fw>
            
     precipitate and hasty legislation, and on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand the encroachment of the 
     <lb/>
     power of the executive. In our Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion it is the duty of the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     to exercise the conservative influence, and to 
     <lb/>
     modify the legislation too energetic and too 
     <lb/>
     full of outside effervescence, which is sent for 
     <lb/>
     their consideration from the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. But when public opinion gains vigor 
     <lb/>
     from the obstacles which it encounters, and 
     <lb/>
     the reforms demanded are rational and come 
     <lb/>
     before them in due course, there is no danger 
     <lb/>
     that the legislation which embodies them will be 
     <lb/>
     obstructed in its progress ; for the people will 
     <lb/>
     rise in their majesty and in their sense of jus<lb break="no"/>tice, as did the people of England in 1832, 
     <lb/>
     and the obstacles they might meet with on 
     <lb/>
     their way would be swept away as by a tor<lb break="no"/>rent. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—That is exactly 
     <lb/>
     where the danger lies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—That is the 
     <lb/>
     danger which assailed the House of Lords in 
     <lb/>
     1832, but no one would venture to confront to 
     <lb/>
     the last extremity a danger such as this. 
     <lb/>
    But the honorable member for Quebec tells us, 
     <lb/>if I understand him rightly, that we have not 
     <lb/>sufficient guarantees for Lower Canada in 
     <lb/>the appointment of the legislative councillors. 
     <lb/>The selection of legislative councillors has 
     <lb/>no bearing whatever on the question we 
     <lb/>are now considering, viz., whether the 
     <lb/>appointment by the Crown is or is not pre<lb break="no"/>ferable to the elective principle. But in an<lb break="no"/>swer to him I will say, that the scheme be<lb break="no"/>fore us seems to be quite clear. According 
     <lb/>to this plan the candidates for the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council will be recommended by the local 
     <lb/>governments and appointed by the General 
     <lb/>Government, and it is by this very division of 
     <lb/>powers that the selections are sure to be good, 
     <lb/>and made in conformity with the desire and 
     <lb/>sentiments of the provinces. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Only the first nom<lb break="no"/>inations are to be made in this manner, not

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—The first nomin<lb break="no"/>ations will be made by the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ments, and the federal councillors will be

     to the number prescribed, 24, provided so

     many can be found who will accept the post, 
     <lb/>
     and who possess the requisite property quali<lb break="no"/>fication. The Conference has engaged, by

     the terms of the scheme, to respect the rights

     there is no conservativc principle to guaran<lb break="no"/>tee that the provinces will be represented in 
     <lb/>
     that Council, and he does so with justice. If 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Montmorenci will 
     <lb/>
     examine it attentively, he will see that the first 
     <lb/>
     nominations are to be made by the existing 
     <lb/>
     governments. Thus the Government of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, that of New Brunswick and that of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia will appoint legislative council<lb break="no"/>lors, but afterwards the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     will make the appointments. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Quebec can, with reason, draw 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that there is no guarantee that 
     <lb/>
     the views of the provinces will be respected. 
     <lb/>
     I for my part have investigated the matter, 
     <lb/>
     more in connection with the power that will 
     <lb/>
     be vested in the legislative councillors. I 
     <lb/>
     asserted that by appointing them for life and 
     <lb/>
     limiting their number, an absolute authority 
     <lb/>
     would created, which would be quite be<lb break="no"/>yond the control of the people and even of the 
     <lb/>Executive ; that the power of this body will be 
     <lb/>so great, that they will always be in a position 
     <lb/>to prevent every reform if they thought pro<lb break="no"/>per, and that a collision between the two 
     <lb/>branches would be inevitable and irremediable. 
     <lb/>The danger arising from the creating of such 
     <lb/>a power is exactly that of being obliged to des<lb break="no"/>troy it if they resist too obstinately the popu<lb break="no"/>lar demands. In England there is no neces<lb break="no"/>sity for breaking down the obstructions some<lb break="no"/>times presented by the House of Lords, 
     <lb/>because the Crown having it in its power to 
     <lb/>appoint new peers, can overcome the difficulty. 
     <lb/>Here there will be no means of doing it, when 
     <lb/>the number of councillors is fixed. Accord<lb break="no"/>ingly, I have looked at the question through 
     <lb/>the medium of the powers assigned to the 
     <lb/>councillors, whereas the honorable member for 
     <lb/>the county of Quebec fears lest the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should make choice of men who would 
     <lb/>not represent public opinion in the provinces ;  
     <lb/>that they might appoint members all of French  
     <lb/>origin or all of English origin to represent 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, or take them all from among 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">571</fw>
          
     a class of men who would not represent the 
     <lb/>
     province for which they are appointed, and 
     <lb/>
     who could give no pledge that they would 
     <lb/>
     maintain its institutions.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—It is evi<lb break="no"/>dent that the honorable member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga has not read the resolutions ; but I have 
     <lb/>
     read them. Lower Canada is in a peculiar 
     <lb/>
     position. We have two races of people whose 
     <lb/>
     interests are distinct from each other in 
     <lb/>
     respect to origin, language and religion. In 
     <lb/>
     preparing the business of the Confederation at 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, we had to conciliate these two inter<lb break="no"/>ests, and to give the country a Constitution 
     <lb/>
     which might reconcile the conservative with 
     <lb/>
     the democratic element ; for the weak point in 
     <lb/>
     democratic institutions is the leaving of all 
     <lb/>
     power in the hands of the popular element. 
     <lb/>
     The history of the past proves that this is an 
     <lb/>
     evil. In order that institutions may be stable 
     <lb/>
     and work harmoniously, there must be a power 
     <lb/>
     of resistance to oppose to the democratic ele<lb break="no"/>ment. In the United States the power of 
     <lb/>
     resistance does not reside in the Senate, nor 
     <lb/>
     even in the President. The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Hochelaga says that the objection of 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for the county of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec is well founded, because the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government may appoint all English or all 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians as legislative councillors for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. If the honorable member had 
     <lb/>
     read the resolutions, he would have found that 
     <lb/>
     the appointments of legislative councillors are 
     <lb/>
     to be made so as to accord with the electoral 
     <lb/>
     divisions now existing in the province. Well, 
     <lb/>
     I ask whether it is probable that the Executive 
     <lb/>
     of the Federal Government, which will have a 
     <lb/>
     chief or leader as it is now—I ask whether it 
     <lb/>
     is very probable that he will recommend the 
     <lb/>
     appointment of a French-Canadian to repre<lb break="no"/>sent divisions like Bedford or Wellington for 
     <lb/>
     Instance ?

     <lb/>
     Canada in making appointments to office in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada. There will be in the Federal

     Government a leader for Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     do you think that the other Ministers will 
     <lb/>
     presume to interfere and intermeddle with his 
     <lb/>
     recommendations ? But I am told that I am

     able to upset the Government if his colleagues

     interfere with his recommendations to office ? 
     <lb/>
     That is our security. At present, if I found

     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName> —— The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga put a question to me 
     <lb/>
     relative to the constitution of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council, and said that he had not looked at 
     <lb/>
     the question, while speaking the other even<lb break="no"/>ing, in the same light as the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for the county of Quebec. He spoke of 
     <lb/>
     the conservatives as a party, and his fear was, 
     <lb/>
     not that the Upper House would not be con<lb break="no"/>servative enough, but that it would be too 
     <lb/>
     much so.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I looked at it both 
     <lb/>
     ways, both as it involved the interests of par<lb break="no"/>ties, and in regard to the power which that 
     <lb/>
     House would exercise from the nature of its 
     <lb/>
     constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—I did not see the 
     <lb/>
     two ways of looking at it. I saw but one. It 
     <lb/>
     is the same idea in a different form. He said 
     <lb/>
     that even if the Lower House were altogether 
     <lb/>
     liberal, the Upper House would remain com<lb break="no"/>posed of conservatives ; this was his fear. He 
     <lb/>
     has been a long while trying to gain predomi<lb break="no"/>nance for his democratic notions, but it is evi<lb break="no"/>dent he will not succeed. I recur to the real 
     <lb/>
     medium through which the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber looks at the question, namely, his fears 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="572" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0572.jpg"/>

     that his party will sink out of sight. In the 
     <lb/>
     present day, parties disappear and become 
     <lb/>
     fused with others, while others arise from 
     <lb/>
     passing events. In New Brunswick, conser<lb break="no"/>vatives join the liberal government to carry 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, and we see no parties there 
     <lb/>
     but the partisans and the opponents of the 
     <lb/>
     union, as in 1788, in the United States, there 
     <lb/>
     were no parties but the adherents of royalty 
     <lb/>
     and those of Federal Government. We see 
     <lb/>
     the same thing in Nova Scotia. This is true 
     <lb/>
     patriotism and the real dignity of public men. 
     <lb/>
     It is unfortunate for us that we do not follow 
     <lb/>
     their example here.

     He may well say so—he who never had a

     everybody expects that. (Continued laughter.)

     I am bound to shew him respect because he 
     <lb/>
     is my senior in this House, my senior by three 
     <lb/>
     years. It is true he has not always repre<lb break="no"/>sented the same county, his brother having 
     <lb/>
     fraternally driven him out of Glengarry, and 
     <lb/>
     obliged him to take refuge in the rotten

     enough to do duty in different camps, we have 
     <lb/>
     not on that account ceased to be good friends. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) I will not look at this question 
     <lb/>
     in a party light, because parties expire, and 
     <lb/>
     we do not know whether in thirty years the 
     <lb/>
     present parties will exist. We ought to look 
     <lb/>
     at the question apart from party considera<lb break="no"/>tions, and on its own merits: that is to say, we 
     <lb/>
     ought to place in the Constitution a counter<lb break="no"/>poise to prevent any party legislation, and to 
     <lb/>
     moderate the precipitancy of any government 
     <lb/>
     which might be disposed to move too fast 
     <lb/>
     and go too far,—I mean a legislative body 
     <lb/>
     able to protect the people against itself and 
     <lb/>
     against the encroachments of power. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) In England, the Crown has never 
     <lb/>
     attempted to degrade the House of Peers by 
     <lb/>
     submerging it, because it knows well that the 
     <lb/>
     nobility are a bulwark against the aggressions 
     <lb/>
     of the democratic element. The House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords, by their power, their territorial posses<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
     sions, and their enormous wealth, are a great 
     <lb/>
     defence against democratic invasion, greater 
     <lb/>
     than anything we can oppose toit in America. 
     <lb/>
     In Canada, as in the rest of North America, 
     <lb/>
     we have not the <hi rendition="simple:italic">castes</hi>—classes of society— 
     <lb/>
     which are found in Europe, and the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, although immutable in 
     <lb/>
     respect of number, inasmuch as all the mem<lb break="no"/>bers belonging to it will come from the ranks 
     <lb/>
     of the people, without leaving them, as do the 
     <lb/>
     members of the House of Commons, will not 
     <lb/>
     be selected from a privileged class which have 
     <lb/>
     no existence. Here all men are alike, and 
     <lb/>
     are all equal; if a difference is to be found, it 
     <lb/>
     arises exclusively from the industry, the in<lb break="no"/>telligence, and the superior education of those 
     <lb/>
     who have labored the most strenuously, or 
     <lb/>
     whom Providence has gifted with the highest 
     <lb/>
     faculties. (Hear, hear.) Long ago the pri<lb break="no"/>vileges of <hi rendition="simple:italic">caste</hi> disappeared in this country. 
     <lb/>
     Most of our ancient nobility left the country 
     <lb/>
     at the conquest, and the greater number of 
     <lb/>
     those who remained have sunk out of sight 
     <lb/>
     by inaction. Accordingly, whom do we see 
     <lb/>
     in the highest offices of state ? The sons of 
     <lb/>
     the poor who have felt the necessity of study, 
     <lb/>
     and who have risen by the aid of their intel<lb break="no"/>lect and hard work. (Hear, hear.) Every<lb break="no"/>thing is democratic with us, because everyone 
     <lb/>
     can attain to everything by the efforts of a 
     <lb/>
     noble ambition. The legislative councillors 
     <lb/>
     appointed by the Crown will not be, there<lb break="no"/>fore, socially speaking, persons superior to the 
     <lb/>
     members of the House of Commons; they 
     <lb/>
     will owe their elevation only to their own 
     <lb/>
     merit. They will live as being of the people 
     <lb/>
     and among the people as we do. How can 
     <lb/>
     it happen, then, that having no advan<lb break="no"/>tage over us greater than that of not 
     <lb/>
     being elected, they will not be subject in a 
     <lb/>
     legitimate degree to the influence of public 
     <lb/>
     opinion? There are some men who have 
     <lb/>
     enough patriotism to approve of everything 
     <lb/>
     done elsewhere, but to find fault with every<lb break="no"/>thing done at home—it is a pitiful crotchet 
     <lb/>
     in the human mind. If there had been as 
     <lb/>
     much danger for the liberal party in this 
     <lb/>
     union as you say there was, would Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     TILLEY, the leader of the Liberal government 
     <lb/>
     of New Brunswick, a man of such foresight and 
     <lb/>
     judgment; would the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford, your former leader, whose talent 
     <lb/>
     and experience you will not deny, have ac<lb break="no"/>cepted it? (Hear, hear.) But look rather 
     <lb/>
     at what is now passing in New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and Nova Scotia; what they have agreed to

     Hon. Mr. TUPPER, the leader of a Conser<lb break="no"/>vative government, and Messrs. ARCHIBALD

     <lb/>
     short-sighted not to see that this new order 
     <lb/>
     of things will produce new combinations 
     <lb/>
     similar to those produced by the American 
     <lb/>
     Constitution of 1788, when the citizens and 
     <lb/>
     public men divided into two camps, the camp 
     <lb/>
     of the supporters of national union and that 
     <lb/>
     of the friends of the state sovereignty. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Let us not then be anxious about the 
     <lb/>
     future of parties. What does it matter to 
     <lb/>
     this country what position the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga or myself may occupy 
     <lb/>
     in this new Constitution ? ( Laughter.) What 
     <lb/>
     matters it to the country if we be above or 
     <lb/>
     below, the first or the last, the victors or the 
     <lb/>
     vanquished, so long as it is happy under the 
     <lb/>
     new rule, and finds happiness, greatness, power 
     <lb/>
     and prosperity in the free development of its 
     <lb/>
     resources and institutions ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The opponents of Confederation do not desire 
     <lb/>
     the union of the provinces for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     military defence ; two and two will always 
     <lb/>
     make four, say they, and in uniting the popu<lb break="no"/>lations of the different provinces, you will not

     give us more strength to resist the common

     enemy, unless, as facetiously remarked the

     honorable member for Lotbinière, we make a

     treaty with the enemy, which would bind him 
     <lb/>
     to attack us at but one place at a time, so as 
     <lb/>
     to allow us to oppose all our forces to the 
     <lb/>
     invasion. Yes, two and two will always 
     <lb/>
     make four. You are right. War between 
     <lb/>
     England and the United States would expose 
     <lb/>
     us in our colonial position to the attacks of the 
     <lb/>
     enemy at all vulnerable points of the re<lb break="no"/>spective provinces. But, firstly, the union 
     <lb/>
     carries with it the construction of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, and that railway which does 
     <lb/>
     not particularly please the two annexationist 
     <lb/>
     leaders of the Opposition, would allow 
     <lb/>
     England and the provinces to transport troops 
     <lb/>
     rapidly from the furthest limits of the country 
     <lb/>
     to the threatened points of the national ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. Without the aid of railways how 
     <lb/>
     could NAPOLEON III. have been able, in a 
     <lb/>
     fortnight, to throw two hundred thousand 
     <lb/>
     men on the plains of Italy, to defeat the 
     <lb/>
     Austrians at Magenta and Solferino, and to 
     <lb/>
     gain one of the bloodiest and most glorious 
     <lb/>
     Victories of modern times ? But in the ad<lb break="no"/>vanced condition of our civilization, our com<lb break="no"/>merce and our manufactures—with so many 
     <lb/>
    elements of greatness, with so many prodi<lb break="no"/>

            <cb/>
 
     gious sources of prosperity and wealth—with 
     <lb/>
     a population of nearly four millions already 
     <lb/>
     —should we have so little ambition as not to 
     <lb/>
     aspire to take our place one day in the 
     <lb/>
     rank of nations ? (Hear, hear.) Shall 
     <lb/>
     we forever remain colonists ? Does the 
     <lb/>
     history of the world afford examples of 
     <lb/>
     eternal subjection? (Hear, hear.) It is 
     <lb/>
     not, for my part, because I do not feel 
     <lb/>
     myself proud and happy under the glorious 
     <lb/>
     flag which protects and shelters in safety one 
     <lb/>
     hundred and fifty millions of souls. It is not 
     <lb/>
     because I do not feel myself free as the bird 
     <lb/>
     of air in the midst of space, under the mighty 
     <lb/>
     segis of the British Empire—a thousand times 
     <lb/>
     more free than I should be, with the name of 
     <lb/>
     citizen, in the grasp of the American Eagle. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and cheers.) But we must not 
     <lb/>
     conceal from ourselves the fact that we are 
     <lb/>
     attracted by two centres of attraction—the 
     <lb/>
     opposing ideas which are developed and which 
     <lb/>
     make war upon each other, even within these 
     <lb/>
     walls, sufficiently attest the fact. Everything 
     <lb/>
     tells us that the day of national emancipation 
     <lb/>
     or of annexation to the United States is ap<lb break="no"/>proaching, and while the statesmen of all par<lb break="no"/>ties in the Empire warn us affectionately to 
     <lb/>
     prepare for the first, a few of our own public 
     <lb/>
     men drive us incessantly towards the second, 
     <lb/>
     by propagating republican ideas, and by en<lb break="no"/>deavoring by all possible means to assimilate 
     <lb/>
     our institutions to those of the neighboring 
     <lb/>
     republic. (Hear, hear.) If we remain iso<lb break="no"/>lated, what will happen at the moment of 
     <lb/>
     separation from the Mother Country ; for 
     <lb/>
     that moment will come, whether we wish 
     <lb/>
     it or wish it not? Each province would 
     <lb/>
     form an independent state, and as to at<lb break="no"/>tack the one would no longer mean to at<lb break="no"/>tack all, inasmuch as we should have ceased 
     <lb/>
     to be the subjects of the same empire, 
     <lb/>
     the United States, if they covet them, would 
     <lb/>
     devour them one by one in their isolated po<lb break="no"/>sition, following therein the able tactics of the 
     <lb/>
     Romans in Asia, Europe and Africa, of the 
     <lb/>
     English in India, and of NAPOLEON, the 
     <lb/>
     greatest warrior of modern times, in Europe. 
     <lb/>
     1 understand that the annexationists insist on 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi> and on isolation ; but others 
     <lb/>
     would be blind did they listen to them, inas<lb break="no"/>much as reason commands them to organize, 
     <lb/>
     so as to be ready when danger comes. If we 
     <lb/>
     are four millions to-day, we shall probably be 
     <lb/>
     eight millions and over then, with proportionate 
     <lb/>
     means of defence, and the alliances which we 
     <lb/>
     would find in the necessity on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     European powers to keep within bounds the 
     <lb/>
     too extensive development of that nation which

            <fw type="num">574</fw>
        
     is now struggling in the horrors of civil war. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Honorable gentlemen do not 
     <lb/>
     desire Confederation, because there must be 
     <lb/>
     an outlay for its defence. But are those, who 
     <lb/>
     argue thus, logical ? If two and two did not 
     <lb/>
     make more than four a moment ago, why 
     <lb/>
     would they make five now ? If each province, 
     <lb/>
     standing in an isolated position, would be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to expend money to organize the 
     <lb/>
     defence of its territory, why would the com<lb break="no"/>bination of all these various outlays in 
     <lb/>
     Confederation amount to more than the total 
     <lb/>
     of these same expenses otherwise added up ? 
     <lb/>
     Would this be the case because a single 
     <lb/>
     organization ought to be, necessarily, less ex<lb break="no"/>pensive than six distinct commands ? The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Hochelaga has exag<lb break="no"/>gerated the expenses of the Confederation, as 
     <lb/>
     he has everything else ; as he exaggerated 
     <lb/>
     and perverted, the other day, the words of the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—And besides this, the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces have to be paid to come 
     <lb/>
     into the Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—That question 
     <lb/>
     will naturally come up in its turn. But it is 
     <lb/>
     not the less true that all the provinces come 
     <lb/>
     into the Confederation on an equal footing, as 
     <lb/>
     their debt is placed in equilibrium ; and as, 
     <lb/>
     for the purposes of the union, the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     is strictly based on the total population of 
     <lb/>
     each of them. On a previous occasion, as I 
     <lb/>
     have elsewhere quoted, the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Hochelaga stated that the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces did not choose our alliance, because our 
     <lb/>
     debt was too great. Now he does not choose 
     <lb/>
     their alliance, because he is afraid we shall 
     <lb/>
     have to pay for them. Now that the debt is 
     <lb/>
     perfectly equal, in proportion to the total 
     <lb/>
     population, and the Conference has so equal<lb break="no"/>ized it in order to found Confederation on 
     <lb/>
     justice, the Atlantic Provinces consent to the 
     <lb/>
     union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—What provinces 
     <lb/>
     are those ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—I allude to New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and Newfoundland, and I am 
     <lb/>
     convinced that the decision of those two 
     <lb/>
     provinces will sufficiently influence Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia to cause her to resolve to come into 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation. The Nova Scotian news<lb break="no"/>papers, even those of them which are most 
     <lb/>
     hostile to the scheme, acknowledge that that 
     <lb/>
     province cannot remain isolated ; and accord<lb break="no"/>ingly she awaits the result of the elections 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick before taking action. In 
     <lb/>
     the meantime the journals in question are 
     <lb/>
     making incredible exertions to prevail upon 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     New Brunswick to refuse the great Confe<lb break="no"/>deration, because they wish for another and 
     <lb/>
     a smaller one, that of the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces alone. Another motive which will 
     <lb/>
     induce Nova Scotia to accept the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec Conference, if New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     should declare herself in favor of it, is that 
     <lb/>
     the terminus of the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>
     would be fixed at St. John instead of at 
     <lb/>
     Halifax ; and what would become of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia so isolated ? She would not consent 
     <lb/>
     to it ; her writers and her statesmen positively 
     <lb/>
     assert it. For our part, we require an out<lb break="no"/>let upon the Atlantic seaboard, and that we 
     <lb/>
     can only have by means of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) To those who cherish differ<lb break="no"/>ent ideas, I can conceive that this matter is 
     <lb/>
     not one of equal importance, for they wish 
     <lb/>
     to fix their terminus at another point on the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic seaboard. (Hear, hear.) I feel 
     <lb/>
     that I have already spoken at length, and I 
     <lb/>
     have yet some important points of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme to examine. I will not, then, enter 
     <lb/>
     into calculations of figures to prove the 
     <lb/>
     extravagance and absurdity of those of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Hochelaga, preferring, 
     <lb/>
     moreover, to leave them in the more skilful 
     <lb/>
     and powerful hands of the Hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance. I shall content myself with telling 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Hochelaga—and that 
     <lb/>
     will suffice for myself as well as for the 
     <lb/>
     House and the country—that I prefer Con<lb break="no"/>federation with its prospects of expense, to 
     <lb/>
     annexation to the United States with an 
     <lb/>
     actual debt of close upon three thousand 
     <lb/>
     millions, and with an annual tax of five hun<lb break="no"/>dred millions of dollars. The 34th paragraph 
     <lb/>
     of the 29th clause of the scheme reads 
     <lb/>
     thus : " The establishment of a General 
     <lb/>
     Court of Appeal for the Federated Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces." What is the object—what will be 
     <lb/>
     the character of the tribunal ? These two 
     <lb/>
     questions will naturally present themselves 
     <lb/>
     to those who have given any attention to 
     <lb/>
     that part of the scheme which refers to the 
     <lb/>
     civil and criminal law, and the working of 
     <lb/>
     the judiciary. The whole of the clauses 
     <lb/>
     which refer to the latter are as complete as 
     <lb/>
     the most ardent supporters of union could 
     <lb/>
     desire, tempered by the few exceptions by 
     <lb/>
     means of which the provinces have wished 
     <lb/>
     to shelter their local institutions from 
     <lb/>
     attack. (Cheers.) To convince the House 
     <lb/>
     of this, I need but read the following :—

     The evident object of this organization is 
     <lb/>
     to reassure the Protestant minority of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada against any apprehension for the 
     <lb/>
     future ; it is also perhaps in the interest of 
     <lb/>
     national unity, to prevent local parliaments 
     <lb/>
     and governments from infringing the attri<lb break="no"/>butes of the Central Parliament. The 
     <lb/>
     nomination of judges, the veto, the reserva<lb break="no"/>tion and even certain directions to be found 
     <lb/>
     in the project itself, tend to the same end, 
     <lb/>
     and must necessarily attain it. I see nothing 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     wrong in that, provided that this formidable 
     <lb/>
     engine in going out of its course does not 
     <lb/>
     crush the rights which we are bound to res<lb break="no"/>pect and maintain forever in their integrity. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I am not of the same opinion 
     <lb/>
     as the hon. member for Brome, who pretends 
     <lb/>
     to see in those clauses that the judges would 
     <lb/>
     be under two masters at the same time. If 
     <lb/>
     they could possibly be controlled at all, it 
     <lb/>
     would be by the Federal Government, which 
     <lb/>
     alone will appoint them, pay them, and have 
     <lb/>
     the power of dismissing them in certain 
     <lb/>
     cases. There is no anomaly here, because 
     <lb/>
     one thing follows another ; all are linked 
     <lb/>
     together and harmonize perfectly . If any<lb break="no"/>thing could possibly arise, it would be danger. 
     <lb/>
     However, so far as we can see, there will be 
     <lb/>
     no danger in the administration of justice— 
     <lb/>
     the question of veto, and reserve with regard 
     <lb/>
     to legislation, being a totally different thing, 
     <lb/>
     and suggesting considerations of a different 
     <lb/>
     nature. But here is the point to which I 
     <lb/>
     wish to draw the attention of this House. 
     <lb/>
     Among all the things guaranteed to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada in the Constitution, and in fact to 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces, we find their own civil 
     <lb/>
     laws. Lower Canada has been so tenacious 
     <lb/>
     of its civil code, that it is laid down in the 
     <lb/>
     project before us that the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment shall not even be able to suggest legis<lb break="no"/>lation by which it may be affected, as it will 
     <lb/>
     have the right to do for the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The reason is obvious—the civil laws of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces are nearly similar ; they 
     <lb/>
     breathe the same spirit and the same prin<lb break="no"/>ciples ; they spring from the same source 
     <lb/>
     and the same ideas. But it is not so 
     <lb/>
     with regard to those of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     with their origin from almost entirely 
     <lb/>
     Latin sources ; and we hold to them as to a 
     <lb/>
     sacred legacy ; we love them because they 
     <lb/>
     suit our customs, and we find under the 
     <lb/>
     protection for our property and our families. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The Conference has under<lb break="no"/>stood and respected our ideas on this point. 
     <lb/>
     However, if a Court of Appeal should one day 
     <lb/>
     be placed over the judiciary tribunals of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, without excepting those of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, the result would be that those 
     <lb/>
     same laws would be explained by men who 
     <lb/>
     would not understand them, and who would, 
     <lb/>
     involuntarily perhaps, graft English juris<lb break="no"/>prudence upon a French code of laws.— 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Such was the spectacle pre<lb break="no"/>sented in Canada after the conquest, and no 
     <lb/>
     one, I am sure, would wish to see a repetition 
     <lb/>
     of the scene. (Hear, hear.) We have, it

     is true, Her Majesty's Privy Council as a last 
     <lb/>
     resort, but we owe it to necessity ; we have 
     <lb/>
     not asked for it ourselves. At any rate it is 
     <lb/>
     composed of chosen men, all or nearly all of 
     <lb/>
     whom are well versed in Roman law—men 
     <lb/>
     who, when they have a doubt upon some 
     <lb/>
     point, avail themselves of the counsels and 
     <lb/>
     advice of the most eminent jurists of France. 
     <lb/>
     Nor does the proposed Constitution speak 
     <lb/>
     of doing away with this tribunal, 
     <lb/>
     which will dominate by its imperial 
     <lb/>
     character even over the Court of Ap<lb break="no"/>peal which the Federal Government has 
     <lb/>
     the power of creating. Here the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion had national views ; it foresaw evidently 
     <lb/>
     in the future the day of colonial emanci<lb break="no"/>pation. Nevertheless, whatever the inten<lb break="no"/>tions of the delegates, their project does not 
     <lb/>
     define the attributes of this Federal court ; 
     <lb/>
     and as there is some apprehension on this 
     <lb/>
     point, I would wish to put the following 
     <lb/>
     question to the Government :—If this Court 
     <lb/>
     of Appeal be established, will it be a purely 
     <lb/>
     civil tribunal, or a constitutional one ? Or 
     <lb/>
     will it be at the same time civil and con<lb break="no"/>stitutional ? If it be a civil tribunal, will 
     <lb/>
     it have jurisdiction over Lower Canada? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName> —The 
     <lb/>
     question put by my hon. friend the member 
     <lb/>
     for Montmorency is one which it is not easy 
     <lb/>
     for the Government to answer, inasmuch as 
     <lb/>
     the power conferred by that article is only 
     <lb/>
     that of creating a Court of Appeal at some 
     <lb/>
     future day, and the jurisdiction of that court 
     <lb/>
     will depend on the causes which lead to its 
     <lb/>
     creation. The hon. member has very justly 
     <lb/>
     remarked that it may become necessary at 
     <lb/>
     a future period to constitute such a tribunal. 
     <lb/>
     At present the several provinces which are 
     <lb/>
     to form part of the Conlederation have the 
     <lb/>
     same court of final appeal. As long as we 
     <lb/>
     keep up our connection with the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, we shall always have our court of 
     <lb/>
     final appeal in Her Majesty's Privy Council. 
     <lb/>
     But when the British Provinces on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent are united by the bond of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, we shall have one uniform system, 
     <lb/>
     common to all, in regard to imports, bills of 
     <lb/>
     exchange and promissory notes, as well as 
     <lb/>
     universal jurisprudence. Accordingly, when 
     <lb/>
     we have lived some years under the Federal 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">régime</hi>, the urgent need of such a Court of 
     <lb/>
     Appeal with jurisdiction in such matters will 
     <lb/>
     be felt, and, if it is created, it will be fit that 
     <lb/>
     its jurisdiction should extend to civil causes 
     <lb/>
     which might arise in the several Confederate 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
            
     Provinces, because it will necessarily be 
     <lb/>
     composed of the most eminent judges in the 
     <lb/>
     different provinces, of the jurists whose re<lb break="no"/>putation stands highest, of men, in short, 
     <lb/>
     profoundly skilled in the jurisprudence of 
     <lb/>
     each of the provinces which they will re<lb break="no"/>spectively represent. Well, if this court is 
     <lb/>
     called upon, for instance, to give final judg<lb break="no"/>ment on a judgment rendered by a Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada court, there will be among the judges 
     <lb/>
     on the bench men perfectly versed in the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the laws of that section of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, who will be able to give the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of their lights to the other judges 
     <lb/>
     sitting with them. I must observe to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the member for Montmorency, 
     <lb/>
     that he disparages the civil law of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada in the estimate he makes of it ; but 
     <lb/>
     he need be under no uneasiness on that 
     <lb/>
     head. He should not forget that if, at this 
     <lb/>
     day, the laws of Lower Canada are so re<lb break="no"/>markably well understood in Her Majesty's  
     <lb/>
     Privy Council, it is because the code of 
     <lb/>
     equity, which is a subject of deep study and 
     <lb/>
     familiar knowledge among the members of 
     <lb/>
     the council, is based on Roman law, as our 
     <lb/>
     own code is. All the eminent judges, 
     <lb/>
     whether in England, in the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces or in Upper Canada, are profoundly 
     <lb/>
     versed in those principles of equity, which 
     <lb/>
     are identical with those of our civil code. 
     <lb/>
     Now, as to my own personal opinion, respect<lb break="no"/>ing the creation of that tribunal, I think 
     <lb/>
     that it is important not to establish it until 
     <lb/>
     a certain number of years shall have elapsed 
     <lb/>
     from the establishment of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and to make it consist of judges from the 
     <lb/>
     several provinces ; for this court would have 
     <lb/>
     to give final judgment in causes pronounced 
     <lb/>
     upon in the courts of all the sections. Nei<lb break="no"/>ther can I tell what functions and powers 
     <lb/>
     might be assigned to it by the act establishing 
     <lb/>
     it. Time alone can tell us that ; but I do 
     <lb/>
     hold, and the spirit of the conference at 
     <lb/>
     Quebec indicated, that the appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     judicial committtee of Her Majesty's Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council must always exist, even if the court 
     <lb/>
     in question is established.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:EVAN1">HON. MR. EVANTUREL</persName>—I acknow<lb break="no"/>ledge the frankness which the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General for Lower Canada has evinced in 
     <lb/>
     giving the explanations to the House which 
     <lb/>
     we have just heard ; and I trust that the 
     <lb/>
     honorable minister will permit me to ask 
     <lb/>
     him one question. Paragraph 32 gives the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government the power of legislating 
     <lb/>
     on criminal law, except that of creating 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="577" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0577.jpg"/>

     courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including 
     <lb/>
     rules of procedure in criminal cases. If I 
     <lb/>
     am not mistaken, that paragraph signifies 
     <lb/>
     that the General Government may establish 
     <lb/>
     judicial tribunals in the several Confederate 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. I should much like to be en<lb break="no"/>lightened on this head by the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General for Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName>—I am very glad 
     <lb/>
     that the honorable member for the County 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec has put this question, which I 
     <lb/>
     shall answer as frankly as that of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Montmorency. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     will find, if he refers to the paragraph which 
     <lb/>
     he has cited, that it gives the General Go<lb break="no"/>vernment simply the power of providing for 
     <lb/>
     the execution of the laws of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government, not of those of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—I have listened 
     <lb/>
     to the explanations of my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Lower Canada, and I 
     <lb/>
     find them perfectly satisfactory, as they 
     <lb/>
     regard criminal law ; for that is the same 
     <lb/>
     or nearly the same in all the provinces. For 
     <lb/>
     my own part, I infinitely prefer the criminal 
     <lb/>
     law of England to that of any other country. 
     <lb/>
     It affords more protection to the party ac<lb break="no"/>cused, than, for instance the criminal code of 
     <lb/>
     France does. The civil laws of the latter, by 
     <lb/>
     the way, have my warm admiration, as have 
     <lb/>
     also their administrative talent and their apt<lb break="no"/>ness for civilizing influences. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     If the English criminal law gives the criminal 
     <lb/>
     too great a chance of escaping, it at least 
     <lb/>
     saves society the stigma of condemning the 
     <lb/>
     innocent. The accused is tried for the single 
     <lb/>
     act for which he is indicted, and is not 
     <lb/>
     questioned concerning his whole past life 
     <lb/>
     and conversation. The laws of commerce 
     <lb/>
     are nearly the same in all countries, and 
     <lb/>
     those which rule the trade of two continents 
     <lb/>
     may be said to be founded on an ordinance 
     <lb/>
     of a king of France. Accordingly, there will 
     <lb/>
     be no inconvenience in bringing commercial 
     <lb/>
     causes, as well as others, for adjudication 
     <lb/>
     before the Court of Appeals mentioned in 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of Confederation. I am convin<lb break="no"/>ced that if ever that tribunal comes into 
     <lb/>
     existence, it will be composed of the most 
     <lb/>
     eminent men in the several provinces, who 
     <lb/>
     will devote their whole energies to the causes 
     <lb/>
     brought before them, but the majority of 
     <lb/>
    whom will have studied and practised a code 
     <lb/>different from ours ; although the laws of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada, for instance, have a constant 
     <lb/>tendency to coincide with our civil code : 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
        
     BLACKSTONE, with his national common law  
     <lb/>
     which he aimed at establishing, being no 
     <lb/>
     longer the great authority which he was in 
     <lb/>
     former days, and England, like Germany, 
     <lb/>
     drawing rather from the pure spring of Ro<lb break="no"/>man law, as the most perfectly rational code 
     <lb/>
     in existence. We have not, however, yet 
     <lb/>
     come to this position of things in our pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and, up to the present hour, English 
     <lb/>
     law consists rather of precedents and 
     <lb/>
     decisions of eminent judges, like Lords 
     <lb/>
     MANSFIELD, COKE, and others ; and as 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of a Constitution makes an 
     <lb/>
     exception in favor of our civil laws, it would 
     <lb/>
     be most prudent, in my opinion, to leave 
     <lb/>
     the decision of our causes to those judges 
     <lb/>
     who have studied and practised them. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing is as yet written in the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion concerning them, and nothing stands 
     <lb/>
     in the way of the desired exception. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am aware that it may be attended with 
     <lb/>
     some inconveniences and that in this behalf 
     <lb/>
     concessions may have been, perforce, sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to in order to obtain others ; but 
     <lb/>
     I think that on reflection it will be found 
     <lb/>
     best for all concerned to have the laws en<lb break="no"/>forced rather by those who understand them 
     <lb/>
     than by those who do not. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     now come, Mr. SPEAKER, to the question of 
     <lb/>
     marriage and divorce. The word divorce 
     <lb/>
     has sounded strangely upon Catholic care 
     <lb/>
     through the length and breadth of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; for the Catholic, whether he live 
     <lb/>
     in Rome, in London, Paris, New York, 
     <lb/>
     Halifax or Quebec, does not recognize any 
     <lb/>
     authority on earth with power to sanction or 
     <lb/>
     legalize divorce. Such is what the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic believes, whether he be the Sovereign 
     <lb/>
     Pontiff, ruling spiritually over 200,000,000 
     <lb/>
     souls, or the humblest or poorest of the 
     <lb/>
     faithful, with nothing to shelter him from 
     <lb/>
     the fury of the elements but the thatched 
     <lb/>
     roof of his cabin. (Hear, hear.) That is 
     <lb/>
     what I believe, in common with all the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics of the world ; but here, in this 
     <lb/>
     House, composed of Catholics and Protes<lb break="no"/>tants, I feel that I need, in order to be 
     <lb/>
     understood, to speak in another language, 
     <lb/>
     which will be understood by all, because 
     <lb/>
     it is based upon principles anterior to Chris<lb break="no"/>tianity and universally admitted. What is 
     <lb/>
     marriage, considered as a natural contract? 
     <lb/>
     It is the social formula ; it is, as I had occa<lb break="no"/>sion to write elsewhere, the natural mode of 
     <lb/>
     transmitting property, which is the funda<lb break="no"/>mental base of society, and, to go farther, 
     <lb/>
     society itself in its constitution. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="578" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0578.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">578</fw>
          
     hear.) If we cannot suppose a body without 
     <lb/>
     a form, so we cannot suppose society with<lb break="no"/>out its formula, and in destroying its for<lb break="no"/>mula you destroy society. That is the 
     <lb/>
     reason why the marriage tie should be in<lb break="no"/>dissoluble ; it is it which constitutes the 
     <lb/>
     family, and in breaking that tie you destroy 
     <lb/>
     the family, in breaking that tie you strike 
     <lb/>
     a mortal blow at society, because family ties 
     <lb/>
     are its only base, its only foundation, its 
     <lb/>
     only element of composition. (Hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     is from those fundamental truths that spring 
     <lb/>
     the rights, duties and civil laws which 
     <lb/>
     prove their existence and at the same time 
     <lb/>
     protect them. (Hear.) I have heard in 
     <lb/>
     another place than in this House, men who, 
     <lb/>
     forgetting the natural law and the principles 
     <lb/>
     of society, become affected at the recital 
     <lb/>
     of the domestic miseries of one of their 
     <lb/>
     fellow beings, and even invoke the Divine 
     <lb/>
     word to justify them in granting a divorce 
     <lb/>
     for cause of adultery. Let us see if the 
     <lb/>
     language of the Saviour of the world, who 
     <lb/>
     taught here upon earth a social doctrine, 
     <lb/>
     by preserving the inviolability of domestic 
     <lb/>
     ties and surrounding them with duties which 
     <lb/>
     rendered them still more sacred, justifies 
     <lb/>
     such an interpretation—"l say unto you, 
     <lb/>
     that he who putteth away his wife, except 
     <lb/>
     for adultery, and marrieth another, commit<lb break="no"/>teth adultery, and he who marrieth her who 
     <lb/>
     hath been put away also committeth adul<lb break="no"/>tery." Are not these words as clear as day, 
     <lb/>
     and do they not expressly forbid divorce, 
     <lb/>
     since they declare an adulterer the man who 
     <lb/>
     shall marry the woman separated from her 
     <lb/>
     husband. (Hear, hear.) These words per<lb break="no"/>mit the sending away, the separation of the 
     <lb/>
     body, but they expressly forbid divorce— 
     <lb/>
     that is, the rupture of family ties. (Applause.) 
     <lb/>
     I have said that those Divine words had a 
     <lb/>
     social object ; in fact what other object could 
     <lb/>
     they have but to preserve intact the social 
     <lb/>
     formula for the transmission of property ; and 
     <lb/>
     if they surround that formula with a super<lb break="no"/>natural sanction, accompanied by a prospect 
     <lb/>
     of reward or punishment, it is to protect it 
     <lb/>
     still more. It is for this reason that, in 
     <lb/>
     Catholicism, marriage, a natural contract, is 
     <lb/>
     elevated to the dignity of a sacrament, but it 
     <lb/>
     was inviolable and indissoluble before that 
     <lb/>
     sanction. (Hear, hear.) Now, if we drop 
     <lb/>
     the consideration of these great philosophical 
     <lb/>
     Christian ideas, we come to the region of ma<lb break="no"/>terial facts, and we are forcibly led to distin<lb break="no"/>guish between force and right, between power 
     <lb/>and duty. The sovereign legislative authority, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     as a superior power everywhere, in spite of 
     <lb/>
     right and duty, has ruled with a high hand 
     <lb/>
     questions in the social order, among which 
     <lb/>
     may be found divorce ; everywhere, in ancient 
     <lb/>
     Rome, in France, in England, in the United 
     <lb/>
     States, and in Canada, has this authority 
     <lb/>
     acted, and the judiciary was bound to execute 
     <lb/>
     its commands. (Hear, hear.) This power 
     <lb/>
     is inherent to Parliament, and is exercised, 
     <lb/>
     without opposition. Our present Parliament 
     <lb/>
     possessed that power, as did those of '74 and 
     <lb/>
     '91, and several of us have had, at some time 
     <lb/>
     or other, to give our vote on a bill of divorce. 
     <lb/>
     Catholics invariably voted against those bills, 
     <lb/>
     denying the right, but unable to deny the 
     <lb/>
     power, of Parliament, thus reconciling their 
     <lb/>
     consciences with their principles. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) This scheme of the Conference does 
     <lb/>
     not ask us to-day to proclaim a principle, but 
     <lb/>
     simply the transposition of the exercise of a 
     <lb/>
     power which exists in spite of us. Now, in 
     <lb/>
     weighing the advantages and inconveniences, 
     <lb/>
     I, for my part, say—and I believe, in so 
     <lb/>
     speaking I express the general sentiment of 
     <lb/>
     Catholics—that, since the evil is a neces<lb break="no"/>sary one, and cannot be got rid of, I would 
     <lb/>
     rather see it where its consequences would be 
     <lb/>
     less serious, because they would be more 
     <lb/>
     cramped in their development, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently less demoralizing and less fatal in 
     <lb/>
     their influence. (Hear, hear.) Marriage 
     <lb/>
     presents itself to us here under another aspect 
     <lb/>
     —that is, marriage with regard to its civil 
     <lb/>
     effects. This project attributes the civil laws 
     <lb/>
     and legislation as to property to the local 
     <lb/>
     legislatures. Now, marriage, considered as a 
     <lb/>
     civil contract, becomes necessarily a part of 
     <lb/>
     these laws, and, I might even say, it affects 
     <lb/>
     the entire civil code, containing in its broadest 
     <lb/>
     sense all the marriage acts, all the qualities 
     <lb/>
     and conditions required to allow marriage to 
     <lb/>
     be contracted, all the formalities relative to 
     <lb/>
     its celebration, all its nullifying causes, all its 
     <lb/>
     obligations, its dissolution, the separation of 
     <lb/>
     the body, its causes and effects ; in a word, all 
     <lb/>
     the possible consequences that can result from 
     <lb/>
     marriage to the contracting parties, their 
     <lb/>
     children and their estates. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     If such had been the intention of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates, we might as well say that the civil laws 
     <lb/>
     will not be one of the attributes of our Local 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, and that these words, "Property 
     <lb/>
     and civil rights," have been placed ironically 
     <lb/>
     in the fifteenth section of the forty-third 
     <lb/>
     clause of the scheme. But I was sure be<lb break="no"/>forehand that such could not be the case, 
     <lb/>
     when the Honorable Solicitor General for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada declared the other day, in the

            <fw type="num">579</fw>
 
     name of the Government, that the word mar<lb break="no"/>riage, inserted in the project of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, expresses the intention to give to the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament the power to declare that 
     <lb/>
     marriages contracted in any one of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, according to its laws, should be con<lb break="no"/>sidered as valid in all the others. Then am I 
     <lb/>
     to understand that that part of the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion relating to this question will be drafted 
     <lb/>
     in the sense expressed in the declaration of 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable Solicitor General, and will be 
     <lb/>
     restricted to the case mentioned ?

            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName> —I made,

     Mr. SPEAKER, the other day, in the name of 
     <lb/>
     the Government, the declaration now alluded 
     <lb/>
     to by the honorable member for Montmor<lb break="no"/>ency, relative to the question of marriage. 
     <lb/>
     The explanation then given by me exactly 
     <lb/>
     accords with that which was affixed to it at 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec Conference. It is undoubted that 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions laid before this honorable 
     <lb/>
     House contain in all things only the princi<lb break="no"/>ples on which the bill or measure respecting 
     <lb/>
     Confederation will be based. I can assure 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member that the explanations I 
     <lb/>
     gave the other evening, relative to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of marriage, are perfectly exact, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Act relating to it will be drawn 
     <lb/>
     up in accordance with the interpretation I 
     <lb/>
     put upon it.

     intended to protect mixed marriages.

     that I may be better understood by the hon.

     <lb/>
     which I communicated to the House the other 
     <lb/>
     evening. This declaration reads as follows :

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The word marriage has been placed in the draft

            <p>
     The hon. member for Hochelaga will please

     to remark that I have been careful in 
     <lb/>
     reading this declaration ; and in order that 
     <lb/>
     no doubt may exist respecting it, I have given 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     mistaken ; but the question on which I wish 
     <lb/>
     to be enlightened by the Hon. Solicitor Gene<lb break="no"/>ral for Lower Canada is this : Will a Local

     Legislature have the right of declaring a mar<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
     riage between parties not professing the same

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Has not 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature of Canada now the power of 
     <lb/>
     legislating on that matter, and yet has it ever 
     <lb/>
     thought of legislating in that way? (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—If I understand 
     <lb/>
     the explanation of the Hon. Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada correctly, it will be nothing 
     <lb/>
     but the application between the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     public international law, namely, that a mar<lb break="no"/>riage lawfully contracted in one province 
     <lb/>
     should be equally binding in all the others. 
     <lb/>
     ( Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—In that case you 
     <lb/>
     have no need of that clause. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—If the principle 
     <lb/>
     is just, I do not see what harm there can be 
     <lb/>
     in having it written in the Constitution, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly as it is desired in the provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     we, for our part, are interested in knowing 
     <lb/>
     that marriages contracted in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     are valid in all parts of the Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     That declaration is satisfactory and reassur<lb break="no"/>ing. Some of the speakers, imbued with de<lb break="no"/>mocratic-republican ideas, have gone so far as 
     <lb/>
     to deny one of the most essential and funda<lb break="no"/>mental principles of the British Constitution 
     <lb/>
     —that is to say, that the Parliament may 
     <lb/>
     change the Constitution without special ap<lb break="no"/>peals to the electoral body, and without re<lb break="no"/>course to popular conventions. It is evident 
     <lb/>
     that they wish to lead us towards a social re<lb break="no"/>public, government and legislation in full 
     <lb/>
     force. The Roman armies in the days of the 
     <lb/>
     decadence of the empire, made and unmade 
     <lb/>
     emperors ; but it never occurred to them to 
     <lb/>
     make laws and administer affairs of state. 
     <lb/>
     This had to be reserved to our republicans, 
     <lb/>
     who are against Confederation because they 
     <lb/>
     desire annexation to the United States, and 
     <lb/>
     who raise all kinds of obstacles in order to 
     <lb/>
     attain their end. (Hear, hear.) Here there 
     <lb/>
     are useless debates provoked in order to 
     <lb/>
     kill time ; there, petitions covered with false 
     <lb/>
     signatures or names obtained under false pre<lb break="no"/>tences ; and the forlorn hope of democracy, 
     <lb/>
     who in the streets threaten with riots and 
     <lb/>
     gibbets all who wish for the union of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and thereby, in its time, constitutional 
     <lb/>
     monarchy and parliamentary government. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But for those who, like my<lb break="no"/>self, move in another circle of ideas, who 
     <lb/>
     have other aspirations, and who are unwill<lb break="no"/>ing to accept on any condition their share 
     <lb/>
     of a debt of three thousand millions, and 
     <lb/>
     of an annual burthen of five hundred mil<lb break="no"/>

     lions of dollars ; for those the theory and 
     <lb/>
     practice of English constitutional law alone 
     <lb/>
     possess attractions. (Hear, hear.) These con<lb break="no"/>victions on my part are not of yesterday. 
     <lb/>
     When, in 1849, after a commercial crisis, 
     <lb/>
     which had everywhere caused discourage<lb break="no"/>ment, ruined merchants sighed for annexa<lb break="no"/>tion, because they hoped to find in it a rem<lb break="no"/>edy for the ills and the fortune they had lost ; 
     <lb/>
     they supplicated Great Britain to allow them 
     <lb/>
     to go over, arms and baggage, to the Wash<lb break="no"/>ington Government ; to them became imme<lb break="no"/>diately allied the republicans by inclination 
     <lb/>
     and principle, among whom were the honora<lb break="no"/>ble members for Chateauguay and Hochelaga. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The prosperity which followed 
     <lb/>
     brought back the merchants to affection for 
     <lb/>
     British rule, but the others remained repub<lb break="no"/>licans and annexationists. Their leaders are 
     <lb/>
     here before us. Their acts betray them, and 
     <lb/>
     were it permitted to us to hear them in their 
     <lb/>
     familiar counsels, I am sure their words would 
     <lb/>
     also betray them. (Hear, hear.) The an<lb break="no"/>nexation movement had scarcely commenced 
     <lb/>
     in Montreal, when the two similar classes of 
     <lb/>
     men began to agitate in Quebec, and called an 
     <lb/>
     annexationist meeting in the St. George's 
     <lb/>
     Hotel, now occupied as the Executive Coun<lb break="no"/>cil Chamber. This meeting was inaugurated 
     <lb/>
     under evil auspices. It was presided over by 
     <lb/>
     a bankrupt merchant. It was evening, and 
     <lb/>
     the meeting was held by gas-light. An orator 
     <lb/>
     was chanting with stentorian lungs the praises 
     <lb/>
    [illegible] annexation and republicanism, from which 
     <lb/>we were to derive prosperity and happiness. 
     <lb/>Respectable leading citizens, indignant at 
     <lb/>what they beheld, implored me to speak, and 
     <lb/>by a spontaneous movement I was borne to<lb break="no"/>wards the platform. The annexationist orator, 
     <lb/>losing his balance with the shock, in order to 
     <lb/>keep himself upright, seized the gas-burner 
     <lb/>above his head, but the frail support gave 
     <lb/>way. (Laughter.) The flames ascended in 
     <lb/>a  threatening manner towards the ceiling, and 
     <lb/>the terrified hotel-keeper immediately ran to 
     <lb/>the cellar and put a stop to the sources of illu<lb break="no"/>mination—and thus annexation was quenched 
     <lb/>in utter darkness. (Cheers and continuous 
     <lb/>laughter.) The republican annexationists, 
     <lb/>their hearts bursting with rage, in order to 
     <lb/>avenge themselves, proceeded to break my 
     <lb/>windows. This occurred nearly sixteen years 
     <lb/>ago, and time has only strengthened within 
     <lb/>me the opinion which guided my action then. 
     <lb/>It is neither hatred nor prejudice which has 
     <lb/>inspired me since I have been able to read 
     <lb/>and reflect. My opinion is the result of 
     <lb/>matured conviction. It is, therefore, in the 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
        
     parliamentary history of Great Britain, and 
     <lb/>
     not in that of American institutions, that I 
     <lb/>
     shall seek a rule of conduct to guide me under 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances. In 1717 the British soil 
     <lb/>
     was invaded by the Pretender. The tories, 
     <lb/>
     who were not in power, but who wanted to 
     <lb/>
     rise to it precisely like the honorable members 
     <lb/>
     in opposition whom I see before me, exclaim<lb break="no"/>ed, like them, that the church and religion of 
     <lb/>
     the country were in danger. Observe well 
     <lb/>
     the similarity. These tories wished to elevate 
     <lb/>
     a Catholic prince to the throne. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     The Whigs, who held the Government, and 
     <lb/>
     who saw in the approaching election the cer<lb break="no"/>tainty of the downfall of the reigning dynasty, 
     <lb/>
     determined to prolong the existence of the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament for four years more without an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people. Their adversaries ex<lb break="no"/>claimed, as do ours to-day, about violation of 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution, and accused them of evading, 
     <lb/>
     by violent means, an appeal to the people, to 
     <lb/>
     maintain themselves in power.

     parliaments was of little more than twenty years' 
     <lb/>
     continuance. It was an experiment which, as 
     <lb/>
     was argued, had proved unsuccessful; it was 
     <lb/>
     subject, like every other law, to be repealed 
     <lb/>
     entirely, or to be modified at discretion. As a 
     <lb/>
     question of constitutional expediency, the septenial 
     <lb/>
      bill was doubtless open at the time to one 
     <lb/>
     serious objection. Everyone admitted that a parliament 
     <lb/>
      subsisting indefinitely during a king's 
     <lb/>
     life, but exposed at all times to be dissolved at 
     <lb/>
     his pleasure, would become far too little dependent 
     <lb/>
      on the people, and far too much so on the 
     <lb/>
     Crown. But if the period of its continuance 
     <lb/>
     should thus be extended from three to seven 
     <lb/>
     years, the natural course of encroachment of those 
     <lb/>
     in power, or some momentous circumstance like 
     <lb/>
     the present, might lead to fresh prolongations, 
     <lb/>
     and gradually to an entire repeal of what had 
     <lb/>
     been thought so important a safeguard of its 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     purity. Time has happily put an end to apprehensions 
     <lb/>
      which are not on that account to be 
     <lb/>
     reckoned unreasonable.

     Against those who pretended that the Parliament 
     <lb/>
      of England could not effect, without an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people, a legislative union with 
     <lb/>
     Ireland, William Pitt, that other great 
     <lb/>
     constitutional authority, maintained that Par<lb break="no"/>liament had the right to alter even the succession 
     <lb/>
      to the Throne, to incorporate with itself 
     <lb/>
      anothcr legislature, to deprive of the franchise 
     <lb/>
      those who elected it, and to create for 
     <lb/>
     itself other electors. To be more exact I will 
     <lb/>
     quote from a speech made by the illustrious 
     <lb/>
     Sir Robert Peel, on the 27th March, 1846, 
     <lb/>
     on the Corn Law question. You will find 
     <lb/>
     there the opinion of Pitt, Fox and PEEL 
     <lb/>
     himself, the most weighty English constitutional 
     <lb/>
      authority of this century. It is found 
     <lb/>
      in Hansard's <hi rendition="simple:italic">Parliamentary-Debates</hi>, third 
     <lb/>
     series, vol. 85, pages 224, 225 and 226. Sir 
     <lb/>
     Robert Peel said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     But my honorable friend says he did not object 
     <lb/>
     to it as impeding the formation of a protection 
     <lb/>
     government, but as preventing a dissolution; and 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend and others have blamed me 
     <lb/>
     for not advising a dissolution of Parliament. In 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, it would have been utterly inconsistent 
     <lb/>
      with the duty of a Minister to advise a dissolution  
     <lb/>
      of Parliament under the particular circumstances 
     <lb/>
      in which this question of the Corn Law 
     <lb/>
     was placed. Why should it be so utterly impossible 
     <lb/>
      for this Parliament to deal with the present 
     <lb/>
     proposition? After its election in 1841, this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament passed the existing Corn Law, which 
     <lb/>
     diminished protection ; this Parliament passed 
     <lb/>
     the tariff destroying altogether the system of 
     <lb/>
     prohibition with respect to food; this Parliament 
     <lb/>
     passed the Canada Corn Bill; why should it 
     <lb/>
     exceed the functions of this Parliament to entertain 
     <lb/>
      the present proposition? But upon much 
     <lb/>
     higher round I would not consent to a dissolution. 
     <lb/>
      That, indeed, I think would have been a 
     <lb/>
     "dangerous precedent" for a Minister to admit 
     <lb/>
     that the existing Legislature was incompetent to 
     <lb/>
     the entertainment of any question ; that is a precedent 
     <lb/>
      which I would not establish. Whatever 
     <lb/>
     may have been the circumstances that may have 
     <lb/>
     taken place at an election, I never would sanction 
     <lb/>
     the view that any House of Commons is incompetent 
     <lb/>
     to entertain a measure that is necessary 
     <lb/>for the well-being of the community. If you 
     <lb/>were to admit that doctrine, you would shake the 
     <lb/>foundations on which many of the best laws are 
     <lb/>placed. Why, that doctrine was propounded at 
     <lb/>the time of the union between England and Ireland, 
     <lb/> as it had been previously at the time of the 
     <lb/>union between England and Scotland. It was 
     <lb/>maintained in Ireland very vehemently, but it was 
     <lb/>not maintained in this country by Mr. Fox. It 
     <lb/>was slightly adverted to by Mr. Sheridan at the 
     <lb/>time when the message with regard to the union 
     <lb/>
            
    
            <pb n="582" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0582.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">582</fw>
       
     was delivered.  Parliament had been elected 
     <lb/>
     without the slightest reason to believe it 
     <lb/>
     would resolve that its functions were to be fused 
     <lb/>
     and mixed with those of another Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     namely, the Irish Parliament ; and Mr. SHERIDAN  
     <lb/>
     slightly hinted it as an objection to the compe<lb break="no"/>tency of Parliament. Mr. PITT met that objection 
     <lb/>
     at the outset in the following manner. Mr. PITT 
     <lb/>
     said :—" The first objection is what I heard alluded 
     <lb/>
     to by the honorable gentleman opposite to me, 
     <lb/>
     when His Majesty's message was brought down, 
     <lb/>
     namely, that the Parliament of Ireland is incom<lb break="no"/>petent to entertain and discuss the question or 
     <lb/>
     rather, to act upon the measure  proposed without 
     <lb/>
     having previously obtained the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Ireland, their constituents. This point, 
     <lb/>
     sir, is of so much importance that I think I ought 
     <lb/>
     not to suffer the opportunity to pass without illus<lb break="no"/>trating more fully what I mean. If this principle 
     <lb/>
     of the incompetency of Parliament to the deci<lb break="no"/>sion of the measure be admitted, or if it be con<lb break="no"/>tended that Parliament has no legitimate author<lb break="no"/>ity to discuss and decide upon it, you will be 
     <lb/>
     driven to the  necessity of recognizing a principle 
     <lb/>
     the most dangerous that ever was adopted in any 
     <lb/>
     civilized state, I mean the principle that Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment cannot adopt any measure, new in its nature 
     <lb/>
     and of great importance, without appealing to the 
     <lb/>
     constituent and delegating authority for direction. 
     <lb/>
     If that doctrine be true, look to what an extent it 
     <lb/>
     will carry you. If such an argument could be 
     <lb/>
     set up and maintained, you acted without any le<lb break="no"/>gitimate authority when you created the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the Principality of Wales or of either 
     <lb/>
     of the counties palatine of England. Every law 
     <lb/>
     that Parliament ever made, without that appeal, 
     <lb/>
     either as to its own frame and constitution, as to 
     <lb/>
     the qualification of the electors or the elected, as 
     <lb/>
     to the great and fundamental point of the succes<lb break="no"/>sion to the Crown, was a breach of treaty and an 
     <lb/>
     act of usurpation." Then, Mr. PITT asked, if 
     <lb/>
     they turned to Ireland herself, what would they 
     <lb/>
     say to the Protestant Parliament that destroyed 
     <lb/>
     the exclusive Protestant franchise, and admitted 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholics to vote without any fresh 
     <lb/>
     appeal ? Mr. PITT went on :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         " What must be said by those who have at any 
     <lb/>
     time been friends to any plan of parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     reform, and particularly such as have been most 
     <lb/>
     recently brought forward, either in Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     or Ireland ? Whatever may have been thought of 
     <lb/>
     the propriety of the measure, I never heard any 
     <lb/>
     doubt of the competency of Parliament to con<lb break="no"/>sider and discuss it. Yet I defy any man to 
     <lb/>
     maintain the principle of those plans without 
     <lb/>
     contending that, as a member of Parliament, he 
     <lb/>
     possesses a right to concur in disfranchising those 
     <lb/>
     who sent him to Parliament, and to select others, 
     <lb/>
     by whom he was not elected, in their stead. I 
     <lb/>
     am sure that no sufficient distinction, in point of 
     <lb/>
     principle, can be successfully maintained for a 
     <lb/>
     single moment ; nor should I deem it necessary 
     <lb/>
     to dwell on this point in the manner that I do, 
     <lb/>
     were I not convinced that it is connected in part 
     <lb/>
     with all those false and dangerous notions on the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     subject of Government which have lately become 
     <lb/>
     too prevalent in the world." Mr. PITT contended, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that Parliament had a right to alter 
     <lb/>
     the succession to the Throne, to incorporate with 
     <lb/>
     itself another legislature, to disfranchise its con<lb break="no"/>stituents, or associate others with them. Why, 
     <lb/>
     is it possible for a Minister now to advise the 
     <lb/>
     Crown to dissolve Parliament on the ground that 
     <lb/>
     it is incompetent to entertain the question what 
     <lb/>
     this country shall do with the Corn Law ? There 
     <lb/>
     could not be a more dangerous example, a more 
     <lb/>
     purely democratic precedent, if I may so say, 
     <lb/>
     than that this Parliament should be dissolved, on 
     <lb/>
     ground of its incompetency to  decide any ques<lb break="no"/>tion of this nature. I am open to the charge, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, if it be one, that I did advise Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty to permit this measure to be brought for<lb break="no"/>ward in the present Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     The principle which I hold is so firmly estab<lb break="no"/>lished, that at the time of the flight of JAMES  
     <lb/>
     II. in 1688, the English Parliament, that is 
     <lb/>
     to say two branches of it  only, declared the 
     <lb/>
     succession vacant and gave the Throne to a 
     <lb/>
     new dynasty.

            <p>
         HON. MR. DORION—Hear! hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. CAUCHON—I wish to be well 
     <lb/>
     understood. I do not cite this example as an 
     <lb/>
     authority, because the Parliament was incom<lb break="no"/>plete without its third legislative branch, but 
     <lb/>
     only for the purpoæ of shewing to what length 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament of Great Britain has carried 
     <lb/>
     the exercise of its great prerogative. During 
     <lb/>
     the illness of GEORGE III., as it had been im<lb break="no"/>possible to foresee that such a misfortune 
     <lb/>
     would happen, and as without the action of 
     <lb/>
     the Sovereign, neither the administration of 
     <lb/>
     the government, which is conducted in the 
     <lb/>
     name of the king, nor legislation, which is only 
     <lb/>
     effectual after receiving the assent of the three 
     <lb/>
     branches of the legislature, were possible ; un<lb break="no"/>der these unforeseen circumstances, the two 
     <lb/>
     Houses, at the suggestion of the Ministers 
     <lb/>
     created a mechanism to act during the illness 
     <lb/>
     of the king, and all that was done under its 
     <lb/>
     operation became law, and was regarded as 
     <lb/>
     such by the whole British nation and all those 
     <lb/>
     charged with the execution of the laws of Par<lb break="no"/>liament. But setting aside these extraordin<lb break="no"/>ary circumstances, which demanded extraor<lb break="no"/>dinary remedies, we assert that Parliament in 
     <lb/>
     its integrity has power to alter the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion and even the succession to the Throne.  
     <lb/>
     As to us, we do not propose to go so far ; we 
     <lb/>
     simply ask the Imperial Parliament to give us 
     <lb/>
     a new Constitution, and even that Parliament 
     <lb/>
     will only with our consent make use of that 
     <lb/>
     power which it has a right to exercise without 
     <lb/>
     our consent. (Hear, hear.) Let it be ob<lb break="no"/>

     served, Mr. SPEAKER, that I am only 
     <lb/>
     considering now the question of power and 
     <lb/>
     right ; the  question of what is fit and ex<lb break="no"/>pedient is quite another matter. We 
     <lb/>
     might do well or we might do ill by taking 
     <lb/>
     this course, but as we act in our capacity of 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the people, it is for us to 
     <lb/>
     decide whether it is  expedient or advantage<lb break="no"/>ous that an appeal should be had to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple under the circumstances. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     As regards the sentiments of Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     in relation to us, the events which have taken 
     <lb/>
     place since the union show that they are al<lb break="no"/>together changed. In 1840 we had a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution imposed upon us against our will, and 
     <lb/>
     by so doing Great Britain was guilty of in<lb break="no"/>justice towards us. Now they await our decision 
     <lb/>
     before they act. In past days England looked 
     <lb/>
     upon the colonies as her own special markets, 
     <lb/>
     and fortified them by prohibitory duties against 
     <lb/>
     foreign trade. Now they are open to the 
     <lb/>
     whole world. Formerly we were  under a des<lb break="no"/>potic  and oligarchical government, and since 
     <lb/>
     1841 we have had that British Parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     Government which the great economist TUR<lb break="no"/>GOT, more than sixty years before, had ad<lb break="no"/>vised England to extend to her colonies. 
     <lb/>
      (Hear, hear.) Thus the Parliament of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, which had just proclaimed the union 
     <lb/>
     with Ireland, incorporated into its legislature 
     <lb/>
     the representation of the latter, and constitu<lb break="no"/>ted itself, by its own authority, the first 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, without recourse to a dissolution 
     <lb/>
     and new elections. At the meeting of the 
     <lb/>
     Houses they proceeded to the election of 
     <lb/>
     a new Speaker for the Commons, pre<lb break="no"/>cisely as after a general election, and all 
     <lb/>
     the other formalities were observed which, 
     <lb/>
     according to custom, accompanied the open<lb break="no"/>ing of new parliaments. You will find those 
     <lb/>
     details in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Parliamentary History</hi>, vol. 35, 
     <lb/>
     page 857. Here is another authority which 
     <lb/>
     the republican-annexation adversaries of Con<lb break="no"/>federation will hardly care to doubt. I find 
     <lb/>
     it in pages 164, 165, and 166 of SEDGWICK 
     <lb/>
     on <hi rendition="simple:italic">Statutory and Constitutional Law</hi> :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
       For are these merely speculative or abstract 
     <lb/>
     questions. We shall find them presenting them<lb break="no"/>selves in a large class of cases which 1 am about 
     <lb/>
     to examine. The dificulty, generally, seems to 
     <lb/>
     have arisen from a want of accurate notions as to 
     <lb/>
     the boundary line which, under our system, divides 
     <lb/>
     the legislative and judicial powers. I now turn 
     <lb/>
     to a more detailed consideration of the cases in 
     <lb/>
     this country, where these questions have been 
     <lb/>
     considered and which, so far as they go, tend to 
     <lb/>
      give a practical definition to the term <hi rendition="simple:italic">law</hi>,  and to 
     <lb/>define the  boundaries which  separate the legisla<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
       
     tive from the judicial power. And first, of causes 
     <lb/>
     where the legislature has sought to divest itself 
     <lb/>
     of real powers. Efforts have been made, in sev<lb break="no"/>eral cases, by the state legislatures to relieve 
     <lb/>
     themselves of the responsibility of their functions, 
     <lb/>
     by submitting statutes to the will of the people, 
     <lb/>
     in their primary capacity. But these proceedings  
     <lb/>
     have been held, and very rightly, to be entirely 
     <lb/>
     unconstitutional and invalid. The duties of 
     <lb/>
     legislation are not to be exercised by the people 
     <lb/>
     at large. The majority governs, but only in the 
     <lb/>
     prescribed form ; the introduction of practices of 
     <lb/>
     this kind would remove all checks on hasty and 
     <lb/>
     improvident legislation, and greatly diminish the 
     <lb/>
     benefits of representative government. So where 
     <lb/>
     an act to  establish free schools was, by its terms, 
     <lb/>
     directed to be submitted to the  electors of the 
     <lb/>
     state, to become a law only in case a majority of 
     <lb/>
     the votes were given in its favor, it was held, in 
     <lb/>
     New York, that the whole proceeding was 
     <lb/>
     entirely void. The Legislature, said the Court 
     <lb/>
     of Appeals, have no power to make such submis<lb break="no"/>sion, nor had the people the power to bind each 
     <lb/>
     other by acting upon it. They voluntarily sur<lb break="no"/>rendered that power when they adopted the con<lb break="no"/>stitution. The government of this state is 
     <lb/>
     democratic ; but it is a representative democracy, 
     <lb/>
     and in passing general laws, the people act only 
     <lb/>
     through their representatives in the Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     And in Pennsylvania, in the case of an excise 
     <lb/>
     statute, the same stern and salutary doctrine has 
     <lb/>
     been applied. In some of the more recent state 
     <lb/>
     constitutions this rule has been made a part of the 
     <lb/>
     fundamental law. So in Indiana, the principle is 
     <lb/>
     now framed into a constitutional provision which 
     <lb/>
     vests the legislative authority in a Senate and 
     <lb/>
     House of Representatives, and declares that no 
     <lb/>
     act " shall be passed, the taking effect of which 
     <lb/>
     shall be made to depend upon any authority 
     <lb/>
     except as provided in the Constitution." And 
     <lb/>
     under these provisions it has been held that so 
     <lb/>
     much of an act as relates to its submission to the 
     <lb/>
     popular vote, was null and void.

     and even change the sexes if necessary, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the doctrine of the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brome. (Laughter.) The honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Hochelaga is an admirer of 
     <lb/>
     written constitutions ; I am citing authorities 
     <lb/>
     to suit him, and which it is quite impossible 
     <lb/>
     for him to reject. (Hear, hear.) All these 
     <lb/>
     authorities establish, by incontestable evidence, 
     <lb/>
     the power of Parliament in regard to every 
     <lb/>
     question that may come before it. There 
     <lb/>
     only remains now the question of convenience 
     <lb/>
     and expediency, and that question can only be 
     <lb/>
     considered by Parliament. In 1717, 1800, 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="584" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-02_Page_0584.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">584</fw>
           
     and 1846, the British Parliament decided it 
     <lb/>
     without appealing to the people. In 1832 it 
     <lb/>
     decided the question after an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people, acting in all those circumstances un<lb break="no"/>der the constitutional responsibility of its 
     <lb/>
     trust.  That is what we shall do in the pre<lb break="no"/>sent difficult conjuncture, awaiting in the ap<lb break="no"/>proaching elections the approval or condem<lb break="no"/>nation of our initiative. But let the oppon<lb break="no"/>ents of the scheme be well convinced that we 
     <lb/>
     understand, quite as well as themselves, the 
     <lb/>
     entire importance of the vote which we are 
     <lb/>
     going to give. In closing, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     may be allowed to say to the House, that in 
     <lb/>
     a debate of such a solemn character, and when 
     <lb/>
     such great destinies as regards the future of 
     <lb/>
     the whole of British North America are at 
     <lb/>
     stake within these walls, let us have the 
     <lb/>
     courage to rise superior to passions, hatreds, 
     <lb/>
     personal enmities, and a miserable spirit of 
     <lb/>
     party, in order to allow our minds to soar 
     <lb/>
     . more freely in the larger sphere of generous 
     <lb/>
     sentiments, and of great and noble national 
     <lb/>
     aspirations.  We possess all that we want— 
     <lb/>
     all the necessary elements of greatness and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity to found an empire in America. 
     <lb/>
     Let us boldly set to work, sheltered by the 
     <lb/>
     flag and protected by the powerful ægis of 
     <lb/>
     the Empire which leads us on to undertake 
     <lb/>
     the task.  (Prolonged applause.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
       HON. MR. DORION—MR. SPEAKER, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montmorency, who has 
     <lb/>
     just sat down, having given it as his opinion 
     <lb/>
     that all those who are opposed to Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion are annexationists and infidels, I must 
     <lb/>
     congratulate him upon having at last opened 
     <lb/>
     his eyes and escaped the danger of being 
     <lb/>
     drawn into the vortex of the American Union, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps into something worse—(laughter) 
     <lb/>
     —-as but a short time ago he was in the bad 
     <lb/>
     company of those who are opposed to Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. He has even written a whole volume 
     <lb/>
     in opposition to the union of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I suppose that at that time he did not look 
     <lb/>
     upon himself as an annexationist, and still 
     <lb/>
     less as an infidel, for the simple reason that 
     <lb/>
     he combatted with all the power at his com<lb break="no"/>mand, not only Confederation, but also union 
     <lb/>
     of any kind with the British American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. (Hear, hear.)  In that book, which 
     <lb/>
     I have just referred to, and which was writ<lb break="no"/>ten at the end of 1858, the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber, after having described the different sys<lb break="no"/>tems under which the union might be pro<lb break="no"/>jected, says :-" We do not desire it, because 
     <lb/>
     we do not want union in any form, inasmuch 
     <lb/>
     as the same object will always be attained, no 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     matter under what form the union may be es<lb break="no"/>tablished." That object, according to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member, was the depriving Lower Canada of 
     <lb/>
     the small influence which she exercises on the 
     <lb/>
     legislation of the existing union. It is true 
     <lb/>
     that the honorable gentleman has written an<lb break="no"/>other book lately. According to that book he 
     <lb/>
     no longer sees any other danger for Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada than that of annexation, and invites every<lb break="no"/>one to turn round as he has done, and to fol<lb break="no"/>low him with the view of avoiding these dan<lb break="no"/>gers. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Once 
     <lb/>
     more I congratulate him that he is now out 
     <lb/>
     of danger, and I will endeavor to follow him 
     <lb/>
     with his two books in his hand. As it is too 
     <lb/>
     late to-night, however, I will do it at the next 
     <lb/>
     sitting, and for that purpose I move that the 
     <lb/>
     debate be now adjourned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName> —The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga alludes to the two 
     <lb/>
     pamphlets which I have written, one in 1858, 
     <lb/>
     and the other in 1865, on the subject of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the provinces. The differ<lb break="no"/>ence between the honorable member and me 
     <lb/>
     is simply this, that I do not deny what I have 
     <lb/>
     written, whilst in' order that he may enjoy 
     <lb/>
     greater freedom of discussion, he has thought 
     <lb/>
     proper to deny his actions in the past. ( Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) There is another contradiction which 
     <lb/>
     it is of importance to remark. After having 
     <lb/>
     asserted, up to 1861, that there was danger 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada in not granting to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada representation based upon population, 
     <lb/>
     or its substitute, the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     two Canadas, and that the danger was so 
     <lb/>
     menacing that it was more prudent to give 
     <lb/>
     way than to allow it to be forcibly taken by 
     <lb/>
     her—to-day he comes down and maintains 
     <lb/>
     that the horizon is quite serene; that there 
     <lb/>
     is no necessity for constitutional changes. 
     <lb/>
     Does he then so easily forget the days of 
     <lb/>
     1858, '59, '60 and '61 ? ( Hear, hear.) For 
     <lb/>
     my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I think we should 
     <lb/>
     be acting with more dignity, and would ren<lb break="no"/>der more service to the country, if we de<lb break="no"/>voted ourselves exclusively to the considera<lb break="no"/>tion of the question, setting aside those ac<lb break="no"/>cusations of contradiction from which no one 
     <lb/>
     is ever exempt. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
