advisers. Well, then, I assert that the case <lb/>
the honorable gentleman has cited to show <lb/>
that my honorable friend on the other side <lb/>
was wrong, is no case at all. It is not appli<lb break="no"/>cable in any respect to present circumstances, <lb/>
because, I repeat it again. we had not respon<lb break="no"/>sible government at that time. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Hon. MR. BUREAU—We have not<lb/>
responsible government yet,
then. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon. SIR E. P. TACHÉ—How does the <lb/>
honorable gentleman make that out? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. MR. BUREAU—The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has stated that since the death of <lb/>
Lord BAGOT we have not had responsible <lb/>
government. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ—The honorable <lb/>
gentleman cannot surely have
understood me. <lb/>
I think I said that under Lord METCALF <lb/>
there was responsible government in name <lb/>
but not in deed. And if the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man will study our parliamentary history a <lb/>
little closer, he will admit that such was the <lb/>
case. The consequence was, as I have already <lb/>
stated, the resignation of Hon. Messrs. LAFON- <lb break="maybe"/>
TAINE and BALDWIN. Still the Lower
Cana<lb break="no"/>dian party was unbroken. It is true the new <lb/>
advisers of Lord METCALF coquetted much <lb/>
with that majority to obtain adhesion; but it <lb/>
was in vain. They remained firm to the <lb/>
last, until the general election of 1848 brought <lb/>
back the parties to Parliament in much about <lb/>
their natural strength. I have already stated <lb/>
that I have destroyed my notes, and I am <lb/>
ready to await the verdict of this honorable <lb/>
House. (Applause) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. MR. VIDAL said—Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, as I consider it my duty to vote for <lb/>
the motion now before the House, I think it <lb/>
desirable to clear myself from the imputation <lb/>
of inconsistency in having supported the <lb/>
amendments which have been proposed. and <lb/>
which the House has rejected. I may state <lb/>
that my views as to the desirableness of sub<lb break="no"/>mitting the question to the people are un<lb break="no"/>changed; the plan has been voted down, but no <lb/>
argument has been adduced to demonstrate that <lb/>
it was wrong in principle, or likely to destroy <lb/>
the scheme. I have previously expressed my <lb/>
general approval of the Confederation, and that <lb/>
my desire was to secure its permanency by <lb/>
having its foundation broad and deep in the <lb/>
expressed approval of the people. Submission <lb/>
of the proposal to them has been refused, and <lb/>
the only question now for me to decide is <lb/>
whether I should accept the scheme as it is, <lb/>
or vote for its rejection altogether. Under <lb/>
these circumstances, I have no difficulty
in<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 
            <p> deciding that I must support the motion
for <lb/>
its adoption. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The question was then put on the main <lb/>
motion, which was carried on the following <lb/>
division:<lb break="no"/>

by Hon. Mr. FERGUSSON BLAIR, that a select <lb/>

            <p> It was then ordered that the Address be <lb/>

that such members of the Executive Council <lb/>
as are members of this House, do wait on <lb/>
His Excellency the Governor General, to <lb/>
know what time His Excellency will please to <lb/>
appoint to be attended with the said Address. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, when it <lb/>
is proposed to change the Constitution of <lb/>
the country, it becomes our duty to study <lb/>
with the greatest care, and from every dis<lb break="no"/>tinct point of view, the new Constitution <lb/>
which it is proposed to substitute for the <lb/>
existing one; and in doing so we ought not <lb/>
to disdain the experience of past ages <lb/>
          
            <pb n="347" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0347.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">347</fw>
         History
is the statesman's safest guide ; it <lb/>
ought to be the basis of all his conceptions ; <lb/>
indeed it would be treating its lessons with <lb/>
contempt, were we to attempt to dispose of <lb/>
the future without first knowing how Provi<lb break="no"/>dence has disposed of the past. To make <lb/>
use of a maxim, common, but yet most truth<lb break="no"/>ful: " There is nothing new under the sun;" <lb/>
the history of the world is a constantly <lb/>
revolving scene ; the same events pass and <lb/>
repass before our eyes under aspects varied <lb/>
enough, it is true, to deceive the superficial <lb/>
observer, but the man who thinks and <lb/>
investigates will have no difficulty in dis<lb break="no"/>covering that at all periods of the world's <lb/>
history, men have allowed themselves to be <lb/>
 controlled by the same motives
and passions, <lb/>
 and will arrive at the
inevitable conclusion <lb/>
 that like causes produce like effects. The <lb/>
honorable ministers who have unfolded to <lb/>
us the scheme of Confederation have based <lb/>
all their arguments on the future ; they <lb/>
have tried to prophecy, but for them the <lb/>
history of the past is a dead letter. Before <lb/>
attempting to predict the fate of our future <lb/>
Confederation, they should first have told us <lb/>
what had been the fate of past confeder<lb break="no"/>ations. It does not suffice to paint a splendid <lb/>
picture of grandeur and prosperity ; let it <lb/>
first be ascertained that the foundations on <lb/>
which the edifice is to be erected are sure <lb/>
and proved, and that established, we may <lb/>
then begin to build with safety. As has <lb/>
been said by one of the great professors of <lb/>
political science : " The wisdom of a states<lb break="no"/>man is the result of experience and not of <lb/>
theory." I am by no means astonished, <lb/>
however, at the repugnance evinced by the <lb/>
advocates of Confederation to make allusion <lb/>
 to the past. The Minister of
Agriculture <lb/>
 alone has had the courage to open the <lb/>
volume of the world's history, and he hastily <lb/>
closed it with the significant remark, especi<lb break="no"/>ally so falling from his lips:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">In
all the constitutions in which the Federal <lb/>
 principle has been adopted, it
cannot be denied <lb/>
 that the same fatal vice is to
be discerned—the <lb/>
 weakness of the central
authority. This has been <lb/>
 the fatal disease in all
confederations of which I <lb/>
 have heard, or whose histories I have read. They
<lb/>
 have died of consumption.
<lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> What the Government has not been willing <lb/>
to do, I now propose to do. Let us take <lb/>
counsel of those nations which have adopted <lb/>
federative constitutions, and may the recital <lb/>
of their unhappy experience be of use to us <lb/>
by placing us on our guard against the same <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               dangers. I propose to cast a brief glance
<lb/>
on the history of each Confederation. I do <lb/>
not propose to lay before you my own views, <lb/>
 and ask you to adopt them, but
rather those <lb/>
 of men of eminence, who have
made the art <lb/>
 of good government the study of
their lives. <lb/>
 I shall indeed make use, as
nearly as I <lb/>
 possibly can, of the very language which <lb/>
 they have used. Lord BROUGHAM, who is <lb/>
 listened to with profound
respect in the <lb/>
 Imperial Parliament, thus
expresses his <lb/>
views in the third part of his work on <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">Political Philosophy</hi>:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Besides the other defects of the Federal
union, <lb/>
its manifest tendency to create mutual estrange<lb break="no"/>ment, and even hostility,
between the different <lb/>
 parts of the same nation, is an
insuparable objec<lb break="no"/>tion to it. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> And further on he adds:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Whoever would see further proofs of this
posi<lb break="no"/>tion, may be referred to the ancient common~ <lb/>
wealths of Greece. As a Florentine hated a
<lb/>
Siennese worse than a German or a Spaniard, or <lb/>
even an infidel, in modern times, so of old did an <lb/>
Athenian hate a Spartan or a Theban worse than <lb/>
a Persian. Now, the Federal union, by keeping <lb/>
up a line of separation among its members, gives <lb/>
the freest scope to these pernicious prejudices<lb break="no"/>feelings which it is the highest duty of
all govern<lb break="no"/>ments to eradicate because they lead directly to <lb/>
confusion and war. <lb/>

and Italy to those of the Seven United Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces (now Holland and Belgium), we there <lb/>
find the same state of things. Let us hear <lb/>
what Lord MACAULAY says in the first <lb/>
               volume of his <hi rendition="simple:italic">History of England</hi>:-<lb/>

one of the Seven Provinces, which this union <lb/>
bound together in one cluster, retained nearly all <lb/>
the rights of sovereignty, and exacted from the <lb/>
Federal Government the most absolute respect of <lb/>
its rights. As the Federal authorities had no <lb/>

<p>The advocates of Confederation take pleasure <lb/>
in citing the result of the Swiss (or Helvetic) <lb/>
Confederacy as an exception to the disas<lb break="no"/>trous fate awaiting all confederations; but <lb/>
Switzerland possesses all the germs of this <lb/>
fatal malady, as witness the civil and reli<lb break="no"/>gious war of the Sonderbund. Here, how<lb break="no"/>ever, the symptoms are less violent than <lb/>
in other confederations, on account of its <lb/>

        exceptional position ; France, Prussia
and <lb/>
Austria are deeply interested in maintaining <lb/>
the existence of Switzerland as a neutral and <lb/>
independent state —it is indispensable to their <lb/>
safety. Were it not so, the last hour of the <lb/>
Helvetic Confederacy would have sounded <lb/>
long ago. If we pass from the confeder<lb break="no"/>ations of the old world to those of the <lb/>
new, we shall find that the climate of Ame<lb break="no"/>rica appears to be still more fatal to confed<lb break="no"/>erations than that of Europe. Let us begin <lb/>
with the Central American Confederacy or <lb/>
Republic of Guatemala. It was established <lb/>
in 1821, and was composed of five states: <lb/>
Guatemala, Honduras, San Salvador, Nica<lb break="no"/>ragua, and Costa Rica. In 1829, that is to <lb/>
say, after an interval of eighteen years only, <lb/>
Honduras set the example by seceding from <lb/>
the Confederation, an example which was very <lb/>
soon followed by the four other states, and <lb/>
that Confederation has ceased to exist, after <lb/>
a brief existence, in the midst of revolu<lb break="no"/>tions and civil wars. The Confederation of <lb/>
Columbia was formed in 1819 of the twelve <lb/>
provinces freed by Bolivar from the dominion <lb/>
of Spain. After endless troubles and revo<lb break="no"/>lutions, they separated in 1831 (after an <lb/>
existence of 12 years) into three
indepen<lb break="no"/>dent republics, though reunited under the <lb/>
name of Confederation of the United states <lb/>
of South America—New Grenada, Venezuela <lb/>
and Ecuador. I hold in my hand a volume <lb/>
               of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Annuaire des Deux Mondes</hi>, containing <lb/>
a general history of the different states <lb/>
during the years 1853 and 1854. I will not <lb/>
occupy the time of the House by entering <lb/>
into the details of that history ; I shall epito<lb break="no"/>mize it by reading a few lines from the table <lb/>
of contents, in which we find mention made <lb/>
of the principal events in the most succinct <lb/>
form. I read from this table as follows:— <lb/>
" Venezuela—General condition of Vene<lb break="no"/>zuela—Insurrection of 1853—Insurrection <lb/>
of 1854." One per annum, one would
soon <lb/>
become used to insurrections and think but <lb/>
little of them in that happy country. " Com<lb break="no"/>pulsory Loans "—I suppose one may get used <lb/>
to these operations in course of time, however <lb/>
disagreeable they may be. At all events, <lb/>
if matters turn out well with the com<lb break="no"/>pulsory borrowers, as I have no doubt <lb/>
they do, they do not leave enough to <lb/>
their compulsory creditors to make it worth <lb/>
their while to renew the Operation annu<lb break="no"/>ally, and thus we see that compulsory loans <lb/>
are not effected every year in Venezuela <lb/>
with the same regularity in which the
insur<lb break="no"/>rections there are carried out. "New Grenada <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               —movements of parties;" I augur nothing <lb/>
good from this movement. " The Golgothas<lb/>
and Draconians"—probably the liberals and <lb/>
conservatives, who have had the singular <lb/>
taste to assume these villainous titles and <lb/>
who discuss the question of the day by <lb/>
musketry practice—" struggles of parties and <lb/>
threats of military revolution ; movement of <lb/>
17th April." Still another movement— <lb/>
"uprising of the Provinces ;"—here, at all <lb/>
events, we have an unmistakable movement, <lb/>
as to the nature of which there can be no <lb/>
doubt whatever. " Present state of the <lb/>
civil war."—In New Grenada civil war figures <lb/>
in the quotations just as in Canada ; we
<lb/>
quote transactions in flour or lumber ; it is <lb/>
their normal condition. I hear an honorable <lb/>
member exclaim " Oh, but they are savages!" <lb/>
They are not savages ; but I am free to con<lb break="no"/>fess they behave like savages. This is but <lb/>
the ordinary effect of civil war ; as witness <lb/>
what is passing amongst our neighbors in <lb/>
the United States. But let us proceed to <lb/>
another confederation. Bolivia and Lower <lb/>
Peru formed themselves into a Confederacy <lb/>
in 1836. This Confederacy was born and <lb/>
lived and died, the whole in three years, <lb/>
between 1836 and 1839, hardly allowing <lb/>
time to begin to write its history. Next we <lb/>
have the confederation of the United Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Rio de la Plata or Argentine Re<lb break="no"/>public, established in 1816, by the union of <lb/>
fourteen independent provinces. BOUILLET, <lb/>
after having referred to the promulgation of <lb/>
the new Constitution, continues in the follow<lb break="no"/>ing terms:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">This Constitution, however, does not
prevent <lb/>
the united provinces of Rio de la Plata from <lb/>
being a prey to anarchy. The federalists and the <lb/>
anti-federalists are continually at war. Manufac<lb break="no"/>tures there are none ; and the trade is very limited. <lb/></quote>
             <p>  In that same table of contents of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">An<lb break="no"/>nuaire des Deux Mondes</hi>, I read * * *
"Civil <lb/>
war and raising of the siege of Buenos Ayres<lb break="no"/>separate Constitution for Buenos Ayres * * * <lb/>
—Struggle between the parties, and financial <lb/>
               distress—Disturbance (<hi rendition="simple:italic">echauffourée</hi>) of the <lb/>
18th July 1853." I suppose this word means <lb/>
something half-way between a movement and <lb/>
an insurrection, " Revolution of the 25th Sep<lb break="no"/>tember." Events succeed each other rapid<lb break="no"/>ly. " Civil war—Intervention of Brazil." <lb/>
But all this passed in 1853 and 1854. It is <lb/>
ancient history. Let us look at a few jour<lb break="no"/>nals of last week or the week before. What <lb/>
do we find? Here is a specimen or two : <lb/>
"The President of San Salvador in his <lb/>
speech at the opening of the House defends <lb/>

       himself indignantly against the
imputation <lb/>
of a wish to annex Central America to <lb/>
Mexico ;" or take another article:
" Hostili<lb break="no"/>ties have recommenced between the Empire <lb/>
of Brazil and the Republic of Uruguay," one <lb/>
of the States of the Argentine Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. " Paraguay, an ally of Uruguay, has also <lb/>
declared war against Brazil. The latter is <lb/>
 assisted by the revolutionary party
in Ura<lb break="no"/>guay, under the orders of General Flores. A <lb/>
Brazilian fleet assisted by General Flores and <lb/>
the revolutionists of Uraguay, has burned <lb/>
Paysandu, the capital of Uruguay * * * so <lb/>
that Uruguay is torn at the same time by civil <lb/>
war and a foreign war." This is a lament<lb break="no"/>able state of affairs ! How prudently minis<lb break="no"/>ters have acted in omitting all mention of <lb/>
these sad scenes, in asking us to vote for <lb/>
Confederation ! They would have spoiled <lb/>
their brilliant picture by too great a depth <lb/>
                of shadow. Passy, in his <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mémoire sur les <lb/>
formes de Gouvernement et les causes qui les <lb/>
déterminent, (Mémoires de l'Institut, Sciences <lb/>
 morales et politiques, 2e série, vol. 3,)</hi> ex<lb break="no"/>presses himself as follows, speaking of all <lb/>
these South American Confederations:<lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> Seldom does a year pass, without fresh
rebel<lb break="no"/>lions breaking out among them ; very seldom do <lb/>
the heads of the governments reach the legal term <lb/>

while the states themselves sometimes confeder<lb break="no"/>ate, again independent, are constantly
changing <lb/>
their forms of government and their aspect. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> PASSY assigns two main causes for these <lb/>
occurrences. The absence of homogeneity <lb/>
or common origin, and the want of know<lb break="no"/>ledge. As to this want of knowledge, I must <lb/>
 observe that there are few nations
in the <lb/>
world, if any, the population of which is <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>generally as enlightened as that of the
United <lb/>
States of
North America, and yet, at this <lb/>
very time, we see the dogs of civil
war let <lb/>
loose among them and raging as fiercely as <lb/>
ever they did among the confederate govern<lb break="no"/>ments of South America. As to the <lb/>
absence of homogeneity talked of by PASSY, <lb/>
if it exists to such an extent as to lead <lb/>
to these sad results among the confeder<lb break="no"/>etions of South America, in which all the <lb/>
citizens are, without exception, Catholics, <lb/>
speaking the same language, and who all <lb/>
within a few years fought side by side against <lb/>
their common enemy, Spain, to achieve <lb/>
their liberty,—if they are deficient, I say, <lb/>
in homogeneity, what is the case with us? <lb/>
Protestants and Catholics, French, English
<lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               and Irish speaking two different
languages. <lb/>
The strongest bond of union among the <lb/>
citizens of a state is a community of language <lb/>
and religion. We have neither in common. <lb/>
The confederations of South America have <lb/>
both, and yet, as PASSY says, they have not <lb/>
sufficient homogeneity to afford a hope
that <lb/>
they can ever live in peace under a federal <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">régime</hi>. Mexico was constituted a Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation in 1824. In 1837 it was united, and <lb/>
the union subsisted till 1846, except three <lb/>
years of dictatorship. In 1846 the Federal <lb/>
principle again prevailed, but disappeared <lb/>
in 1853, since which period the history of <lb/>
Mexico is too generally known to need re<lb break="no"/>petition in this place. It is written with <lb/>
the blood of its citizens. I shall merely <lb/>
mention the United States of North America. <lb/>
I do not pretend—I do not possess the ability <lb/>
—to trace out the real sources of the im<lb break="no"/>mense civil war by which they are now rent <lb/>
in pieces. Enough for me to say, that no<lb break="no"/>body is to consider slavery as the only cause</p>
            <p>of the civil strife. <lb/>
More than thirty years <lb/>
ago upon a question of tariff which went to <lb/>
protect the manufacturers of the North at the <lb/>
expense of the planters of the South, South <lb/>
Carolina sounded the signal of insurrection, <lb/>
as she since did in 1861 ; and had it not been <lb/>
for the firmness of General JACKSON, who <lb/>
overstepped his powers to save his country, <lb/>
the civil contest would have commenced at <lb/>
that time. It was sure to come on ; it was <lb/>
only delayed for a while. These were all <lb/>
trials of the Confederate system. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CORN1">MR. CORNELLIER</persName>—All the confeder<lb break="no"/>ations which you have mentioned were or <lb/>
are republican, and had the common fate of <lb/>
republican institutions. You have not said <lb/>
a word about monarchical confederations. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName> —I have made no mention of <lb/>
monarchical confederations, because none <lb/>
have ever existed, and none can exist. The <lb/>
principle of a monarchy is that the war <lb/>
resides in one person; the principle of con<lb break="no"/>federation is that it resides in all the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the confederation. A confederation <lb/>
would, therefore, always be a republic, even <lb/>
if formed of several states subject to a mon<lb break="no"/>archy ; because the power would not be <lb/>
vested in one person, but in each of the <lb/>
several states, of which no one would <lb/>
acknowledge a head ; it would be a republic <lb/>
consisting of a very small number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers. Before I take leave of all the confe<lb break="no"/>derations, the names of which I have men<lb break="no"/>tioned, I intend to say one word, at least, in <lb/>
their favor. We understand that states <lb/>
     
            <pb n="350" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0350.jpg"/>

          perfectly independent of one another, and
<lb/>
not subject to any authority bearing equally<lb/>
on them all, may have agreed (notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing the inconveniences of confederation) to <lb/>
become confederate for the purpose of <lb/>
strengthening themselves to resist a common <lb/>
enemy. So much they may have done. <lb/>
But we do not understand how provinces like <lb/>
ours, which have no existence independent <lb/>
of each other, but are all subject to the same <lb/>
authority, need have recourse to confeder<lb break="no"/>ation for the purpose of cementing a union <lb/>
which already exists. Confederation, by <lb/>
marking more strongly the lines of demar<lb break="no"/>cation between them, spoken of by Lord <lb/>
BROUGHAM, renders any more intimate con<lb break="no"/>nection between them for the future impos<lb break="no"/>sible. We are like bars of iron strongly <lb/>
welded together, which men should try to <lb/>
unite more strongly to each other by tearing <lb/>
them asunder to reunite them with shoe<lb break="no"/>maker's paste. Some will answer, " True ! <lb/>
the Federal principle has always and in every <lb/>
case proved a failure, but the cause lay in <lb/>
the weakness of the central power. We <lb/>
shall obviate that inconvenience, by establish<lb break="no"/>ing a central power strong enough to pre<lb break="no"/>serve our Confederation from that danger." <lb/>
But then it will be no longer a Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation ; it will be a legislative union—a union <lb/>
which the most zealous advocates of Confe<lb break="no"/>deration reject as incompatible with the <lb/>
various interests of the different provinces. <lb/>
If you succeed in establishing this central <lb/>
power, with strength enough to bear sway <lb/>
over the local powers, the latter will no <lb/>
longer have an exclusive existence ; they <lb/>
will become the authorized delegates of the <lb/>
central power, their officers and every vestige <lb/>
of confederation will disappear from your <lb/>
Constitution. If you absolutely resolve to <lb/>
adopt the Federal principle, you cannot do <lb/>
it without adopting at the same time all its <lb/>
inconveniences. The weakness of the <lb/>
central power is not the fruit of the Federal <lb/>
system ; it is its root, it is itself. This is <lb/>
the reason why states which are perfectly <lb/>
independent of each other, adopt the Federal <lb/>
principle solely as a means of defence against <lb/>
foreigners, because the central power in a <lb/>
confederation cannot be other than weak. <lb/>
We already possess, under our present Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, and without confederation, a central <lb/>
power stronger than any power which you <lb/>
can create, and to which we submit without <lb/>
complaint, because it is perfectly compatible <lb/>
with the existence of our local powers—I <lb/>
            <cb/>
               mean the power of England. It is exercised<lb/>
by men who live too far from us to hearken <lb/>
to the bickerings of race or of party, or to be <lb/>
mixed up with them in any way. But if <lb/>
that central power was wielded by men taken <lb/>
from among ourselves, men who have taken <lb/>
part in our quarrels and animosities, and who <lb/>
would make use of it to give effect to the <lb/>
views of their party, it would become in<lb break="no"/>supportable. As it now exists, we feel it <lb/>
only by the benefits it confers. Having <lb/>
thus shown the serious inconveniences <lb/>
innate in the Federal system, let us see <lb/>
whether there be anything exceptional in our <lb/>
position, operating in our favor, and allow<lb break="no"/>ing as to hope for immunity from those evils <lb/>
which have befallen all former confederations. <lb/>
What is our position? In what respects is <lb/>
it more favorable than that of other confed<lb break="no"/>erations? Let us begin with Lower Canada ; <lb/>
its population is composed of about three- <lb break="yes"/>
fourths
French-Canadians, and of one-fourth <lb/>
English-Canadians. It is impossible, even <lb/>
for the blindest admirers of the scheme of <lb/>
Confederation, to shut out from their view <lb/>
this great difference of nationality, which is <lb/>
certainly fated to play an important part in <lb/>
the destinies of the future Confederation. <lb/>
When Lord DURHAM wrote his celebrated <lb/>
report in 1839, he said, when speaking of <lb/>
the English-Canadians of Lower Canada:—<lb/>
" The English population will never submit <lb/>
to the authority of a parliament in which <lb/>
the French have a majority, or even the <lb/>
semblance of a majority." A little further <lb/>
on, he added :—" In the significant language <lb/>
of one of their most eminent men, they assert <lb/>
that Lower Canada must become English, <lb/>
even if to effect that object it should be <lb/>
necessary that the province should cease to <lb/>
belong to England." Whatever errors Lord <lb/>
DURHAM may have fallen into in judging <lb/>
the French-Canadians, he certainly cannot <lb/>
be reproached with having shewn too great <lb/>
severity towards the English- Canadians. He <lb/>
merely depicted their sentiments, as they <lb/>
manifested themselves in his day. Since <lb/>
then, things have undergone a change. <lb/>
And last autumn, at Sherbrooke, the Hon<lb break="no"/>orable Minister of Finance presented to us a <lb/>
very different picture, when he said :—" For  <lb/>
five and twenty years harmony has reigned <lb/>
in Lower Canada, and the English and <lb/>
French populations have entered into a com<lb break="no"/>pact to labor together to promote the common <lb/>
interests of the country." This picture is <lb/>
a true one at the present time, as was also <lb/>
      
            <pb n="351" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0351.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">351</fw>
        
        
        that drawn by Lord DURHAM in his day ; <lb/>
things have changed ! In the Parliament of <lb/>
the United Canadas, the English are in a <lb/>
majority ; they have not to deal with a <lb/>
French majority. But, if circumstances <lb/>
have altered, men have not ; place them in <lb/>
the same position in which they were pre<lb break="no"/>vious to 1839, and again you will perceive <lb/>
in them the same sentiments as were depicted <lb/>
by Lord DURHAM. The seed lies hid in the <lb/>
soil, it does not shew itself on the surface ; <lb/>
but a few drops of rain are all that is neces<lb break="no"/>sary to cause it to spring up. If such senti<lb break="no"/>ments did not exist between the two nation<lb break="no"/>alities, why this resolution, to be submitted <lb/>
to the House by the honorable member for <lb/>
Missisquoi, which I am now about to read:-<lb/></p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Resolved</hi>, That assuming the Federal system of <lb/>

               <p>
At the mere idea of a legislature in which <lb/>
the French element is to be in a majority in <lb/>
Lower Canada, the passions described by <lb/>
Lord DURHAM are evinced. It is true that <lb/>
the Ministry are doing their best to reassure <lb/>
both parties, and to each party, separately, <lb/>
they make promises at the expense of the <lb/>
other. French-Canadians ! do not allow <lb/>
yourselves to be led away by those brilliant <lb/>
promises. An Italian poet describes the <lb/>
endeavors of a mother to induce her child to <lb/>
swallow a draught, which is intended to re<lb break="no"/>store him to health ; to tempt him, she covers <lb/>
the edge of the cup with honey ; in like man<lb break="no"/>ner, the edge of the cup which is presented <lb/>
to you has been covered with honey, but in<lb break="no"/>stead of containing a health-restoring draught, <lb/>
that cup contains poison and death. I do <lb/>
not believe that the French-Canadians will <lb/>
share the power of their majority in Lower <lb/>
Canada by striving to oppress the English- <lb break="yes"/>
Canadian
; but there are
too many points <lb/>
            <cb/>
                  
                  on which they disagree to allow of their <lb/>
living long in peace together, in spite of <lb/>
their sincere wish to do so, under the sys<lb break="no"/>tem of local government which is proposed <lb/>
to us. The Honorable Prime Minister said <lb/>
in the Council:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">I believe the French-Canadians will do
all in <lb/>
their power to render justice to their fellow subjects <lb/>
of English origin ; and it should not be forgotten <lb/>
that, if the former are in a majority in Lower <lb/>
Canada, the English will be in a majority in the <lb/>
General Government, and that no act of real <lb/>
injustice can take place without its being reversed <lb/>
by the Federal Parliament. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> But who is to decide whether any act of
the <lb/>
French-Canadians is really an act of injus<lb break="no"/>tice? The Federal Parliament in which <lb/>
the English element will be all-powerful ! <lb/>
In political matters, a disinterested opinion <lb/>
is but seldom come to ; the sympathies of <lb/>
the majority in the Federal Parliament will <lb/>
be against us ; I see in this the prospect of <lb/>
a position which may prove to be a most <lb/>
dangerous one for us; if the strife should <lb/>
commence, no one can tell when it will end. <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:BEAU1">DR. BEAUBIEN</persName>—I have confidence in <lb/>
the conscience of the Federal Parliament. <lb/>
We ought not to attribute evil intentions to <lb/>

 <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—Despite the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber's sermon—I beg his pardon, I mean <lb/>

Confederation, by changing <lb/>
 the state of things which
established harmony <lb/>
 between the English and French
races in <lb/>
 Lower Canada, will destroy that
harmony, <lb/>
 and the consequences may be
only too easily <lb/>
 foreseen. In Upper Canada there
is much <lb/>
 more homogeneity, and, by consequence, the <lb/>
danger of intestine trouble there is much less <lb/>
great ; true it is, that the enormous power of <lb/>
the Orangemen and the law respecting sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools may give rise to difficulties, but <lb/>
I fear more for the relations of Upper Canada<lb/>
with the other provinces, and especially the <lb/>
Atlantic Provinces. Upper Canada objects, <lb/>
in general terms, to the construction of the <lb/>
 Intercolonial Railway. Its wish
is to see</p>
            <p>the resources of the future Confederation<lb/>
applied to opening up the immense territory <lb/>
of the North-West, and to the enlargement <lb/>
          

            <pb n="352" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0352.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">352</fw> 
          
          of its canals. The Atlantic Provinces
desire <lb/>
the Intercolonial Railway ; but they hold in <lb/>
dread the expenditure which would be en<lb break="no"/>tailed by the opening up of the North-West <lb/>
territory and the enlargement of the canals. <lb/>
Upper Canada already fears lest the Atlantic <lb/>
Provinces should unite with Lower Canada <lb/>
against her ; the French-Canadians fear for <lb/>
their nationality, threatened by the English <lb/>
majority from the other provinces, and yet <lb/>
Confederation so far only exists as a scheme. <lb/>
If our relations with the other provinces are <lb/>
not at present very intimate, at least there <lb/>
is nothing hostile in them. We regard them <lb/>
with interest and friendship as members of <lb/>
one and the same family with ourselves. <lb/>
We all grow together under the shelter of <lb/>
the English flag, and in case of war with the <lb/>
United States, we are all ready to unite in <lb/>
our efforts, in good faith, for our
common de<lb break="no"/>fence. But when the different provinces <lb/>
shall meet together in the Federal Parliament <lb/>
as on a field of battle, when they have there <lb/>
contracted the habit of contending with each <lb/>
other to cause their own interests, so various <lb/>
and so incompatible with each other, to <lb/>
prevail, and when, from repetition of this <lb/>
undying strife, jealousy and inevitable hatred <lb/>
shall have resulted, our sentiments towards <lb/>
the other provinces will be no longer the <lb/>
same ; and should any great danger, in <lb/>
which our safety would depend upon our <lb/>
united condition, arise, it would then per<lb break="no"/>haps be found that our Federal union had <lb/>
been the signal for our disunion. In such <lb/>
a position the greatest danger would result <lb/>
from the neighborhood of the United States, <lb/>
a nation which for a long time has looked on <lb/>
our provinces with a covetous eye, and <lb/>
which has an immense army which the end <lb/>
of the war, probably not far distant, will <lb/>
leave without occupation. They will follow <lb/>
up our political struggles closely, will en<lb break="no"/>courage the discontented, and will soon find<lb/>
an opportunity for interfering in our internal <lb/>
affairs, being called in by the
weaker party ; <lb/>
history is full of similar occurrences. The <lb/>
Attorney General for Lower Canada pretends <lb/>
that the opponents of Confederation desire <lb/>
annexation to the United States. I find it <lb/>
difficult to believe in his sincerity when he <lb/>
expresses that opinion ; it is usually by such <lb/>
arguments as this that he replies to his <lb/>
opponents when he has no other answer to <lb/>
make them. One of the most justly respect<lb break="no"/>ed men in Lower Canada, a man who enjoys <lb/>
universal esteem, Mr. CHERBIER, who had <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               long withdrawn from public life,
determined, <lb/>
despite his repugnance to entering the lists, <lb/>
to raise his voice in order to warn his fellow- <lb break="yes"/>
countrymen against the dangers of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation project. The purity of his motives <lb/>
could not be questioned ; being connected <lb/>
with no political party, he was perfectly <lb/>
disinterested in the course he took. It <lb/>
appears to me that the opinion of such a <lb/>
man deserved at least a respectful hearing. <lb/>
Instead of answering his argument, the <lb/>
honorable the Attorney General attempted <lb/>
to make him the laughing stock of this <lb/>
House. The Government stifles the voice <lb/>
of those who wish to enlighten the people ; <lb/>
but it takes upon itself the task of enlight<lb break="no"/>ening them. Here is a work "in favor of <lb/>
Confederation," published in 1865, entitled: <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">L'Union des Provinces de l'Amérique Bri<lb break="no"/>tannique
du Nord, par l'Hon. Joseph Cau<lb break="no"/>chon, membre de Parlement Canadien, et <lb/>
Rêdacteur-en-chef du Journal de Québec ;</hi> <lb/>
and also author of a work published in 1858, <lb/>
"against Confederation." If the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were generous, they would distribute <lb/>
the work of 1858 at the same time with that <lb/>
of 1865, in order to afford to every one the <lb/>
 advantage of a choice, more particularly as <lb/>
the honorable author cannot be right in both. <lb/>
In bringing these two works into contrast, <lb/>
I do not wish to make a personal attack on <lb/>
the honorable member ; the fact that he first <lb/>
wrote against Confederation and then in favor <lb/>
of it, is perfectly foreign to the debate. I <lb/>
should not have mentioned the matter, were<lb/>
it not that the Government make use of
the<lb/>
work of 1865 (the second) in order to <lb/>
propagate in every direction their doctrines <lb/>
on Confederation ; they are distributing <lb/>
thousands of copies of the work throughout <lb/>
Lower Canada, and in order to influence the <lb/>
English-speaking population, they are having <lb/>
it translated into English. It is, therefore, <lb/>
right to warn the people that they must <lb/>
distrust the arguments contained in that <lb/>
book ; they are diametrically opposed to the <lb/>
opinions enunciated by the author in his <lb/>
work of 1858, in which he says, in express <lb/>
terms, that the consequences of Confederation <lb/>
would be the ruin of Lower Canada. Of <lb/>
course the author, in his work of 1865, <lb/>
attempts to explain his change of opinion ; <lb/>
it is none the less true that he was wrong <lb/>
either in 1858 or else in 1865—which ? It <lb/>
may be said in behalf of the book of 1865 <lb/>
that it is four times thicker than the other ; <lb/>
this perhaps may seem a disadvantage to the <lb/>
     

            <pb n="353" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0353.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">353</fw> 
   
   minds of some readers. The Government, <lb/>
knowing well how much the people fear <lb/>
direct taxes, tell them that Confederation <lb/>
involves them in no such risk. What new <lb/>
method are they going to invent then for <lb/>
raising money? It is perfectly clear that <lb/>
Confederation will largely increase our ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. Then, for instance, Canada, <lb/>
which has now but one Government to <lb/>
maintain (and it is as much as she can do to <lb/>
maintain it), will have three to maintain, or <lb/>
nearly so : the Government of Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da, the Government of Lower Canada, and <lb/>
nine-twelfths of the Federal Government ; <lb/>
it will be the same as regards the legisla<lb break="no"/>tures. Canada, with a population forming <lb/>
nine-twelfths of the Confederation, will have <lb/>
to build nine-twelfths of the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway, in place of the five-twelfths she <lb/>
was to have been charged with, under the <lb/>
arrangements of 1863. With reference to <lb/>
the opening of the all but boundless territory <lb/>
of the North-West, and the construction of <lb/>
the fortifications which are spoken of only <lb/>
in whispers as yet, lest we should become <lb/>
alarmed, it is impossible to
calculate the <lb/>
expenditure these works will involve. And, <lb/>
in face of this increased expenditure, our <lb/>
chief source of revenue is to be considerably <lb/>
diminished. I refer to the import customs <lb/>
duties. Here is the justification offered by <lb/>
the Minister of Finance for the reduction:-<lb/></p>
               
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">It is evident since the Atlantic Provinces con<lb break="no"/>sume a far larger quantity of articles paying <lb/>
import duties than we do, that we shall be com<lb break="no"/>pelled, in order to assimilate all the customs <lb/>
tariffs,
to diminish the import duties we pay in <lb/>
Canada. The Atlantic Provinces cannot adopt a <lb/>
customs tariff so high as ours. <lb/></quote>
 
 <p>
I think I have shown that our expenditure <lb/>
must infallibly increase ; and as our revenue <lb/>
will diminish, to what new tax will the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have recourse in order to make up <lb/>
the deficit ? We are told that Lower Canada <lb/>
will have a revenue of nearly a million and <lb/>
a half to meet her local expenditure ; with <lb/>
what shall we meet our proportion of the <lb/>
Federal expenditure, which will be far lar<lb break="no"/>ger ? But I shall now deal with the advan<lb break="no"/>tages which
we are told must certainly result <lb/>
from Confederation. They may be divided <lb/>
into three classes—political, military and <lb/>
commercial. The honorable member for <lb/>
Montmorency tells us that we are to have <lb/>
the advantage of a seat at the banquet <lb/>
of nations. The perspective is a highly <lb/>
flattering one, I admit, but we must be <lb/>
            <cb/>
    
    permitted to take a common-sense view <lb/>
of it. The Honorable Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance, faithful to the doctrine that the great<lb break="no"/>ness of a State is proportioned to the great<lb break="no"/>ness of its debt, announces to us that our <lb/>
credit will be considerably increased, and <lb/>
that we shall be enabled to borrow much <lb/>
more extensively than we have hitherto done, <lb/>
a prospect at which he seems greatly to re<lb break="no"/>joice. This facility of borrowing is not <lb/>
always an unmixed good ; but it must be <lb/>
remembered that our credit will depend en<lb break="no"/>tirely on the success of our Confederation. <lb/>
If it should not succeed, if any serious dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty should arise within it—a thing which <lb/>
is possible—public opinion will be more <lb/>
prompt to take alarm, in that our Federal <lb/>
form of government does not afford strong <lb/>
guarantees for the maintenance of order and <lb/>
peace, and our credit will soon be worth <lb/>
less than the credit of a single province is <lb/>
worth to-day. The Honorable the President <lb/>
of the Council enumerated all our provinces, <lb/>
comparing one after another, as regards su<lb break="no"/>perficial extent, with the great states of Eu<lb break="no"/>rope. He finished with the Hudson's Bay <lb/>
territory, stating that it is as large as Euro<lb break="no"/>pean Russia ; but will it ever be capable of <lb/>
supporting, like European Russia, a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of sixty millions, and feeding, with its <lb/>
surplus corn, a great part of Europe ? The <lb/>
vastness of territory in which the honorable <lb/>
minister takes so much pride is precisely what <lb/>
inspires me with uneasiness ; we shall have <lb/>
the outward form of a giant, with the strength <lb/>
of a child ; we shall be unable to stand up. <lb/>
Hasty and premature growth is as fatal to <lb/>
states as it is to men ; a state should extend <lb/>
its limits only in proportion as its strength in<lb break="no"/>creases. The Roman Empire did not attain <lb/>
in a day its colossal proportions ; its growth, <lb/>
like that of the oak, was slow but sure. Let <lb/>
us not allow ourselves to be dazzled by the <lb/>
ambition of becoming all at once a great <lb/>
people ; the United States are a great people, <lb/>
but
where is the people, however small it <lb/>
maybe, that now envies their greatness ? Let <lb/>
us be content with our lot ; few nations have <lb/>
a better one. The territorial formation of <lb/>
the future Federation will also be an insur<lb break="no"/>mountable obstacle to the establishment of a <lb/>
strong government ; it amounts to a deform<lb break="no"/>ity. I give the following passage in support <lb/>
of this proposition:-<lb/></p>
            
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">What may the geographical advantages of the <lb/>
Union be ? We speak more as regards the future
<lb/>
than as regards the present. If the provinces it <lb/>

           is proposed to unite were grouped in a
compact <lb/>
mass as are the majority of the states of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Union, if their geographical position were <lb/>
such that they needed one another in
order to <lb/>
prosper, in order to attain an outlet on the sea, <lb/>
we should say—here, at all events, is a motive for <lb/>
the sacrifices demanded of us. But no, they are <lb/>
scattered over the surface of the Gulf. The <lb/>
nearest to Canada, New Brunswick, is connected <lb/>
with us solely by a narrow strip of territory at <lb/>
most but a few leagues in width, and bordered <lb/>
throughout by the menacing frontier of the Amer<lb break="no"/>ican Union. And even at this moment, pending <lb/>
the carrying out of the works of improvement we <lb/>
have just referred to, the shortest route from the <lb/>
provinces
to Canada is by way of the United <lb/>
States. While the union of the Canadas was <lb/>
odious in its formula, it was at all events justifi<lb break="no"/>able in a geographical point of view ; Upper <lb/>
Canada required the use of the St. Lawrence in <lb/>
order to reach the sea, and the two provinces <lb/>
together form a compact body, a fact which is the <lb/>
strongest possible condemnation of the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tional Act of 1791, and on which they were sepa<lb break="no"/>rated. <lb/></quote>
            <p>
If the readers of the work published by <lb/>
the Hon. Mr. CAUCHON, in 1865, in favor of <lb/>
Confederation, desire to know where I found <lb/>
that passage, I answer, in the work pub<lb break="no"/>lished by the Hon. Mr. CAUCHON, in 1858. <lb/>
It is probably the portion of the honorable <lb/>
gentleman's work of 1858, which he will find <lb/>
it most difficult
to get over. He may, indeed, <lb/>
allege in explanation of his change of opinion <lb/>
on other points, that the political position is <lb/>
altered, that our relations with the provinces <lb/>
and our neighbors of the United States are no <lb/>
longer the same; but I apprehend he will hard<lb break="no"/>ly go the length of asserting that the geograph<lb break="no"/>ical configuration of the country is changed. <lb/>
He will perhaps endeavor to show that the <lb/>
Intercolonial Railway, the construction of <lb/>
which forms part of the plan of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, will obviate the defects of our geograph<lb break="no"/>ical position ; but I would remind him that <lb/>
in 1858, when he wrote his first work, the <lb/>
building of the Intercolonial Railway was <lb/>
proposed as it is proposed now ; this will ap<lb break="no"/>pear from the passage I have just quoted: <lb/>
" And at this moment, pending the carrying <lb/>
out of the improvements we have just re<lb break="no"/>ferred to, the shortest way to come from the <lb/>
provinces to us is by way of the
United <lb/>
tates." Mr. SPEAKER, with the best possi<lb break="no"/>ble desire to assist the honorable gentleman, <lb/>
I find it utterly impossible to extricate him <lb/>
from his unfortunate position, and I shall not <lb/>
make the attempt. The Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral promises us that Lower Canada will be <lb/>
the sun of the Confederation. Since we can<lb break="no"/>not find a comparison on this poor earth em<lb break="no"/><cb/>blematic of our future greatness, let us
bor<lb break="no"/>row one from the heavens at the risk of losing <lb/>
ourselves in the clouds with the advocates of <lb/>
Confederation ; I propose the adoption of the <lb/>
rainbow as our emblem. By the endless
va<lb break="no"/>riety of its tints the rainbow will give an ex<lb break="no"/>cellent idea of the diversity of races, religions, <lb/>
sentiments and interests of the different parts <lb/>
of the Confederation. By its slender and <lb/>
elongated form, the rainbow would afford a <lb/>
perfect representation of the geographical con<lb break="no"/>figuration of the Confederation. By its lack <lb/>
of consistence—an image without substance <lb/>
—the rainbow would represent aptly the sol<lb break="no"/>idity of our Confederation. An emblem we <lb/>
must have, for every great empire has one ; <lb/>
let us adopt the rainbow. Mr. SPEAKER, the <lb/>
fact of our provinces being all at once erected <lb/>
into a Confederation will not give us a single <lb/>
additional man ; battalions cannot be made <lb/>
to spring forth from the earth, armed from <lb/>
head to foot, by a stamp of the foot as in the <lb/>
mythological ages. The Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral for Lower Canada has developed a plan <lb/>
of strategy which I take the liberty of seri<lb break="no"/>ously recommending to the Commander-in-<lb break="yes"/>Chief. The honorable gentleman sums up in <lb/>
the following terms the advantages of the <lb/>
Confederation in a military point of view : <lb/>
"When we shall be united, the enemy will <lb/>
know that if he attacks any part of our provin<lb break="no"/>ces, the Island of Prince Edward or Canada, he <lb/>
will have to meet the combined forces of the <lb/>
Empire." There was no need of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration to convince our neighbors of that ; <lb/>
they are, as a general rule, sufficiently sharp- <lb break="yes"/>
witted to discover, without being told it, that <lb/>
if they content themselves with attacking us <lb/>
at a single point at a time, of course they will <lb/>
have to meet all our strength. Would it not <lb/>
be well to enter into a contract, binding them <lb/>
to attack us at a single point only at one time <lb/>
—say Quebec? We might, in fact, give them <lb/>
the free use of the Grand Trunk Railway to <lb/>
bring their troops to Point Levis. Of what <lb/>
benefit to the United States would be their <lb/>
vast armies, their great fleets, their abundant <lb/>
means of transport in every direction, if they <lb/>
were to attack us only at one point at a time, <lb/>
as the Hon. Attorney General seems to hope ? <lb/>
In the war of 1812, they attacked us simul<lb break="no"/>taneously at different points, though their <lb/>
troops were far less numerous in proportion <lb/>
to ours than they would now be in case of <lb/>
war, and though their means of transport <lb/>
were then far inferior to what they now are. <lb/>
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island,
Nova <lb/>
Scotia, New Brunswick and Canada, would <lb/>
      
            <pb n="355" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0355.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">355</fw>
               
 be attacked simultaneousy, and each province <lb/>
at different points. The provinces will help <lb/>
one another sufficiently if each of them can <lb/>
maintain the integrity of its own territory, <lb/>
so that the enemy may not be enabled to take <lb/>
the adjoining province in flank ; in the same <lb/>
way that a soldier in line of battle assists his <lb/>
comrade at his side by simply keeping his <lb/>
own place in the ranks. We do not need <lb/>
Confederation to give us that unity which <lb/>
is indispensable in all military operations<lb break="no"/>unity of headship. A commander-in-chief <lb/>
will direct the defence of all our provinces ; <lb/>
he will forward troops, and, if he can, vessels <lb/>
of war, to the points most seriously threat<lb break="no"/>ened, and will assist each province to de<lb break="no"/>fend the post which Providence has al<lb break="no"/>ready assigned to each in our long line of <lb/>
battle. Moreover, in the event of
war with <lb/>
the United States, if we were to trust to num<lb break="no"/>bers we should be sadly disappointed. What <lb/>
we need above all is enthusiasm ; our citizen <lb/>
soldiers must be convinced that they are risk<lb break="no"/>ing their lives for something worth while ; <lb/>
that they are happier in being under the flag <lb/>
of England than they could be under that of <lb/>
the United States, and that they must lose by <lb/>
an exchange. In the present position of the <lb/>
United States it is not difficult to make them <lb/>
understand that ; the taxes alone with which <lb/>
the Americans are now crushed down, and of <lb/>
which the vast volume is growing from day <lb/>
to day, suffice to shew, at a first glance, how <lb/>
far our position is superior to theirs in a ma<lb break="no"/>terial point of view. But if, in order to meet <lb/>
the extravagant expenditure the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion must bring with it, the people find them<lb break="no"/>selves taxed beyond their resources, the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment need not be surprised, if they should <lb/>
ever appeal to the courage of the people and <lb/>
call upon them to meet the enemy, to receive <lb/>
the answer the old man got from his donkey <lb/>
in LAFONTAINE'S fable. When, at the
ap<lb break="no"/>proach of the enemy, the old man wished to <lb/>
mount and fly, the donkey refused to bear <lb/>
him, and commenced the following dialogue <lb/>
with his master:-<lb/></p>

            <p> LAFONTAINE, it will be seen, found means,
two <lb/>
hundred years ago, of saying serious things in <lb/>
a laughing way. If the Government treat <lb/>
the people as a beast of burthen, to be piti<lb break="no"/>lessly overladen, the people will one day make <lb/>
them the same answer that the donkey made <lb/>
to his master, in LAFONTAINE'S fable.
Lord <lb/>
BACON, in his essays, expresses the
same <lb/>
thought in more serious terms. But apart <lb/>
from purely material interests, which are <lb/>
nevertheless highly important, for happiness <lb/>
and poverty rarely go hand in hand, there are <lb/>
other interests of a higher order which rouse <lb/>
the courage of a people and sometimes render <lb/>
it capable of sustaining the most unequal <lb/>
struggles. Deprive the French Canadians of <lb/>
their nationality, and you deprive them of the <lb/>
enthusiasm which would have doubled their <lb/>
strength. I concur with the Government in <lb/>
their desire to form more intimate commercial <lb/>
relations between the different provinces ; but <lb/>
when it is attempted to use the immense ad<lb break="no"/>vantages which would result from these rela<lb break="no"/>tions as an overwhelming argument in favor <lb/>
of Confederation, it is as well to form a proper <lb/>
appreciation of those advantages, and see <lb/>
whether we cannot secure them without Con<lb break="no"/>federation. The Gulf Provinces possess tim<lb break="no"/>ber, coal and fisheries ; our own two great <lb/>
articles of export are timber and wheat. <lb/>
With regard to timber, the Gulf Prov<lb break="no"/>inces have no more need of ours than we <lb/>
of theirs. As to coal we import from Eng<lb break="no"/>land what we need for our present wants, in <lb/>
ballast, on board the numerous ships which <lb/>
come here for our timber, and we thus get it <lb/>
cheaper than we could import it from the <lb/>
Gulf Provinces. When this supply becomes <lb/>
insufficient to meet our growing wants, it will <lb/>
be necessary to look somewhere for a supply <lb/>
of coal. If the Lower Provinces can furnish<lb/>
it to us at cheaper rates than we can get
it in <lb/>
the United States, we shall buy it from them. <lb/>
Upper Canada will probably get its coal from <lb/>
the Pennsylvania mines, which are in direct <lb/>
communication with Lake Erie, on the north <lb/>
shore of which the richest and most thickly<lb/>
settled portion of Upper Canada is
situated. <lb/>
As regards fisheries, Canada has a stock of <lb/>
fish in its waters sufficient not only to supply <lb/>
all its own requirements, but to enable it to <lb/>
export largely from Gaspé to Europe. Now <lb/>
as to wheat. The Honorable President of the <lb/>
Council told us that in a single year the At<lb break="no"/>lantic Provinces paid $4,440,000 to the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States for flour, and that a portion of that <lb/>
flour came from Upper Canada ; and the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman asks why should not we <lb/>
     
            <pb n="356" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0356.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">356</fw>
     
     ourselves sell our flour to the Lower
Provin<lb break="no"/>ces ? For the simple reason that, instead of <lb/>
having to pay four millions four hundred and <lb/>
forty-seven thousand dollars to the United <lb/>
States, they would have to pay us five millions <lb/>
of dollars, and they would therefore refuse to <lb/>
buy from us. There is no such thing as sen<lb break="no"/>timent in matters of business ; men buy in the <lb/>
cheapest market. The Gulf Provinces will <lb/>
buy their flour from the United States so long <lb/>
as they can obtain it at a lower price there <lb/>
than in Canada ; and the fact that they do <lb/>
obtain it cheaper from the United States is <lb/>
clearly demonstrated by their buying from <lb/>
the Americans and not from us. But a single <lb/>
glance at the map will account for the differ<lb break="no"/>ence in price. I do not believe that the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway can be advantageously <lb/>
employed for the transport of flour from Rivière <lb/>
du Loup to Halifax ; the cost of transport <lb/>
over five hundred miles of railway would be <lb/>
too great ; the water route must therefore be <lb/>
adopted. Kingston and Halifax are in the <lb/>
same latitude, between the 44th and 45th <lb/>
parallel. From Kingston the St. Lawrence <lb/>
flows undeviatingly towards the north-east, <lb/>
and falls into the Gulf in the 50th
degree of <lb/>
north latitude. From that point, in order to <lb/>
reach the Gut of Canso, you must not only <lb/>
make five degrees of southing, but also make <lb/>
nearly three degrees of longitude to the east, <lb/>
and then nearly three more towards the west <lb/>
before reaching Halifax. Moreover, the navi<lb break="no"/>gation is more or less dangerous throughout.
<lb/>
When you compare this circuitous
route with <lb/>
the far more direct one of the United States, <lb/>
it is quite easy to understand why the United <lb/>
States can sell even our wheat to the Gulf <lb/>
Provinces at lower prices than we ourselves <lb/>
are able to do. I have attempted to reduce <lb/>
the commercial advantages we are promised to <lb/>
their proper proportion. I will now endeavor <lb/>
to show that we can secure every one of these <lb/>
advantages without the Confederation. I <lb/>
shall cite, for that purpose, the very words of <lb/>
the Honorable Minister of Finance:-<lb/>
            </p>
            
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">If we look at the results of the free
interchange <lb/>
of produce between Canada and the United States, <lb/>
we shall find that our trade with them increased, <lb/>
in ten years, from less than two millions to twenty <lb/>
millions of dollars. If free trade has produced <lb/>
such results in that case, what may we not expect <lb/>
when the artificial obstacles which hamper free <lb/>
trade between us and the provinces of the Gulf <lb/>
shall have disappeared ? <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> But this fine result was not obtained by <lb/>
means of a Confederation with the United <lb/>
States. What hinders us from having free<lb/>
            <cb/>
               trade with the Gulf Provinces ? In support <lb/>
of this view, I shall note the work of the <lb/>
honorable member for Montmorency, not
that <lb/>
of 1858, but that of 1865, written in favor of <lb/>
Confederation, pages 32 and 33, where he <lb/>
shews in the most conclusive manner that we <lb/>
have no need of Confederation to improve our <lb/>
commercial relations with the Gulf Provinces. <lb/>
It is under this head of commercial advan<lb break="no"/>tages that the Intercolonial Railway fitly <lb/>
comes in. The Honorable President of the <lb/>
Council tells us that he is favorable to Con<lb break="no"/>federation, because it will give us a seaport at <lb/>
all seasons of the year—a most powerful <lb/>
argument, he adds, in its favor. We stand <lb/>
in great need of a seaport in the winter <lb/>
season, more especially if the United States <lb/>
abolish the right of transit. Absolutely,
<lb/>
without reference to that, we require it in <lb/>
order to perfect our system of defence. But is <lb/>
Confederation necessary in order that we may <lb/>
build the Intercolonial Railway? Certainly <lb/>
not. The hon. minister, in the same speech, <lb/>
gives an answer to the representatives from <lb/>
Upper Canada complaining that the
Interco<lb break="no"/>lonial Railway is to be built before any scheme <lb/>
is entertained for opening up the North-West <lb/>
Territory,—" The reason is that the neces<lb break="no"/>sary means of constructing the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway are already secured to us by the <lb/>
guarantee of the Imperial Government, which <lb/>
will enable us to obtain money at a very ad<lb break="no"/>vantageous rate of interest." These means <lb/>
were secured to us a long time since, long <lb/>
before the question of Confederation was <lb/>
agitated. I see also in a report laid before the <lb/>
House in a return to an address moved for <lb/>
last year by the Honorable Minister of Agri<lb break="no"/>culture, that as soon as it became known in <lb/>
England that Mr. FLEMING had been ap<lb break="no"/>pointed to report upon a plan for the Interco<lb break="no"/>lonial
Railway, two offers were at once made <lb/>
for the building of it, uncalled for by us. <lb/>
One is contained in Mr. C. D. ARCHIBALD'S <lb/>
letter of 27th August, 1863, and the other <lb/>
in that of Mr. C. J. BRYDGES of 4th March, <lb/>
1864. Our credit is good enough to procure <lb/>
us the means of building the railway with<lb break="no"/>out having recourse to Confederation. To <lb/>
sum up all in few words : all the advantages <lb/>
are negative, that is to say, Confederation will <lb/>
do no harm to our interests, military or com<lb break="no"/>mercial, but neither do they require it. As to <lb/>
the inconveniences of which it may be pro<lb break="no"/>ductive, I leave them to the judgment of the <lb/>
House, who will decide whether they are posi<lb break="no"/>tive. I am asked : " If you will have nothing to <lb/>
do with Confederation, what will you have ?" <lb/>

       I answer, we would remain as we are.
That, I<lb/>
am told, is impossible, in our present position <lb/>
with respect to Upper Canada. The Hon.<lb/>
Premier, in introducing the scheme of
Con<lb break="no"/>federation to the Legislature, said,—" At the <lb/>
time these measures were resolved upon, the <lb/>
country was bordering on civil strife, and he <lb/>
would ask if it was not the duty of both sides <lb/>
to do all they could to prevent the unfortunate <lb/>
results which would have followed." All the <lb/>
ministers following him, used expressions of <lb/>
the same tenor, nothing caring for the in<lb break="no"/>calculable wrong which they were doing to the <lb/>
country, they whose duty it was to watch for <lb/>
the preservation of its good name, and the <lb/>
safety of its interests. How will the world be <lb/>
astonished, who look upon Canada as one of <lb/>
the most favored countries on earth, in which <lb/>
the people enjoy more liberty and more perfect <lb/>
tranquillity than is to be found in any other <lb/>
—how will they be astonished to hear that we <lb/>
are " a country bordering on civil strife ?" <lb/>
How will such tidings affect our credit ? The <lb/>
world will not understand the motives of our <lb/>
ministers in painting the condition of our <lb/>
country in such gloomy colors. It will <lb/>
not be aware that they must have Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation to keep their places, and that this threat <lb/>
of war is uttered for the nonce as an unanswer<lb break="no"/>able argument to force us to accept it. What <lb/>
a discrepancy there is between this declaration <lb/>
of the Ministry that we are "bordering
on <lb/>
civil strife," and the opening of the Speech <lb/>
from the Throne, which expresses " thankful<lb break="no"/>ness to a beneficent Providence for the gen<lb break="no"/>eral contentment of the people of this pro<lb break="no"/>vince," or the address voted by the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture in answer to the Speech from the Throne <lb/>
which is the faithful echo of this grateful<lb/>
sentiment
! What would the members of the <lb/>
Ministry have said if a member had risen to <lb/>
move an amendment to the Address in the <lb/>
words made use of by the Hon. Premier, <lb/>
" That the country is bordering on civil <lb/>
strife, and that therefore the House can<lb break="no"/>not admit that there is general contentment <lb/>
among the people ?" It is on reasons widely <lb/>
differing from these that the Speech
from the <lb/>
Throne takes ground in recommending the <lb/>
adoption of the scheme of Confederation. <lb/>
But are we really bordering on civil strife ? <lb/>
Of course it is representation based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation which is the exciting cause. Do the <lb/>
               people of Upper Canada demand representa<lb break="no"/>tion based on population as a condition <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine <lb/>
quâ non</hi> of the continuation of our
peaceful <lb/>
relations with them ? Has this desire to ob<lb break="no"/>tain representation based on population taken <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               such deep root in the bosom of Upper
Canada, <lb/>
that it is ready to plunge us and itself into <lb/>
the horrors of civil war in order to achieve <lb/>
it ? Or is not representation by population <lb/>
rather one of those political clap-traps which <lb/>
ambitious men, who can catch them no other <lb/>
way, set to catch the heedless multitude ? <lb/>
We, Lower Canadians, who at this distance <lb/>
cannot judge of the sentiments of Upper <lb/>
Canadians by our own observation, must de<lb break="no"/>pend for the formation of our opinions re<lb break="no"/>specting them on the Upper Canada news<lb break="no"/>papers, and on the speeches of their members <lb/>
in this House. They are the only sources of <lb/>
information which we possess. Well, in 1862, <lb/>
we saw the Upper Canada leaders, except the <lb/>
President of the Council, who was wise enough <lb/>
to keep aloof, who are at the same time con<lb break="no"/>nected with the principal newspapers there, <lb/>
either as proprietors, editors or co-editors, ac<lb break="no"/>cept office under the MACDONALD-SICOTTE<lb/>
Government, the fundamental principle of <lb/>
which was equal representation of the two <lb/>
sections, a principle which entitled it to the <lb/>
cordial support of Lower Canada. These <lb/>
gentlemen we saw reelected, notwithstanding <lb/>
their abandonment of their principles, and we <lb/>
found them voting against representation by <lb/>
population. From this I conclude that Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada is much more indifferent, and its <lb/>
leaders much less sincere touching this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the representation, than they would <lb/>
have us believe. Were it otherwise, Upper <lb/>
Canada would have taken the opportunity, <lb/>
afforded by the election, of
punishing the men <lb/>
who had betrayed her. But who are those two <lb/>
men who now pitch their voices in harmony <lb/>
(formerly so discordant to predict civil war, <lb/>
if we do not vote for Confederation ? They <lb/>
are the Attorney General for Lower Canada, <lb/>
and the President of the Council (Hon. Messrs. <lb/>
CARTIER and BROWN !)—the one demanding <lb/>
representation by population, the other refus<lb break="no"/>ing it : both took their stand as the champions <lb/>
of their sections, and became their chieftains <lb/>
respectively. When they found out that that <lb/>
game was unprofitable to both, as
the Presi<lb break="no"/>ident of the Council seemed to be excluded
for <lb/>
ever from the ministerial benches, and the <lb/>
Attorney General could not maintain himself <lb/>
in his position on them, the Attorney General <lb/>
gave way : he agreed to representation by <lb/>
population, trying to disguise it under the <lb/>
name of Confederation ; and to reward him <lb/>
for this complaisance, the President of the <lb/>
Council saved him—him and his colleagues<lb break="no"/>and condescended to take a seat among them.<lb/>
They hold over us a threat of civil war to <lb/>
          

            <pb n="358" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0358.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">358</fw>
         
         force us to ratify their bargain. There
is <lb/>
only one man in Canada who could have done <lb/>
what the Attorney General for Lower Canada <lb/>
has done, and that man is himself. Thanks <lb/>
to his energy, to his intimate acquaintance <lb/>
with the strong and the weak points of his <lb/>
fellow-countrymen, the Attorney General for <lb/>
Lower Canada has succeeded in attaining an <lb/>
elevation which no one can dispute with him <lb/>
—that of chief of the French Canadian na<lb break="no"/>tionality. To attain this eminence, he has <lb/>
crushed the weak, cajoled the strong, deceived <lb/>
the credulous, bought up the venal, and exalt<lb break="no"/>ed the ambitious ; by turns he has called in <lb/>
the accents of religion and stimulated the <lb/>
clamour of interest—he has gained his end. <lb/>
When Lower Canada heard of his alliance <lb/>
with the President of the Council, there arose <lb/>
from all quarters one universal cry of indig<lb break="no"/>nation. He managed to convert the cry
of <lb/>
anger into a shout of admiration. When his <lb/>
scheme of Confederation became public, a <lb/>
feeling of uneasiness pervaded all minds ; <lb/>
that instinct forewarned them of the danger <lb/>
which impended. He has hushed that feel<lb break="no"/>ing to a sleep of profound security. I shall <lb/>
compare him to a man who has gained the <lb/>
unbounded confidence of the public, who takes <lb/>
advantage of it to set up a Savings Bank, in <lb/>
which the rich man deposits his wealth, and <lb/>
the day laborer the small amount which he <lb/>
has squeezed out of his wages, against a day <lb/>
of need—both without a voucher. When that <lb/>
man has gathered all into his strong box, he <lb/>
finds an opportunity to purchase, at the cost <lb/>
of all he holds in trust, the article on which <lb/>
he has long set his ambitious eye ; and he buys <lb/>
it, unhesitatingly, without a thought of the <lb/>
wretches who are doomed to ruin by his con<lb break="no"/>duct. The deposit committed to the keeping <lb/>
of the Attorney General is the fortune of the <lb/>
French-Canadians—their nationality. That <lb/>
fortune had not been made in a day ; it was <lb/>
the accumulation of the toil and the savings <lb/>
of a whole people in a whole century. To <lb/>
prolong the ephemeral existence of his admin<lb break="no"/>istration for a few months, the Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral has sacrificed, without a scruple, this <lb/>
precious trust, which the unbounded con<lb break="no"/>fidence of his fellow-countrymen had confided <lb/>
to his keeping. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName>—And what have I <lb/>
received in payment for that ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—A salary of five thousand dol<lb break="no"/>lars annum, and the honor of the position. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName>—That is not enough <lb/>
for me. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—I am well aware of it ; that<lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               is why the honorable member is desirous
of <lb/>
extending the circle of his operations. But <lb/>
he will not long enjoy the fruits of his trea<lb break="no"/>son ; by crushing the power of the French- <lb break="yes"/>
Canadians he has crushed his own, for upon <lb/>
them his existence depends. Does he believe <lb/>
in the sincerity of the friendship of the Liber<lb break="no"/>als of Upper Canada ? They fought with him <lb/>
for too long a time to allow of the existence <lb/>
of any sympathy between them and him, and <lb/>
now he has lost even their respect. They <lb/>
consented to ally themselves with him in <lb/>
order to obtain their object—representation <lb/>
by population ; but when they no longer <lb/>
stand in need of him, they will throw him <lb/>
aside like a worn-out tool. I look upon this <lb/>
threat of civil war as resembling a farce <lb/>
played by two comrades ; they shout out to <lb/>
us, "Take care, we are going to fight; we <lb/>
shall do some mischief if you don't hold us." <lb/>
Do not put yourselves out of the way to stop <lb/>
them ; you need not be alarmed, they will not <lb/>
fight. It is also said to us, "See how many <lb/>
changes of Ministry there have been since <lb/>
1862 ; can such a state of affairs continue <lb/>
any longer ?" I am free to admit that all those <lb/>
changes must have been very unpleasant for <lb/>
the different ministers who have succumbed <lb/>
under them, but has the country suffered <lb/>
much by them ? The condition of the finances <lb/>
of a nation is the touchstone of its prosperity. <lb/>
In 1862, the Minister of Finance, before re<lb break="no"/>signing, declared a deficit of five millions one <lb/>
hundred and fifty-two thousand dollars (page <lb/>
20 of his speech) ; for the year ending the 30th <lb/>
June last, there was a surplus of seven hun<lb break="no"/>dred and fifty thousand dollars. If all these <lb/>
changes of ministries had not taken place, it <lb/>
is impossible to say how large the deficit <lb/>
would have become by this time, as for sever<lb break="no"/>al years previous to 1862 it had gone on <lb/>
steadily increasing. These two reasons ad<lb break="no"/>vanced by ministers are merely intended as <lb/>
a veil to conceal the true motive for this com<lb break="no"/>plete revolution in our Constitution ; that <lb/>
true motive is simply a desire on their parts <lb/>
to remain in power. Without wishing to <lb/>
enter into all the details of the measure pro<lb break="no"/>posed to the House, which have been so
ably <lb/>
handled by the honorable member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga, more especially those relating to the <lb/>
Legislative Council, there are some which I <lb/>
cannot pass over in silence. The following <lb/>
are the paragraphs of the resolutions of the <lb/>
Quebec Conference which regulate the organi<lb break="no"/>zation of the Lower House of the Federal <lb/>
Legislature, principally in respect of the num<lb break="no"/>ber of representatives:-<lb/>

            <p>17. The basis of representation in the
House <lb/>
of Commons shall be population, as determined <lb/>
by the official census every ten years, and the <lb/>
number of members at first shall be 194, dis<lb break="no"/>tributed as follows : <lb/>

            <p> 18. Until the official census of 1871 has
been <lb/>
made up, there shall be no change in the number <lb/>
of representatives from the several sections. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 19. Immediately after the completion of
the <lb/>
census of 1871, and immediately after every <lb/>
decennial census thereafter, the representation <lb/>
from each section in the House of Commons <lb/>
shall be readjusted on the basis of population. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 20. For purpose of such readjustments,<lb/>
Lower
Canada shall always be assigned sixty-five <lb/>
members, and each of the other sections shall at <lb/>
each readjustment receive, for the ten years then <lb/>
next succeeding the number of members to which <lb/>
it will be entitled on the same ratio of represen<lb break="no"/>tation to population as Lower Canada will enjoy <lb/>
according to the census last taken by having <lb/>
sixty-five members. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 21. No reduction shall be made in the
number <lb/>
of members returned by any section, unless its <lb/>
population shall have decreased, relatively to the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> population of the whole Union, to the
extent of <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>five per centum. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 22. In computing at each decennial period
the <lb/>
number of members to which each section is en<lb break="no"/>titled, no fractional parts shall be considered, <lb/>
unless when exceeding one-half the number en<lb break="no"/>titling to a member, in which case a member <lb/>
shall be given for each such fractional part. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> I object to the 21st clause, because it
contains <lb/>
provisions which are unjust to Lower Canada. <lb/>
The full scope of that clause is not generally <lb/>
understood ; that proportion of five per cent. <lb/>
appears to be a very small affair, and yet, <lb/>
under certain circumstances, it might produce <lb/>
considerable results, which are not
taken into <lb/>
consideration in the explanations given on
that <lb/>
subject in the work written by the Honorable <lb/>
Mr. CAUCHON, which the Government has <lb/>
caused to be distributed (pages 72 to 87). <lb/>
It is difficult to foretell what the exact numer<lb break="no"/>ical increase of the several provinces will be <lb/>
from the present time to the next census in <lb/>
1871. The Honorable Mr. CAUCHON assumes, <lb/>
as the basis of his calculations, a rate of thirty <lb/>
per cent. Let us suppose the case to prove <lb/>
that in all the provinces (with the
exception <lb/>
of Lower Canada) the population increases <lb/>
by thirty per cent between 1861 and 1871, <lb/>
and that that of Lower Canada increases by <lb/>
thirty-four per cent. It may, perhaps, be <lb/>
objected to this that it is improbable. My <lb/>
reply is, that when we are discussing a scheme <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
         
         of such importance as that which is now
under <lb/>
our consideration, we should provide for all <lb/>
possible contingencies ; but this one is far <lb/>
from being impossible if the predictions of the <lb/>
Minister of Finance and the Attorney General, <lb/>
who promise to Lower Canada so brilliant a <lb/>
future under the Federal system, are fulfilled. <lb/>
If Lower Canada becomes the heart of the <lb/>
commercial life of the Confederation ; if the <lb/>
mines of copper, lead, silver, and gold which <lb/>
we have lately discovered should produce the <lb/>
same results that they produce everywhere <lb/>
else, that of attracting a great influx of popu<lb break="no"/>lation, I cannot be accused of any very great <lb/>
exaggeration in supposing that the population <lb/>
of Lower Canada may, between the years 1861 <lb/>
and 1871, increase by four per cent more <lb/>
than the population of the other provinccs. <lb/>
In the case which I have supposed the in<lb break="no"/>crease would be as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> According to this calculation, Lower
Canada <lb/>
would have, in 1871, a population of 1,488,<lb break="no"/>289 souls, which would have to be divided by <lb/>
65, that being the invariable number of repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives assigned to Lower Canada, in order <lb/>
to ascertain what will be the number of con<lb break="no"/>stituents for each representative in the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Parliament ; the result will be found to <lb/>
be 22,896. Upper Canada would have a <lb/>
            population of 1,814,918 souls, which,
divided <lb/>
       
    by 22,896, would give her seventy-nine
repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives instead of eighty-two. Nova Scotia <lb/>
would have a population of 430,114 souls, <lb/>
which would give her nineteen representatives <lb/>
as at present (eighteen and a fraction over the <lb/>
half). New Brunswick would have a popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 327,661 souls, which would give her <lb/>
fourteen representatives instead of fifteen. <lb/>
Newfoundland would have a population of<lb/>
169,000 souls, which would give her seven <lb/>
representatives instead of eight. Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island would have a population of <lb/>
104,984 souls, which would give her five <lb/>
members as at present (four and a fraction <lb/>
over the half). It will be seen that if the <lb/>
five other provinces were represented on the <lb/>
same scale as Lower Canada, they would, in <lb/>
1871, lose among them five members ; but as <lb/>
the total population of each will not have <lb/>
decreased by five per cent, relatively to the <lb/>
total population of the Confederated Provinces, <lb/>

            there will be no reduction in the number
of <lb/>
their representatives, in accordance with the <lb/>
provisions of this 21st clause. It is the <lb/>
interest of Lower Canada, more than of any <lb/>
other province, to watch with a jealous eye <lb/>
over the mechanism adopted for the organiza<lb break="no"/>tion of the Federal Legislature. In case of a <lb/>
vital question arising, we should have to coun<lb break="no"/>teract the votes of these five members (who <lb/>
ought, in justice, to be deducted from the <lb/>
representation of the other provinces) by those <lb/>
of five of our members, whose votes would <lb/>
thus be lost to us, as would also be the weight <lb/>
which their five united counties, with a total <lb/>
population of 114,480 (or 22,896 for each <lb/>
county), would throw into the scale. Other <lb/>
combinations of circumstances might arise <lb/>
which might prove even more disadvantageous <lb/>
to us. This subject naturally leads me to <lb/>
address myself to my French Canadian col<lb break="no"/>leagues ; I fear that my remarks may not be <lb/>
well received by all, but I hope that honorable <lb/>
members will be good enough to excuse my <lb/>
frankness in consideration of the great import<lb break="no"/>ance of the question. I have no right to <lb/>
maintain that all those who are favorably dis<lb break="no"/>posed towards Confederation are not acting in <lb/>
good faith ; it is not my wish to reproach <lb/>
them for acting according to their convictions, <lb/>
but in so acting they should not forget the <lb/>
duties which their charge imposes on them. <lb/>
It a well known fact that when the scheme <lb/>
of Confederation was laid before the pub<lb break="no"/>lic, all the newspapers, and most of the <lb/>
members who support the Administration, <lb/>
declared themselves in favor of the scheme, <lb/>
but, in nearly every instance, with an ex<lb break="no"/>press reservation of the right to introduce <lb/>
certain amendments which they considered <lb/>
indispensable. But the Honorable Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General for Upper Canada declared, <lb/>
some days ago, that the Government would <lb/>
accept no amendment, and that the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions must be adopted exactly in the shape in <lb/>
which they were brought down. Are honor<lb break="no"/>able members going to submit to this decree ? <lb/>
Is it not their intention at least to make an <lb/>
effort to have those amendments, which they <lb/>
looked upon as indispensable, adopted ? Their <lb/>
position in relation to the Government confers <lb/>
upon them an influence which they can never <lb/>
exert more usefully than at present ; it is <lb/>
their duty to exert that influence ; they are <lb/>
responsible for the results of this measure, <lb/>
which cannot be adopted without their con<lb break="no"/>currence. Their principal argument in sup<lb break="no"/>port of Confederation is that we have now an <lb/>
excellent opportunity of obtaining favorable <lb/>
       
            <cb/> 
         
         conditions—an opportunity which will
proba<lb break="no"/>bly never occur again, and one of which it is <lb/>
their duty to avail themselves. But have the <lb/>
honorable members made those conditions ? <lb/>
Have they taken as great precautions to pre<lb break="no"/>serve intact the interests of nearly a million <lb/>
French Canadians entrusted to their care, as <lb/>
they would have taken in making an agree<lb break="no"/>ment for the sale of a farm, or even the pur<lb break="no"/>chase of a horse ? Have they made any con<lb break="no"/>ditions at all ? If they have made no condi<lb break="no"/>tions, do they at least know what the fate is <lb/>
that is reserved for us ? Do they know the <lb/>
nature of the form of Government which will <lb/>
be imposed on Lower Canada? Can they <lb/>
say whether we shall have Responsible Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment ? No ! for the Ministry refuses to <lb/>
speak ; it will only speak when the measure <lb/>
of Confederation shall have been adopted, and <lb/>
when it is too late to raise any objections. <lb/>
Responsible government would not be a very <lb/>
efficacious remedy for the evils which I fore<lb break="no"/>see, but it would, at all events, be a means of <lb/>
defence for us, and we ought not to reject it. <lb/>
It is true that, accordig to the 4lst article <lb/>
of the resolutions, " The local
governments <lb/>
and legislature of each province shall be con<lb break="no"/>structed in such manner as the existing legis<lb break="no"/>lature of each such province shall provide." <lb/>
But the English element is at present in the <lb/>
majority. We are told that the English are <lb/>
naturally favorable to responsible
govern<lb break="no"/>ment. That is true when it relates to them<lb break="no"/>selves ; for how many years did Canada re<lb break="no"/>main without responsible government ? The <lb/>
painful events of 1837 and 1838 were the <lb/>
result of that anomaly in the parliamentary <lb/>
system. Upper Canada will not need, as we <lb/>
shall, a local responsible government ; it will <lb/>
not have, as we shall have, to defend a nation<lb break="no"/>ality which will be in a minority in the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Parliament, but which, at least, ought to <lb/>
enjoy in Lower Canada those powers which <lb/>
parliamentary authority everywhere accords <lb/>
to the majority. Upper Canada only desires <lb/>
to make of her local legislature a municipal <lb/>
council on a large scale ; she will fight out <lb/>
her quarrels in the wider arena of the <lb/>
Federal Parliament. The English of Lower <lb/>
Canada, who will gain nothing by having a
<lb/>
responsible local government, because that <lb/>
government is the government of the major<lb break="no"/>ity, will unite their votes with those of Upper <lb/>
Canada to impose upon us the same system <lb/>
of government as in the other section. The <lb/>
local parliaments, in the event of that system <lb/>
being adopted, having no part in the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, will
soon become perfectly useless, and <lb/>
       
            <pb n="361" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0361.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">361</fw>
      
      they will soon be dispensed with, just as
in a <lb/>
machine we do away with useless and expen<lb break="no"/>sive wheelwork. Nothing will then be left to <lb/>
us but the legislative union which the honor<lb break="no"/>able members have not ventured to propose,<lb/>
because they are compelled to admit it would <lb/>
be an act of crying injustice to Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada. But we are told to rely on article 42, <lb/>
which gives to the local legislatures the right <lb/>
of amending or changing their Constitutions <lb/>
from time to time, and it is said that when <lb/>
Lower Canada is separated from Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada, she may alter her Constitution if she <lb/>
pleases, and adapt it to her own views. It <lb/>
 must not be forgotten, however,
that the <lb/>
Lieutenant-Governor, who will enjoy the <lb/>
right of reserving the bills of the Local Par<lb break="no"/>liament for the sanction of the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, will be appointed by the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral in Council, that is to say, by the Federal <lb/>
Government, and, as a matter of course, it <lb/>
must be expected that he will act in conform<lb break="no"/>ity with the views of the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Any bill reserved by him will require <lb/>
to be sanctioned by the Federal Government, <lb/>
which may refuse such sanction if they think <lb/>
proper, as they undoubtedly will as regards <lb/>
any bill the object of which might be to give <lb/>
responsible government to Lower Canada, <lb/>
whilst all the other provinces would only have <lb/>
governments which were not responsible. And <lb/>
the militia,—it will be exclusively under the <lb/>
control of the Federal Government. Have <lb/>
the honorable the French-Canadian members, <lb/>
to whom I more particularly address myself <lb/>
at this moment, reflected on the danger to us <lb/>
that is contained in this provision ? It is with <lb/>
reluctance that I once more allude to the dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties which may arise between the different <lb/>
sections of the Confederacy, but it would be <lb/>
wrong to shut our eyes to the future for fear <lb/>
that it may appear too threatening. Did we <lb/>
not, a few days ago, hear one of the honorable <lb/>
members, who most warmly supports the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, complain in this House that Upper <lb/>
Canada was going to have four military <lb/>
schools, whilst Lower Canada would only have <lb/>
two ? Why should we vest in the Federal <lb/>
Government the right of giving instruction in <lb/>
the military art and of arming the other <lb/>
provinces at the expense of Lower Canada ? <lb/>
Why, while there is yet time,
should we ne<lb break="no"/>glect to take those salutary precautions on <lb/>
which our existence as French-Canadians de<lb break="no"/>pend? Our Local Government ought to have <lb/>
the same active part in the organization, in<lb break="no"/>struction and equipment of our militia which <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
               belongs to all local governments which
form <lb/>
part of other confederacies. But I was for<lb break="no"/>getting that this is to be a model Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, which is to unite within itself all the <lb/>
evils of the Federative system without includ<lb break="no"/>ing one of its advantages. I read in the work <lb/>
in favor of Confederation, to which I have <lb/>
referred on more than one occasion, page 25, <lb/>
as follows: "With them we offer protection <lb/>
to your religion, to your institutions, and to <lb/>
your civil laws," &amp;c., &amp;c. They offer to protect <lb/>
the French-Canadians ; but when, under the <lb/>
present Constitution, they can protect them<lb break="no"/>selves, why should they abdicate the
right of so <lb/>
doing ? Now they are strongly entrenched in <lb/>
their citadel, and they are advised to raze the <lb/>
walls in order to secure their safety. The <lb/>
French Canadians, at the present day, are in a <lb/>
better position than they were at the time of <lb/>
the union. They are at the same time both <lb/>
judges and suitors. They are asked to adopt <lb/>
a new form of government ; it is not imposed <lb/>
upon them ; and, to induce them to do so, <lb/>
the hon. Minister of Agriculture tells them that <lb/>
this new form of government was recommended <lb/>
successively by Chief Justice SEWELL, Judge <lb/>
ROBINSON, and Lord DURHAM. The names <lb/>
alone of these three men ought to suffice to <lb/>
open our eyes ; their avowed object always <lb/>
was to obliterate French-Canadian nationality, <lb/>
to blend the races into one only, and that the <lb/>
English ; and to attain that end they recom<lb break="no"/>mended, as the Minister of Agriculture has <lb/>
told us, the system of government now sub<lb break="no"/>mitted for our approval. In the last passage, <lb/>
a few lines of which I have just cited, we <lb/>
find at age 25 a phrase upon which I have <lb/>
reflected seriously ; it is as follows, and is <lb/>
placed
by the author in the mouths of the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>English-Canadians of Lower Canada, " Re<lb break="no"/>member that we, too, are inhabitants of Lower <lb/>
Canada, and that we, too, aspire to other and <lb/>
nobler destinies." I asked of myself, with <lb/>
all seriousness, what then are the aspirations <lb/>
of the French-Canadians ? I have always <lb/>
imagined, indeed I still imagine, that they all <lb/>
centre in one point, the maintenance of their <lb/>
nationality as a shield destined for the protec<lb break="no"/>tion of the institutions they hold most dear. <lb/>
For a whole century this has ever been the <lb/>
aim of the French-Canadians ; in the long <lb/>
years of adversity they have never for a mo<lb break="no"/>ment lost sight of it ; surmounting all obstacles, <lb/>
they have advanced step by step towards its <lb/>
attainment, and what progress have they not <lb/>
made ? What is their position to-day ? They <lb/>
number nearly a million, they have no longer, <lb/>
          
            <pb n="362" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-20_Page_0362.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">362</fw> 
        
        if they are true to themselves, to fear
the fate <lb/>
of Louisiana, which had not as many inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants, when it was sold by NAPOLEON to the <lb/>
United States, as Canada had in 1761. A <lb/>
people numbering a million does not vanish <lb/>
easily, especially when they are the owners of <lb/>
the soil. Their number is rapidly increasing. <lb/>
New townships are being opened in every <lb/>
direction, and being peopled with industrious <lb/>
settlers. In the Eastern Townships, which it <lb/>
was thought were destined to be peopled en<lb break="no"/>tirely by English settlers, these latter are <lb/>
slowly giving way to the French-Canadians. <lb/>
There is a friendly rivalry between the two <lb/>
races, a struggle of labor and energy ; contact <lb/>
with our fellow-countrymen of English origin <lb/>
has at last opened our eyes ; we have at last <lb/>
comprehended that in order to succeed, not <lb/>
only labor is needed, but well-directed and <lb/>
skilled labor, and we profit by their example <lb/>
and by the experience they have acquired in <lb/>
the old countries of Europe. Agriculture <lb/>
with us is now becoming an honorable pursuit ; <lb/>
the man of education is no longer ashamed to <lb/>
devote himself to it. Our farmers feel the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity and desire of attaining perfection
in the <lb/>
art. We possess magnificent model farms, in <lb/>
which we can learn the science of agriculture. <lb/>
We are entering a new era of prosperity. <lb/>
The French-Canadians hold a distinguished <lb/>
position in the commerce of the country ; <lb/>
they have founded banks and savings banks ; <lb/>
on the St. Lawrence between Quebec and <lb/>
Montreal, they own one of the finest lines of <lb/>
steamboats in America ; there is not a parish <lb/>
on the great river which has not its steamboat ; <lb/>
the communications with the great towns are <lb/>
easy ; we have railways, and we now measure <lb/>
by hours the duration of a journey which for<lb break="no"/>merly we measured by days ; we have foun<lb break="no"/>dries and manufactories, and our shipbuild<lb break="no"/>ers have obtained a European renown. We <lb/>
have a literature peculiarly our own ; we have <lb/>
authors, of whom we are justly proud ; to them <lb/>
we entrust our language and our history ; they <lb/>
are the pillars of our nationality. Nothing de<lb break="no"/>notes our existence as a people so much as our lit<lb break="no"/>erature ; education has penetrated everywhere ; <lb/>
we have several excellent colleges, and an uni<lb break="no"/>versity in which all the sciences may be studied <lb/>
under excellent professors. Our young men <lb/>
learn in the military schools how to defend <lb/>
their country. We possess all the elements <lb/>
of a nationality. But a few months ago, we <lb/>
were steadily advancing towards prosperity, <lb/>
satisfied with the present and confident in the <lb/>
future of the French-Canadian people. Sud<lb break="no"/>denly discouragement, which had never over<lb break="no"/><cb/>come us in our adversity, takes
possession of<lb/>
us ; our aspirations are now only empty <lb/>
dreams ; the labors of a century must be <lb/>
wasted ; we must give up our nationality, <lb/>
adopt a new one, greater and nobler, we are <lb/>
told, than our own, but then it will no longer <lb/>
be our own. And why? Because it is our <lb/>
inevitable fate, against which it is of no use <lb/>
to struggle. But have we not already strug<lb break="no"/>gled against destiny when we were more feeble <lb/>
than we are now, and have we not triumphed ? <lb/>
Let us not give to the world the sad spectacle <lb/>
of a people voluntarily resigning its nation<lb break="no"/>ality. Nor do we intend to do so.
Let the <lb/>
people have time given them to understand <lb/>
the question ; let their opinion on the subject <lb/>
be obtained at the polls. It is but their right, <lb/>
unless our form of government is a delusion <lb/>
and a snare. If the measure is a good one, <lb/>
what danger is there in discussing it ? If the <lb/>
new Constitution it is proposed to give us is <lb/>
to last for centuries, why should we not at <lb/>
least endeavor to make it as perfect as possi<lb break="no"/>ble ? Why press its adoption before it is <lb/>
understood ? In conclusion, I object to the <lb/>
proposed Confederation, first, as a Canadian, <lb/>
without reference to origin, and secondly, as <lb/>
a French-Canadian. From either point of <lb/>
view, I look upon the measure as a fatal error ; <lb/>
and, as a French-Canadian, I once more appeal <lb/>
to my fellow-countrymen, reminding them of the <lb/>
precious inheritance confided to their keeping <lb/>
—an inheritance sanctified by the blood of <lb/>
their fathers, and which it is their duty to <lb/>
hand down to their children as unimpaired as <lb/>
the received it. (Cheers.) <lb/></p>

was then adjourned. <lb/>

 —It is not without some degree of hesitation <lb/>
 that I rise to address the
House on this <lb/>
 occasion ; for I see before me
the represent<lb break="no"/>atives of two millions and a
half of people, <lb/>
 who are called together to settle the most <lb/>
 weighty matters which concern them, and <lb/>
 more particularly to take into
consideration <lb/>
 a question involving the
destiny, not only of <lb/>
 the two Canadas, but also of
all the Provin<lb break="no"/>ces of British North America. I
must con<lb break="no"/>fess that I experience a strong
feeling of <lb/>
 hesitation and great diffidence
of my own <lb/>
 powers, when I consider the
importance of <lb/>
 the measure submitted to us for
discussion, <lb/>
