<!--<p>
     distinction between Papists and Protestants. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I never used the terms "Papist," or 
     <lb/>
     " Catholic," or " Protestant." (Hear, hear) 
     <lb/>
     The distinction I drew, and the remarks I 
     <lb/>
     made, were with regard to the English and 
     <lb/>
     the French of Lower Canada. And honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen will remember that I distinctly ad<lb break="no"/>mitted what the Premier had claimed for his 
     <lb/>
     countrymenâ€”namely, their well-known liber<lb break="no"/>ality. I have always admitted that, and have 
     <lb/>
     never had any disposition to deny it. But 
     <lb/>
     my argument was that, in establishing a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, our rights and interests should be 
     <lb/>
     protected by distinct provisions in that Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     stitutionâ€”that these would form the only 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory assurance we could getâ€”that we 
     <lb/>
     could not rest upon the liberality of any class 
     <lb/>
     of men, but must have the assurance of dis<lb break="no"/>tinct guarantees. That was the line of argu<lb break="no"/>ment pursued. (Hear, hear.) I do not 
     <lb/>
     think the Premier should have been so hard 
     <lb/>
     upon me for not stipulating that the ten men 
     <lb/>
     who should, be chosen in the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be old men, so that they might 
     <lb/>
     not have the advantage of putting in young 
     <lb/>
     men as an offset to our old ones. When I 
     <lb/>
     see, in the case of the Premier himself, at 
     <lb/>
     his advanced years, the youthful fire burn 
     <lb/>
     up so brightly, and that age does not at all 
     <lb/>
     detract from the vigor he manifests, I think 
     <lb/>
     he must excuse me for not having made 
     <lb/>
     an invidious distinction between old men and 
     <lb/>
     young ones. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>, in resuming the 
     <lb/>
     adjourned debate on Confederation, saidâ€” 
     <lb/>
     I should have desired to make my remarks 
     <lb/>
     to the House in French, but considering the 
     <lb/>
     large number of honorable members who are 
     <lb/>
     not familiar with that language, I think it 
     <lb/>
     my duty to speak at the present time in 
     <lb/>
     English. In rising on this occasion to ad<lb break="no"/>dress the House on the important question 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us, I must say I do so with an 
     <lb/>
     unusual degree of embarrassment, not only 
     <lb/>
     on account of the importance of the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of our deliberations, but also because I 
     <lb/>
     have to differ from many of those with whom 
     <lb/>
     I have been in the habit of acting ever since 
     <lb/>
     I first entered into political life. Yet, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, when I consider the questions 
     <lb/>
     raised by the resolutions submitted by the 
     <lb/>
     Government, I find that whether they be 
     <lb/>
     purely political ones, such as the proposal to 
     <lb/>
     restrict the influence and control of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple over the Legislature of the country by 
     <lb/>
     substituting a Chamber nominated by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown for an Elective Legislative Council, or 
     <lb/>
     whether they are purely commercial in their 
     <lb/>
     character, such as that regarding the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, or the larger question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation itself, I still hold the same 
     <lb/>
     views that I held, in common with others 
     <lb/>
     who have now changed their opinions, when 
     <lb/>
     the subjects were first mooted. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And as I have not heard, since the first 
     <lb/>
     opening of this debate, any reason for sub<lb break="no"/>stituting a nominated for an elective Upper 
     <lb/>
     Chamber that was not fully argued out in 
     <lb/>
     1856, when, by an overwhelming majority 
     <lb/>
     of this House, it was decided that the elec<lb break="no"/>tive principle should prevailâ€”as I have 
     <lb/>
     not heard any reason why we should pledge 
     <lb/>
     our credit and resources to the construction 
     <lb/>
     of the Intercolonial Railway, even previous 
     <lb/>
     to any estimate of its cost being made, that 
     <lb/>
     was not urged in 1862 when the question was 
     <lb/>
     before the countryâ€”nor any reason for inter<lb break="no"/>colonial union that was not raised in 1858, 
     <lb/>
     when the present Hon. Finance Minister 
     <lb/>
    pressed the question on the attention of the 
     <lb/>Imperial authoritiesâ€”I do not see on what 
     <lb/>ground these several subjects which were 
     <lb/>then so unpopular, and those views which 
     <lb/>were then most universally repudiated, 
     <lb/>should now be more favorably considered by 
     <lb/>the people of this countryâ€”I fail to perceive 
     <lb/>why those once unpalatable measures, now 
     <lb/>

     coupled with additions to the burdens of the 
     <lb/>
     people, should have grown into the public 
     <lb/>
     favor. I cannot understand why I or any 
     <lb/>
     members of this House should change our 
     <lb/>
     views merely because certain other members 
     <lb/>
     have, when we do not conscientiously think 
     <lb/>
     such change would be for the benefit of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I say, sir, that I am quite entitled 
     <lb/>
     to maintain the same views now that I have 
     <lb/>
     always entertained. (Hear.) This scheme, 
     <lb/>
     sir, is submitted to us on two grounds ; first, 
     <lb/>
     the necessity for meeting the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties which have arisen between Upper  
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada, owing to the growing 
     <lb/>
     demands on the part of Upper Canada for 
     <lb/>
     representation by population ; and, secondly, 
     <lb/>
     the necessity for providing more efficient 
     <lb/>
     means for the defence of the country than 
     <lb/>
     now exist. These are the only two grounds 
     <lb/>
     we have heard stated for the propositions 
     <lb/>
     now submitted to us ; and, sir, I shall apply 
     <lb/>
     myself to explain my views on these two 
     <lb/>
     subjects, and also upon the scheme generally. 
     <lb/>
     When on the first question, I trust I shall 
     <lb/>
     be permitted to go a little into the history 
     <lb/>
     of the agitation of representation by pop<lb break="no"/>ulation, for I owe it to myself, to my 
     <lb/>
     constituents and the country. My name 
     <lb/>
     has been used in various ways. It has some<lb break="no"/>times been said that I was entirely favorable 
     <lb/>
     to representation by populationâ€”at other 
     <lb/>
     times that I was entirely favorable to the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the provinces, and I will 
     <lb/>
     now endeavor, once more, to state as clearly 
     <lb/>
     as possible what my real views have been and 
     <lb/>
     still are. ( Hear.) The first time represen<lb break="no"/>tation by population was mooted in this 
     <lb/>
     House, on behalf of Upper Canada, was, I 
     <lb/>
     believe, in the Session of 1852, when the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party took it up, and the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Sir ALLAN MACNAB moved resolutions in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of the principle. We then found the con<lb break="no"/>servatives arrayed in support of this constitu<lb break="no"/>tional change. It had been mooted before on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of Lower Canada, but the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canadians had all opposed it. I think 
     <lb/>
     two votes were taken in 1852, and on one of 
     <lb/>
     these occasions the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West (Hon. J. A. MACDONALD) voted for 
     <lb/>
     it ; it came up incidentally. In 1854 the 
     <lb/>
     MACNAB-MORIN coalition took place, and we 
     <lb/>
     heard no more of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion from that quarterâ€”that is, as mooted 
     <lb/>
     by the Conservative party, who from that 
     <lb/>
     moment uniformly opposed it on every occa<lb break="no"/>sion. It was, however, taken up by the present 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, the member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford, and with the energy and 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
          

     vigor he brings to bear on every question he 
     <lb/>
     takes in hand, he caused such an agitation 
     <lb/>
     in its behalf as almost threatened a revolu<lb break="no"/>tion. As the agitation in the country in<lb break="no"/>creased, so did the vote for it in this House 
     <lb/>
     increase, and on several occasions I expressed 
     <lb/>
     my views upon the subject. I never shirked 
     <lb/>
     the questionâ€”I never hesitated to say that 
     <lb/>
     something ought to be done to meet the just 
     <lb/>
     claims of Upper Canada, and that represen<lb break="no"/>tation based on population was in the abstract 
     <lb/>
     a just and correct principle. I held, at the 
     <lb/>
     same time, there were reasons why Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada could not grant it ; I entreated Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadian representatives to show themselves 
     <lb/>
     disposed to meet the views of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     by making, at any rate, a counter proposi<lb break="no"/>tion ; and in 1856, when Parliament was 
     <lb/>
     sitting in Toronto, I, for the first time, sug<lb break="no"/>gested that one means of getting over the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty would be to substitute for the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Legislative union a Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     the two Canadas, by means of which all local 
     <lb/>
     questions could be consigned to the delibera<lb break="no"/>tions of local legislatures, with a Central 
     <lb/>
     government having control of commercial 
     <lb/>
     and other questions of common or general 
     <lb/>
     interest. I stated that, considering the 
     <lb/>
     different religious faith, the different lan<lb break="no"/>guage, the different laws that prevailed in 
     <lb/>
     the two sections of the country, this was the 
     <lb/>
     best way to meet the difficulty ; to leave to a 
     <lb/>
     general government questions of trade, cur<lb break="no"/>rency, banking, public works of a general 
     <lb/>
     character, &amp;c., and to commit to the decision 
     <lb/>
     of local legislatures all matters of a local 
     <lb/>
     bearing. At the same time I stated that, if 
     <lb/>
     these views should not prevail, I would cer<lb break="no"/>tainly go for representation by population, 
     <lb/>
     and such checks and guarantees as would 
     <lb/>
     secure the interests of each section of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and preserve to Lower Canada its 
     <lb/>
     cherished institutions. (Hear, hear.) This 
     <lb/>
     speech, sir, has been twisted in all sorts of 
     <lb/>
     ways. I have heard it quoted to prove that 
     <lb/>
     I was in favor of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion, pure and simple ; that I was in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a Confederation of the provinces and for 
     <lb/>
     several other purposes, just as it suited 
     <lb/>
     the occasion or the purpose of those who 
     <lb/>
    quoted it. (Hear and laughter.) The first 
     <lb/>time the matter was put to a practical test 
     <lb/>was in 1858. On the resignation of the 
     <lb/>MACDONALD-CARTIER Administration, the 
     <lb/>BROWN-DORIAN Government was formed, 
     <lb/>and one of the agreements made between its 
     <lb/>members was that the constitutional question 
     <lb/>should be taken up and settled, either by a 
     <lb/>
           

    
            <pb n="247" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0247.jpg"/>

     Confederation of the two provinces or by 
     <lb/>
     representation according to population, with 
     <lb/>
     such checks and guarantees as would secure 
     <lb/>
     the religious faith, the laws, the language, 
     <lb/>
     and the peculiar institutions of each section 
     <lb/>
     of the country from encroachments on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the other. The subject came up 
     <lb/>
     again in the latter part of 1850, when the 
     <lb/>
     Toronto Convention took place. I should, 
     <lb/>
     however, first say that, when the BROWN- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     DORION Administration was formed, the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. the President of the Council urged 
     <lb/>
     very strongly that representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion should be taken up as the method by 
     <lb/>
     which to settle the constitutional question ; 
     <lb/>
     while, on the contrary, I saw the difficulty 
     <lb/>
     of so taking it up, even with such checks 
     <lb/>
     and guarantees as were spoken of, and made 
     <lb/>
     the counter-proposition that a Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of the two provinces should be formed. Of 
     <lb/>
     course as our Administration was so short- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     lived, the subject was not discussed in all its 
     <lb/>
     bearings ; but if we could have come to an 
     <lb/>
     agreement on one or the other mode, that 
     <lb/>
     one would have been submitted as the solu<lb break="no"/>tion for the evils complained ofâ€”it being 
     <lb/>
     however distinctly understood that I would 
     <lb/>
     not attempt to carry any such measure 
     <lb/>
     through without obtaining for it a majority 
     <lb/>
     from Lower Canada. I would never have 
     <lb/>
     tried to make any change in the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     without ascertaining that the people in my 
     <lb/>
     own section of the province were in favor of 
     <lb/>
     such a change. ( Hear.) To return to the 
     <lb/>
     Toronto Convention. I was invited to attend 
     <lb/>
     it, but though I was unable to do so, certain 
     <lb/>
     communications took place, and a meeting 
     <lb/>
     of the liberal members of the House from 
     <lb/>
    Lower Canada was held, and a document 
     <lb/>issued, signed by the present Minister of 
     <lb/>Agriculture (Hon. Mr. MCGEE), Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>DESSAULLES, Hon. Mr. DRUMMOND, and 
     <lb/>myself. The document was given to the 
     <lb/>public for the purpose of setting forth the 
     <lb/>views which we held  as to the settlement of 
     <lb/>the difficulty. Pretended extracts have 
     <lb/>been given from that document, as from my 
     <lb/>speech, to attempt to prove all sorts of things 
     <lb/>as being my views, but I can show most 
     <lb/>clearly that the proposition made in it was 
     <lb/>just that which had been made in 1858, 
     <lb/>viz, the Confederation of the two provinces, 
     <lb/>with some joint authority for both. Both 
     <lb/>at that time, and at the time of the forma<lb break="no"/>tion of the BROWN-DORIAN Administration, 
     <lb/>various suggestions were made as to the 
     <lb/>carrying out of the plan of confederating the 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
         

     two Canadas. Some thought that two 
     <lb/>
     entirely distinct legislatures should be form<lb break="no"/>ed ; one local for Lower Canada, another 
     <lb/>
     local for Upper Canada, with a general 
     <lb/>
     legislature acting for both. Others suggest<lb break="no"/>ed the idea that the same legislature might 
     <lb/>
     fulfil all puposes ; that the same body might 
     <lb/>
     meet and deliberate on questions of common 
     <lb/>
     interest, and that the members for each 
     <lb/>
     section might then separate and discuss all 
     <lb/>
     matters of a sectional character. Others, 
     <lb/>
     again, said the same result might be obtained 
     <lb/>
     by having but one legislature, and insisting 
     <lb/>
     that no laws affecting either section of the 
     <lb/>
     province should be carried, unless with the 
     <lb/>
     support of a majority from the section 
     <lb/>
     affected by them. These three plans were 
     <lb/>
     suggestedâ€”the first to have two entirely 
     <lb/>
     distinct legislative bodies, one for general 
     <lb/>
     purposes, others for local ones ; the second, 
     <lb/>
     to have one legislature, of which the parts 
     <lb/>
     should have the right to act separately for 
     <lb/>
     local objects, after general business had been 
     <lb/>
    disposed of ; the third, to have but one body, 
     <lb/>but to resolve that no legislative act of a 
     <lb/>local nature should pass without the consent 
     <lb/>of a majority of the representatives from 
     <lb/>that locality. (Hear, hear.) The document 
     <lb/>to which I have just referred, issued in 
     <lb/>October, 1859, contained this language on 
     <lb/>the subject :â€”

     Well, Sir, I have not a word of all this 
     <lb/>
     to take back. I still hold to the same 
     <lb/>
     views, the same opinions. I still think that 
     <lb/>
     a Federal union of Canada might hereafter 
     <lb/>
     extend so as to embrace other territories 
     <lb/>
     either west or east ; that such a system is 
     <lb/>
     well adapted to admit of territorial expan<lb break="no"/>sion without any disturbance of the federal 
     <lb/>
     economy, but I cannot understand how this 
     <lb/>
     plain sentence should be considered by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, or by other 
     <lb/>
     hon. members who have spoken in the 
     <lb/>
     other House, as any indication that I have 
     <lb/>
     ever been in favor of Confederation with 
     <lb/>
     the other British Provinces. There is 
     <lb/>
     nothing I have ever said or written that can 
     <lb/>
     be construed to mean that I was ever in 
     <lb/>
     favor of such a proposition. On the con<lb break="no"/>trary, whenever the question came up I set 
     <lb/>
     my face against it. I asserted that such a 
     <lb/>
     confederation could only bring trouble and 
     <lb/>
     embarrassment, that there was no social, no 
     <lb/>
     commercial connection between the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces proposed to be unitedâ€”nothing to 
     <lb/>
     justify their union at the present juncture. 
     <lb/>
     Of course I do not say that I shall be 
     <lb/>
     opposed to their Confederation for all time 
     <lb/>
     to come. Population may extend over the 
     <lb/>
     wilderness that now lies between the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces and ourselves, and commer<lb break="no"/><cb/>cial intercourse may increase sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     to render Confederation desirable. My 
     <lb/>
     speeches have been paraded of late in all 
     <lb/>
     the ministerial papersâ€”misconstrued, mis<lb break="no"/>translated, falsified in every wayâ€”for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of making the public believe that 
     <lb/>
     in former times I held different views from 
     <lb/>
     those I now do. A French paper has said 
     <lb/>
     that I called with all my heart for the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the provincesâ€”(<hi rendition="simple:italic">que j'appelais

     <lb/>
     and as I said in 1861 also, that I am opposed to 
     <lb/>
     this Confederation now. In the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror of Par<lb break="no"/>liament</hi> which contains a report, though a 
     <lb/>
     very bad one, of my speech in 1861, I find

     This is the speech which has been held 
     <lb/>
     to signify that I was anxious for Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, that I should like nothing better. 
     <lb/>
     Why ? I distinctly said that though the 
     <lb/>
     time might come when it would become 
     <lb/>
     necessary, it was not desirable under existing 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. (Hear, hear.) In 1862 I 
     <lb/>
     was not in Parliament ; the CARTIER-MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD Administration was dismissed, and 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend, the member for Cornwall 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. John S. MACDONALD), was called 
     <lb/>
     upon to form a new one. He applied to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SICOTTE to form the Lower Canada section 
     <lb/>
     while he himself undertook the formation of 
     <lb/>
    the Upper Canada portion. The question of 
     <lb/>representation by population then necessarily 
     <lb/>came up for settlementâ€”this time at the 
     <lb/>hands of the Liberal party who had voted for 
     <lb/>it year after yearâ€”and when I came down 
     <lb/>to Quebec, summoned by telegraph, I found 
     <lb/>the arrangements made, the policy of the 
     <lb/>new government was settled, representation 
     <lb/>by population was excluded. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The Liberal party from Upper Canada, sir, 
     <lb/>to my surprise, had decided that it was not 
     <lb/>to be taken upâ€”that they were going into 
     <lb/>office just as the Conservative party had done 
     <lb/>before on a similar occasion in 1854 ; they 
     <lb/>decided that they would sustain an Adminis 
     <lb/>tration which made it a closed question, and 
     <lb/>whose members all pledged themselves to 
     <lb/>vote against it. (Hear, hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">MR. RANKIN</persName>â€”No, no.

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”If not, I was mis<lb break="no"/>informed. I certainly understood that the

     <lb/>
     vote against the question of representation 
     <lb/>
     by population whenever it came up, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Upper Canada party would support the 
     <lb/>
     Administration so formed. At any rate the 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada Liberal party supported, for 
     <lb/>
     eleven months, a government pledged to ex<lb break="no"/>clude representation by population from the 
     <lb/>
     category of open questions, and agreed to lay 
     <lb/>
     that question aside.

     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”I hear an honorable 
     <lb/>gentleman say it was not so, that he did not 
     <lb/>agree to lay aside representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion then, but if he did not then has he not 
     <lb/>done so since ? He declared at a public 
     <lb/>meeting the other day that representation 
     <lb/>by population was no cure for the evils afflict<lb break="no"/>ing Upper Canada. The members from 
     <lb/>Upper Canada who had joined the MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD-SICOTTE Government had certainly 
     <lb/>abandoned representation by population, by 
     <lb/>entering into an Administration which bound 
     <lb/>every one of them to vote against it. The 
     <lb/>Hon. Provincial Secretary had stated pub<lb break="no"/>licly in Ottawa, in January, 1864, that it had 
     <lb/>been abandoned by the Liberal party at the 
     <lb/>Toronto Convention in 1859 ; and although 
     <lb/>he had at the time been soundly abused for 
     <lb/>this by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> and by those of his party 
     <lb/>who look to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> as their political gos<lb break="no"/>pel, he had now the satisfaction of seeing 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Lambton, and some 
     <lb/>others who formerly held very strong views 
     <lb/>on this question, acknowledge, as they had 
     <lb/>done at a public meeting  held at Toronto 
     <lb/>about three weeks ago, that they also con<lb break="no"/>sidered representation by population as ap<lb break="no"/>plied to Canada no remedy for the Upper 
     <lb/>Province, and that it was not a measure the 
     <lb/>liberals ought to insist upon, and that it had 
     <lb/>been abandoned. (Hear, hear and laughter.) 
     <lb/> Yes, the question was in effect abandoned 
     <lb/>when in November, 1859, six hundred 
     <lb/>delegates from all parts of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>attended the Reform Convention at Toronto, 
     <lb/>and agreed to advocate a Confederation of 
     <lb/>the two Canadas, by giving to each province 
     <lb/>a local legislature, with some joint authority, 
     <lb/>to carry on the general business common to 
     <lb/>both. The hon. member on my left was 
     <lb/>present on the occasionâ€” 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>â€”Yes I was.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”And the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber has told me that he never saw a more 
     <lb/>
     respectable, a more educated, or more intelli<lb break="no"/>gent assemblage brought together in such 
     <lb/>
                        <cb/>
           

     numbers to discuss public questions. But 
     <lb/>
     that scheme did not attract much attention 
     <lb/>
     out of the Convention. It took no hold on 
     <lb/>
     the popular mind. Shortly before that, in 
     <lb/>
     1858, the present Hon. Finance Minister, 
     <lb/>
     who then sat on the cross-benches, made a 
     <lb/>
     speech of two or three hours' duration, in 
     <lb/>
     which, with all that force and ability for 
     <lb/>
     which he is distinguished, he expounded and 
     <lb/>
     advocated the Confederation of the whole of 
     <lb/>
     the British North American Provinces. He 
     <lb/>
     was then assisted in its advocacy by the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Hon. Minister of Agriculture ; and, 
     <lb/>
     subsequently, on becoming a member of the 
     <lb/>
     CARTIER-MACDONALD Administration, he 
     <lb/>
     went to England and drew the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial authorities to the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of all those provinces. The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Finance Minister received an answer 
     <lb/>
     not very encouraging ; and that which he 
     <lb/>
     received from this country was still less en<lb break="no"/>couraging. There was not even an answer 
     <lb/>
     to his speech, able though it certainly was â€” 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p>HON. MR. HOLTONâ€”He never ven<lb break="no"/>tured to propose any resolution to Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON. MR. DORIONâ€”Though the Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration was formed with the understand<lb break="no"/>ing of effecting the Confederation of all the 
     <lb/>provinces, and it was the main plank of their 
     <lb/>platform, they never dared to submit the 
     <lb/>question to Parliament at all. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>Subsequently, in 1861, the hon. member 
     <lb/>for South Oxford brought forward a motion 
     <lb/>based on the resolution at the Toronto Con<lb break="no"/>vention. I spoke  and voted for it. It was in 
     <lb/>perfect accord with a notice I had given in 
     <lb/>1856, and which was read here by the Hon. 
     <lb/>President of the Council a few nights ago, 
     <lb/>and with my often-repeated declarations that 
     <lb/>I was willing to adopt some measure calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to remove existing difficulties, without 
     <lb/>doing injustice to either section ; but while 
     <lb/>I was willing to do justice to Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>I always declared that I would not do so by 
     <lb/>sacrificing the interests of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>or placing her in the position of having to 
     <lb/>beg for justice at the hands of the sister pro<lb break="no"/>vince. (Hear, hear.) I always stated that 
     <lb/>the difference existing in the religious faith 
     <lb/>of the people of the two sections, in their 
     <lb/>language, in their laws, in their prejudices 
     <lb/>evenâ€”for there are prejudices which were re<lb break="no"/>spectable and ought to be respectedâ€”would 
     <lb/>prevent any member from Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>representing a French constituency, from 
     <lb/>voting for representation by population, pure 
     <lb/>and simple, and thereby placing the people  of

     Lower Canada in the position of having to 
     <lb/>
     trust for the protection of their rights to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada, who would 
     <lb/>
     thereby have the majority in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. (Hear) There is at this moment a 
     <lb/>
     movement on the part of the British Pro<lb break="no"/>testants in Lower Canada to have some 
     <lb/>
     protection and guarantee for their educa<lb break="no"/>tional establishments in this province put 
     <lb/>
     into the scheme of Confederation, should it 
     <lb/>
     be adopted ; and far from finding fault with 
     <lb/>
     them, I respect them the more for their 
     <lb/>
     energy in seeking protection for their 
     <lb/>
     separate interests. I know that majorities 
     <lb/>
     are naturally aggressive and how the posses<lb break="no"/>sion of power engenders dispotism, and I 
     <lb/>
     can understand how a majority, animated 
     <lb/>
     this moment by the best feelings, might in 
     <lb/>
     six or nine months be willing to abuse its 
     <lb/>
     power and trample on the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     minority, while acting in good faith, and 
     <lb/>
     on what it considered to be its right. 
     <lb/>
     We know also the ill feelings that might 
     <lb/>
     be engendered by such a course. I think 
     <lb/>
     it but just that the Protestant minority 
     <lb/>
     should be protected in its rights in 
     <lb/>
     everything that was dear to it as a dis<lb break="no"/>tinct nationality, and should not lie at the 
     <lb/>
     discretion of the majority in this respect, 
     <lb/>
     and for this reason I am ready to extend to 
     <lb/>
     my Protestant fellow-citizens in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada of British origin, the fullest justice 
     <lb/>
     in all things, and I wish to see their interests 
     <lb/>
     as a minority guaranteed and protected in 
     <lb/>
     every scheme which may be adopted. With 
     <lb/>
     those views on the question of representa<lb break="no"/>tion, I pronounced in favor of a Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of the two Provinces of Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, as the best means of pro<lb break="no"/>moting the varied interests of the two sec<lb break="no"/>tions. But the Confederation I advocated 
     <lb/>
     was a real confederation, giving the largest 
     <lb/>
     powers to the local governments, and merely 
     <lb/>
     a delegated authority to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>mentâ€”in that respect differing <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi> from 
     <lb/>
     the one now proposed which gives all the 
     <lb/>
     powers to the Central Government, and 
     <lb/>
     reserves for the local governments the 
     <lb/>
     smallest possible amount of freedom of 
     <lb/>
     action. There is nothing besides in what I 
     <lb/>
     have ever written or said that can be inter<lb break="no"/>preted as favoring a Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. This I always opposed. 
     <lb/>
     There is no breach of confidence in my say<lb break="no"/>ing that in the conversations I had with the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, previous to 
     <lb/>
     his accepting office, since he has referred to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          

     them himself in a speech which he made 
     <lb/>
     when reelected at South Oxford, I posi<lb break="no"/>tively declined to support any proposi<lb break="no"/>tion for the Confederation of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Very true, sir, I did not refuse to 
     <lb/>
     vote for it in committee. I did not vote at 
     <lb/>
     allâ€”I was not present when the vote was 
     <lb/>
     taken, but I did not conceal my opposition to 
     <lb/>
     it. In that speech the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council also said :â€” 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Before the negotiations were gone through 
     <lb/>
     with, I warned the Hon. Messrs. HOLTON and DO<lb break="no"/>RION to take action, but they refused me. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I felt all the pain of a refusal, but they 
     <lb/>
     left me no resource. When the question was 
     <lb/>
     asked me by the Government, I said wanted six 
     <lb/>
     membersâ€”four from Upper and two from Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. When asked how many supporters I 
     <lb/>
     could bring from Lower Canada, I replied that 
     <lb/>
     since Hon. Mr. DORION did not act, I could bring 
     <lb/>
     no supporters. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     So, sir, I have the best evidence possible 
     <lb/>
     to repudiate the accusation that I was in 
     <lb/>
     favor of Confederation of all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     in the fact that, before there was any ques<lb break="no"/>tion at all as to who should go into the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, I statedâ€”and that in the hearing 
     <lb/>
     of several honorable members now presentâ€” 
     <lb/>
     that I would have nothing to do with it be<lb break="no"/>cause I did not conceive it would be for the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the country to have such a Con<lb break="no"/>federation, at all events at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) Now, sir, I think I have shown 
     <lb/>
     that I neither favored representation by 
     <lb/>
     population pure and simple, nor a Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the provinces ; and when honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen state that the necessity of settling 
     <lb/>
     the question of representation is the origin 
     <lb/>
     of this Federation scheme, they labor under 
     <lb/>
     a grave misapprehension. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     further from the fact. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     representation question wasalmost altogether 
     <lb/>
     abandonedâ€”was played out ; there was no 
     <lb/>
     agitation about it, and certainly less than 
     <lb/>
     there had been for the last ten years. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for South Oxford, after 
     <lb/>
     adopting the views of the Toronto Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, still persisted in advocating representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population, but so changed was the 
     <lb/>
     feeling that he could hardly get a debate on 
     <lb/>
     the motion he made last session for a com<lb break="no"/>mittee to consider the constitutional difficul<lb break="no"/>ties. There was then another cause for this 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme of which representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population was made the pretext. 
     <lb/>
     It is not so well known, but far more power<lb break="no"/>ful. In the year 1861, Mr. WATKIN was 
     <lb/>
     sent from England by the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="251" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0251.jpg"/>

     Railway Company . He came with the dis<lb break="no"/>tinct view of making a large claim on the 
     <lb/>
     country for aid, but in the then temper of 
     <lb/>
     the people, he soon found that he could not 
     <lb/>
     expect to obtain that. Thinking that if he 
     <lb/>
     only could put some new scheme afloat which 
     <lb/>
     would give a decent pretext to a well disposed 
     <lb/>
     Government, he would quietly get the assist<lb break="no"/>ance required, he immediately started for 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, and came back after 
     <lb/>
     inducing people there to resuscitate the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the Intercolonial Railway. Parties 
     <lb/>
     were readily found to advocate it, if Canada 
     <lb/>
     would only pay the piper. (Hear, and a 
     <lb/>
     laugh.) A meeting of delegates took place, 
     <lb/>
     resolutions were adopted, and an application 
     <lb/>
     was made to the Imperial Government for a 
     <lb/>
     huge contribution to its costs, in the shape 
     <lb/>
     of an indemnity for carrying the troops over 
     <lb/>
     the road. Mr. WATKIN and Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     VANKOUGHNET, who was then a member of 
     <lb/>
     the Government, went to England about 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, but the Imperial authorities 
     <lb/>
     were unwilling to grant the required assist<lb break="no"/>ance, and rejected their propositions. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     WATKIN, although baffled in his expectations, 
     <lb/>
     did not give up his project. He returned 
     <lb/>
     again to Canada, and by dint of perseverance, 
     <lb/>
     induced my honorable friend on my right 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. J. S. MACDONALD) and other honor<lb break="no"/>able members of his Cabinet to enter into his 
     <lb/>
     views. As to the advantages of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, I have not the slightest 
     <lb/>
     idea that my hon. friend had any suspicion 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever of the motives which animated 
     <lb/>
     these Grand Trunk officials, and that their 
     <lb/>
     object was to have another haul at the public 
     <lb/>
     purse for the Grand Trunkâ€”(laughter)â€” 
     <lb/>
     but this was the origin of the revival of the

     by which Canada was to pay five-twelfths 
     <lb/>
     and the Lower Provinces seven-twelfths. So 
     <lb/>
    unpopular was this arrangement that when 
     <lb/>its terms were made known, if a vote of the 
     <lb/>
           
    
            <cb/>
            

     people had been taken upon it, not ten out 
     <lb/>
     of every hundred, from Sandwich to GaspÃ©, 
     <lb/>
     would have declared in its favor, although 
     <lb/>
     Canada was only to pay five-twelfths of its 
     <lb/>
     cost. (Hear, hear.) This project having fail<lb break="no"/>ed, someother scheme had to be concocted for 
     <lb/>
     bringing aid and relief to the unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunkâ€”and the Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the British North American Provinces 
     <lb/>
     naturally suggested itself to the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk officials as the surest means of bring<lb break="no"/>ing with it the construction of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     Such was the origin of this Confederation 
     <lb/>
     scheme. The Grand Trunk people are at 
     <lb/>
     the bottom of it ; and I find that at the 
     <lb/>
     last meeting of the Grand Trunk Railway 
     <lb/>
     Company, Mr. WATKIN did in advance 
     <lb/>
     congratulate the shareholders and bond<lb break="no"/>holders on the bright prospects opening 
     <lb/>
     before them, by the enhanced value which 
     <lb/>
     will be given to their shares and bonds, by 
     <lb/>
     the adoption of the Confederation scheme 
     <lb/>
     and the construction of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     as part of the scheme. (Hear, hear.) I re<lb break="no"/>peat, sir, that representation by population 
     <lb/>
     had very little to do with bringing about 
     <lb/>
     
    this measure. The TACHÃ‰-MACDONALD 
     <lb/> Government were defeated because the House 
     <lb/>condemned them for taking without author<lb break="no"/>ity $100,000 out of the public chest for the 
     <lb/>Grand Trunk Railway, at a time when there 
     <lb/>had not been a party vote on representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population for one or two sessions. 
     <lb/>Those who had been the loudest in their 
     <lb/>advocacy of it, had let it drop. I was track<lb break="no"/>ed through Lower Canada as being willing 
     <lb/>to sell Lower Canada, grant representation 
     <lb/>by population, and destroy Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>institutions. I thank God, sir, I never in<lb break="no"/>sulted Upper Canada, like some of those 
     <lb/>who reviled me. I never compared the people 
     <lb/>of Upper Canada to so many codfish. I 
     <lb/>showed on the contrary that I was always 
     <lb/>willing to meet the just claims of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada. (Hear, hear.) Well, without any 
     <lb/>demand whatever for the agitation of this 
     <lb/>question, the moment the Government was 
     <lb/>defeated and there was a necessity for resign<lb break="no"/>ing or going before the people, these gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite prepared to embrace their 
     <lb/>greatest opponents and said to themselves, 
     <lb/>" We will make everything smooth, we will 
     <lb/>forget past difficulties, provided we can but 
     <lb/>keep our seats."

     which is well known in this House, the voice

     of the Attorney General West, saying "hear,

     hear." But what was the course of that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman last year, when the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford had a committee appointed 
     <lb/>
     to whom was referred the despatch written 
     <lb/>
     by his three colleagues, the Minister of Fi<lb break="no"/>nance, the Attorney General East and the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. ROSS, who is now no longer a minis<lb break="no"/>ter. He voted against the appointment of 
     <lb/>
     the committee, and, after it was named, as a 
     <lb/>
     member of it, he voted. against the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of Confederation. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”The last vote taken 
     <lb/>
     in that committee was about the middle of 
     <lb/>
     June, the very day of the crisis, and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman voted against the principle 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation of all the provinces, in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the opinions he again and 
     <lb/>
     again expressed in this House, as being 
     <lb/>
     opposed to all Confederation whatever. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) When I state that these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     only found out that Confederation was a 
     <lb/>
     panacea for all evils, a remedy for all ills, 
     <lb/>
     when their seats as ministers were in danger, 
     <lb/>
     I come to this conclusion quite legitimately, 
     <lb/>
     from facts which are well known to this 
     <lb/>
     House. (Hear, hear.) But, sir, it would 
     <lb/>
    probably be of very little moment whether 
     <lb/>I was formerly in favor of Confederation or 
     <lb/>against it, or whether the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>General West was in favor of Confederation 
     <lb/>or opposed to it, if the scheme proposed to 
     <lb/>us were an equitable one, or one calculated 
     <lb/>to meet the wishes of the people of this 
     <lb/>country ; but, as I said a minute ago, the 
     <lb/>scheme was not called for by any consider<lb break="no"/>able proportion of the population. It is not 
     <lb/>laid before the House as one which was 
     <lb/>demanded by any number of the people ; it 
     <lb/>is not brought down in response to any call 
     <lb/>from the people ; it is a device of men who 
     <lb/>are in difficulties, for the purpose of getting 
     <lb/>out of them. (Hear, hear.) The members 
     <lb/>of the TACHÃ‰-MACDONALD Government 
     <lb/>could not appeal to the country after their 
     <lb/>defeat upon the question, whether they were 
     <lb/>justified in taking $100,000 out of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic chest, in addition to the millions they 
     <lb/>had previously taken, without the consent of 
     <lb/>Parliament ; so, having either to give up 
     <lb/>their seats or evade that particular issue, 
     <lb/>they abandoned all their previous opinions,  
     <lb/>and joined the hon. member for South Oxford 
     <lb/>in carrying out this Confederation scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <cb/>
            <p>
     (Hear.) I come now to another point, viz., 
     <lb/>
     is the scheme presented to us the same 
     <lb/>
     one that was promised to us by the Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration when it was formed ? This, sir, 
     <lb/>
     might be but of slight importance if the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which this proposed Constitution 
     <lb/>
     was framed had not a most unfortunate bear<lb break="no"/>ing on the scheme itself ; but it is a grave 
     <lb/>
     matter, since the scheme is so objectionable, 
     <lb/>
     especially as we are gravely told that it can<lb break="no"/>not be amended in the least, but that it is 
     <lb/>
     brought down as a compact made between 
     <lb/>
     the Government of this country and delegates 
     <lb/>
     from the governments of Nova Scotia, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Islandâ€”as a treaty which cannot be 
     <lb/>
     altered or amended in any particular. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) The plain meaning of this is, sir, 
     <lb/>
     that the Lower Provinces have made out a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution for us and we are to adopt it. 
     <lb/>
      This fact will appear the more clearly when 
     <lb/>
     it is considered, as was pointed out much to 
     <lb/>
     my surprise, by the hon. member for Hast<lb break="no"/>ings (Mr. T. C. WALLBRIDGE), that in the 
     <lb/>
     Conference the vote was taken by provinces, 
     <lb/>
     putting Upper and Lower Canada, with 
     <lb/>
     nearly 2,500,000 people, on no higher level 
     <lb/>
     than Prince Edward Island, with its 80,000 
     <lb/>
     â€”on the same level with New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     with its 250,000â€”on the same level as Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, with its 330,000.

     There is a vast difference, Mr. SPEAKER, be<lb break="no"/>tween these two propositions. The first was 
     <lb/>
     that the Government would pledge themselves 
     <lb/>
     to seek a Confederation of the British Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Provinces, and if they failed in that to 
     <lb/>
     Federate the two Canadas, and this was reject<lb break="no"/>ed ; the second, which was accepted by the 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council, pledged the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to bring in a measure for the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the two Canadas, with provision for

            <cb/>
        

     the admission of the other provinces when

    they thought proper to enter.

     HON. MR. DORIONâ€”But, sir, I may be 
     <lb/>
     asked, granting all this, granting that the 
     <lb/>
     scheme brought down is not the scheme pro<lb break="no"/>mised to us, what difference our bringing in 
     <lb/>
     the provinces at once can make ? This 
     <lb/>
     I will endeavor to explain. When they went 
     <lb/>
     into the Conference, honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite submitted to have the votes taken 
     <lb/>
     by provinces. Well, they have now brought 
     <lb/>
     us in, as was natural under the circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     the most conservative measure ever laid before 
     <lb/>
     a Parliament. The members of the Upper 
     <lb/>
     House are no longer to be elected, but nomin<lb break="no"/>ated, and nominated by whom ? By a Tory 
     <lb/>
     or Conservative Government for Canada, by 
     <lb/>
     a Conservative Government in Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     by a Conservative Government in Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, by a Conservative Government 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, the only Liberal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment concerned in the nomination being that 
     <lb/>
     which is controlled by the Liberal party in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, whose fate depends on the result 
     <lb/>
     of the elections that are now going on in that 
     <lb/>
     province. Such a scheme would never have 
     <lb/>
    been adopted if submitted to the liberal peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Upper Canada. When the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment went into that Conference they were 
     <lb/>bound by the majority, especially since they 
     <lb/>voted by provinces, and the 1,400,000 of Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada with the 1,100,000 of Lower 
     <lb/>Canadaâ€” together 2,500,000 peopleâ€”were 
     <lb/>over-ridden by 900,000 people of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces. Were we not expressly told 
     <lb/>that it was the Lower Provinces who would not 
     <lb/>hear of our having an elective Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil ? If, instead of going into Conference with 
     <lb/>the people of the Lower Provinces, our Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had done what they pledged them<lb break="no"/>selves to do, that is, to prepare a Constitution 
     <lb/>themselves, they would never have dared to 
     <lb/>bring in such a proposition as this which is 
     <lb/>now imposed upon us by the Lower Colonies 
     <lb/>â€”to have a Legislative Council, with a fixed 
     <lb/>number of members, nominated by four Tory 
     <lb/>governments. Why, taking the average time 
     <lb/>each councillor will be in the Council to be 
     <lb/>fifteen to twenty years, it will take a century 
     <lb/>before its complexion can be changed. For 
     <lb/>all time to come, so far as this generation and 
     <lb/>the next are concerned, you will find the 
     <lb/>Legislative Council controlled by the influ<lb break="no"/>ence of the present Government. And is it

     to be believed that, as promised in the docu<lb break="no"/>ment we are considering , such a Government 
     <lb/>
     as we have " will take care of the Opposition,

     or consider their right to be represented in

     thank the delegates for their kind solicitude

     for the Opposition, but I do not believe they

     <lb/>
     should advise the selection of the best men I 
     <lb/>
     could findâ€”and of course of my own party?" 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) So it will be, sir ; and, if this pre<lb break="no"/>cious scheme is carried, we shall have a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council divided in the following pro<lb break="no"/>portion :â€”For Upper Canada, we should pro<lb break="no"/>bably have liberals in the proportion of three 
     <lb/>
     to nine ; for I suppose the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford has made sacrifices enough 
     <lb/>
     to deserve at least that consideration, and, as 
     <lb/>
     his friends compose one-fourth of the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council, I dare say we should get one-

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”Just 25 per cent. of 
     <lb/>
     liberals for Upper Canada. Then, in addi<lb break="no"/>tion, we should get from Nova Scotia ten 
     <lb/>
     conservatives, from Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     four more, and four from Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Thus we shall have eighteen conservatives 
     <lb/>
     from the Lower Provinces, which, added to 
     <lb/>
     thirty-six from Canada, would make fifty-four 
     <lb/>
     conservatives against twenty-two liberals, 
     <lb/>
     taking the ten New Brunswick councillors to 
     <lb/>
     be liberals. Now, supposing three per 
     <lb/>
     cent. as the average number of deaths per 
     <lb/>
     annumâ€”the average proportion of changeâ€” 
     <lb/>
     it would take nearly thirty years to bring 
     <lb/>
     about a change in the character of a majority 
     <lb/>
     of the Council, even supposing all the addi<lb break="no"/>tions made to it to be from the liberal ranks. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, that will hardly be the case. In 
     <lb/>
     some of the Lower Provinces there will be 
     <lb/>
     Conservative governments now and then, and 
     <lb/>
     there may occasionally be conservative gov<lb break="no"/>ernments in Canada. (Hear, and laughter.) So 
     <lb/>
     this generation will certainly pass away before 
     <lb/>
     the views of the Liberal party will ever find

     expression in the decisions of the Upper House.

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName> â€” The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Lambton says that makes no dif<lb break="no"/><cb/>ference. It makes just the difference that 
     <lb/>
     we are to be bound by the scheme or by a 
     <lb/>
    Constitution enabling the Council to stop all 
     <lb/>measures of reform, such as would be 
     <lb/>desired by the Liberal party ; if the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Lambton thinks that 
     <lb/>makes no difference, I beg to differ from 
     <lb/>him, and I believe the Liberal party generally 
     <lb/>will. The Government say they had to in<lb break="no"/>troduce certain provisions, not to please them<lb break="no"/>selves, but to please the provinces below, 
     <lb/>and they have pledged themselves to those 
     <lb/>provinces that this House will carry out the 
     <lb/>scheme without amendment. Does not the 
     <lb/>honorable member see the difference now ? 
     <lb/>If the two Canadas were alone interested, the 
     <lb/>majority would have its own wayâ€”would look 
     <lb/>into the Constitution closelyâ€”would scan its 
     <lb/>every doubtful provision, and such a proposal 
     <lb/>as this about the Legislative Council  would 
     <lb/>have no chance of being carried, for it is not 
     <lb/>very long since the House, by an overwhelm<lb break="no"/>ing majority, voted for the substitution of an 
     <lb/>elected for a nominated Upper Chamber. In 
     <lb/>fact, the nominated Chamber had fallen so 
     <lb/>low in public estimationâ€”I do not say it was 
     <lb/>from the  fault of the men who were there, 
     <lb/>but the fact is, nevertheless, as I state itâ€” 
     <lb/>that it commanded no influence. There was 
     <lb/>even a difficulty in getting a quorum of it 
     <lb/>together. So a change became absolutely 
     <lb/>necessary, and up to the present moment the 
     <lb/>new system has worked well ; the elected 
     <lb/>members are equal in every respect to the 
     <lb/>nominated ones, and it is just when we see 
     <lb/>an interest beginning to be felt in the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings of the Upper House that its Constitution 
     <lb/>is to be changed ,to return back again to the one 
     <lb/>so recently condemned. Back again, did I 
     <lb/>say ? No, sir, a Constitution is to be substi<lb break="no"/>tuted, much worse than the old one, and such 
     <lb/>as is nowhere else to be found. Why, even 
     <lb/>the British House of Lords, conservative as 
     <lb/>it is, is altogether beyond the influence of the 
     <lb/>popular sentiment of the country. Their 
     <lb/>number may be increased on the recommen<lb break="no"/>dation of the responsible advisers of the 
     <lb/>Crown, if required to secure united action or 
     <lb/>to prevent a conflict between the two Houses. 
     <lb/>From the position its members occupy, it is a 
     <lb/>sort of compromise between the popular ele<lb break="no"/>ment and the influence or control of the 
     <lb/>Crown. But the new House for the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration is to be a perfectly independent body 
     <lb/>â€”these gentlemen are to be named for lifeâ€” 
     <lb/>and there is to be no power to increase their 
     <lb/>number. How long will the system work 
     <lb/>without producing a collision between the

     two branches of the Legislature ? Suppose the 
     <lb/>
     Lower House turns out to be chiefly Liberal, 
     <lb/>
     how long will it submit to the Upper House, 
     <lb/>
     named by Conservative administrations which 
     <lb/>
     have taken advantage of their temporary nu<lb break="no"/>merical strength to bring about such a change 
     <lb/>
     as is now proposed ? Remember, sir, that, af<lb break="no"/>ter all, the power, the influence of the popular 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature is paramount. We 
     <lb/>
     have seen constitutions like that of England 
     <lb/>
     adopted in many countries, and where there ex<lb break="no"/>isted a nobility, such as in France in 1830, 
     <lb/>
     the second chamber was selected from this 
     <lb/>
     nobility. In Belgium, where the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion is almost a <hi rendition="simple:italic">fac-simile</hi> of that of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, but where there are no aristocracy, they 
     <lb/>
     adopted the elective principle for the Upper 
     <lb/>
     House, and no where in the world is there a 
     <lb/>
     fixed number for it, unless it is also elective. 
     <lb/>
     It must be fresh in the memory of a great 
     <lb/>
     many members of this House how long the 
     <lb/>
     House of Lords resisted the popular demand 
     <lb/>
     for reform, and great difficulties were threat<lb break="no"/>ened. At last in 1832 the agitation had 
     <lb/>
     become so great that the Government de<lb break="no"/>termined to nominate a sufficient number of 
     <lb/>
     peers to secure the passage of the Reform 
     <lb/>
    Bill. The members of the House had to 
     <lb/>choose between allowing the measure to be<lb break="no"/>come law, or see their influence destroyed by 
     <lb/>the addition of an indefinite number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers. They preferred the first alternative, and 
     <lb/>thereby quieted an excitement, which if not 
     <lb/>checked in time, might have created a revo<lb break="no"/>lution in England. The influence of the 
     <lb/>Crown was then exerted in accordance with 
     <lb/>the views of the people ; but here we are to 
     <lb/>have no such power existing to check the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of our Upper Chamber, and no change 
     <lb/>can be made in its composition except as 
     <lb/>death might slowly remove its members. I 
     <lb/>venture to prophesy, sir, that before a very 
     <lb/>short time has elapsed a dead-lock may arise, 
     <lb/>and such an excitement be created as has 
     <lb/>never yet been seen in this country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Now, if this Constitution had been 
     <lb/>framed by the members of our Government, 
     <lb/>we could change some of its provisionsâ€”this 
     <lb/>provision would  most certainly be alteredâ€” 
     <lb/>there is not a man in the Liberal ranks who 
     <lb/>dare vote for such a proposition as this, that 
     <lb/>could go before his constituents and say, " I 
     <lb/>have taken away the influence and control of 
     <lb/>the people over the Upper Chamber, and I 
     <lb/>have created an entirely independent body, to 
     <lb/>be chosen by the present governments of the 
     <lb/> several provinces." But no, the Constitution 
     <lb/>is in the nature of a compact, a treaty, and 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          

     cannot be changed. (Hear.) But, sir, the 
     <lb/>
     composition of the Legislative Council be<lb break="no"/>comes of more importance when we consider 
     <lb/>
     that the governors of the local legislatures  
     <lb/>
     are to be appointed by the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, as well as the Legislative Council ; 
     <lb/>
     their appointment is to be for five years, and 
     <lb/>
     they are not to be removed without cause. I 
     <lb/>
    will venture upon another prediction and say 
     <lb/>we shall find there will be no such thing as 
     <lb/>responsible government attached to the local 
     <lb/>legislatures.

     done in the times of Sir FRANCIS BOND HEAD,

     Sir JOHN COLBORN, or Sir JAMES CRAIG.  You

     will have governments, the chief executives

     of which will be appointed and hold office at 
     <lb/>
     the will of the Governor. If that is not to 
     <lb/>
     be the case, why do not honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     lay their scheme before us? (Hear.) Is this 
     <lb/>
    House, sir, going to vote a Constitution with 
     <lb/>the Upper House as proposed, without knowing 
     <lb/>what sort of local legislatures we are to have 
     <lb/>to govern us ? Suppose, after we have adopt<lb break="no"/>ed the main scheme, the Government come 
     <lb/>down with a plan for settling the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures upon which great differences of opinion 
     <lb/>will arise, may it not happen then that the 
     <lb/>majority from Lower Canada will unite with a 
     <lb/>minority from Upper Canada and impose upon 
     <lb/>that section a local Constitution distasteful to 
     <lb/>a large majority of the people of Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>The whole scheme, sir, is absurd from begin<lb break="no"/>ning to end. It is but natural that gentlemen 
     <lb/>with the views of honorable gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site want to keep as much power as possible 
     <lb/>in the hands of the Governmentâ€”that is the 
     <lb/>doctrine of the Conservative party everywhere 
     <lb/>â€”that is the line which distinguishes the 
     <lb/>tories from the whigsâ€”the tories always 
     <lb/>side with the Crown, and the liberals always 
     <lb/>want to give more power and influence to the 
     <lb/>people. The instincts of honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>opposite, whether you take the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>General East or the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>West, lead them to thisâ€”they think the hands

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”I now come to an<lb break="no"/>other point. It is said that this Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is necessary for the purpose of providing 
     <lb/>
     a better mode of defence for this country. 
     <lb/>
     There may be people who think that by add<lb break="no"/>ing two and two together you make five. I 
     <lb/>
     am not of that opinion. I cannot see how by 
     <lb/>
     adding the 700,000 or 800,000 people, the 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of the Lower Provinces, to 
     <lb/>
     the 2,500,000 inhabitants of Canada, you 
     <lb/>
     can multiply them so as to make a much 
     <lb/>
     larger force to defend the country than you 
     <lb/>
     have at present. Of course the connection 
     <lb/>
     with the British Empire is the link of com<lb break="no"/>munication by which the whole force of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire can be brought together for defence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But the position of this coun<lb break="no"/>try under the proposed scheme is very evident. 
     <lb/>
     You add to the frontier four or five hundred 
     <lb/>
     more miles than you now have, and an extent 
     <lb/>
     of country immeasurably greater in pro<lb break="no"/>portion than the additional population you 
     <lb/>
     have gained; and if there is an advantage at 
     <lb/>
     all for the defence of the country, it will 
     <lb/>
     be on the part of the Lower Provinces and 
     <lb/>
     not for us. And as we find that we are 
     <lb/>
     about to enter into a very large expendi<lb break="no"/>ture for this purpose of defenceâ€”this having 
     <lb/>
     been formally announced in a speech deliv<lb break="no"/>ered by the President of the Council at To<lb break="no"/>rontoâ€”and as Canada is to contribute to 
     <lb/>
     that expenditure to the extent of ten-twelfths 
     <lb/>
     of the whole, the other provinces paying only 
     
            <cb/>
           

     two-twelfths, it follows that Canada will pay 
     <lb/>
     ten-twelfths also of the cost of defence, which, 
     <lb/>
     to defend the largely extended country we 
     <lb/>
     will have to defend, will be much larger than 
     <lb/>
     if we remained alone. I find in the speech 
     <lb/>
     delivered by the President of the Council on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion, this statement :â€”

     I cannot conclude without referring to some 
     <lb/>
     other things which have received the grave atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Conference. And the first point 
     <lb/>
     which I desire to call attention is the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the delegates have unanimously resolved that the

     <lb/>
     the world, our course must be to put our country 
     <lb/>
     in such a position of defence that we may fear<lb break="no"/>lessly look our enemies in the face.  It is a 
     <lb/>
     pleasure to me to state, and I am sure it must be 
     <lb/>
     a pleasure to all present to be informed, that the 
     <lb/>
     Conference at Quebec did not separate before 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     them is not stated. - This I contend, then,

     that if the military and naval defences of all

     Provinces will pay only their proportion of 
     <lb/>
     two-twelfths, and Canada, while obtaining no 
     <lb/>
     greater defensive force than at present, will 
     <lb/>
     have to pay five times as much as we are now 
     <lb/>
     paying. (Hear, hear.) Why , sir, take the 
     <lb/>
     line dividing New Brunswick from Maine and 
     <lb/>
     you find it separates on the one side 250,000, 
     <lb/>
     thinly scattered over a vast territory, from 
     <lb/>
     750,000 on the other, compact and powerful. 
     <lb/>
     These 250,000 Canada will have to defend, 
     <lb/>
     and it will have to pledge its resources for the

     that extended line. (Hear, hear.) And, if

     <lb/>
     there will be ten miles or one hundred miles 
     <lb/>
     of it in Lower Canada, or whether it will cost 
     <lb/>
     $10,000,000 or $20.000,000.

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”In 1862, when the 
     <lb/>
     question of the construction of this road was 
     <lb/>
     before the country. what was the cry raised 
     <lb/>
     by honorable gentlemen opposite ? Why, that 
     <lb/>
     the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government had 
     <lb/>
     pledged itself to build a railway at whatever 
     <lb/>
     cost it might come to ; and those who were 
     <lb/>
     loudest in these denunciations, were the very 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have now undertaken to build 
     <lb/>
     the road without knowing or even enquiring 
     <lb/>
     what the cost of it will be.  (Hear, hear. ) 
     <lb/>
     This, if I remember right, was the purport of 
     <lb/>
     a speech made by the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West at Otterville.  (Hear, hear. ) I was 
     <lb/>
     satisfied, sir, at that time, to press my objec<lb break="no"/>tions to the scheme and retire from the 
     <lb/>
     Government ; but my colleagues were de<lb break="no"/>nounced without stint for having undertaken 
     <lb/>
     to build the railway and pay seven-twelfths of 
     <lb/>
     its cost, and now the House is asked by the 
     <lb/>
     very men who denounced them to pay ten- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
    twelfths of it, without even knowing whether 
     <lb/>the work is practicable or not.  (Hear, hear. ) 
     <lb/>We have heard for some time past that the 
     <lb/>engineer, Mr. FLEMING, is prepared to make 
     <lb/>his report. Why is it not forthcoming ?â€” 
     <lb/>why has it been kept back? The represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the people in this House will show 
     <lb/>utter disregard of their duty if they do 
     <lb/>not insist upon having that report, and full 
     <lb/>explanations respecting the undertaking, as 
     <lb/>well as the scheme for the constitution of the 
     <lb/>local governments, before they vote upon the 
     <lb/>resolutions before the House.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>It is folly to suppose that this Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railway will in the least degree he con<lb break="no"/>ducive to the defence of the country. We 
     <lb/>have expended a large sum of moneyâ€”and 
     <lb/>none voted it more cordially and heartily than 
     <lb/>myself-for the purpose of opening a military 
     <lb/>highway from GaspÃ© to -Rimouski ; 
     <lb/>and that road, in case, of hostilities with our 
     <lb/>neighbors, would be found of far greater ser<lb break="no"/>vice, for the transport of troops, cannon and 
     <lb/>all kinds of munitions of war, than any rail<lb break="no"/>way following the same or a more southern 
     <lb/>
                      <cb/>
         

     
     route possibly can be. That road cannot be 
     <lb/>
     effectually destroyed; but a railway lying in 
     <lb/>
     some places not more than fifteen or twenty 
     <lb/>
     miles from the frontier, will be of no use 
     <lb/>
     whatever, because of the readiness with which 
     <lb/>
     it may be attacked and seized. An enemy 
     <lb/>
     could destroy miles of it before it would be 
     <lb/>
     possible to resist him, and in time of difficulty 
     <lb/>
     it would be a mere trap for the troops passing 
     <lb/>
     along it, unless we had almost an army to keep 
     <lb/>
     it open. Upon this question of defence, 
     <lb/>
     we have heard so much during the past two 
     <lb/>
     or three years that I think it is time now 
     <lb/>
     we should have some plain explanations about 
     <lb/>
     it. We heard the other day from the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for West Montrealâ€”and I am 
     <lb/>
     always glad to quote him, he is usually so 
     <lb/>
     correctâ€”(laughterâ€”that in less than a year 
     <lb/>
     the American army, the army of the North<lb break="no"/>ern States, was increased from 9,000 to 800,<lb break="no"/>000 men ready for service, and that in less 
     <lb/>
     than four years they were able to put to sea 
     <lb/>
     a fleet which, in point of numbersâ€”I do not 
     <lb/>
     say in armament or valueâ€”was equal to the 
     <lb/>
     entire naval force of England. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman might have gone further 
     <lb/>
     and shown that within a period of four years 
     <lb/>
     the Northern States have called into the field 
     <lb/>
     2,300,000 menâ€”as many armed men as we 
     <lb/>
     have men, women and children in the two 
     <lb/>
     Canadasâ€”and that we hear every day of more 
     <lb/>
     being raised and equipped. It is stated that, 
     <lb/>
     in view of these facts, it is incumbent upon 
     <lb/>
     us to place ourselves in a state of defence. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, 1 say it here candidly and honestly, that 
     <lb/>
     we are bound to do everything we can to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the countryâ€”(hear, hear,)â€”but we are 
     <lb/>
     not bound to ruin ourselves in anticipation of 
     <lb/>
     a supposed invasion which we could not repel 
     <lb/>
     even with the assistance of England. The 
     <lb/>
     battles of Canada cannot be fought on the 
     <lb/>
     frontier, but on the high seas and at the great 
     <lb/>
     cities on the Atlantic coast; and it will be 
     <lb/>
     nothing but folly for us to cripple ourselves by 
     <lb/>
     spending fifteen or twenty millions a year to 
     <lb/>
     raise an army of 50,000 men for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of resisting an invasion of the country. The 
     <lb/>
     best thing that Canada can do is to keep 
     <lb/>
     quiet, an to give no cause for war.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.)  Let the public opinion of this country 
     <lb/>
     compel the press to cease the attacks it is 
     <lb/>
     every day making upon the Government and 
     <lb/>
     people of the United States ; and then if war 
     <lb/>
     does come between England and the Statesâ€” 
     <lb/>
     even if from no fault of oursâ€”we will cast 
     <lb/>
     our lot with England and help her to fight the 
     <lb/>
     battle; but in the meantimw it is no use what<lb break="no"/><pb n="258" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0258.jpg"/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON ATT. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>â€”Will 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend let me ask him how we can 
     <lb/>
     assist England in a war on the high seas un<lb break="no"/>less we have a naval force ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Peterborough stated the other day, and 
     <lb/>
     correctly I believe, that the place for our mili<lb break="no"/>tia was behind the fortifications of our forti<lb break="no"/>fied places, where they would count for some<lb break="no"/>thing to be of some use. No doubt of this. 
     <lb/>
     Why, sir, it is absurd to ak of defending 
     <lb/>
     this country with such a force as we could 
     <lb/>
     maintain when we have the recent example 
     <lb/>
     before our eyes of a country in Europe pos<lb break="no"/>sessing as large a defensive force, literally 
     <lb/>
     wiped off the map by an invading army of 
     <lb/>
     some 75,000 or 80,000 men. The kingdom 
     <lb/>
     of Denmark consists now of only two small 
     <lb/>
     islandsâ€”less by far, in extent, than one of 
     <lb/>
     our large counties; and this dismemberment 
     <lb/>
     has been forced upon it, although it had a 
     <lb/>
     standing army of 30,000 men, and the feel<lb break="no"/>ing of the whole pulation was in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the war. (Hear, ear.) I do not use this 
     <lb/>
     argument for the purpose of showing that 
     <lb/>
     something ought not to be done respecting our 
     <lb/>
     militia. I am willing that we should make 
     <lb/>
     sacrifices, if necessary, for the purpose of or<lb break="no"/>ganizing it thoroughly ; but I am decidedly 
     <lb/>
     opposed to a standing army, and do not 
     <lb/>
     believe we could raise an army now that 
     <lb/>
     would be able to withstand the force that 
     <lb/>
     could be sent against it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We have sent to the frontier 2,000 men, 
     <lb/>
     whose services for a year will cost us a 
     <lb/>
     million and a-half ; and at the same rate 
     <lb/>
     of expenditure, 50,000 men would cost us 
     <lb/>
     over thirty millions of money. Now, if the 
     <lb/>
     whole defence of'the country is to rest upon 
     <lb/>
     us, I ask again what would such a force 
     <lb/>
     amount to ? (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, when 
     <lb/>
     I look into the provisions of this scheme, I 
     <lb/>
     find another most objectionable one. It is that 
     <lb/>
     which gives the General Government control 
     <lb/>
     over all the acts of the local legislatures. What 
     <lb/>
     dificulties may not arise under this system ? 
     <lb/>
     Now, knowing that the General Government 
     <lb/>
     will be party in its character, may it not for 
     <lb/>
     party purposes reject laws passed the 
     <lb/>
    by the local legislatures and demanded by a majority 
     <lb/>of the people of that locality. This power 
     <lb/>conferred upon the General Government 
     <lb/>has been compared to the veto wer that 
     <lb/>exists in. England in respect to our legislation; 
     <lb/>but we know that the statesmen of England 
     <lb/>are not actuated by the local feelings and 
     <lb/>
         

    
            <cb/>
           

     prejudices, and do not partake of the local 
     <lb/>
     jealousies, that prevail in the colonies. The 
     <lb/>
     local governments have therefore confidence 
     <lb/>
     in them, and respect for their decisions; and 
     <lb/>
     generally, when a law adopted by a colonial 
     <lb/>
     legislature is sent to them, if it does not 
     <lb/>
     clash with the licy of the Empire at large, 
     <lb/>
     it is not disallowed, and more especially of 
     <lb/>
     late has it been the policy of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government to do whatever the colonies de<lb break="no"/>sire in this respect, when their wishes are 
     <lb/>
     constitutionally expressed. The axiom on 
     <lb/>
     which they seem to act is that the less they 
     <lb/>
     hear of the colonies the better. (Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
     But how different will be the result in this 
     <lb/>
     case, when the General Government exercises 
     <lb/>
     the veto power over the acts of local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures. Do you not see that it is quite possible 
     <lb/>
     for a majority in a local government to be 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the General Government; and in 
     <lb/>
     such a case the minority would call upon the 
     <lb/>
     General Government to disallow the laws en<lb break="no"/>acted by the majority? The men who shall 
     <lb/>
     compose the General Government will be de<lb break="no"/>pendent for their su port upon their political 
     <lb/>
     friends in the local egislatures, and it may so 
     <lb/>
     happen that, in order to secure this support, 
     <lb/>
     or in order to serve their own purposes or 
     <lb/>
     that of their supporters, they will veto laws 
     <lb/>
     which the ma'onty of a local legislature find 
     <lb/>
     necessary and (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     know how high party feeling runs sometimes 
     <lb/>
     upon local matters even of trivial importance, 
     <lb/>
     and we may find parties so hotly opposed to 
     <lb/>
     each other in the local legislatures, that the 
     <lb/>
     whole power of the minority may be brought 
     <lb/>
     to bear upon their friends who have a ma<lb break="no"/>jority in the General Legislature, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of preventing the passage of some law 
     <lb/>
     objectionable to them but desired by the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of their own section. What will be 
     <lb/>
     the result of such a state of things but bit<lb break="no"/>terness of feeling, strong litical acrimony 
     <lb/>
     and dangerous agitation? ( ear, hear.) Then 
     <lb/>
     sir, I find that in addition to all the other 
     <lb/>
     sums that are to be paid by the general to 
     <lb/>
     the local governments, there are revisions 
     <lb/>
     in favor of New Brunswick and Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, which must strike the House as being 
     <lb/>
     of a rather extraordinary nature. In the 
     <lb/>
     document which was sent by the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary to the members of this House 
     <lb/>
     marked "Private," there appears to have been 
     <lb/>
     a mistake. It was therein stated that the 
     <lb/>
     General Government would have no right to 
     <lb/>
     impose an export duty on timber, logs, 
     <lb/>
     masts, spars, deals and sawn lumber ; but that 
     <lb/>
     the local governments would have the power 
     <lb/>

        <fw type="num">259</fw>

     to impose export duties on these articles. 
     <lb/>
    This provision, it seems, was too favorable to 
     <lb/>Lower Canada ; for it would have allowed 
     <lb/>Lower Canada to impose an export duty upon    
     <lb/>Upper Canadian timber.<lb/>

     <lb/>
     This mistake seems to have been corrected, 
     <lb/>
     for, in this respect, the resolutions before the 
     <lb/>

    <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€” The clause of the

     resolution to which I refer now reads, that

     the General Parliament shall have power to

     make laws " respecting the imposition or regu<lb break="no"/>lation of duties of customs on imports and 
     <lb/>
     exportsâ€”except on exports of timber, logs, 
     <lb/>
     masts, spars, , deals and sawn lumber from 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, and of coal and other min<lb break="no"/>erals from Nova Scotia." That is, the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government may impose a tax for its 
     <lb/>
     own benefit upon all timber and minerals ex<lb break="no"/>ported from Upper or Lower Canada, but not 
     <lb/>
    New Brunswick or Nova Scotia.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Then, among the powers granted to 
     <lb/>local legislatures, we find the power to pass 
     <lb/>by-laws imposing direct taxation.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.)  That is the first power they have, 
     <lb/>and I have no doubt that, before many 
     <lb/>months have passed after they are consti<lb break="no"/>tuted, they will find it necessary to resort 
     <lb/>to it. But, in addition to this, find that 
     <lb/>New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, which, no 
     <lb/>doubt, are the favored children of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, have powers not granted to the other 
     <lb/>provinces.  New Brunswick, the resolution 
     <lb/>declares, shall have the power to impose an export duty on timber, logs, masts, spars, deals and sawn lumber, and Nova Scotia on coal and other materials, for local, purposes ; 
     <lb/>so that while our timber and minerals export<lb break="no"/>ed from Upper and Lower Canada will be 
     <lb/>taxed by the General Government for  general 
     <lb/>purposes, the timber and minerals of New 
     <lb/>Brunswick and Nova Scotia will be exempt, 
     <lb/>
               the revenue derived from them going to the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the local governments, to be ex<lb break="no"/>pended on local objects.  (Hear, hear.)  This 
     <lb/>
     is one of the results of the Conference in 
     <lb/>
     ,which, of course, New Brunswick counted as 
     <lb/>
     much as Upper and Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and the other Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     the balance of influence.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Now, among the other powers granted to the
<lb/>
            <cb/>
         

     General Government is its control over agri<lb break="no"/>culture and immigration, as well as the fish<lb break="no"/>eries. An honorable member from Upper

     Canada (MR. MACKENZIE of Lambton), en<lb break="no"/>quired very anxiously, yesterday, if it was 
     <lb/>
     possible that any act respecting agriculture 
     <lb/>
     could be affected by the General Government ? 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, it is as plain as can be that agri<lb break="no"/>culture and immigration are to be under the 
     <lb/>
     control of both the local and the general le<lb break="no"/>gislatures. And the forty- fifth resolution 
     <lb/>
     says : â€”"In regard to all subjects over which 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction belongs to the general and local 
     <lb/>
     legislatures, the laws of the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment shall control and supersede those made by 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature, and the latter shall be 
     <lb/>
     void so far as they are repugnant to or incon<lb break="no"/>sistent with the former."  What will be the 
     <lb/>
     operation of this provision ? The Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature will pass a law which will then go to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government ; the latter will put its 
     <lb/>
     veto upon it, and if that does not answer, it 
     <lb/>
    will pass a law contrary to it, and you have 
     <lb/>at once a conflict.  ( Hear, hear.) .

     <lb/>flourishing condition, and that we shall have 
     <lb/>a surplus every year of at least a million dollars. 
     <lb/>(Laughter.) Â  From what I knew of former 
     <lb/>prophecies, I imagined he would make it eleven 
     <lb/>or twelve millions at any rate, but he is mo<lb break="no"/>dest and puts it down at only a million. But 
     <lb/>how does he make out even this moderate sur<lb break="no"/>plus? He takes, in the first place, the re<lb break="no"/>venue of Newfoundland for 1862. I had the 
     <lb/>curiosity to look for the reason, and what do 
     <lb/>you suppose it is ? The revenue for 1862 
     <lb/>was the highest he could find, except 1860. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Then he takes the revenue of 
     <lb/>New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada, 
     <lb/>or 1863â€”the highest figures again  (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.)  Taking all this, he still finds a de<lb break="no"/><pb n="260" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0260.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">260</fw>ficiency of $827,512, which he provides for 
     <lb/>
     by adding a supposed increase for 1864 of 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 for each of the Provinces of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick, and $1,500,000 
     <lb/>
     for Canada.  (Hear, hear.)  And this leaves 
     <lb/>
     a surplus of just $872,488.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, even granting that on the 31st of De<lb break="no"/>cember he had a surplus of a million, if at the 
     <lb/>
     end of the present financial year it is not dimi<lb break="no"/>nished to half a million by his militia and 
     <lb/>
     other expenditure, I shall be very agreeably 
     <lb/>
     surprised.  (Hear.)  This, then, is the in<lb break="no"/>ducement he offers to the country to adopt 
     <lb/>
     this scheme. I have a million more than I 
     <lb/>
     want, he exclaims, and I will reduce the du<lb break="no"/>ties to 15 per cent. But the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman forgets that he has the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway to provide for, as well as that military 
     <lb/>
     and naval defensive force which we are going 
     <lb/>
     to raise.  (Hear, hear.)  He forgets all this, 
     <lb/>
     but the promise is there; and just as he held 
     <lb/>
     out to the expected shareholders of the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk Railway the 11 per cent. divi<lb break="no"/>dends upon their investments, he now tells 
     <lb/>
     the people of these several colonies that the 
     <lb/>
     customs duties will be reduced to 15 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)  I do not desire to go over the 
     <lb/>
     figures the honorable gentleman has laid before 
     <lb/>
     the House, for I have not the talent of group<lb break="no"/>ing them together, so as to present an attrac<lb break="no"/>tive, but deceptive, whole, that he possesses 
     <lb/>
     in such an eminent degree. I find in the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions now proposed a few propositions 
     <lb/>
     to which I would call the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House.  The first thing that the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration will have to provide for is the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, which will certainly cost 
     <lb/>
     twenty millions of dollars, the interest upon 
     <lb/>
     which, at 5 per cent., will amount to one 
     <lb/>
     million of dollars annually.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Then to Newfoundland we are bound to pay 
     <lb/>
     $150,000 a year, for all time to come, to 
     <lb/>
     purchase the mineral lands of that colony ; 
     <lb/>
     while, as regards the other provinces, all the 
     <lb/>
     public lands are given up to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. But that is not all, for, in order to 
     <lb/>
     manage these "valuable lands" in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, we shall have to establish a Crown 
     <lb/>
     Lands department under the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment ; and if honorable gentlemen desire 
     <lb/>
     to learn something of the probable expense of 
     <lb/>
     such an establishment, they need only refer 
     <lb/>
     to a return brought down last night, by which 
     <lb/>
     they will see that there are no less than sixty 
     <lb/>
     or seventy officers in the Crown Lands de<lb break="no"/>partment, and that some eight or ten new 
     <lb/>
     appointments have been made since March 
     <lb/>
     last, when the present Government was formed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     (Hear, hear.)  This return is a highly in<lb break="no"/>structive one in other respects. It shows 
     <lb/>
     that within that period there is not a depart<lb break="no"/>ment of the Government that has not increased 
     <lb/>
     its force of employÃ©s, except that of the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General East, who is satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     the three officers it contained before he re<lb break="no"/>turned to the Government.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I may state, however, that in the return 
     <lb/>
     there is an omission which ought to be sup<lb break="no"/>plied. The honorable gentleman has made a 
     <lb/>
     large number of appointments connected with 
     <lb/>
     the administration of justice in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     that are not mentioned. This return is, how<lb break="no"/>ever, instructive as showing the additional 
     <lb/>
     number of appointments that have been made 
     <lb/>
     within the past year in all the departmentsâ€” 
     <lb/>
     several of whom have been taken from their 
     <lb/>
     seats in this House and appointed to offices 
     <lb/>
     to make room for others here.

            <p>The general expenses he alludes to are the

     <lb/>by showing that New Brunswick is to have 
     <lb/>$34,000 over and above its necessities, and

     <lb/>these additional burdens, - $63,000 a year for 
     <lb/>ten years to New Brunswick, would make a

     <lb/>
     the militia expenditure to the extent of a 
     <lb/>
     million a-yearâ€”this, I think, is a very rea<lb break="no"/>sonable estimate, and will not go very far to<lb break="no"/>wards carrying out the intentions of the Con<lb break="no"/>ference respecting military and naval defence, 
     <lb/>
     as explained by the President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     to his Tomato audience. Then add the in<lb break="no"/>terest of the sum required to build the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway, five per cent. on $20,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     and we have an annual payment of $1,000,000 
     <lb/>
     more, which is increased by $150,000, the in<lb break="no"/>demnity paid to Newfoundland for its valuable

     <lb/>
     governments, at the rate of 80 cents per head, 
     <lb/>
     $3,056,849. The interest on the debt of

     Prince Edward Island, $2,021,425, to $101,<lb break="no"/>071. Adding all these sums together, we find 
     <lb/>
     that the annual expenditure, in addition be it

     remembered to the burdens which we now bear, 
     <lb/>
     will be $6,237,920â€”( hear, hear)â€”represent<lb break="no"/>ing a capital of $124,758,400.  (Hear, hear.)

     The share of Canada in this annual expendi<lb break="no"/>ture will be $1.89 head, amounting to the

     sum of $4,725,000. This is altogether irres<lb break="no"/>pective of the debt of $62,500,000 with which 
     <lb/>
     Canada enters the union. The share of Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, according to population, will be 
     <lb/>
     $2,646,000 ; but Upper Canadians have long 
     <lb/>
     claimed that they paid upwards of two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of the expenditure, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> lately 
     <lb/>
     said that this was the proportion ten years ago, 
     <lb/>
     but that the disparity had greatly increased

     since.  If Upper Canada really pays two-thirds

     of the expenditure, its share in the additional

     but necessary expenditure will be $3,183,334

     per annum.  (Hear, hear.) This is taking

     or granted that the Lower Provinces should

     pay their share according to po ulation. I

     have my doubts about that, and believe that

     the city of Montreal pays a little more duty on

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”It has much to do 
     <lb/>
     with it.  It shows that representation by pop<lb break="no"/>ulation was put forth as a remedy for the 
     <lb/>
     financial evils of our present system of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.  Under this adviceUpper Canada 
     <lb/>
     gave a large majority against the Government 
     <lb/>
    of the day, and the members elected turned 
     <lb/>round, and by abandoning, for a time at least, 
     <lb/>representation by population, they acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged that the financial question was para<lb break="no"/>mount to it. I have shown, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>I think, the proportion which Upper Canada 
     <lb/>would have to pay of the increased expendi<lb break="no"/>ture which must immediately ensue from the 
     <lb/>adoption of Confederation which is proposed to 
     <lb/>free Upper Canada from a larger expenditure 
     <lb/>by Lower Canada than what she contributes to 
     <lb/>the revenue.  Now, let us see what that ex<lb break="no"/>penditure is.  The whole expenditure of the 
     <lb/>province exclusive of interest on public debt, 
     <lb/>costs of legislation, militia, subsin to ocean 
     <lb/>steamers and collection of revenue, which 
     <lb/>will have to be paid even with Confederation, 
     <lb/>if it takes place, does not amount to more 
     <lb/>than $2,500,000, or one dollar per head of 
     <lb/>the whole population.   Then supposing that 
     <lb/>
                      
 <pb n="263" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-16_Page_0263.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">263</fw>

     Upper Canada pays two-thirds of that sum, 
     <lb/>
     or $1,666,666, and Lower Canada one-third, 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada would only pay $266,666 
     <lb/>
     more than her share according to population. 
     <lb/>
     And it is, I say, to get rid of this expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of a couple of hundred thousand dollars that 
     <lb/>
     the Upper Canadian members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment repose that their section of the country 
     <lb/>
     should pay an additional yearly expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of $3,181,000, yielding no return whatsoever 
     <lb/>
     â€”(hear, hear)â€”and to saddle on Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada an additional expenditure of from $1,<lb break="no"/>500,000 to $2,000,000 a yearâ€”the amount 
     <lb/>
     depending on the proportion which they res<lb break="no"/>pectively contribute to the revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     country. And, Mr. SPEAKER, this is only 
     <lb/>
     the immediate and necessary expenditure that 
     <lb/>
     will fall on the people of Canada at the very 
     <lb/>
     outset.  There is not a single sixpence in this 
     <lb/>
     estimate for any improvements to be made in 
     <lb/>
     the eastern or western portion of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy.   (Hear, hear.)  But, sir, respecting 
     <lb/>
     the defences of the country, I should have said 
     <lb/>
     at an earlier stage of my remarks that this 
     <lb/>
     scheme proposes a union not only with Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, and Newfoundland, but also with 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia and Vancouver's Island. 
     <lb/>
     Although I have not been able to get the 
     <lb/>
     information from the Governmentâ€”for they 
     <lb/>
     do not seem to be very ready to give informa<lb break="no"/>tionâ€”yet I understand that there are des<lb break="no"/>patches to hand, stating that resolutions have 
     <lb/>
     adopted in the Legislature of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia asking for admission into the Con<lb break="no"/>federation at once. I must confess, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that it looks like a burlesque to 
     <lb/>
     speak as a means of defence of a scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation to unite the whole country 
     <lb/>
     extending from Newfoundland to Vancouver's 
     <lb/>

     It is evident, from what has transpired, that

     Honorable members from Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     are made aware that the delegates all desired 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union, but it could not be accom<lb break="no"/>plished at once. This Confederation is the 
     <lb/>
     first necessary step towards it.  The British 
     <lb/>
     Government is ready to grant a Federal union 
     <lb/>
     at once, and when that is accomplished the 
     <lb/>
     French element will be completely over<lb break="no"/>whelmed by the majority of British repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives What then would prevent the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government from passing a set of 
     <lb/>
     resolutions in a similar way to those we are 
     <lb/>
     called upon to pass, without submitting them 
     <lb/>
     to the people, calling upon the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to set aside the Federal form of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and give a legislative union instead 
     <lb/>
     of it ? (Hear, hear.)  Perhaps the people

     attached to their institutions in a manner that 
     <lb/>
     defies any attempt to change them in that

     way. They will not change their religious

     institutions, their laws and their language, for 
     <lb/>
     any consideration whatever.  A million of

     inhabitants may seem a small affair to the

     be better that there should be but one religion, 
     <lb/>
     one language and one system of laws, and he 
     <lb/>
    goes to work to frame institutions that will 
     <lb/>bring all to that desirable state; but I can 
     <lb/>tell honorable gentlemen that the history of Â

     accomplished. (Hear, hear.) We have the 
     <lb/>
     history of the Greek race, having at one time 
     <lb/>
     a population of six millions, dwindling down 
     <lb/>
     to seven hundred thousand, and we find them 
     <lb/>
     even then, after several centuries of oppres<lb break="no"/>sion, rising up and asserting their rights. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have the same circum<lb break="no"/>stance in the history of Belgium, which was 
     <lb/>
     united to Holland with a view to secure the 
     <lb/>
     assimilation of the two countries, but fifteen 
     <lb/>
     years of trial had hardly elapsed when the 
     <lb/>
     whole of the Belgium people and Government 
     <lb/>
     rose <hi rendition="simple:italic">en masse</hi> to protest against that union, 
     <lb/>
     and to assert their separate nationality. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Sir, it is not only from the history of 
     <lb/>
     the past we may derive the lesson, but we 
     <lb/>
     have the circumstances of the present gener<lb break="no"/>ation to guide us. I am astonished to see the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montreal West helping 
     <lb/>
     a scheme designed to end in a legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     the object of which can only be to assimilate 
     <lb/>
     the whole people to the dominant population. 
     <lb/>
     In that honorable gentleman's own country 
     <lb/>
     the system has produced nothing but a dis<lb break="no"/>satisfied and rebellious people. Is it desirable 
     <lb/>
     that in this country then we should pass a 
     <lb/>
     measure calculated to give dissatisfaction to a 
     <lb/>
     million of people ? You may ascertain what the 
     <lb/>
     cost of keeping down a million of dissatisfied 
     <lb/>
     people is by the scenes that have been and are 
     <lb/>
     now transpiring on the other side of the line, 
     <lb/>
     where a fifth of the people of the United 
     <lb/>
     States has risen and has caused more misery 
     <lb/>
     and misfortune to be heaped upon that 
     <lb/>
     country than could have been wrought in cen<lb break="no"/>turies of peaceful compromising legislation. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, if a legislative union of the British 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces is attempted, there will 
     <lb/>
     be such an agitation in this portion of the 
     <lb/>
     province as was never witnessed beforeâ€”you 
     <lb/>
     will see the whole people of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     clinging together to resist by all legal and con<lb break="no"/>stitutional means, such an attempt at wresting 
     <lb/>
     from them those institutions that they now 
     <lb/>
     enjoy. They would go as a body to the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, voting as one man, and caring 
     <lb/>
     for nothing else but for the protection of their 
     <lb/>
     beloved institutions and law, and making gov<lb break="no"/>ernment all but impossible. The ninety Irish 
     <lb/>
     members in the British House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     composed as it is of nearly seven hundred 
     <lb/>
     members, by voting together have caused their 
     <lb/>
     influence to be felt, as in the grants to the 
     <lb/>
     Maynooth College and some other questions. 
     <lb/>
     It would be the same way with the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, and a more deplorable state of 
     <lb/>
     things would be the inevitable result. The 
     <lb/>
     majority would be forced by the minority to 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            

     do things they would not, under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances, think of doing. This is a state so 
     <lb/>
     undesirable that, although I am strongly op<lb break="no"/>posed to the proposed Federal union, I am 
     <lb/>
     still more strongly opposed to a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union. Those who desire a legislative union 
     <lb/>
     may see from this what discordant elements 
     <lb/>
     they would have to deal with in undertaking 
     <lb/>
     the task, and what misery they would bring 
     <lb/>
     upon the country by such a step. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I know there is an apprehension 
     <lb/>
     among the British population in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     that, with even the small power that the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government will possess, their rights will not 
     <lb/>
     be respected. How, then, can it be expected 
     <lb/>
     that the French population can anticipate any 
     <lb/>
     more favorable result from the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, when it is to possess such enormous 
     <lb/>
     powers over the destinies of their section of 
     <lb/>
     the country ? Experience shows that majori<lb break="no"/>ties are always aggressive, and it cannot well 
     <lb/>
     be otherwise in this instance. It therefore 
     <lb/>
     need not be wondered at that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, of British origin, are ready to 
     <lb/>
     make use of every means to prevent their 
     <lb/>
     being placed at the mercy of a preponderating 
     <lb/>
     population of a different origin. I agree with 
     <lb/>
     them in thinking that they ought to take 
     <lb/>
     nothing on trust in this matter of entering 
     <lb/>
     upon a new state of political existence, and 
     <lb/>
     neither ought we of French origin to do so, 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the General Government, how<lb break="no"/>ever happy our relations to each other may be 
     <lb/>
     at present.

     <lb/>
     marked manner, by placing in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     guarantees respecting the educational institu<lb break="no"/>tions of the two sections of Canada. The

     Roman Catholics of Upper Canada were

     the hand of the Protestant majority, and, 
     <lb/>
     where the Protestants are in a minority, they 
     <lb/>
     are just as anxious to have their rights per<lb break="no"/>manently protected. But, sir, the whole

     <lb/>he became a member of the present Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, and a warm advocate of both these

     If our Government were to rush into the rail<lb break="no"/>way project, expend a large sum of money upon 
     <lb/>
     the road, and form a compact immediately with 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, both the alliance and the road 
     <lb/>
     would be carried out mainly for the benefit of the 
     <lb/>
     dominant power in this province at this moment ; 
     <lb/>
     we need hardly say we mean Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The important question to Upper  Canadaâ€”her 
     <lb/>
     connection with the North-West Territoryâ€”would 
     <lb/>
     be altogether ignored, Quebec would be made 
     <lb/>
     the capital of the Federation, representation by 
     <lb/>
     population would form no part of the compact, 
     <lb/>
     and, instead of having one leech draining her of 
     <lb/>
     her resources, Upper Canada would have three. 
     <lb/>
     Before entering into new alliances. it should be 
     <lb/>
     the effort of Upper Canadians to regulate the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of their own province, to obtain represen<lb break="no"/>tation by population, and to open the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territory, so that when the Federation of all the 
     <lb/>
     British American provinces does come, it may be 
     <lb/>
     found with Upper Canada as the central figure of 
     <lb/>
     the group of states, with western adjuncts as well 
     <lb/>
     as eastern. Not even the most ardent supporter 
     <lb/>
     of the union of all the provinces can allege that 
     <lb/>
     there is any absolute necessity for haste in carry<lb break="no"/>ing out the project. Nobody is being hurt by 
     <lb/>
     the provinces remaining in their present condition ; 
     <lb/>
     no one single material interest, either in Canada 
     <lb/>
     or the Lower Provinces, would be enhanced in 
     <lb/>
     value by the union.

            <p>Sir, I agree with the statement, that to go 
     <lb/>into the construction of this road without 
     <lb/>knowing what it is to cost, or over what par<lb break="no"/>ticular route it is to be built, is a thing not 
     <lb/>to be thought of by any prudent member of 
     <lb/>this House, and that such a proposal ought to 
     <lb/>be resisted at every stage. I think, too, that 
     <lb/>the whole scheme, apart from the construction 
     <lb/>of the railway, is worse than the railway 
     <lb/>scheme itself, and ought to be still more 
     <lb/>strongly opposed. It is a mere revival of a 
     <lb/>scheme that has been rejected by the people 
     <lb/>on every occasion on which it has been 
     <lb/>presented to them during the past seven years. 
     <lb/>Independent of various other considerations 
     <lb/>the mere question of its expense ought to 
     <lb/>cause it to be rejected by the representatives 
     <lb/>of the people. When the duties on imports 
     <lb/>were raised to twenty and twenty-five per 
     <lb/>cent., what was the cry we heard from the 
     <lb/>lower portion of the province ? It was that 
     <lb/>the people were quite unable to pay such a 
     <lb/>serious tax, and the result was the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of a free port at GaspÃ©. We have not, 
     <lb/>for several years, collected a single cent of 
     <lb/>income from that large section of country, but 
     <lb/>have, from year to year, paid out large sums 
     <lb/>of money for the opening up of roads, for the 
     <lb/>administration of justice, and for keeping up

     a steam summer communication with the ex<lb break="no"/>treme eastern section of the province. More 
     <lb/>
     money has been squandered in that section of 
     <lb/>
     the country than on any other, yet it has 
     <lb/>
     produced no revenue. And that was the 
     <lb/>
     character of the country through which the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial road was to run, both in Canada 
     <lb/>
     and in New Brunswick. For we are asked to 
     <lb/>
     add, at one stroke, to our debt of sixty â€”two 
     <lb/>
     and a half millions of dollars, an annual c harge 
     <lb/>
     representing in capital the moderate sum of 
     <lb/>
     one hundred and twenty-four millionsâ€”for 
     <lb/>
     that is the financial nature of the proposition, 
     <lb/>
     and this for the purpose of adding 900,000 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants to our population, most of whom 
     <lb/>
     are not in a better position, if they are in as 
     <lb/>
     good, as the people of the district of GaspÃ©. 
     <lb/>
    Hear, hear.) Sir, in 1841, nearly twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>five years ago, Lower Canada entered into the 
     <lb/>union of the provinces with a debt of Â£133,<lb break="no"/>000. That was a debt created by the Special 
     <lb/>Council, for the Legislature of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>under the old Constitution owed not a penny 
     <lb/>when it ceased to exist. That debt was 
     <lb/>created between 1837 and 1840. Since the 
     <lb/>union there have been expended in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, for the Beauharnois canal, the en<lb break="no"/>largement of the Lachine canal, the works 
     <lb/>on Lake St. Peter, and the Chambly canal, 
     <lb/>about four millions of dollars. Besides, we 
     <lb/>have three hundred and fifty miles of the 
     <lb/>Grand Trunk Railwayâ€”about a hundred less 
     <lb/>than Upper Canada. Taking one-half the 
     <lb/>cost to the province of that railway â€”â€”two 
     <lb/>million pounds currency, or eight millions of 
     <lb/>dollarsâ€”we have four millions for canals and 
     <lb/>eight millions for railways. Twelve millions 
     <lb/>of dollars have, therefore, been expended for 
     <lb/>public works in Lower Canada, with perhaps 
     <lb/>another million for other small worksâ€”in all, 
     <lb/>thirteen millions of dollars.

     never have to pay a copper of it, any more 
     <lb/>
     than it will of the municipal indebtedness of 
     <lb/>
     the city of Montreal, the interest of which is 
     <lb/>
    regularly paid every year. Twelve or thirteen 
     <lb/>millions of dollars' worth of public works is 
     <lb/>all we are able to show for an increase of our 
     <lb/>debt from Â£133,000 at the time of the union, 
     <lb/>to $27,500,000, which, on going out of the 
     <lb/>union to enter into the Confederation, is the 
     <lb/>Lower Canada proportion of the $62,500,<lb break="no"/><cb/>000 of public debt we are bringing into it. 
     <lb/>I do not take into consideration the Municipal 
     <lb/>Loan Fund indebtedness, nor the Seigniorial 
     <lb/>Tenure redemption, because if we have re<lb break="no"/>ceived any benefit from the outlay, we are 
     <lb/>going to be charged for those items separately 
     <lb/>over and above our share in the $62,500,000. 
     <lb/>If I am not right in thus stating the case, I 
     <lb/>hope honorable gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>of the House will correct me. From the ex<lb break="no"/>planations given the other day by the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Finance Minister, I infer that by putting 
     <lb/>the Seigniorial Tenure to the charge of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, and by Upper Canada abandoning 
     <lb/>its indemnity or the Seigniorial Tenure ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, there is no necessity for taking 
     <lb/>those items into account as part of the 
     <lb/>liability of Canada in the Confederation; 
     <lb/>that the charge for the redemption of the 
     <lb/>Seigniorial Tenure, the township indemnity 
     <lb/>under the Seigniorial Act of 1859, the interest 
     <lb/>on that indemnity, the liability of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince to the Superior Education Fund, and 
     <lb/>the loss on the Lower Canada Municipal Loan 
     <lb/>Fund, amounting in all to about $4,500,000, 
     <lb/>will have to be paid by Lower Canada alone, the 
     <lb/>interest on which, at five per cent, will be 
     <lb/>$225,000, which sum will be retained out of 
     <lb/>the $880,000 to be paid the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to Lower Canada or local purposes, 
     <lb/>leaving something less than 60 cents per head 
     <lb/>for carrying on the Local Government. Upper 
     <lb/>Canada came into the union with a debt of 
     <lb/>Â£1,300,000. Immediately after the union 
     <lb/>Â£1,500,000 sterling was borrowed for public 
     <lb/>works, most of which amount was expended in 
     <lb/>Upper Canada. And yet Upper Canada goes 
     <lb/>out of the union by simply abandoning its 
     <lb/>claim for indemnity under the Seigniorial 
     <lb/>Tenure Act, having nothing to assume but its 
     <lb/>Municipal Loan Fund and its share in the 
     <lb/>Federal debt; while Lower Canada, on the 
     <lb/>contrary, goes out with a load of $4,500,000 
     <lb/>of local debt, besides the $27,500,000 
     <lb/>which falls to its share to be paid through 
     <lb/>the General Government. And this, too, 
     <lb/>after paying for twenty-five years a highly 
     <lb/>increase taxation, for all which it has 
     <lb/>nothing to show except public improvements 
     <lb/>to the amount of about $13,000,000. Sir, 
     <lb/>if such a scheme as this, on being submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the people, would be approved by them, 
     <lb/>I am very much mistaken. I submit that no 
     <lb/>such project ought to be voted by the House, 
     <lb/>before we have the fullest information neces<lb break="no"/>sary to enable us to come to right conclusions. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) It is for the security of the

     this demand. Honorable gentlemen who cry 
     <lb/>
     "hear! hear !" may find themselves very much 
     <lb/>
     disappointed, if, after this portion of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     is passed, the local constitutions proposed 
     <lb/>
     were quite unsatisfactory. I contend that 
     <lb/>
     the local constitutions are as much an essential 
     <lb/>
     part of the whole as the general Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     and that they both should have been laid at 
     <lb/>
     the same time before the House. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We ought, besides, to have a clear 
     <lb/>
     statement of what are the liabilities specially 
     <lb/>
     assigned to Upper and Lower Canada. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is well that Upper Canada should 
     <lb/>
     know if she has to pay the indebtedness 
     <lb/>
     of Port Hope, Cobourg, Brockville, Nia<lb break="no"/>gara, and other municipalities which have 
     <lb/>
     borrowed from the municipal loan fund, 
     <lb/>
     and what these liabilities are; and it is 
     <lb/>
     important for Lower Canada to be told 
     <lb/>
     what are the amounts they will be required 
     <lb/>
     to tax themselves for. We ought, besides, to 
     <lb/>
     obtain some kind of information upon the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the Intercolonial Railway, what is 
     <lb/>
     the proposed cost, and what route is to be 
     <lb/>
     followed; and before these facts are before the 
     <lb/>
     House, we ought not to take it upon ourselves 
     <lb/>
     to legislate on the subject. Still further, the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country do not understand the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. (Hear, hear.) Many members of 
     <lb/>
     this House, before hearing the explanations 
     <lb/>
     which have been offered, were, and others are 
     <lb/>
     still, in doubt as to the bearing of many of 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions. In the Upper House doubts 
     <lb/>
     were expressed as to who should recommend 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of the members composing 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council. It was thought in 
     <lb/>
     many quarters that the appointment of these 
     <lb/>
     members was to be made by the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments after the scheme should come into 
     <lb/>
     operation. But this it seems is a mistake. 
     <lb/>
     here are many other matters with which we 
     <lb/>
     are unacquainted, particularly as regards the 
     <lb/>
     assets and liabilities. There is a provision 
     <lb/>
     that the nomination of the judges of the 
     <lb/>
     superior courts shall be vested in the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, but it would seem that the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the courts is to be left to the 
     <lb/>
     local governments; and I put the question, 
     <lb/>
     What does this mean? Do you mean that 
     <lb/>
     the local governments are to establish as many 
     <lb/>
     courts as they please, declare of how many 
     <lb/>
     judges they will be composed, and that the 
     <lb/>
     General Government will have to pay for 
     <lb/>
     them? Is a local government to say, here is a 
     <lb/>
     court with three judges; we want five, and those 
     <lb/>
     five must be appointed and paid by the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government ? I have received no answer 
     <lb/>
     to this and to several other questions. I can 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         

     well understand what is meant by the regula<lb break="no"/>tion of the law of divorce; but what is meant 
     <lb/>
     by the regulation of the marriage question ? 
     <lb/>
     Is the General Government to be at liberty 
     <lb/>
     to set aside all that we have been in the habit 
     <lb/>
     of doing in Lower Canada in this respect ? 
     <lb/>
     Will the General Government have the power 
     <lb/>
     to determine the degree of relationship and 
     <lb/>
     the age beyond which parties may marry, 
     <lb/>
     as well as the consent which will be required 
     <lb/>
     to make a marriage valid? (Hear, ear.) 
     <lb/>
     Will all these questions be left to the General 
     <lb/>
     Government? If so, it will have the power 
     <lb/>
     to upset one of the most important portions 
     <lb/>
     of our civil code, and one affecting more 
     <lb/>
     than any other all classes of society. The 
     <lb/>
     adoption, for instance, of the English rule, 
     <lb/>
     whereby females at the age of twelve, and 
     <lb/>
     males at the age of fourteen, can contract a 
     <lb/>
     valid marriage without the consent of parents, 
     <lb/>
     tutors or guardians, would be looked to by the 
     <lb/>
     mass of the people of Lower Canada as a most 
     <lb/>
     objectionable innovation in our laws, as would 
     <lb/>
     also any provision to allow such marriages to 
     <lb/>
     take place before any common magistrate 
     <lb/>
     without any formality whatsoever. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Yet is there no danger that such 
     <lb/>
     measures might be carried, when you see the 
     <lb/>
     different feelings existing on these questions 
     <lb/>
     among the people of the different provinces ? 
     <lb/>
     There is another question to which I must 
     <lb/>
     refer before closing. It is said that the 
     <lb/>
     division of the debt is a fair one. We have 
     <lb/>
     given, say the Government, $25 of debt to 
     <lb/>
     each inhabitantâ€”that is, in those provinces 
     <lb/>
     where it was less, they have increased it to 
     <lb/>
     that amount, charging it to the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and thereb they have made a present to 
     <lb/>
     the several provinces of the difference between 
     <lb/>
     their present indebtedness and the 425 per 
     <lb/>
     head. (Laughter.) This $25 per head, 
     <lb/>
     when compared to the debt of England, is a 
     <lb/>
     heavier burden upon our own people than the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial debt upon the people of England, 
     <lb/>
     taking into consideration the greater wealth 
     <lb/>
     per individual in England and the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the greater part of that debt bears three per 
     <lb/>
     cent. interest. (Hear, hear.) There is an<lb break="no"/>other aspect in which this question of debt is 
     <lb/>
     to be considered. To equalize it, the Con<lb break="no"/>ference have increased it on the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     present pulation for the several provinces. 
     <lb/>
     This is fair enough at present, supposing that 
     <lb/>
     each province contribute the same proportion 
     <lb/>
     to the general revenue, and would continue to 
     <lb/>
     be so if their population progressed in the 
     <lb/>
     same ratio of increase; but, from the 
     <lb/>
    natural advantages of Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>

     Canada, and their greater area of arable lands, 
     <lb/>
     there is no doubt they will increase in popu<lb break="no"/>lation and wealth in a much greater ratio than 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, and in ten years hence, 
     <lb/>
     this proprtion, which this day appears a fair 
     <lb/>
     one, will have much increased for Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, while it will have diminished 
     <lb/>
     for the Lower Provinces. (Hear, hear.)  I 
     <lb/>
     owe an apology to the House for having of<lb break="no"/>fered such lengthened remarks on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and I have to thank honorable members 
     <lb/>
     for having so kindly listened to them. (Cries 
     <lb/>
     of "go on.")  I will simply content myself 
     <lb/>
     with saying that for these reasons which I 
     <lb/>
     have so imperfectly exposed, I strongly fear 
     <lb/>
     it would be a dark day for Canada when she 
     <lb/>
     adopted such a scheme as this. (Cheers.) It 
     <lb/>
     would be one marked in the history of this 
     <lb/>
     country as having had a most depressing and 
     <lb/>
     crushing influence on the energies of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in both U per and Lower Canadaâ€”(hear 
     <lb/>hear) â€” for I consider it one of the worst 
     <lb/>schemes that could be brought under the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the House ; and if it should be 
     <lb/>adopted without the sanction of the people, 
     <lb/>the country would never cease to regret it. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.)  What is the necessity for all 
     <lb/>this haste ? The longer this Constitution is 
     <lb/>expected to last, the greater the necessity for 
     <lb/>the fullest consideration and dehberation. I 
     <lb/>find, sir, that when, in 1839, Lord JOHN RUS<lb break="no"/>SELL brought into the House of Commons his 
     <lb/>first measure for the union of the provinces, 
     <lb/>he announced his intention to lay his measure 
     <lb/>before the House, have it read a second time, 
     <lb/>and postpone it till next session, to give a 
     <lb/>year to the people of Canada to consider it 
     <lb/>and make such representations as they would 
     <lb/>think proper. (Hear, hear.) And it was only 
     <lb/>in the subsequent session, and after under<lb break="no"/>going considerable modifications in the mean 
     <lb/>time, that the measure was passed.  Nothing 
     <lb/>could be more reasonable than such delay. 
     <lb/>But here it seems the people are to be treat<lb break="no"/>ed with less respect than they were when their 
     <lb/>Constitution was suspended , and this meas<lb break="no"/>ure is to be pushed with indecent haste. 
     <lb/>There are three modes of obtaining the views 
     <lb/>of the people upon the question now under 
     <lb/>discussion.  The most direct one would be, 
     <lb/>after debating it in this House, to submit it 
     <lb/>to the people for their verdict, yea or nay. 
     <lb/>The second is to dissolve the House and 
     <lb/>appeal to the people.  The third is to discuss 
     <lb/>and pass the resolutions or address to a 
     <lb/>second reading,and afterwards leave it open 
     <lb/>to the ublic to judge of its merits, by meet<lb break="no"/>ing an discussing it, and sending in petitions 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          

     and instructing their representatives how to 
     <lb/>
     vote upon it when they came to Parliament 
     <lb/>
     at the next session.  Any one of these 
     <lb/>
     methods would elicit the views of the people. 
     <lb/>
     But to say that the opinions of the people 
     <lb/>
     have been ascertained on the question, I say 
     <lb/>
     it is no such thing.  (Hear, hear.)  We 
     <lb/>
     have heard one side of the question discussed, 
     <lb/>
     but we have heard none of the views on the 
     <lb/>
     other side ; and yet the feeling, as exhibited 
     <lb/>
     in some parts of the country, has been un<lb break="no"/>mistakeably in favor of an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people.  Some fifteen counties in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada have held meetings and declared for 
     <lb/>
     an appeal before the scheme is allowed to 
     <lb/>
     pass ; and when honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     other side have held second meetings, they 
     <lb/>
     have been condemned more conclusively than 
     <lb/>
     at first.  (Hear, hear.)  In the county of 
     <lb/>
     Rouville, the hon. member representing that 
     <lb/>
     county , not satisfied with the first expression 
     <lb/>
     of opinion, held a second meeting , but the 
     <lb/>
     decision was still more emphatic than at the 
     <lb/>
     first. (Hear, hear.) Then meetings have 
     <lb/>
     been held, all tending to the same conclusion, 
     <lb/>
     in St. Maurice, MaskinongÃ©, Berthier, Joli<lb break="no"/>ette, Richelieu, Chambly, VercherÃ¨s, Bagot, 
     <lb/>
     St. Hyacinthe, Iberville, St. John's, Napier<lb break="no"/>ville, Drummond and Arthabaska, Two 
     <lb/>
     Mountains, Vaudreuil, and also in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal.

            <p><persName ref="pers:BELL1">MR. BELLEROSE</persName>â€”What about Laval ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>â€”Yes, a meeting was 
     <lb/>called, and called without the requisite 
     <lb/>notice ; the notice having been given at the 
     <lb/>church doors on a Friday for a meeting on 
     <lb/>the next day; but notwithstanding, when 
     <lb/>the meeting was held, the hon. gentleman did 
     <lb/>not dare press a resolution in favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, but simply one of confidence in 
     <lb/>himself. (Hear, hear.) His friends co<lb break="no"/>lected together, and all they did was to 
     <lb/>express confidence in him. There was no 
     <lb/>resolution in favor of Confederation, nor of 
     <lb/>passing such a measure without submitting 
     <lb/>it to the people. (Hear, hear.) I have now 
     <lb/>to thank the House for the patience with 
     <lb/>which they have listened to my remarks. 
     <lb/>In the terms of the paragraph I have quoted 
     <lb/>from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, I shall feel it my duty to 
     <lb/>resist the passage of the measure at every 
     <lb/>stage, with a view that the scheme should 
     <lb/>go to the people in some shape or other. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) There is no hurry in regard 
     <lb/>to the scheme.  We are now legislating for 
     <lb/>the future as well as for the present, and 
     <lb/>feeling that we ought to make a Constitution 
     <lb/>as perfect as possibe, and as far as possible 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">269</fw>

     in harmony with the views of the people, I 
     <lb/>
     maintain that we ought not to pass this 
     <lb/>
     measure now, but leave it to another year, in 
     <lb/>
     order to ascertain in the meantime what the 
     <lb/>
     views and sentimentsof the people actually 
     <lb/>
     are. (The honorablc gentleman was loudly 
     <lb/>
     cheered on resuming his seat.) 
     <lb/></p>

<p>
    After some discussion as to the mode of 
     <lb/>continuing the debate, the House adjourned 
     <lb/>at ten minutes past twelve.

     HON. MR. CURRIE saidâ€”Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, with the consent of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     opposite (Hon. Mr. DICKSON) who is en<lb break="no"/>titled to the floor, in consequence of having 
     <lb/>
     moved the adjournment of the debate, I 
     <lb/>
     rise for the purpose of proposing the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which for some length of time has been 
     <lb/>
     before the House, on the notice-paper. It is 
     <lb/>
     one which, I think, should commend itself 
     <lb/>
     to the good sense and impartial iudgment 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this Honorable House; 
     <lb/>
     and I shall be surprised if it shall meet any 
     <lb/>
     degree of opposition from the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men representing the Government in this 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The resolution is as follows :â€” 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That upon a matter of such great importance 
     <lb/>
     as the purposed Confederation of this and certain 
     <lb/>
     other British colonies, this House is unwilling to 
     <lb/>
     assume the responsibility of assenting to a mea<lb break="no"/>sure involving so many important considerations, 
     <lb/>
     without further manifestation of the public will 
     <lb/>
     than has yet been declared. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not aimed at either the destruction 
     <lb/>
     or the defeat of 'the resolutions before the 
     <lb/>
     House. It simply asks for delay until such 
     <lb/>
     time as the people of the country can more 
     <lb/>
     fully express their views on the matter than 
     <lb/>
     they have hitherto had an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     doing Hon. gentlemen, I stated, when I 
     <lb/>
     first addressed this Chamber in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the proposed address, that I was not opposed 
     <lb/>
     "? the Confederation of the British Pro- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     mess in itself, but that I was opposed to 
     <lb/>
     many of the details embraced in the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions upon which this House is asked to 
     <lb/>
     found an Address to Her Majesty the 
     <lb/>
     Queen. The hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. ROSS) 
     <lb/>
     who followed me upon that occasion, stated 
     <lb/>
     among other things, that I had attempted 
     <lb/>
     to decry the Lower Provinces, and that I 
     <lb/>
     had attempted also to decry the credit of 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     
    Canada. I appeal to hon. members present, 
     <lb/>who were good enough to listen to me on that 
     <lb/>occasion, to point out a single word which I 
     <lb/>said, reflecting upon the credit of the people 
     <lb/>of the eastern provinces. Instead of having 
     <lb/>said anything to their discredit, I thought 
     <lb/>I had paid them a very high compliment. 
     <lb/>So far from reflecting upon the character of 
     <lb/>the public men of those provinces, I alluded 
     <lb/>to but one of them by name, the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>TILLEY, and I paid him the compliment, 
     <lb/>which he fully merits, of stating that he 
     <lb/>must be ranked among the leading and most 
     <lb/>prominent of British American statesmen. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) As to my decrying the credit 
     <lb/>of Canadaâ€”if, to tell the truthâ€”if, to speak 
     <lb/>the honest convictions of one's mindâ€”if, to 
     <lb/>state to the world what the Public Accounts 
     <lb/>of our country tell usâ€”if this be to decry 
     <lb/>the credit of our countryâ€”then I am guilty 
     <lb/>of the charge. But the hon. gentleman went 
     <lb/>on and told us, that my speech was so illo<lb break="no"/>gical that it was unworthy of notice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     HON. MR. ROSSâ€”I did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. CURRIEâ€”The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said what amounted to that. And yet 
     <lb/>
     to my astonishment be found it necessary to 
     <lb/>
     reply to me in a speech four columns in 
     <lb/>
     lengthâ€”a speech, however, in which he 
     <lb/>
     failed to controvert a single position which 
     <lb/>
     I had the honor to take on that occasion. 
     <lb/>
     Then I was charged with having attacked 
     <lb/>
     statements of fact made by our public men. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. ROSSâ€”Hear! hear ! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. CURRIE-The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man from Toronto says " Hear, hear." But 
     <lb/>
     I ask, is it not the duty of hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, standing on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House, to correct misstatements which have 
     <lb/>
     been sent to the country? Was I doing 
     <lb/>
     anything more than my duty, when, in 
     <lb/>
     my humble way, I endeavored to correct 
     <lb/>
     what, if not misstatements, were at least 
     <lb/>
     evidently incorrect statements? We have 
     <lb/>
     had too much of that kind of thing in this 
     <lb/>
     country. And since my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Hon. Mr. ROSS) has chosen to 
     <lb/>
     remind me of it, I must say that I think it 
     <lb/>
     is much to be regretted that certain state<lb break="no"/>ments have been made in this country, and 
     <lb/>
     sent from this country, which, instead of 
     <lb/>
     helping to build up our credit, have done 
     <lb/>
     much to injure it. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     I could not allude to anything more forcibly 
     <lb/>
     in point, than the flaming prospectus sent to 
     <lb/>
     the world under the auspices of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Toronto, in which he promised 
     <lb/>
    the confiding capitalists of England a
