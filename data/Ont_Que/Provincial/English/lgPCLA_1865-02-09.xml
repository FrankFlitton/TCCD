     The order of the day for resuming the 
     <lb/>
     adjourned debate on the proposed Address 
     <lb/>
     to Her Majesty, on the subject of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces having been called ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Honorable <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">MR. McGEE</persName> said—Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I rise to endeavor to fulfil the 
     <lb/>
     promise made in my name last evening by 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Canadian leader of this House. 
     <lb/>
     After the four speeches that have already 
     <lb/>
     been delivered from this quarter of the 
     <lb/>
     House, it may very well be supposed that 
     <lb/>
     little of essential importance remains to be 
     <lb/>
     said. On Monday the Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West, in exposing the case for the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, in moving this Address to Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty, went very fully through all the 
     <lb/>
     items of the resolutions agreed upon at the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference, and gave us a full 
     <lb/>
     analysis of the whole project with his own 
     <lb/>
     constitutional commentaries upon the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of that body. On the next evening, 
     <lb/>
     the Attorney General East gave us his views 
     <lb/>
     also, treating chiefly of the difficulties in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. The same night, my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, the Minister of Finance, gave us a 
     <lb/>
     financial view of the whole subject ; and last 
     <lb/>
     evening the Hon. President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     gave us another extended financial and 
     <lb/>
     political address, with some arguments from 
     <lb/>
     " the Upper Canadian point of view," as the 
     <lb/>
     phrase is. It may well therefore seem that 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     after these speeches little of essential import<lb break="no"/>ance remains to be stated. Still this subject 
     <lb/>
     is so vast, the project before the House is so 
     <lb/>
     vast, and comprehends within it so many 
     <lb/>
     objects of interest, the atmosphere that sur<lb break="no"/>rounds a subject of this importance is so 
     <lb/>
     subtle and fluctuating, that there may be, I 
     <lb/>
     am feign to believe, a little joiner-work still 
     <lb/>
     left to do—there may be a <hi rendition="simple:italic">hiatus</hi> here and 
     <lb/>
     there to fill up ; and although, as far as what 
     <lb/>
     is called " the preliminary case" is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     the question might perhaps very well have 
     <lb/>
     rested with the four speeches already 
     <lb/>
    delivered—there may be some slight addi<lb break="no"/>tional contribution made, and, such as it is, 
     <lb/>in my own humble way, I propose to make it 
     <lb/>to-night. (Hear, hear.) We all remember 
     <lb/>that in the nursery legend of the Three Kings 
     <lb/>of Cologne, CASPAR brought myrrh, and 
     <lb/>MELOCHIOR incense, and BALTASSAR gold, 
     <lb/>but I am afraid my contribution will be less 
     <lb/>valuable than any of these, yet such as it is 
     <lb/>I cheerfully bring it, particularly when there 
     <lb/>are so many in this and the other provinces 
     <lb/>who would like to know what my own views 
     <lb/>are in relation to the present crisis. (Hear-) 
     <lb/>With your approbation, sir, and the for<lb break="no"/>bearance of the House, I will endeavour to treat 
     <lb/>this subject in this way :—First, to give some 
     <lb/>slight sketch of the history of the question ; 
     <lb/>then to examine the existing motives which 
     <lb/>ought to prompt us to secure a speedy union 
     <lb/>of these provinces ; then to speak of the 
     <lb/>difficulties which this question has encoun<lb break="no"/>tered before reaching its present fortunate 
     <lb/>stage ; then to say something of the mutual 
     <lb/>advantages, in a social rather than political 
     <lb/>point of view, which these provinces will 
     <lb/>have in their union, and lastly to add a few 
     <lb/>words on the Federal principle in general, 
     <lb/>when I shall have done. In other words, I 
     <lb/>propose to consider the question of union 
     <lb/>mainly from within, and as far as possible to 
     <lb/>avoid going over the ground already so fully 
     <lb/>and so much better occupied by hon. friends 
     <lb/>who have already spoken upon the subject. 
     <lb/>My hon. friend, the member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga, thought he did a very clever thing the 
     <lb/>other evening when he disentombed an old 
     <lb/>newspaper article of mine, entitled " A 
     <lb/>New Nationality," and endeavored to fix on 
     <lb/>me the paternity of the phrase—destined to 
     <lb/>become prophetic—which was employed by 
     <lb/>a very distinguished personage in the Speach 
     <lb/>from the Throne at the opening of the 
     <lb/>session. I do happen to remember the 
     <lb/>article alluded to as one of my first 
     <lb/>essays in political writing in Canada ; but 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="126" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0126.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">126</fw>
         
     I am quite sure that the almost forgotten 
     <lb/>
     publication in which it appeared was ne<lb break="no"/>ver known, even by name, to the illustrious 
     <lb/>
     person who delivered the speech on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion. But I will own when I saw 
     <lb/>
     my bantling held up to the admiration of 
     <lb/>
     the House in the delicate and fostering hands 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for Hochelaga, I was 
     <lb/>
     not ashamed of it ; on the contrary, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     there was some tingling of parental pride 
     <lb/>
     when I saw what ten years ago I pointed out 
     <lb/>
     as the true position for these colonies to take, 
     <lb/>
     about to be adopted by all the colonies un<lb break="no"/>der such favorable circumstances. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it ought to be made a matter of re- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     roach to me, or a cause for belittling the 
     <lb/>
     importance of the subject, that ten years ago 
     <lb/>
     I used the identical phrase employed in the 
     <lb/>
     Speech from the Throne. The idea itself is 
     <lb/>
     a good one, and it may have floated through 
     <lb/>
     the minds of many men and received intel<lb break="no"/>lectual hospitality even from the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga himself. One is re<lb break="no"/>minded by this sort of thing, of Puff in the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Critic</hi>. "Two people" happened "to hit 
     <lb/>
     upon the same thought, and SHAKSPERE 
     <lb/>
      made use of it first—that's all." (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     My honorable friend is in this respect, no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, the SHAKSPERE of the new nation<lb break="no"/>ality. (Renewed laughter.) If there is any<lb break="no"/>thing in the article he has read to the House 
     <lb/>
     which is deserving of disapprobation, he is 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">particeps criminis</hi>, and equally blameable if 
     <lb/>
     not more blameable than myself. He is in<lb break="no"/>deed the older sinner, and I bow to him in 
     <lb/>
     that character with all proper humility. 
     <lb/>
     (Renewed laughter.) Really, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     the attempt to fix the parentage of this child 
     <lb/>
     of many fathers is altogether absurd and 
     <lb/>
     futile. It is almost as ridiculous as the at<lb break="no"/>tempt to fix the name of this new Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, in advance of the decision of the 
     <lb/>
     Gracious Lady to whom the matter is to be 
     <lb/>
     referred. I have read in one newspaper 
     <lb/>
     published in a western city not less than a 
     <lb/>
     dozen attempts of this nature. One indi<lb break="no"/>vidual chooses Tuponia and another Hochel<lb break="no"/>aga, as a suitable name for the new national<lb break="no"/>ity. Now I would ask any hon. member of 
     <lb/>
     this House how he would feel if he woke up 
     <lb/>
     some fine morning and found himself, instead 
     <lb/>
     of a Canadian, a Tuponian or Hochelagan<lb break="no"/>der. (Laughter.)  I think, sir, we may 
     <lb/>
     safely leave for the present the discussion 
     <lb/>
     of the name as well as the origin of the new 
     <lb/>
     system proposed ; when the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     has a place among the nations of the world, 
     <lb/>
    and opens a new page in history, it will be 
     <lb/>
       
            <cb/>
   
     time enough to look into its antecedents, and 
     <lb/>
     when it has reached this stage there are a 
     <lb/>
     few men who, having struggled for it in its 
     <lb/>
     earlier difficulties, will then deserve to be 
     <lb/>
     honorably mentioned. I shall not be guilty 
     <lb/>
     of the bad taste of complimenting those with 
     <lb/>
     whom I have the honor to be associated ; 
     <lb/>
     but when we reach the stage of research, 
     <lb/>
     which lies far beyond the stage of delibera<lb break="no"/>tion in these affairs, there are some names 
     <lb/>
     that ought not to be forgotten. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) So far back as the year 1800, the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Mr. UNIACKE, a leading politi<lb break="no"/>cian in Nova Scotia at that date, submitted 
     <lb/>
     a scheme of Colonial Union to the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     authorities. In 1815, Chief Justice SEWELL, 
     <lb/>
     whose name will be well remembered 
     <lb/>
     as a leading lawyer of this city and far<lb break="no"/>sighted politician, submitted a scheme. 
     <lb/>
     In 1822, Sir JOHN BEVERLEY ROBIN<lb break="no"/>SON, at the request of the Colonial Office, 
     <lb/>
     submitted a project of the same kind; 
     <lb/>
     and I need not refer to the report of Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM on Colonial Union in 1839. These 
     <lb/>
     are all memorable, and some of them are 
     <lb/>
     great names. If we have dreamed a dream 
     <lb/>
     of union (as some hon. gentlemen say), it 
     <lb/>
     is at least worth while remarking that a 
     <lb/>
     dream which has been dreamed by such wise 
     <lb/>
     and good men, may, for aught we know or 
     <lb/>
     you know, have been a sort of vision—a vision 
     <lb/>
     foreshadowing forthcoming natural events in 
     <lb/>
     a clear intelligence. A vision (I say it with<lb break="no"/>out irreverence, for the event concerns the 
     <lb/>
     lives of millions living, and yet to come) re<lb break="no"/>sembling those seen by the DANIELS and 
     <lb/>
     JOSEPHS of old, foreshadowing the trials of 
     <lb/>
     the future ; the fate of tribes and peoples ; 
     <lb/>
     the rise and fall of dynasties. But the im<lb break="no"/>mediate history of the measure is sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     wonderful without dwelling on the remoter 
     <lb/>
     predictions of so many wise men. Who<lb break="no"/>ever, in 1862, or even in 1863, would have 
     <lb/>
     told us that we should see, even what we see 
     <lb/>
     in these seats by which I stand—such a re<lb break="no"/>presentation of interests acting together, 
     <lb/>
     would be accounted, as our Scotch friends 
     <lb/>
     say, " half-daft ;"—and whoever, in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces about the same time, would 
     <lb/>
     have ventured to foretell the composition of 
     <lb/>
     their delegations, which sat with us under 
     <lb/>
     this roof last October, would probably 
     <lb/>
     have been considered equally demented. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) But the thing came about, and 
     <lb/>
     if those gentlemen, who have had no imme<lb break="no"/>diate hand in bringing it about, and there<lb break="no"/>fore naturally felt less interest in the pro<lb break="no"/>ject than we who did, will only give us the 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="127" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0127.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">127</fw>
          
     benefit of the doubt, will only assume that 
     <lb/>
     we are not all altogether wrong-headed, we 
     <lb/>
     hope to show them still farther, as we think 
     <lb/>
     we have already shown them, that we are by 
     <lb/>
     no means without reason in entering on this 
     <lb/>
     enterprise. I submit, however, we may very 
     <lb/>
     well dismiss the antecedent history of the 
     <lb/>
     question for the present : it grew from an 
     <lb/>
     unnoticed feeble plant, to be a stately and 
     <lb/>
     flourishing tree, and for my part any one 
     <lb/>
     that pleases may say he made the tree grow, 
     <lb/>
     if I can only have hereafter my fair share 
     <lb/>
     of the shelter and the shade. (Cheers) But 
     <lb/>
     in the present stage of the question, the first 
     <lb/>
     real stage of its success—the thing that gave 
     <lb/>
     importance to theory in men's minds—was 
     <lb/>
     the now celebrated despatch, signed by two 
     <lb/>
     members of this Government and an hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman formerly their colleague, a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the other House ; I refer to the des<lb break="no"/>patch of 1858. The recommendations in 
     <lb/>
     that despatch lay dormant until revived by 
     <lb/>
     the Constitutional Committee of last Session, 
     <lb/>
     which led to the Coalition, which led to the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference, which led to the draft 
     <lb/>
     of the Constitution now on our table, which 
     <lb/>
     will lead, I am fain to believe, to the union 
     <lb/>
     of all these provinces. (Hear, hear.) At 
     <lb/>
     the same time that we mention the distin<lb break="no"/>guished politicians, I think we ought not to 
     <lb/>
     forget those zealous and laborious contribu<lb break="no"/>tors to the public press, who, although not 
     <lb/>
     associated with governments, and not them<lb break="no"/>selves at the time in politics, addressed the 
     <lb/>
     public mind, and greatly contributed to give 
     <lb/>
     life and interest to this question, and indi<lb break="no"/>rectly to bring it to the happy position in 
     <lb/>
     which it now stands. Of those gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     I will mention two. 1 do not know whether 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen of this House have seen some 
     <lb/>
     letters on colonial union, written in 1855, the 
     <lb/>
     last addressed to the late Duke of NEW<lb break="no"/>CASTLE, by Mr. P. S. HAMILTON, an able 
     <lb/>
     public writer of Nova Scotia, and the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Gold Commissioner of that province ; 
     <lb/>
     but I take this opportunity of bearing my 
     <lb/>
     testimony to his well-balanced judgment, 
     <lb/>
     political sagacity and the skilful handling 
     <lb/>
     the subject received from him at a very early 
     <lb/>
     period. (Hear, hear. There is another 
     <lb/>
     little book written in English, six or seven 
     <lb/>
     years ago, to which I must refer. It is a 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet, which met with an extraordinary 
     <lb/>
    degreeof success, entitled Nova Britannia, 
     <lb/>by my hon. friend the member for South 
     <lb/>Lanark (Mr. MORRIS) ; and as he has 
     <lb/>been one of the principal agents in bringing 
     <lb/>into existence the present Government, 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     which is now carrying out the idea embodied 
     <lb/>
     in his book, I trust he will forgive me if I 
     <lb/>
     take the opportunity, although he is present, 
     <lb/>
     of reading a single sentence to show how far 
     <lb/>
     he was in advance and how true he was to 
     <lb/>
     the coming event, which we are now consid<lb break="no"/>ering. At page 57 of his pamphlet—which 
     <lb/>
     I hope will be reprinted among the political 
     <lb/>
     miscellanies of the provinces when we are 
     <lb/>
     one country and one people—I find this 
     <lb/>
     paragraph :-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The dealing with the destinies of a future 
     <lb/>
     Britannic empire, the shaping its course, the lay<lb break="no"/>ing its foundations broad and deep, and the erect<lb break="no"/>ing thereon a noble and enduring superstructure, 
     <lb/>
     are indeed duties that may well evoke the ener<lb break="no"/>gies of our people, and nerve the arms and give 
     <lb/>
     power and enthusiasm to the aspirations of all 
     <lb/>
     true patriots. The very magnitude of the inter<lb break="no"/>ests involved, will, I doubt not, elevate many 
     <lb/>
     amongst us above the demands of mere sectional<lb break="no"/>ism, and enable them to evince sufficient compre<lb break="no"/>hensiveness of mind to deal in the spirit of real 
     <lb/>
     statesmen with issues so momentous, and to origi<lb break="no"/>nate and develope a national line of commercial 
     <lb/>
     and general policy, such as will prove adapted to 
     <lb/>
     the wants an exigencies of our position. 
     <lb/>
            </quote>
   
            <p>
     There are many other excellent passages 
     <lb/>
     in the work, but I will not detain the House 
     <lb/>
     with many quotations. The spirit that 
     <lb/>
     animates the whole will be seen from the 
     <lb/>
     extract I have read. But whatever the 
     <lb/>
     private writer in his closet may have con<lb break="no"/>ceived, whatever even the individual states<lb break="no"/>man may have designed, so long as the 
     <lb/>
     public mind was uninterested in the adop<lb break="no"/>tion, even in the discussion of a change in 
     <lb/>
     our position so momentous as this, the union 
     <lb/>
     of these separate provinces, the individual 
     <lb/>
     laboured in vain—perhaps sir, not wholly in 
     <lb/>
     vain, for although his work may not have 
     <lb/>
     borne fruit then, it was kindling a fire that 
     <lb/>
     would ultimately light up the whole political 
     <lb/>
     horizon, and herald the dawn of a better day 
     <lb/>
     for our country and our people. Events 
     <lb/>
     stronger than advocacy, events stronger than 
     <lb/>
     men, have come in at last like the fire 
     <lb/>
     behind the invisible writing to bring out the 
     <lb/>
     truth of these writings and to impress them 
     <lb/>
     upon the mind of every thoughtful man who 
     <lb/>
     has considered the position and probable 
     <lb/>
     future of these scattered provinces. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     Before I go further into the details of my 
     <lb/>
     subject, I will take this opportunity of con<lb break="no"/>gratulating this House and the public of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces upon the extraordinary activity 
     <lb/>
     which has been given to this subject since 
     <lb/>
     it has become a leading topic of public 
     <lb/>
     discussion in the maritime, and what I may 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="128" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0128.jpg"/>

     call relatively to them, the inland provinces. 
     <lb/>
     It is astonishing how active has been the 
     <lb/>
     public mind in all those communities since 
     <lb/>
     the subject has been fairly launched. I have 
     <lb/>
     watched with great attention the expression 
     <lb/>
     of public opinion in the Lower Provinces as 
     <lb/>
     well as in our own, and I am rejoiced to 
     <lb/>
     find that even in the smallest of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces I have been able to read writings and 
     <lb/>
     speeches which would do no discredit to 
     <lb/>
     older and more cultivated communities<lb break="no"/>articles and speeches worthy of any press and 
     <lb/>
     of any audience. The provincial mind, it 
     <lb/>
     would seem, under the inspiration of a great 
     <lb/>
    question, leaped at a single bound out of the 
     <lb/>slough of mere mercenary struggles for office, 
     <lb/>and took post on the high and honorable 
     <lb/>ground from which alone this great subject 
     <lb/>can be taken in in all its dimensions,—had 
     <lb/>risen at once to the true dignity of this 
     <lb/>discussion with an elasticity that does honor 
     <lb/>to the communities that have exhibited it, 
     <lb/>and gives assurance that we have the metal, 
     <lb/>the material, out of which to construct a new 
     <lb/>and vigorous nationality. (Cheers.) We 
     <lb/>find in the journals and in the speeches of 
     <lb/>public men in the Lower Provinces a discus<lb break="no"/>sion of the first principles of government, a 
     <lb/>discussion of the principles of constitutional 
     <lb/>law, and an intimate knowledge and close 
     <lb/>application of the leading facts in constitu<lb break="no"/>tional history, which gives to me at least the 
     <lb/>satisfaction and assurance that, if we never 
     <lb/>went farther in this matter, we have put an 
     <lb/>end for the present, and I hope for long, to 
     <lb/>bitterer and smaller controversies. We have 
     <lb/>given the people some sound mental food, 
     <lb/>and to every man who has a capacity for 
     <lb/>discussion we have given a topic upon which 
     <lb/>he can fitly exercise his powers, no longer 
     <lb/>gnawing at a file and wasting his abilities in 
     <lb/>the poor effort of advancing the ends of some 
     <lb/>paltry faction or party. I can congratulate 
     <lb/>this House and province and the provinces 
     <lb/>below, that such is the case, and I may 
     <lb/>observe, with some satisfaction, that the va<lb break="no"/>rious authors and writers seem to be speak<lb break="no"/>ing or writing as if in the visible presence 
     <lb/>of all the colonies. (Hear, hear.) They are 
     <lb/>no longer hole-and-corner celebrities : they 
     <lb/>seem to think that their words will be 
     <lb/>scanned and weighed afar off as well as at 
     <lb/>home. We have, I believe, several hundred 
     <lb/>celebrities in Canada — my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>MORGAN, I believe, has made out a list of 
     <lb/>them—(laughter) —but they are no longer 
     <lb/>now local celebrities ; if celebrities at all 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
     
     they must be celebrities for British North 
     <lb/>
     America ; for every one of the speeches 
     <lb/>
     made by them on this subject is watched in 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces, and in point of fact by the 
     <lb/>
     mere appearance of political union, we have 
     <lb/>
     made a mental union among the people of 
     <lb/>
     all these provinces ; and many men now 
     <lb/>
     speak with a dignity and carefulness which 
     <lb/>
     formerly did not characterise them, when 
     <lb/>
     they were watched only by their own narrow 
     <lb/>
     and struggling section, and weighed only 
     <lb/>
     according to a stunted local standard. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Federation, I hope, may 
     <lb/>
     supply to all our public men just ground for 
     <lb/>
     uniting in nobler and more profitable contests 
     <lb/>
     than those which have signalized the past. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We on this side, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     propose for that better future our plan of 
     <lb/>
     union ; and, if you will allow me, I shall 
     <lb/>
     go over what appear to me the principal 
     <lb/>
     motives which exist at present for that 
     <lb/>
     union. My hon. friend the Finance Minister 
     <lb/>
     mentioned the other evening several strong 
     <lb/>
     motives for union—free access to the sea, an 
     <lb/>
     extended market, breaking down of hostile 
     <lb/>
     tariffs, a more diversified field for labor and 
     <lb/>
     capital, our enhanced credit with England, 
     <lb/>
     and our greater effectiveness when united 
     <lb/>
     for assistance in time of danger. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. President of the Council also 
     <lb/>
     enumerated several motives for union in 
     <lb/>
     relation to the commercial advantages which 
     <lb/>
     will flow from it, and other powerful reasons 
     <lb/>
     which may be advanced in favor of it. But the 
     <lb/>
     motives to such a comprehensive change as 
     <lb/>
     we propose, must be mixed motives—partly 
     <lb/>
     commercial, partly military, and partly poli<lb break="no"/>tical ; and I shall go over a few—not strained 
     <lb/>
     or simulated—motives which are entertained 
     <lb/>
     by many people of all these provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     are rather of a social, or, strictly speaking, 
     <lb/>
     political, than of a financial kind. In the 
     <lb/>
     first place, I echo what was stated in the 
     <lb/>
     speech last night of my honorable friend, the 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council—that we cannot 
     <lb/>
     stand still ; we cannot stave off some great 
     <lb/>
     change ; we cannot stand alone, province 
     <lb/>
     apart from province, if we would ; and that 
     <lb/>
     we are in a state of political transition. All, 
     <lb/>
     even honorable gentlemen who are opposed 
     <lb/>
     to this union, admit that we must do some<lb break="no"/>thing, and that that something must not be 
     <lb/>
     a mere temporary expedient. We are com<lb break="no"/>pelled, by warning voices from within and 
     <lb/>
     without, to make a change, and a great 
     <lb/>
     change. We all, with one voice, who are 
     <lb/>
     unionists, declare our conviction that we can<pb n="129" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0129.jpg"/><fw type="num">129</fw>not go on as we have gone ; but you, who 
     <lb/>
     are all anti-unionists, say—" Oh! that is 
     <lb/>
     begging the question ; you have not yet 
     <lb/>
     proved that." Well, Mr. SPEAKER, what 
     <lb/>
     proofs do the gentlemen want ? I presume 
     <lb/>
     there are three influences which determine 
     <lb/>
     any great change in the course of any indi<lb break="no"/>vidual or state. First—his patron, owner, 
     <lb/>
     employer, protector, ally, or friend ; or, in 
     <lb/>
     politics, "Imperial connection." Secondly<lb break="no"/>his partner, comrade, or fellow-laborer, or 
     <lb/>
     near neighbor. And, thirdly,—the man 
     <lb/>
     himself, or the state itself. Now, in our 
     <lb/>
     case, all three causes have concurred to warn 
     <lb/>
     and force us into a new course of conduct. 
     <lb/>
     What are these warnings ? We have had at 
     <lb/>
     least three. The first is from England, and 
     <lb/>
     is a friendly warning. England warned us 
     <lb/>
     by several matters of fact, according to her 
     <lb/>
     custom, rather than verbiage, that the colo<lb break="no"/>nies had entered upon a new era of existence, 
     <lb/>
     a new phase in their career. She has given 
     <lb/>
     us this warning in several different shapes<lb break="no"/>when she gave us " Responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment"—when she adopted Free Trade—when 
     <lb/>
     she repealed the Navigation laws—and when, 
     <lb/>
     three or four years ago, she commenced that 
     <lb/>
     series of official despatches in relation to 
     <lb/>
     militia and defence which she has ever since 
     <lb/>
     poured in on us, in a steady stream, always 
     <lb/>
     bearing the same solemn burthen—"prepare ! 
     <lb/>
     prepare ! prepare !" These warnings gave 
     <lb/>
     us notice that the old order of things between 
     <lb/>
     the colonies and the Mother Country had 
     <lb/>
     ceased, and that a new order must take its 
     <lb/>
     place. (Hear, hear.) About four years 
     <lb/>
     ago, the first despatches began to be address<lb break="no"/>ed to this country, from the Colonial Office, 
     <lb/>
     upon the subject. From that day to this 
     <lb/>
     there has been a steady stream of despatches 
     <lb/>
     in this direction, either upon particular or 
     <lb/>
     general points connected with our defence ; 
     <lb/>
     and I venture to say, that if bound up to<lb break="no"/>gether, the despatches of the lamented Duke 
     <lb/>
     of NEWCASTLE alone would make a respect<lb break="no"/>able volume—all notifying this Government, 
     <lb/>
     by the advices they conveyed, that 
     <lb/>
     the relations—the military apart from 
     <lb/>
     the political and commercial relations 
     <lb/>
     of this province to the Mother Country 
     <lb/>
     had changed ; and we were told in the most 
     <lb/>
     explicit language that could be employed, 
     <lb/>
     that we were no longer to consider ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     in relation to defence, in the same position 
     <lb/>
     we formerly occupied towards the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country. Well, these warnings have been 
     <lb/>
     friendly warnings ; and if we have failed to 
     <lb/>
     do our part in regard to them, we must, at 
     <lb/>
     
          
            <cb/>
           
     all events, say this, that they were addressed 
     <lb/>
     to our Government so continuously and so 
     <lb/>
     strenuously that they freed the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     power of the responsibility for whatever 
     <lb/>
     might follow, because they showed to the 
     <lb/>
     colonies clearly what, in the event of certain 
     <lb/>
     contingencies arising, they had to expect. 
     <lb/>
     We may grumble or not at the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     preparation England imposes upon us, but, 
     <lb/>
     whether we like it or not, we have, at all 
     <lb/>
     events, been told that we have entered upon 
     <lb/>
     a new era in our military relations to the 
     <lb/>
     rest of the Empire. (Hear, hear.) Then, 
     <lb/>
     sir, in the second place, there came what I 
     <lb/>
     may call the other warning from without<lb break="no"/>the American warning. (Hear, hear.) Re<lb break="no"/>publican America gave us her notices in times 
     <lb/>
     past, through her press, and her demagogues 
     <lb/>
     and her statesmen,—but of late days she has 
     <lb/>
     given us much more intelligible notices<lb break="no"/>such as the notice to abrogate the Recipro<lb break="no"/>city Treaty, and to arm the lakes, contrary 
     <lb/>
     to the provisions of the addenda to the treaty 
     <lb/>
     of 1818. She has given us another notice 
     <lb/>
     in imposing a vexatious passport system ; 
     <lb/>
     another in her avowed purpose to construct 
     <lb/>
     a ship canal round the Falls of Niagara, so 
     <lb/>
     as " to pass war vessels from Lake Ontario 
     <lb/>
     to Lake Erie ;" and yet another, the most 
     <lb/>
     striking one of all, has been given to us, 
     <lb/>
     if we will only understand it, by the enor<lb break="no"/>mous expansion of the American army and 
     <lb/>
     navy. I will take leave to read to the 
     <lb/>
     House a few figures which show the amazing, 
     <lb/>
     the unprecedented growth, which has not, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, a parallel in the annals of the past, 
     <lb/>
     of the military power of our neighbors with<lb break="no"/>in the past three or four years. I have the 
     <lb/>
     details here by me, but shall only read the 
     <lb/>
     results, to show the House the emphatic 
     <lb/>
     meaning of this most serious warning. In 
     <lb/>
     January, 1861, the regular army of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, including of course the whole 
     <lb/>
     of the States, did not exceed 15,000 men. 
     <lb/>
     This number was reduced, from desertion 
     <lb/>
     and other causes, by 5,000 men, leaving 
     <lb/>
     10,000 men as the army of the States. In 
     <lb/>
     December, 1862—that is, from January, 
     <lb/>
     1861, to January, 1863, this army of 10,000 
     <lb/>
     was increased to 800,000 soldiers actually in 
     <lb/>
     the field. (Hear, hear.) No doubt there 
     <lb/>
     are exaggerations in some of these figures<lb break="no"/>the rosters were, doubtless, in some cases 
     <lb/>
     filled with fictitious names, in order to procure 
     <lb/>
     the bounties that were offered ; but if we 
     <lb/>
     allow two-thirds as correct, we find that a 
     <lb/>
     people who had an army of 10,000 men in 
     <lb/>
    1861, had in two years increased it to an 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="130" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0130.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">130</fw>
       
     army of 600,000 men. As to their ammu<lb break="no"/>nition and stock of war material at the 
     <lb/>
     opening of the war—that is to say, at the 
     <lb/>
     date of the attack upon Fort Sumpter—we 
     <lb/>
     find that they had of siege and heavy guns 
     <lb/>
     1,952 ; of field artillery, 231 ; of infantry 
     <lb/>
     firearms, 473,000 ; of cavalry firearms, 
     <lb/>
     31,000 ; and of ball and shell, 363,000. At 
     <lb/>
     the end of 1863—the latest period to which 
     <lb/>
     I have statistics upon the subject—the 
     <lb/>
     1,052 heavy guns had become 2,116 ; the 
     <lb/>
     231 field pieces had become 2,965 ; the 
     <lb/>
     473 ,000 infantry arms had become 2,423,000 ; 
     <lb/>
     the 31,000 cavalry arms had become 369,<lb break="no"/>000 , and the 363,000 ball and shell had 
     <lb/>
     become 2,925,000. Now, as to the navy of 
     <lb/>
     the United States, I wish to show that this 
     <lb/>
     wonderful development of war power in the 
     <lb/>
     United States is the second warning we have 
     <lb/>
     had, that we cannot go on as we have gone. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In January, 1861, the ships 
     <lb/>
     of war belonging to the United States were 
     <lb/>
     83 ; in December, 1864, they numbered 
     <lb/>
     671, of which 54 were monitors and iron<lb break="no"/>clads, carrying 4,610 guns, with a tonnage 
     <lb/>
     of 510,000 tons, and manned by a force of 
     <lb/>
     51,000 men. These are frightful figures for 
     <lb/>
     the capacity of destruction they represent, 
     <lb/>
     for the heaps of carnage that they represent, 
     <lb/>
     for the quantity of human blood spilt that 
     <lb/>
     they represent, for the lust of conquest that 
     <lb/>
     they represent, for the evil passions that 
     <lb/>
     they represent, and for the arrest of the 
     <lb/>
     onward progress of civilization that they 
     <lb/>
     represent. But it is not the figures which 
     <lb/>
     give the worst view of the fact—for England 
     <lb/>
     still carries more guns afloat even than our 
     <lb/>
     war-making neighbors. (Cheers) It is the 
     <lb/>
     change which has taken place in the spirit 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the Northern States them<lb break="no"/>selves which is the worst view of the fact. 
     <lb/>
     How far have they travelled since the humane 
     <lb/>
     CHANNING preached the unlawfulness of war 
     <lb/>
     —since the living SUMNER delivered his ad<lb break="no"/>dresses to the Peace Society on the same 
     <lb/>
     theme! I remember an accomplished poet, 
     <lb/>
     one of the most accomplished the New Eng<lb break="no"/>land States have ever produced, took very 
     <lb/>
     strong grounds against the prosecution of 
     <lb/>
     the Mexican war, and published the Bigelow 
     <lb/>
     Papers, so well known in American litera<lb break="no"/>ture, to show the ferocity and criminality of 
     <lb/>
     war. He thus made Mr. BIRD-OF-FREEDOM 
     <lb/>
     SAWIN sing :— <lb/></p>

     (Laughter.) This was slightly audacious 
     <lb/>
     and irreverent in expression, but it was 
     <lb/>
     remarkably popular in New England at 
     <lb/>
     that time. The writer is now one of 
     <lb/>
     the editors of a popular Boston periodical, 
     <lb/>
     and would be one of the last, I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, to induce a Northern soldier to 
     <lb/>
     withdraw his sword from the body of any 
     <lb/>
     unhappy Southerner whom he had, contrary 
     <lb/>
     to the poet's former political ethics, "stuck 
     <lb/>
     thru." (Laughter.) But it is not the revo<lb break="no"/>lution wrought in the minds of men of great 
     <lb/>
     intelligence that is most to be deplored—for 
     <lb/>
     the powerful will of such men may compel 
     <lb/>
     their thoughts back again to a philosophy of 
     <lb/>
     peace ; no, it is the mercenary and military 
     <lb/>
     interests created under Mr. LINCOLN—which 
     <lb/>
     are represented, the former by an estimated 
     <lb/>
     governmental outlay of above $100,000,000 
     <lb/>
     this year, and the other by the 800,000 men 
     <lb/>
     whose blood is thus to be bought and paid 
     <lb/>
     for ; by the armies out of uniform who prey 
     <lb/>
     upon the army ; by the army of contractors 
     <lb/>
     who are to feed and clothe and arm the 
     <lb/>
     million ; by that other army, the army of 
     <lb/>
     tax-collectors, who cover the land, seeing 
     <lb/>
     that no industry escapes unburthened, no 
     <lb/>
     possession unentered, no affection even, un<lb break="no"/>taxed. Tax ! tax ! tax ! is the cry from the 
     <lb/>
     rear ! Blood ! blood ! blood ! is the cry 
     <lb/>
     from the front ! Gold ! gold ! gold ! is the 
     <lb/>
     chuckling undertone which comes up from 
     <lb/>
     the mushroom <hi rendition="simple:italic">millionaires</hi>, well named a 
     <lb/>
     shoddy aristocracy. Nor do I think the army 
     <lb/>
     interest, the contracting interest, and the tax- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     gathering interest, the worst results that 
     <lb/>
     have grown out of this war. There is 
     <lb/>
     another and equally serious interest—the 
     <lb/>
     change that has come over the spirit, mind 
     <lb/>
     and principles of the people, that terrible 
     <lb/>
     change which has made war familiar and 
     <lb/>
     even attractive to them. When the first 
     <lb/>
     battle was fought—when, in the language of 
     <lb/>
     the Duke of WELLINGTON, the first "butch<lb break="no"/>er's bill was sent in"—a shudder of horror 
     <lb/>
     ran through the length and breadth of the 
     <lb/>
     country ; but by and by as the carnage in<lb break="no"/>creased, no newspaper was considered worth 
     <lb/>
     laying on the breakfast table unless it con<lb break="no"/>tained the story of the butchery of thousands 
     <lb/>
     of men. " Only a couple of thousand killed ! 
     <lb/>
     Pooh, pooh, that's nothing !" exclaimed Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SHODDY as he sipped his coffee in his luxu<lb break="no"/>rious apartment ; and nothing short of the 
     <lb/>
     news of ten, fifteen, twenty thousand human 
     <lb/>
     beings struck dead in one day would satisfy 
     <lb/>
     the jaded palate of men craving for excite<lb break="no"/>ment, and such horrible excitement as attend<lb break="no"/><pb n="131" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0131.jpg"/><fw type="num">131</fw>ed the wholesale murder of their fellow 
     <lb/>
     creatures. Have these sights and sounds no 
     <lb/>
     warning addressed to us ? Are we as those 
     <lb/>
     who have eyes and see not ; ears and hear 
     <lb/>
     not ; reason, neither do they understand ? If 
     <lb/>
     we are true to Canada—if we do not desire 
     <lb/>
     to become part and parcel of this people<lb break="no"/>we cannot overlook this the greatest revolu<lb break="no"/>tion of our own times. Let us remember 
     <lb/>
     this, that when the three cries among our 
     <lb/>
     next neighbors are money, taxation, blood, 
     <lb/>
     it is time for us to provide for our own secu<lb break="no"/>rity. I said in this House, during the ses<lb break="no"/>sion of the year 1861, that the first gun 
     <lb/>
     fired at Fort Sumpter had "a message for 
     <lb/>
     us ;" I was unheeded then ; I repeat now 
     <lb/>
     that every one of the 2,700 great guns in the 
     <lb/>
     field, and every one of the 4,600 guns afloat, 
     <lb/>
     whenever it opens its month, repeats the 
     <lb/>
     solemn warning of England—prepare—pre<lb break="no"/>pare—prepare ! (Cheers.) But I may be 
     <lb/>
     told by some moralizing friend, Oh ! but 
     <lb/>
     when they get out of this, they will have had 
     <lb/>
     enough of it, and they will be very glad to 
     <lb/>
     rest on their Iaurels. They ! Who ? The 
     <lb/>
     shoddy aristocracy have enough of it ? The 
     <lb/>
     disbanded army of tax-gathers have enough 
     <lb/>
     it ? The manufacturers of false intelligence 
     <lb/>
     have enough of it ? Who is it possible will 
     <lb/>
     have had enough of it ? The fighting men 
     <lb/>
     themselves ? I dare say they would all like 
     <lb/>
     to have a furlough, but all experiences 
     <lb/>
     teach us, it is not of war soldiers tire but 
     <lb/>
     of peace ; it is not of the sea sailors tire, but 
     <lb/>
     of the land. Jack likes to land, and have a 
     <lb/>
     frolic and spend his money, so does Jack's 
     <lb/>
     brother the fighting landsman—but the one 
     <lb/>
     is soon as much out of his element as the 
     <lb/>
     other, when parted from his comrades ; when 
     <lb/>
     denied the gypsy joys of the camp, when he 
     <lb/>
     no longer feels his sword, he looks up to it 
     <lb/>
     where it hangs, and sighs to take it down 
     <lb/>
     and be " at work" again. He will even quit 
     <lb/>
     his native country, if she continues perverse<lb break="no"/>ly peaceful, and go into foreign service, 
     <lb/>
     rather than remain what he calls " idle." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) This is experience, which I beg 
     <lb/>
     respectfully to cite in opposition to the se<lb break="no"/>ductive, disarming fallacy of my moralizing 
     <lb/>
     friend. (Hear, hear.) The Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral East told us in his speech the other 
     <lb/>
     night, that one of the features of the original 
     <lb/>
     programme of the American Revolutionists 
     <lb/>
     was the acquisition of Canada to the United 
     <lb/>
     States. They pretend to underrate the im<lb break="no"/>portance of this country, now that they are 
     <lb/>
     fully occupied elsewhere ; but I remember 
     <lb/>
     that the late Mr. WEBSTER—who was 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
          
     not a demagogue—at the opening of the 
     <lb/>
     Worcester and Albany Railway, some years 
     <lb/>
     since, expressed the hope that the railways 
     <lb/>
     of the New England States would all point 
     <lb/>
     towards Canada, because their influence and 
     <lb/>
     the demands of commerce would in time 
     <lb/>
     bring Canada into the union and increase 
     <lb/>
     the New England element in that union. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I think, sir, I am justified 
     <lb/>
     in regarding the American conflict as one of 
     <lb/>
     the warnings we have received ; and the 
     <lb/>
     third warning, that things cannot go on in 
     <lb/>
     this country as they are, is a warning voice 
     <lb/>
     from within—a warning voice from our own 
     <lb/>
     experience in the government of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. (Hear, hear.) On these internal 
     <lb/>
     constitutional difficulties existing among our<lb break="no"/>selves, which were so fully exposed last even<lb break="no"/>ing by my hon. friend the President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, I need say little ; they are admitted 
     <lb/>
     to have been real, not imaginary, on all 
     <lb/>
     hands. An illustration was used in another 
     <lb/>
     place in explaining this part of the subject 
     <lb/>
     by the venerable and gallant knight, our 
     <lb/>
     Premier, than which nothing could be more 
     <lb/>
     clear. He observed that when we had had 
     <lb/>
     five administrations within two years, it was 
     <lb/>
     full time to look out for some permanent re<lb break="no"/>medy for such a state of things. True<lb break="no"/>most true —Constitutional Government among 
     <lb/>
     us had touched its lowest point when it ex<lb break="no"/>isted only by the successful search of a mes<lb break="no"/>senger or a page, after a member, willingly 
     <lb/>
     or unwillingy absent from his seat. Any 
     <lb/>
     one might in those days have been the savi<lb break="no"/>our of his country. (Laughter) All he 
     <lb/>
     had to do was, when one of the five success<lb break="no"/>ive governments which arose in two years, 
     <lb/>
     was in danger, to rise in his place, say 
     <lb/>
     "yea !" and <hi rendition="simple:italic">presto</hi> the country was saved. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter) This House was fast losing, 
     <lb/>
     under such a state of things its hold on the 
     <lb/>
     country ; the administrative departments 
     <lb/>
     were becoming disorganized under such fre<lb break="no"/>quent changes of chiefs and policies ; we were 
     <lb/>
     nearly as bad as the army of the Potomac, 
     <lb/>
     before its " permanent remedy" was found in 
     <lb/>
     General GRANT. Well ! we have had our 
     <lb/>
     three warnings. One warning from within 
     <lb/>
     and two from without. I dare say, sir, we 
     <lb/>
     all remember the old class-book story of Mrs. 
     <lb/>
     THRALE'S "Three Warnings ;" how Death 
     <lb/>
     promised not to come after a certain individ<lb break="no"/>ual he had unintentionally intruded on, on 
     <lb/>
     his wedding day. I say, unintentionally-<lb/> for Death is a gentleman, and seldom walks 
     <lb/>
     in, unannounced—(laughter)—but he pro<lb break="no"/>mised not to call upon this particular per<lb break="no"/><pb n="132" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0132.jpg"/><fw type="num">132</fw>son, without giving him three distinct<lb/> 
warnings. Well, the honorable gentleman in<lb/>  
question—I dare say he was honorable, and<lb/>  
a member of some House,—he, like all the<lb/>  
rest of us expected to outlive everybody.<lb/>  
But in process of years he fell lame, then<lb/>  
afterwards, he became deaf, and at last he<lb/>  
grew blind: then Death's hour had come<lb/>  
and in site of some admirable pleading on<lb/>  
behalf of the defendant in the case, he had<lb/>  
his " three warnings" like a Parisian editor,<lb/>  
his case was closed, his form was locked up,<lb/>  
and his impression was struck of the face of<lb/>  
the earth, and Death claimed and had his<lb/>  
own. (Laughter.) Now, sir, we have had<lb/>  
three warnings, and if we do not take heed<lb/>  
of them and prepare for the possible future<lb/>  
condition into which we may be plunged,<lb/>  
woe to us if we are found unprepared when<lb/>  
the hour of destiny strikes! (Cheers.)<lb/>  
We have submitted a plan preparing us<lb/>  
for such a contingency, and the Attorneys<lb/>  
General East and West have analysed its<lb/>  
constitutional character, while the Minister<lb/>  
of Finance and the President of the Council<lb/>  
have treated it in its financial aspects. There<lb/>  
are some objections taken to the plan, I<lb/>  
understand, but I do not believe that any<lb/>  
member will get up in this House, and de<lb break="no"/>clare that he is an anti-unionist, that he is<lb/>  
opposed to all union, and that he considers<lb/>  
union unnecessary and inexpedient. (Hear,<lb/>  
hear.) I do not know that there is one man<lb/>  
out of the one hundred and thirty who com<lb break="no"/>pose this House, in view of the circumstances<lb/>  
in which we are placed, who will declare<lb/>  
that he is opposed to any sort of union with<lb/>  
the Lower Provinces. One may say that he<lb/>  
does not like this or the other clause—that<lb/>  
he does not like this or that feature of the<lb/>  
proposed scheme; but still all admit that<lb/>  
union of some kind would increase our pro<lb break="no"/>tection and be a source of strength. Some<lb/>  
honorable gentlemen, while admitting that we<lb/>  
have entered, within the present decade, on<lb/>  
a period of political transition, have contend<lb break="no"/>ed that we might have bridged the abyss<lb/>  
with that Prussian pontoon, called a Zoll<lb break="no"/>verein. But if any one for a moment will<lb/>  
remember that the trade of the whole front<lb/>  
of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia gravi<lb break="no"/>tates at present along-shore to Portland and<lb/>  
Boston, while the trade of Upper Canada,<lb/>  
west of Kingston, has long gravitated across<lb/>  
the lakes to New York, he will see, I think,<lb/>  
that a mere Zollverein treaty without a<lb/>  
strong political end to serve, and some poli<lb break="no"/>tical power at its back, would be, in our new<lb/>  
            

<cb/>
           
circumstances, merely waste per. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The charge that we ave not gone 
     <lb/>
     far enough—that we have not struck out 
     <lb/>
     boldly for a consolidated union, instead of a 
     <lb/>
     union with reserved local jurisdictions, is 
     <lb/>
     another charge which deserves some notice. 
     <lb/>
     To this I answer that, if we had had, as was 
     <lb/>
     proposed, an Intercolonial Railway twenty 
     <lb/>
     years ago, we might by this time have been, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, and only perhaps, in a condition to 
     <lb/>
     unite into one consolidated Government; 
     <lb/>
     but certain politicians and capitalists having 
     <lb/>
     defeated that project twenty years ago, 
     <lb/>
     special interests took the place great general 
     <lb/>
     interests might by this time have occupied ; 
     <lb/>
     vested rights and local ambitions arose and 
     <lb/>
     were recognized; and all these had to be 
     <lb/>
     admitted as existing in a pretty advanced 
     <lb/>
     stage of development, when our Conferences 
     <lb/>
     were called together. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     lesson to be learned from this squandering 
     <lb/>
     of quarter centuries by British Americans is 
     <lb/>
     this, that if we lose the present propitious 
     <lb/>
     opportunity, we may find it as hard a few 
     <lb/>
     years hence to get an audience, even for any 
     <lb/>
     kind of union (except American union) as 
     <lb/>
     we should have found it to get a hearing 
     <lb/>
     last year for a Legislative union, from the 
     <lb/>
     long period of estrangement and non-inter<lb break="no"/>course which had existed between these 
     <lb/>
     rovinces, and the special interests which 
     <lb/>
     had grown up in the meantime in each of 
     <lb/>
     them. (Cheers.) Another motive to union, 
     <lb/>
     or rather a phase of the last motive spoken 
     <lb/>
     of, is this, that the policy of our neighbors 
     <lb/>
     to the south of us has always been aggressive. 
     <lb/>
     There has always been a desire amongst 
     <lb/>
     them for the acquisition of new territory, 
     <lb/>
     and the inexorable law of democratic exist<lb break="no"/>ence seems to be its absorption. They 
     <lb/>
     coveted Florida, and seized it; they coveted 
     <lb/>
     Louisiana, and purchased it; they coveted 
     <lb/>
     Texas, and stole it; and then they picked 
     <lb/>
     a quarrel with Mexico, which ended by their 
     <lb/>
     getting California. (Hear, hear.) They 
     <lb/>
     sometimes pretend to despise these colonies 
     <lb/>
     as prizes beneath their ambition; but had 
     <lb/>
     we not had the strong arm of England over 
     <lb/>
     us, we should not now have had a separate 
     <lb/>
     existence. (Cheers) The acquisition of 
     <lb/>
     Canada was the first ambition of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Confederacy, and never ceased to be so, 
     <lb/>
     when her troops were a handful and her 
     <lb/>
     navy scarce a squadron. Is it likely to be 
     <lb/>
     stopped now, when she counts her guns 
     <lb/>
     afloat by thousands and her troops by hun<lb break="no"/>dreds of thousands? On this motive, a 
     <lb/>
     very powerful expression of opinion has 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="133" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0133.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">133</fw>
      
     lately appeared in a published letter of the 
     <lb/>
     Archbishop of Halifax, Dr. CONNOLLY. Who 
     <lb/>
     is the Archbishop of Halifax ? In either 
     <lb/>
     of the coast colonies, where he has labored 
     <lb/>
     in his high vocation for nearly a third of a 
     <lb/>
     century, it would be absurd to ask the ques<lb break="no"/>tion ; but in Canada he may not be equally 
     <lb/>
     well known. Some of my honorable friends in 
     <lb/>
     this and the other House, who were his 
     <lb/>
     guests last year, must have felt the impress 
     <lb/>
     of his character as well as the warmth of his 
     <lb/>
     hospitality. (Hear, hear.) Well, he is 
     <lb/>
     known as one of the first men in sagacity as 
     <lb/>
     he is in position, in any of these colonies ; 
     <lb/>
     that he was for many years the intimate 
     <lb/>
     associate of his late distinguished confrere, 
     <lb/>
     Archbishop HUGHES, of New York ; that he 
     <lb/>
     knows the United States as thoroughly as 
     <lb/>
     he does the provinces, and these are his 
     <lb/>
     views on this particular point ; the extract 
     <lb/>
     is somewhat long, but so excellently put that 
     <lb/>
     I am sure the House will be obliged to me 
     <lb/>
     for the whole of it :-<lb/>

<p>Instead of cursing, like the boy in the up<lb break="no"/>turned boat, and holding on until we are fairly 
     <lb/>
     on the brink of the cateract we must at once 
     <lb/>
     begin to pray and strike out for the shore by all 
     <lb/>
     means, before we get too far down on the current. 
     <lb/>
     We must at this most critical moment invoke the 
     <lb/>
     Arbiter of nations for wisdom, and abandoning 
     <lb/>
     in time our perilous position, we must strike out 
     <lb/>
     boldly, and at some risk, for some rock on the 
     <lb/>
     nearest shore—some resting place of greater 
     <lb/>
     security. A cavalry raid or a visit from our 
     <lb/>
     Fenian friends on horseback, through the plains 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and the fertile valleys of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Nova Scotia, may cost more in a single 
     <lb/>
     week than Confederation for the next fifty years ; 
     <lb/>
     and if we are to believe you, where is the security 
     <lb/>
     even at the present moment against such a disas<lb break="no"/>ter ? Without the whole power of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country by land and sea, and the concentration in 
     <lb/>
     a single hand of all the strength of British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica, our condition is seen at a glance. Whenever 
     <lb/>
     the present difficulties will terminate—and who 
     <lb/>
     can tell the moment ?—we will be at the mercy of 
     <lb/>
     our neighbors ; and victorious or otherwise, they 
     <lb/>
     will be eminently a military people, and with 
     <lb/>
     their apparent indifference about annexing this 
     <lb/>
     country, and all the friendly feelings that may be 
     <lb/>
     talked, they will have the power to strike when 
     <lb/>
     they please, and this is precisely the kernel and 
     <lb/>
     the only touch point of the whole question. No 
     <lb/>
     nation ever had the power of conquest that did 
     <lb/>
     not use it, or abuse it, at the very first favorable 
     <lb/>
     opportunity. All that is said of the magnanimity 
     <lb/>
    and forbearance of mighty nations can be explain<lb break="no"/>ed on the principle of sheer inexpediency, as the 
     <lb/>world knows. The whole face of Europe has 
     <lb/>been changed, and the dynasties of many hundred 
     <lb/>years have been swept away within our own time, 
     <lb/>on the principle of might alone—the oldest, the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     strongest, and as some would have it, the most 
     <lb/>
     sacred of all titles. The thirteen original states 
     <lb/>
     of America, with all their professions of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     denial, have been all the time, by money, power 
     <lb/>
     and by war, and by negotiation, extending their 
     <lb/>
     frontier until they more than quadrupled their ter<lb break="no"/>ritory within sixty years ; and believe it who may, 
     <lb/>
     are they now of their own accord to come to a 
     <lb/>
     full stop ? No ; as long as they have the power, 
     <lb/>
     they must go onward : for it is the very nature 
     <lb/>
     of power to grip whatever is within its reach. It 
     <lb/>
     is not their hostile feelings, therefore, but it is 
     <lb/>
     their power, and only their power, I dread ; and 
     <lb/>
     I now state it, as my solemn conviction, that it 
     <lb/>
     becomes the duty of every British subject in these 
     <lb/>
     provinces to control that power, not by the insane 
     <lb/>
     policy of attacking or weakening them, but by 
     <lb/>
     strengthening ourselves—rising, with the whole 
     <lb/>
     power of Britain at our back, to their level ; and 
     <lb/>
     so be prepared for any emergency. There is no 
     <lb/>
     sensible or unprejudiced man in the community 
     <lb/>
     who does not see that vigorous and timely pre<lb break="no"/>paration is the only possible means of saving us 
     <lb/>
    from the horrors of a war such as the world has 
     <lb/>never seen. To be fully prepared is the only 
     <lb/>practical argument that can have weight with a 
     <lb/>powerful enemy, and make him pause beforehand 
     <lb/>and count the cost. And as the sort of prepara<lb break="no"/>tion I speak of is utterly hopeless without the 
     <lb/>union of the provinces, so at a moment when 
     <lb/>public opinion is being formed on this vital point, 
     <lb/>as one deeply concerned, I feel it a duty to declare 
     <lb/>myself unequivocally in favor of Confederation as 
     <lb/>cheaply and as honorably as possible—but Con<lb break="no"/>federation at all hazards an at all reasonable 
     <lb/>sacrifices.

            <p>
     After the most mature consideration, and all 
     <lb/>
     the arguments I have heard on both sides for the 
     <lb/>
     last month, these are my inmost convictions, on 
     <lb/>
     the necessity and merits of a measure which alone, 
     <lb/>
     under Providence, can secure to us social order 
     <lb/>
     and peace, and rational liberty, and all the bles<lb break="no"/>sings we now enjoy under the mildest Government 
     <lb/>
     and the hallowed institutions of the freest and

     These are the words of a statesman—of a 
     <lb/>
     mitred statesman—one of that order of 
     <lb/>
     mighty men, powerful in their generation, 
     <lb/>
     whose statesmanly gifts have been cast in the 
     <lb/>
     strong mould of theological discipline—such 
     <lb/>
     men as were XIMENES and WOLSEY. No 
     <lb/>
     one more deprecates than I do the interfer<lb break="no"/>ence of clergymen in mere party politics, and 
     <lb/>
     I think such is the sentiment also of His 
     <lb/>
     Grace of Halifax ; but when it is an issue of 
     <lb/>
     peace or war, of deliverance or conquest, 
     <lb/>
     who has a better, who so good a right to 
     <lb/>
     speak as the ministers of the gospel of 
     <lb/>
     peace, and justice, and true freedom ? 
     <lb/>
     Observe once more these two closing senten<lb break="no"/>ces, " I feel it a duty" says the illustrious

     <lb/>
     and as honorably obtained as possible, but 
     <lb/>
     Confederation at all hazards and at all 
     <lb/>
     reasonable sacrifices. After  the most mature 
     <lb/>
     consideration, and all the arguments I have 
     <lb/>
     heard on both sides for the last month, these 
     <lb/>
     are my inmost convictions on the necessity 
     <lb/>
     and merits of a measure which alone, 
     <lb/>
     under Providence, can secure to us social 
     <lb/>
     order and peace, and rational liberty, and 
     <lb/>
     all the blessings we now enjoy under 
     <lb/>
     the mildest Government and the hallowed 
     <lb/>
     institutions of the freest and happiest 
     <lb/>
     country in the world." (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The next motive for union to which I 
     <lb/>
     shall refer is, that it will strengthen rather 
     <lb/>
     than weaken the connection with the empire, 
     <lb/>
     so essential to these rising provinces. Those 
     <lb/>
     who may be called, if there are any such, 
     <lb/>
     the anti-unionists, allege, that this scheme 
     <lb/>
     here submitted will bring separation in its 
     <lb/>
     train. How, pray ? By making these coun<lb break="no"/>tries more important, will you make them 
     <lb/>
     less desirable as connections to England ? 
     <lb/>
     By making their trade more valuable, will 
     <lb/>
     you make her more anxious to get rid 
     <lb/>
     of it ? By reducing their Federal tariff will 
     <lb/>
     you lessen their interest for England ? By 
     <lb/>
     making them stronger for each  other's 
     <lb/>
     aid, will you make her less willing to 
     <lb/>
     discharge a lesser than a greater responsi<lb break="no"/>bility ? But if the thing did not answer 
     <lb/>
     itself, England has answered that she 
     <lb/>
     " cordially approves" of our plan of union, 
     <lb/>
     —and she has always been accounted a pretty 
     <lb/>
     good judge of her own Imperial interests. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) She does not consider our 
     <lb/>
     union inimical to those interests. Instead 
     <lb/>
     of looking upon it with a dark and discourag<lb break="no"/>ing frown, she cheers us on by her most 
     <lb/>
     cordial approval and bids us a hearty " God 
     <lb/>
     speed" in the new path we have chosen to 
     <lb/>
     enter. (Hear, hear.) But I put it on 
     <lb/>
     provincial grounds as well. We are not 
     <lb/>
     able to go alone, and if we attempted it we 
     <lb/>
     would almost certainly go to our own 
     <lb/>
     destruction—so that as we cannot go alone, 
     <lb/>
     and as we do not desire union with the 
     <lb/>
     United States, it is the duty of every man to 
     <lb/>
     do all in his power to strengthen the connec<lb break="no"/>tion with Great Britain. And how shall we 
     <lb/>
     do it ? Is it by compelling the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government to negotiate at Charlottetown, 
     <lb/>
     for every man and musket required for our 
     <lb/>
     defence, to negotiate again at Halifax, and 
     <lb/>
     again at Frederickton, and again at St. 
     <lb/>
     John, and again at Quebec ? Is it by hav<lb break="no"/>ing these five separate governments that we 
     <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
       
     are to render the connection desirable and 
     <lb/>
     appreciated, or is it by putting the power of 
     <lb/>
     these colonies into the hands of one General 
     <lb/>
     Government and making the negotiations 
     <lb/>
     between two parties only, thereby simplifying 
     <lb/>
     the whole transaction and expediting what<lb break="no"/>ever is to be done between the two countries. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I will content myself, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, with those principal motives to 
     <lb/>
     union ; first, that we are in the rapids, and 
     <lb/>
     must go on ; next that our neighbors will not, 
     <lb/>
     on their side, let us rest supinely, even if 
     <lb/>
     we could do so from other causes ; and 
     <lb/>
     thirdly, that by making the united colonies 
     <lb/>
     more valuable as an ally to Great Britain, we 
     <lb/>
     shall strengthen rather than weaken the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial connexion. (Cheers) Let me 
     <lb/>
     now, sir, call your attention to the difficulties, 
     <lb/>
     past and present, which this great project 
     <lb/>
     had to encounter, before it reached the 
     <lb/>
     fortunate stage in which we now find it. 
     <lb/>
     When it was first advocated by individuals, 
     <lb/>
     however eminent, of course it had but scanty 
     <lb/>
     chance of success. (Hear, hear.) That was 
     <lb/>
     the first stage ; when, as in 1822 and 1839, 
     <lb/>
     it found favor with Downing street, it excited 
     <lb/>
     the suspicions of the colonists ; when it was 
     <lb/>
     identified with the Quebec and Halifax 
     <lb/>
     railway project, it shared the fate,—it was 
     <lb/>
     sacrificed to the jealousies and dissensions 
     <lb/>
     which destroyed that particular undertaking. 
     <lb/>
     When, as in the case of my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     GALT'S) motion in 1858, and my own motion 
     <lb/>
     in 1860, the subject was mooted in this 
     <lb/>
     House by a private member, the Ministry of 
     <lb/>
     the day could not allow so grave a measure 
     <lb/>
     to succeed in other hands than their own ; 
     <lb/>
     when, as was the case in 1858, the Ministry 
     <lb/>
     committed themselves to it, the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     complained that Parliament had not been 
     <lb/>
     consulted. When Canada proposed to move, 
     <lb/>
     in 1859, Newfoundland alone responded ; 
     <lb/>
     when Nova Scotia moved, in 1860, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick alone agreed to go with her ; at 
     <lb/>
     all events, Canada did not then consent. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Of late years the language of 
     <lb/>
     the Colonial Office, of Mr. LABOUOHERE, of 
     <lb/>
     Sir BULWER LYTTON, and of the lamented 
     <lb/>
     Duke of NEWCASTLE, was substantially : 
     <lb/>
     " Agree among yourselves, gentlemen, and 
     <lb/>
     we will not stand in the way." Ah ! there 
     <lb/>
     was the rub—" Agree among yourselves !" 
     <lb/>
     Easier said than done, with five colonies so 
     <lb/>
     long estranged, and whose former negotia<lb break="no"/>tions had generally ended in bitter contro<lb break="no"/>versies. Up to the last year there was no 
     <lb/>
     conjunction of circumstances favorable to 
     <lb/>
     the bringing about of this union, and 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="135" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0135.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">135</fw>
           
     probably if we suffer this opportunity to be 
     <lb/>
     wasted we shall never see again such a con<lb break="no"/>junction of circumstances as will enable us 
     <lb/>
     to agree, even so far, among ourselves. By a 
     <lb/>
     most fortunate concurrence of circumstances 
     <lb/>
     —by what I presume to call, speaking of 
     <lb/>
     events of this magnitude, a providential 
     <lb/>
     concurrence of circumstances—the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada was so modified last spring 
     <lb/>
     as to enable it to deal fearlessly with this 
     <lb/>
     subject, at the very moment when the coast 
     <lb/>
     colonies, despairing of a Canadian union, 
     <lb/>
     were arranging a conference of their own for 
     <lb/>
     a union of their own. Our Government 
     <lb/>
     embraced among its members from the 
     <lb/>
     western section the leaders of the former 
     <lb/>
     Ministry and former Opposition from that 
     <lb/>
     section. At the time it was formed it 
     <lb/>
     announced to this House that it was its inten<lb break="no"/>tion as part of its policy to seek a conference 
     <lb/>
     with the lower colonies, and endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     bring about a general union. This House 
     <lb/>
     formally gave the Government its confidence 
     <lb/>
     after the announcement of this policy, and 
     <lb/>
     although I have no desire to strain terms, it 
     <lb/>
     does appear to me that this House did com<lb break="no"/>mit itself to the principle of a union of the 
     <lb/>
     colonies if found practicable. That is my 
     <lb/>
     view, sir, of the relations of this House to 
     <lb/>
     the Government after it gave it expressly its 
     <lb/>
     confidence. Other members of the House 
     <lb/>
     take another view of that matter, they do 
     <lb/>
     not think themselves committed even to the 
     <lb/>
     principle, and they certainly are not to the 
     <lb/>
     details of the scheme. (Hear.) After the 
     <lb/>
     Coalition was formed an incident occurred, 
     <lb/>
     which, though not of national importance, 
     <lb/>
     it would be most ungrateful of me to forget. 
     <lb/>
     An intercolonial excursion was proposed and 
     <lb/>
     was rendered practicable through the public 
     <lb/>
     spirit of two gentlemen representing our 
     <lb/>
     great railway, of which so many hard things 
     <lb/>
     have been said that I feel it my duty to say 
     <lb/>
     this good thing—I refer to the Honorable Mr. 
     <lb/>
     FERRIER and Mr. BRYDGES. (Cheers.) Forty 
     <lb/>
     members of this House, twenty-five members 
     <lb/>
     of the other House, and forty gentlemen of 
     <lb/>
     the press and other professions, from Canada, 
     <lb/>
     joined in that excursion. So many Cana<lb break="no"/>dians had never seen so much of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces before, and the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces had never seen so many 
     <lb/>
     Canadians. Our reception was beyond all 
     <lb/>
     description kind and cordial. The general 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of union was everywhere cheered 
     <lb/>
     to the echo, though I am sorry to find that 
     <lb/>
     some of those who cheered then, when it 
     <lb/>
     was but a general sentiment, seem to act very 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     differently now, that it has become a ripened  
     <lb/>
     project, and I fear that they do not intend to 
     <lb/>
     act up to the words they then uttered. They 
     <lb/>
     may, perhaps, intend to do so, but they 
     <lb/>
     have a very odd way of going about it. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) Well, sir, this was in August ; 
     <lb/>
     the Charlottetown Conference was called in 
     <lb/>
     September, the Quebec Conference in Octo<lb break="no"/>ber, and the tour of the maritime delegates 
     <lb/>
     through Canada took place in November. 
     <lb/>
     Four months of the eight which have elapsed 
     <lb/>
     since we promised this House to deal with it 
     <lb/>
     have been almost wholly given up to this 
     <lb/>
     great enterprise. Let me bear my tribute, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, now that I refer to the Con<lb break="no"/>ference, to the gentlemen from the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, who sat so many days in council 
     <lb/>
     with us under this roof. (Cheers) A very 
     <lb/>
     worthy citizen of Montreal, when I went up 
     <lb/>
     a day or two in advance of the Montreal 
     <lb/>
     banquet, asked me, with a curious sort of 
     <lb/>
     emphasis—"What sort of people are they ?" 
     <lb/>
     —meaning the maritime delegates. I 
     <lb/>
     answered him then, as I repeat now, that 
     <lb/>
     they were, as a body, as able and accom<lb break="no"/>plished a body as I thought any new country 
     <lb/>
     in the world could produce,—and that some 
     <lb/>
     among them would compare not unfavorably 
     <lb/>
     in ability and information with some of the 
     <lb/>
     leading commoners of England. As our 
     <lb/>
     Government included a representation both 
     <lb/>
     of the former Opposition, and the former 
     <lb/>
     Ministry, so their delegations were composed 
     <lb/>
     in about equal parts of the Opposition and 
     <lb/>
     Ministerial parties of their several provinces. 
     <lb/>
     A more hard-working set of men ; men more 
     <lb/>
     tenacious of their own rights, yet more con<lb break="no"/>siderate for those of others ; men of readier 
     <lb/>
     resources in debate ; men of gentler manners ; 
     <lb/>
     men more willing to bear and forbear, I never 
     <lb/>
     can hope to see together at one council table 
     <lb/>
     again. (Cheers) But why need I dwell 
     <lb/>
     on this point ? They were seen and heard 
     <lb/>
     in all our principal cities, and I am sure 
     <lb/>
     every Canadian who met them here was 
     <lb/>
    proud of them as fellow-subjects, and would 
     <lb/>be happy to feel that he could soon call 
     <lb/>them fellow-countrymen in fact as well as in 
     <lb/>name. (Cheers.) Sir, by this combination 
     <lb/>of great abilities—by this coalition of leaders 
     <lb/>who never before acted together—by this 
     <lb/>extraordinary armistice of party warfare, 
     <lb/>obtained in every colony at the same moment 
     <lb/>—after all this labor and all this self-sacrifice 
     <lb/>—after all former impediments had been most 
     <lb/>fortunately overcome—the treaty was con<lb break="no"/>cluded and signed by us all—and there it lies 
     <lb/>on your table. The propositions contained in 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="136" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0136.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">136</fw>
          
     it have been objected to, and we were remind<lb break="no"/>ed the other evening by the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Chateauguay, that we are not a treaty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     making power. Well, in reference to that 
     <lb/>
     objection, I believe the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has in certain cases, such as the Reci<lb break="no"/>procity Treaty, conceded to these provinces 
     <lb/>
     the right of coaction ; and in this case there is 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Despatch of 1862 to Lord MUL<lb break="no"/>GRAVE, Governor of Nova Scotia, distinct<lb break="no"/>ly authorizing the public men of the colonies 
     <lb/>
     to confer with each other on the subject of 
     <lb/>
     union, and writing them to submit the re<lb break="no"/>sult of their conferences to the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government. (Hear, hear.) We assembled 
     <lb/>
     under authority of that despatch, and acted 
     <lb/>
     under the sanction it gave. Everything we 
     <lb/>
     did was done in form and with propriety, 
     <lb/>
     and the result of our proceedings is the do<lb break="no"/>cument that has been submitted to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government as well as to this House, 
     <lb/>
     and which we speak of here as a treaty. And 
     <lb/>
     that there may be no doubt about our posi<lb break="no"/>tion in regard to that document we say, ques<lb break="no"/>tion it you may, reject it you may, or accept 
     <lb/>
     it you may, but alter it you may not. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is beyond your power, or our 
     <lb/>
     power, to alter it. There is not a sentence— 
     <lb/>
     ay, or even a word—you can alter without 
     <lb/>
     desiring to throw out the document. Alter 
     <lb/>
     it, and we know at once what you mean—you 
     <lb/>
     thereby declare yourselves anti-unionists. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) On this point, I repeat after 
     <lb/>
     all my hon. friends who have already spoken, 
     <lb/>
     for one party to alter a treaty, is, of course, 
     <lb/>
     to destroy it. Let us be frank with each 
     <lb/>
     other ; you who do not like our work, nor 
     <lb/>
     do you like us who stand by it, clause by 
     <lb/>
     clause, line by line, and letter by letter. 
     <lb/>
     Oh ! but this clause ought to run thus, and 
     <lb/>
     this other clause thus. Does any hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber seriously think that any treaty in the 
     <lb/>
     world between five separate provinces ever 
     <lb/>
     gave full and entire satisfaction on every 
     <lb/>
     point to every party ? Does any hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber seriously expect to have a constitutional 
     <lb/>act framed to his order, or my order, or any 
     <lb/>man's order ? No, sir, I am sure no legisla<lb break="no"/>tor at least since ANACHARSIS CLOOTZ was 
     <lb/>"Attorney General of the Human Race" ever 
     <lb/>expected such ideal perfection. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>It may be said by some hon. gentleman that 
     <lb/>they admit the principle of this measure to 
     <lb/>be good, but that it should be dealt with as 
     <lb/>an ordinary parliamentary subject in the 
     <lb/>usual parliamentary manner. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>this is not an ordinary parliamentary mea<lb break="no"/>sure. We do not legislate upon it—we do 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     not enact it,—that is for a higher authority. 
     <lb/>
     Suppose the Address adopted by this House 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow, is the act of this House final 
     <lb/>
     and conclusive ? No. It is for the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament to act upon it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) It will be that body that will cause 
     <lb/>the several propositions to be moulded into 
     <lb/>a measure which will have the form of law, 
     <lb/>and these resolutions will probably be the 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">ipsissima verba</hi> of the measure they will give 
     <lb/>us and the other provinces. But some hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen opposite say, that if there be de<lb break="no"/>fects in this measure they ought to be re<lb break="no"/>medied now, and that the Government ought 
     <lb/>to be glad to have them pointed out. Yes, 
     <lb/>surely, if this were simply the act of the 
     <lb/>Parliament of Canada ; but it is not to be our 
     <lb/>act alone. It is an Address to the Throne, in 
     <lb/>the terms of which other colonies are to 
     <lb/>agree, and even if we were to make altera<lb break="no"/>tions in it, we cannot bind them to accept 
     <lb/>them. If we were weak and wicked enough 
     <lb/>to alter a solemn agreement with the other 
     <lb/>provinces, the moment their representatives 
     <lb/>had turned their backs and gone home, what 
     <lb/>purpose would it serve except that of defeat<lb break="no"/>ing the whole measure and throwing it as 
     <lb/>well as the country back again into chaos. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I admit, sir, as we have been 
     <lb/>told, that we ought to aim at perfection, but 
     <lb/>who has ever attained it, except perhaps the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Brome. (Laughter.) We, 
     <lb/>however, did strive and aim at the mark, and 
     <lb/>we think we made a tolerably good shot. The 
     <lb/>hon. member for Chateauguay will not be 
     <lb/>satisfied—insatiate archer !—unless we hit 
     <lb/>the bull's eye. (Laughter.) My hon. friend 
     <lb/>is well read in political literature—will he 
     <lb/>mention me one authority, from the first to 
     <lb/>the last, who ever held that human govern<lb break="no"/>ment ever was or could be anything more 
     <lb/>than what a modern sage called "an approxi<lb break="no"/>mation to the right," and an ancient called 
     <lb/>" the possible best." Well, we believe we 
     <lb/>have here given to our countrymen of all the 
     <lb/>provinces the possible best—that we have 
     <lb/>given it to them in the most imperative mo<lb break="no"/>ment—their representatives and ours have 
     <lb/>labored at it, letter and spirit, form and sub<lb break="no"/>stance, until they found this basis of agree<lb break="no"/>ment, which we are all alike confident will 
     <lb/>not now, nor for many a day to come, be 
     <lb/>easily swept away. Before I pass to another 
     <lb/>point, sir, permit me to pay my tribute of 
     <lb/>unfeigned respect to one of our Canadian 
     <lb/>colleagues in this work, who is no longer 
     <lb/>with us ; I mean the present Vice-Chancellor 
     <lb/>of Upper Canada (Hon. Mr. MOWAT), who 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="137" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0137.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">137</fw>
         
     took a constant and honorable share in the 
     <lb/>
     preparation of this project. (Cheers.) Now, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I wish to say a few words in reference 
     <lb/>
     to what I call the social relations which I 
     <lb/>
     think ought to exist and will spring up be<lb break="no"/>tween the people of the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     and ourselves if there is a closer communi<lb break="no"/>cation established between us, and also in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the social fitness of each of the 
     <lb/>
     parties to this proposed union. And first, I 
     <lb/>
     will make a remark to some of the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian gentlemen who are said to be op<lb break="no"/>posed to our project, on French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     grounds only. I will remind them, I hope 
     <lb/>
     not improperly, that every one of the colon<lb break="no"/>ies we now propose to re-unite under one 
     <lb/>
     rule—in which they shall have a potential 
     <lb/>
     voice—were once before united, as New 
     <lb/>
     France. (Cheers.) Newfoundland, the ut<lb break="no"/>termost, was theirs, and one large section of 
     <lb/>
     its coast is still known as "the French shore ;" 
     <lb/>
     Cape Breton was theirs till the final fall of 
     <lb/>
     Louisburgh ; Prince Edward Island was 
     <lb/>
     their Island of St. Jean, and Charlottetown 
     <lb/>
     was their Port Joli ; in the heart of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia was that fair Acadian land, where the 
     <lb/>
     roll of LONGFELLOW'S noble hexameters may 
     <lb/>
     any day be heard in every wave that breaks 
     <lb/>
     upon the base of Cape Blomedon. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     In the northern counties of New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     from the Miramichi to the Matapediac, they 
     <lb/>
     had their forts and farms, their churches and 
     <lb/>
     their festivals, before the English speech had 
     <lb/>
     ever once been heard between those rivers. 
     <lb/>
     Nor is that tenacious Norman and Breton 
     <lb/>
     race extinct in their old haunts and homes. 
     <lb/>
     I have heard one of the members for Cape 
     <lb/>
     Breton speak in high terms of that portion 
     <lb/>
     of his constituency, and I believe I am cor<lb break="no"/>rect in saying that Mr. LE VISCONTE, the 
     <lb/>
     late Finance Minister of Nova Scotia, was, 
     <lb/>
     in the literal sense of the term, an Acadian. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. COZZANS, of New York, who wrote a 
     <lb/>
     very readable little book the other day about 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, describes the French residents 
     <lb/>
     near the basin of Minas, and he says especial<lb break="no"/>ly of the women, " they might have stepped 
     <lb/>
     out of Normandy a hundred years ago !" 
     <lb/>
     In New Brunswick there is more than one 
     <lb/>
     county, especially in the north, where 
     <lb/>
     business, and law, and politics, require a 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of both French and English. A 
     <lb/>
     worthy friend of ours, Hon. Mr. MITCHELL, 
     <lb/>
     of Chatham, who was present at the earlier 
     <lb/>
     meetings of the Conference, owed his first 
     <lb/>
     election for one of these counties, because he 
     <lb/>
     was <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pierre Michel</hi>, and could speak to his 
     <lb/>
      French constituents in their own language. 
     <lb/>
     
          
            <cb/>
          
     I will, with leave of the House, read on this 
     <lb/>
     interesting subject a passage from a very 
     <lb/>
     capital sketch of the French district of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick in 1863, by Lieutenant Governor 
     <lb/>
     GORDON [it is in GALSTON'S <hi rendition="simple:italic">Vacation Tour<lb break="no"/>ist</hi> for 1864], and is exceedingly interesting 
     <lb/>
     throughout :-<lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The French population, which forms so large 
     <lb/>
     a proportion among the inhabitants of the coun 
     <lb/>
     ties of Westmoreland, Kent and Gloucester, ap<lb break="no"/>pears to me as contented as the <hi rendition="simple:italic">habitants</hi> of Vic<lb break="no"/>toria, but hardly equally as well off. There was 
     <lb/>
     an air of comfort and <hi rendition="simple:italic">bien-être</hi> about the large 
     <lb/>
     timber two-storied houses, painted a dark Indian 
     <lb/>
     red, standing among the trees, the numerous good 
     <lb/>
     horses, the well-tilled fields and sleek cattle, which 
     <lb/>
     is wanting on the sea coast. We stopped after a 
     <lb/>
     pleasaut drive, affording us good views of the beau<lb break="no"/>tiful peak of Green River Mountain, at the house 
     <lb/>
     of a Monsieur VIOLET, at the mouth of Grand 
     <lb/>
     River, which was to be our starting point. The 
     <lb/>
     whole aspect of the farm was that of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">métairie</hi> 
     <lb/>
     in Normandy—the outer doors of the house gaud<lb break="no"/>ily painted—the panels of a different color from 
     <lb/>
     the frame—the large, open, uncarpeted room, 
     <lb/>
     with its bare, shining floor—the lasses at the 
     <lb/>
     spinning-wheel—the French costume and appear<lb break="no"/>ance of Madame VIOLET and her sons and daugh<lb break="no"/>ters, all carried me back to the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic. After a short conversation with the VIO<lb break="no"/>LETS, we walked down to the bridge, where two 
     <lb/>
     log-canoes, manned by Frenchmen—three CYRS 
     <lb/>
     and a THIBAUDEAU—were waiting for us, and 
     <lb/>
     pushed off from the shore. A turn in the river 
     <lb/>
     very speedily hid from us the bridge and farm, 
     <lb/>
     our empty carriage, and the friends who had ac<lb break="no"/>companied us from Grand Falls standing on the 
     <lb/>
     bank, in the evening sunshine, waving us their 
     <lb/>
     farewells, and it was not without pleasure that we 
     <lb/>
     felt that the same turn which screened them from 
     <lb/>
     our view separated us for some time to come from 
     <lb/>
     civilized life.

            <p>
     It will be observed Governor GORDON 
     <lb/>
     speaks of four counties in the north 
     <lb/>
    of New Brunswick which still bear a 
     <lb/>marked French character. Well, gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen of French origin, we propose to 
     <lb/>restore these long-lost compatriots to your 
     <lb/>protection : in the Federal Union, which 
     <lb/>will recognize equally both languages, they 
     <lb/>will naturally look to you ; their petitions 
     <lb/>will come to you, and their representatives 
     <lb/>will naturally be found allied with you. 
     <lb/>Suppose those four New Brunswick counties 
     <lb/>are influenced by the French vote, and two 
     <lb/>in Nova Scotia, and one in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>you will, should you need them, have them 
     <lb/>as sure allies to your own compact body, to 
     <lb/>aid your legitimate influence in the Federal 
     <lb/>councils. (Cheers) I shall proceed with 
     <lb/>my outline analysis of the maritime popula<lb break="no"/>tion, in order to establish the congruity and 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">138</fw>
         
     congeniality of our proposed union. In 
     <lb/>
     point of time, the next oldest element in that 
     <lb/>
     population is the Irish settlement of Ferry- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     land, in Newfoundland, undertaken by Lord 
     <lb/>
     BALTIMORE and Lord FALKLAND (Lord 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant of Ireland at the time), immediate<lb break="no"/>ly after the restoration of King CHARLES I., 
     <lb/>
     soon after 1660. Newfoundland still re<lb break="no"/>mains strongly Irish, as is natural, since it 
     <lb/>
     is the next parish to Ireland—(laughter)<lb break="no"/>and I think we saw a very excellent specimen 
     <lb/>
     of its Irish natives at our Conference, in 
     <lb/>
     AMBROSE SHEA. (Cries of hear, hear.) To 
     <lb/>
     me, I confess, it is particularly grateful to 
     <lb/>
     reflect that the only Irish colony, as it may 
     <lb/>
     be called, of our group, is to be included in 
     <lb/>
     the new arrangements. (Hear.) Another main 
     <lb/>
     element in the Lower Province population 
     <lb/>
     is the Highland Scotch. Large tracts of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton 
     <lb/>
     were granted after the Peace of Paris, to 
     <lb/>
     officers and men of FRAZER'S Highlanders 
     <lb/>
     and other Scottish regiments, which had 
     <lb/>
     distinguished themselves during the seven 
     <lb/>
     years' war. If my hon. friend from Glen<lb break="no"/>garry (Mr. D. A. MACDONALD) had been 
     <lb/>
     with us last September at Charlottetown, he 
     <lb/>
     would have met clansmen, whom he would 
     <lb/>
     have been proud to know, and who could 
     <lb/>
     have conversed with him in his own cherish<lb break="no"/>ed Gaelic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD6">MR. D. A. MACDONALD</persName>—They are 
     <lb/>
     all over the world. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. McGEE</persName>—So much the better 
     <lb/>
     for the world. (Cheers.) And I will tell 
     <lb/>
     him what I think is to their honor, that 
     <lb/>
     the Highlanders in all the provinces pre<lb break="no"/>serve faithfully the religion, as well as the 
     <lb/>
     language and traditions, of their fathers. 
     <lb/>
     The Catholic Bishop of Charlottetown is a 
     <lb/>
     McINTYRE ; his Right Rev. brother of Ari<lb break="no"/>chat (Cape Breton) is a McKINNON ; and in 
     <lb/>
     the list of the clergy, I find a constant suc<lb break="no"/>cession of such names as McDONALD, Mc<lb break="no"/>GILLIS, McGILLIVRAY, McLEOD, McKEN<lb break="no"/>ZIE and CAMERON—all "Anglo-Saxons" of 
     <lb/>
     course, and mixed up with them FOURNIERS, 
     <lb/>
     GAUVREAUS, PAQUETS and MARTELLS, 
     <lb/>
     whose origin is easy to discover. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>
     Another of the original elements of that 
     <lb/>
     population remains to be noticed—the U. E. 
     <lb/>
     Loyalists, who founded New Brunswick, just 
     <lb/>
     as surely as they founded Upper Canada, for 
     <lb/>
     whom New Brunswick was made a separate 
     <lb/>
     province in 1794, as Upper Canada was for 
     <lb/>
     their relatives in 1791. Their descendants 
     <lb/>
     still flourish in the land, holding many 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          
     positions of honor, and as a representative 
     <lb/>
     of the class, I shall only mention Judge 
     <lb/>
     WILMOT, who the other day declared in 
     <lb/>
     charging one of his grand juries, that if it 
     <lb/>
     were necessary to carry Confederation in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, so impressed was he with 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of the measure to the very 
     <lb/>
     existence of British laws and British institu<lb break="no"/>tions, he was prepared to quit the bench for 
     <lb/>
     politics. (Cheers.) There are other ele<lb break="no"/>ments also not to be overlooked. The thrifty 
     <lb/>
     Germans of Lunenberg, whose homes are 
     <lb/>
     the neatest upon the land, as their fleet is 
     <lb/>
     the tightest on the sea, and other smaller 
     <lb/>
     subdivisions ; but I shall not prolong this 
     <lb/>
     analysis. I may observe, however, that this 
     <lb/>
     population is almost universally a native 
     <lb/>
     population of three or four or more genera<lb break="no"/>tions. In New Brunswick, at the most there 
     <lb/>
     is about twelve per cent. of an immigrant peo<lb break="no"/>ple ; in Nova Scotia, about eight ; in the two 
     <lb/>
     islands, very much less. In the eye of the 
     <lb/>
     law we admit no disparity between natives 
     <lb/>
     and immigrants in this country ; but it is to 
     <lb/>
     be considered that where men are born in 
     <lb/>
     the presence of the graves of their fathers, 
     <lb/>
     for even a few generations, the influence of 
     <lb/>
     that fact is great in enhancing their attach<lb break="no"/>ment to that soil. I admit, for my part, as 
     <lb/>
     an immigrant, of no divided allegiance to 
     <lb/>
     Canada and her interests ; but it would be 
     <lb/>
     untrue and paltry to deny a divided affection 
     <lb/>
     between the old country and the new. Kept 
     <lb/>
     within just bounds, such an affection is rea<lb break="no"/>sonable, is right and creditable to those who 
     <lb/>
     cherish it. (Hear, hear.) Why I refer to 
     <lb/>
     this broad fact which distinguishes the popu<lb break="no"/>lations of all the four seaward provinces as 
     <lb/>
     much as it does Lower Canada herself, is, to 
     <lb/>
     show the fixity and stability of that popula<lb break="no"/>tion ; to show that they are by birth British 
     <lb/>
     Americans ; that they can nearly all, of 
     <lb/>
     every origin, use that proud phrase when 
     <lb/>
     they look daily from their doors, "this is 
     <lb/>
     my own, my native land." (Cheers.) Let 
     <lb/>
     but that population and ours come together 
     <lb/>
     for a generation or two—such are the ele<lb break="no"/>ments that compose, such the conditions that 
     <lb/>
     surround it—and their mutual descendants 
     <lb/>
     will hear with wonder, when the history of 
     <lb/>
     these present transactions are written, that 
     <lb/>
     this plan of union could ever have been 
     <lb/>
     seriously opposed by statesmen in Canada or 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere. (Cheers) I am told, however, 
     <lb/>
     by one or two members of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     by exclusively-minded Canadians out of it 
     <lb/>
     that they cannot entertain any patriotic feel<lb/><pb n="139" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0139.jpg"/><fw type="num">139</fw>ing about this union with New Brunswick or 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, and that they cannot look with 
     <lb/>
     any interest at those colonies, with which 
     <lb/>
     we have had hitherto so little association. 
     <lb/>
     " What's Hecuba to me, or I to Hecuba?" 
     <lb/>
     Well, I answer to that, know them and my 
     <lb/>
     word for it, you will like them. I have been 
     <lb/>
     on seven or eight journeys there, and have 
     <lb/>
     seen much of the people, and the more I have 
     <lb/>
     seen of them, the more I respected and 
     <lb/>
     esteemed them. (Hear, hear.) I say, then, 
     <lb/>
     to these gentlemen, that if you want to feel 
     <lb/>
     any patriotism on the subject ; if you want to 
     <lb/>
     stir up a common sentiment of affection be<lb break="no"/>tween these people and ourselves, bring us 
     <lb/>
     all into closer relation together, and having 
     <lb/>
     the elements of a vigorous nationality with 
     <lb/>
     us, each will find something to like and res<lb break="no"/>pect in the other ; mutual confidence and 
     <lb/>
     respect will follow, and a feeling of being 
     <lb/>
     engaged in a common cause for the good of 
     <lb/>
     a common nationality will grow up of itself 
     <lb/>
     without being forced by any man's special 
     <lb/>
     advocacy. (Hear, hear.) The thing who 
     <lb/>
     shuts up his heart against his kindred, his 
     <lb/>
     neighbors, and his fellow-subjects, may be a 
     <lb/>
     very pretty fellow at a parish vestry, but do 
     <lb/>
     you call such a forked-radish as that, a man ? 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) Don't so abuse the noblest word 
     <lb/>
     in the language. (Hear, hear.) Sir, there is 
     <lb/>
     one other argument for this union, or rather 
     <lb/>
     an illustration of its mutually advantageous 
     <lb/>
     character, which I draw from the physical 
     <lb/>
     geography and physical resources of the whole 
     <lb/>
     territory which it is proposed to unite ; but 
     <lb/>
     before I draw the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>
     it, I may perhaps refer to a charge that pro<lb break="no"/>bably will be made against me, that I am 
     <lb/>
     making what may appear to be a non-politi<lb break="no"/>cal speech. If it be non-political in the 
     <lb/>
     sense of non-partisan, then I plead guilty to 
     <lb/>
     the charge ; but I think that on some of the 
     <lb/>
     points to which I have alluded the country 
     <lb/>
     is desirous of being informed, and as many 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman have not had time to make a 
     <lb/>
     tour of the country to the east of us, those 
     <lb/>
     who have had the opportunity of doing so 
     <lb/>
     cannot, I think, better subserve the interest 
     <lb/>
     of the community than by giving what 
     <lb/>
     appears to them a fair, just and truthful 
     <lb/>
     sketch of those provinces and their people, 
     <lb/>
     and thus informing those in Canada who 
     <lb/>
     have not had the opportunity of making 
     <lb/>
     observations for themselves on the spot. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It was remarked by the late Sir 
     <lb/>
     JOHN BEVERLEY ROBINSON, in his letter to 
     <lb/>
     Lord JOHN RUSSELL in 1839, that if the Bri<lb break="no"/><cb/>tish Government had attempted to maintain 
     <lb/>
     the ancient boundaries of New France, in 
     <lb/>
     the treaty which acknowledged the United 
     <lb/>
     States, it would have been impossible to do 
     <lb/>
     so. These boundaries extend to Ohio on the 
     <lb/>
     south, and included much of what is now 
     <lb/>
     called by our neighbours " the North-West." 
     <lb/>
     There is great force, I think, in this obser<lb break="no"/>vation. But in relation to what I may call 
     <lb/>
     the ground-plan on which we propose to 
     <lb/>
     erect our constitutional edifice, its natural 
     <lb/>
     oneness is admirable to contemplate. There 
     <lb/>
     is not one port or harbour of all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     now proposing to confederate, which cannot be 
     <lb/>
     reached from any other by all vessels, if not of 
     <lb/>
     too great draught, without ever once leaving 
     <lb/>
     our own waters. From the head of Lake 
     <lb/>
     Superior the same craft may coast uninter<lb break="no"/>ruptedly, always within sight of our own 
     <lb/>
     shores nearly the distance of a voyage to Eng<lb break="no"/>land—to St. John, Newfoundland. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>
     We sometimes complain of our inland navi<lb break="no"/>gation, that we have it free but half the year 
     <lb/>
     round, but what it lacks at one season, it 
     <lb/>
     amply compensates by its vast capacity. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) Last summer, when we visited 
     <lb/>
     Halifax in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Queen Victoria</hi>, which the 
     <lb/>
     good people of that blockade running strong<lb break="no"/>hold mistook for a Confederate cruiser, we 
     <lb/>
     were the better part of a week steaming 
     <lb/>
     away, always in British American waters, 
     <lb/>
     within sight of the bold and beautiful coasts, 
     <lb/>
     which it was our privilege to call our own. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) While we were thus following 
     <lb/>
     our river system to the open sea, I could not 
     <lb/>
     help often recurring to the vast extent of the 
     <lb/>
     whole. If any hon. gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     never made, and who cannot find time to 
     <lb/>
     make, a journey through his own country, 
     <lb/>
     will only go to the library he will find an 
     <lb/>
     excellent substitute for such a voyage in 
     <lb/>
     KEITH JOHNSTON'S <hi rendition="simple:italic">Physical Atlas</hi>, a book 
     <lb/>
     that when one opens its leaves his brain opens 
     <lb/>
     with the book. ( Laughter.) He will find 
     <lb/>
     that our matchless St. Lawrence drains an 
     <lb/>
     area of 298,000 square miles, of which only 
     <lb/>
     94,000 are occupied by the five great lakes 
     <lb/>
     taken together. I shall not attempt to tread 
     <lb/>
     in the path of my two friends who sit next 
     <lb/>
     me (Hon. Messrs. GALT and BROWN) by ex<lb break="no"/>hibiting in any detail the prospects of mutual 
     <lb/>
     commercial advantages opened up by this 
     <lb/>
     union. I have prepared a statement on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, giving certain general results,<lb break="no"/>which I do not present as complete, but only 
     <lb/>
     as proximately correct—and which I now 
     <lb/>
     beg to read to the House :-<lb/>

     But there is one special source of wealth to 
     <lb/>
     be found in the Maritime Provinces, which 
     <lb/>
     was not in any detail exhibited by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friends—I allude to the important article of 
     <lb/>
     coal. I think there can be no doubt that, 
     <lb/>
     in some parts of Canada, we are fast passing 
     <lb/>
     out of the era of wood as fuel, and entering 
     <lb/>
     on that of coal. In my own city every year, 
     <lb/>
    there is great suffering among the poor from 
     <lb/>the enormous price of fuel, and large sums are 
     <lb/>paid away by national societies and benevo<lb break="no"/>lent individuals, to prevent whole families 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     perishing for want of fuel. I believe we 
     <lb/>
     must all conclude with Sir WILLIAM LOGAN 
     <lb/>
     that we have no coal in Canada, and I may 
     <lb/>
     venture to state, on my own authority, an<lb break="no"/>other fact, that we have—a five months' 
     <lb/>
     winter, generally very cold. Now, what are 
     <lb/>
     the coal resources of our maritime friends, to 
     <lb/>
     whose mines Confederation would give us 
     <lb/>
     free and untaxed access forever ? I take 
     <lb/>
     these data from the authority in my hand-<lb/> from the highest authority on the subject— 
     <lb/>
     TAYLOR'S <hi rendition="simple:italic">Coal Fields of the New World</hi> :-<lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Dr. A. GESNER, in a communication to the 
     <lb/>
     Geological Society of London, 1843, states that 
     <lb/>
     the area of coal fields in New Brunswick has 
     <lb/>
     been recently determined to be 7,500 square 
     <lb/>
     miles; 10,000 square miles, including Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     but exclusive of Cape Breton. Since his first 
     <lb/>
     report he has explored the whole of this vast 
     <lb/>
     region, and has found the area covered by that 
     <lb/>
     coal formation to be no less than 8,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles in New Brunswick. He says the most pro<lb break="no"/>ductive coal beds prevail in the interior, while 
     <lb/>
     those of Nova Scotia occur on the shores of her 
     <lb/>
     bays and rivers, where they offer every ad<lb break="no"/>vantage for mining operations. The coal fields 
     <lb/>
     of the two provinces are united at the boundary 
     <lb/>
     line, and belong to the carboniferous period . 
     <lb/>
     The developments of almost every season illus<lb break="no"/>trate more clearly the magnitude of these coal 
     <lb/>
     fields, which extend from Newfoundland by Cape 
     <lb/>
     Breton, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     and across a large portion of New Brunswick into 
     <lb/>
     the state of Maine. Mr. HENWOOD, a geologist 
     <lb/>
     of high standing, observes that the beauty and 
     <lb/>
     extent of these coal treasures it is impossible to 
     <lb/>
     describe. In Nova Scotia, Dr. GESNER'S state<lb break="no"/>ments exhibit an area of coal formation of 2,500 
     <lb/>
     square miles, while Messrs. LOGAN, DAWSON and 
     <lb/>
     BROWN greatly exceed even that area. Sir W. 
     <lb/>
     E. LOGAN demonstrated by a laborious survey the 
     <lb/>
     thickness or depth of the whole group in North<lb break="no"/>ern Nova Scotia to be over 2 3/4 miles, an amount 
     <lb/>
     which far exceeds anything seen in the coal for<lb break="no"/>mation in other parts of North America ; in this 
     <lb/>
    group there are seventy-six coal beds one above 
     <lb/>the other.

            <p>
     I must say, sir, that this is a cheer<lb break="no"/>ing statement of facts, coming to us on 
     <lb/>
     the very highest authority, and I feel warm<lb break="no"/>ing with the subject, even while mak<lb break="no"/>ing the statement. (Laughter.) These ex<lb break="no"/>haustless coal fields will, under this plan<lb break="no"/>which is in fact our Reciprocity Treaty with 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces—become, hereafter, 
     <lb/>
     the great resource of our towns for fuel. I 
     <lb/>
     see the cry is raised below by the anti-un<lb break="no"/>ionists that to proceed with Confederation 
     <lb/>
     would be to entail the loss of the New Eng<lb break="no"/>land market for their coals. I do not quite 
     <lb/>
     see how they make that out, but even an 
     <lb/>

     anti-unionist might see that the population 
     <lb/>
     of Canada is within a fraction of that of all 
     <lb/>
     New England put together, that we consume 
     <lb/>
     in this country as much fuel per annum as 
     <lb/>
     they do in all New England ; and, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     that we offer them a market under the union 
     <lb/>
     equal to that which these theorizers want to 
     <lb/>
     persuade their followers they would lose. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Sir, another cry raised by 
     <lb/>
     the anti-unionists below is, that they would 
     <lb/>
     have to fight for the defence of Canada—a 
     <lb/>
     very specious argument. What, sir, three 
     <lb/>
     millions and one million unite, and the one 
     <lb/>
     million must do the fighting for all. In pro<lb break="no"/>portion to their numbers no doubt these 
     <lb/>
     valiant gentlemen will have to fight, if fight<lb break="no"/>ing is to be done, but not one man or one 
     <lb/>
     shilling more than Canada, <hi rendition="simple:italic">pro rata</hi>, will 
     <lb/>
     they have to fight or spend. On the con<lb break="no"/>trary, the greater community, if she should 
     <lb/>
     not happen to be first attacked, would be ob<lb break="no"/>liged to fight for them, and in doing so, I 
     <lb/>
     do not hesitate to say, on far better authority 
     <lb/>
     than my own, that the man who fights for 
     <lb/>
     the valley and harbour of St. John, or even 
     <lb/>
     for Halifax, fights for Canada. I will sup<lb break="no"/>pose another not impossible case. I will 
     <lb/>
     suppose a hostile American army, on a fish<lb break="no"/>ery or any other war, finding it easier and 
     <lb/>
     cheaper to seize the lower colonies by land 
     <lb/>
     than by sea, by a march from a convenient 
     <lb/>
     rendezvous on Lake Champlain, through 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, into the upper part of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, and so downward to the sea—a 
     <lb/>
     march like SHERMAN'S march from Knox<lb break="no"/>ville to Savannah. While we obstructed 
     <lb/>
     such a march by every means in our power, 
     <lb/>
     from the Richelieu to Rivière du Loup, 
     <lb/>
     whose battles would we be fighting then ? 
     <lb/>
     Why the seaports aimed at, for our common 
     <lb/>
     subjugation. (Hear, hear.) But the truth 
     <lb/>
     is, all these selfish views and arrangements 
     <lb/>
     are remarkably short-sighted, unworthy of 
     <lb/>
     the subject, and unworthy even of those who 
     <lb/>
     use them. In a commercial, in a military, 
     <lb/>
     in every point of view, we are all, rightly 
     <lb/>
     considered , dependant on each other. New<lb break="no"/>foundland dominates the Gulf, and none of 
     <lb/>
     us can afford to be separated from her. 
     <lb/>
     Lord CHATHAM said he would as soon aban<lb break="no"/>don Plymouth as Newfoundland, and he is 
     <lb/>
     said to have understood how to govern men. 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are Siamese 
     <lb/>
     twins, held together by that ligature of land 
     <lb/>
     between Baie Verte and Cumberland Basin, 
     <lb/>
     and the fate of the one must follow the fate 
     <lb/>
     of the other. (Hear, hear.) Prince Ed<lb break="no"/><cb/>ward is only a little bit, broken off by the 
     <lb/>
     Northumberland Strait from those two big<lb break="no"/>ger brethren, and Upper and Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     are essential to each other's prosperity. Our 
     <lb/>
     very physical outline teaches us the lesson of 
     <lb/>
     union, and indicates how many mutual ad<lb break="no"/>vantages we may all derive from the treaty 
     <lb/>
     we have made. Mr. SPEAKER, while we in 
     <lb/>
     Canada have no doubt of the ratification of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Treaty, by this House and 
     <lb/>
     country, I cannot conceal from myself that 
     <lb/>
     our friends in the Lower Provinces are fight<lb break="no"/>ing a battle with narrow views and vested 
     <lb/>
     interests, which are always most bitter in the 
     <lb/>
     smallest communities. There are coasting 
     <lb/>
     trade interests and railway interests at work ; 
     <lb/>
     and there are the strong interests of honest 
     <lb/>
     ignorance and dishonest ingenuity. What 
     <lb/>
     can these men mean, who are no fools ? Do 
     <lb/>
     they, too, fancy they can get a government 
     <lb/>
     made to their own private order ? Do they 
     <lb/>
     think they can go on on the old system ? 
     <lb/>
     Do they mean to give up the country to the 
     <lb/>
     Americans ? Why not hang up at once the 
     <lb/>
     sign, "these provinces for sale—terms cash ! 
     <lb/>
     —' greenbacks ' taken at full value !" I re<lb break="no"/>joice to see the unionists of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces so resolved, so high spirited and so 
     <lb/>
     united—and though their victory will not be 
     <lb/>
     won without work, yet I feel assured it will be 
     <lb/>
     a victory. If the honest and misguided would 
     <lb/>
     but reflect for a moment the risks they run by 
     <lb/>
     defeating, or even delaying this measure, 
     <lb/>
     I am sure they would, even yet, retract. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) If we reject it now, is there 
     <lb/>
     any human probability that we shall ever see 
     <lb/>
     again so propitious a set of circumstances to 
     <lb/>
     bring about the same results? How they 
     <lb/>
     came about we all know. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The strange and fortunate events that have 
     <lb/>
     occurred in Canada; the extraordinary con<lb break="no"/>cessions made by the leaders of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ments below—Dr.TUPPER, the Nova Scotian 
     <lb/>
     Premier, for instance, admitting to his con<lb break="no"/>fidence, and bringing with him here as his 
     <lb/>
     co-representatives, Hon. Messrs. ARCHIBALD 
     <lb/>
     and MCCULLY, two of his most determined 
     <lb/>
     political opponents—can we ever expect, if we 
     <lb/>
     reject this scheme, that the same or similar 
     <lb/>
     things will occur again to favor it? Can we 
     <lb/>
     expect to see the leader of the Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>dian conservative party and the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canadian liberals sitting side by side 
     <lb/>
     again, if this project fails to work out, in a 
     <lb/>
     spirit of mutual compromise and concession, 
     <lb/>
     the problem of our constitutional difficulties ? 
     <lb/>
     No, sir, it is too much to expect. Miracles

     would cease to be miracles if they were events 
     <lb/>
     of every day occurrence ; the very nature of 
     <lb/>
     wonders requires that they should be rare ; 
     <lb/>
     and this is a miraculous and wonderful cir<lb break="no"/>cumstance, that men at the head of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernments in five separate provinces, and men 
     <lb/>
     at the head of the parties opposing them, all 
     <lb/>
     agreed at the same time to sink party differ<lb break="no"/>ences for the good of all, and did not shrink, 
     <lb/>
     at the risk of having their motives misun<lb break="no"/>derstood, from associating together for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of bringing about this result. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) I have asked, sir, what risks do 
     <lb/>
     we run if we reject this measure ? We run 
     <lb/>
     the risk of being swallowed up by the spirit 
     <lb/>
    of universal democracy that prevails in the  
     <lb/>United States. Their usual and favorite 
     <lb/>motto is-<lb/>

     That is the paraphrase of the Monroe doc<lb break="no"/>trine. And the popular voice has favored-<lb/>
     ay, and the greatest statesmen among them 
     <lb/>
     have looked upon it as inevitable—an exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the principles of democraey over this 
     <lb/>
     continent. Now, I suppose a universal de<lb break="no"/>mocracy is no more acceptable to us than a 
     <lb/>
     universal monarchy in Europe, and yet for 
     <lb/>
     three centuries—from CHARLES V. to NA<lb break="no"/>POLEON—our fathers combatted to the death 
     <lb/>
     against the subjection of all Europe to a sin<lb break="no"/>gle system or a single master, and heaped up 
     <lb/>
     a debt which has since burthened the pro<lb break="no"/>ducing classes of the Empire with an enor<lb break="no"/>mous load of taxation, which, perhaps, none 
     <lb/>
     other except the hardy and ever-growing in<lb break="no"/>dustry of those little islands could have borne 
     <lb/>
     up under. (Hear, hear.) The idea of a uni<lb break="no"/>versal democracy in America is no more wel<lb break="no"/>come to the minds of thoughtful men among 
     <lb/>
     us, than was that of a universal monarchy to 
     <lb/>
     the mind of the thoughtful men who fol<lb break="no"/>lowed the standard of the third WILLIAM in 
     <lb/>
     Europe, or who afterwards, under the great 
     <lb/>
     MARLBOROUGH, opposed the armies of the 
     <lb/>
     particular dynasty that sought to place Europe 
     <lb/>
     under a single dominion. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But if we are to have a universal democracy 
     <lb/>
     on this continent, the Lower Provinces—the 
     <lb/>
     smaller fragments—will be "gobbled up" 
     <lb/>
     first, and we will come in afterwards by way 
     <lb/>
     of dessert. (Laughter.) The proposed 
     <lb/>
     Confederation will enable us to bear up 
     <lb/>
     shoulder to shoulder ; to resist the spread of 
     <lb/>
     this universal democracy doctrine ; it will 
     <lb/>
     make it more desirable to maintain on both 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     sides the connection that binds us to the 
     <lb/>
     parent State ; it will raise us from the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of mere dependent colonies to a new 
     <lb/>
     and more important position ; it will give us 
     <lb/>
     a new lease of existence under other and 
     <lb/>
     more favorable conditions ; and resistance 
     <lb/>
     to this project, which is pregnant with so 
     <lb/>
     many advantages to us and to our children, 
     <lb/>
     means simply this, ultimate union with the 
     <lb/>
     United States. (Cheers.) But these are 
     <lb/>
     small matters, wholly unworthy of the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the SMITHS, and ANNANDS, and 
     <lb/>
     PALMERS, who have come forward to forbid 
     <lb/>
     the banns of British American union. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, before I draw to a close the little 
     <lb/>
     remainder of what I have to say—and I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry to have detained the House so long<lb break="no"/>(cries of " No, no")—I beg to offer a few 
     <lb/>
     observations <hi rendition="simple:italic">apropos</hi> of my own position as 
     <lb/>
     an English-speaking member for Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. I venture, in the first place, to ob<lb break="no"/>serve that there seems to be a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     exaggeration on the subject of race, occa<lb break="no"/>sionally introduced, both on the one side and 
     <lb/>
     the other, in this section of the country. I 
     <lb/>
     congratulate my honorable friend the Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General for this section on his freedom 
     <lb/>
     from such prejudices in general, though I 
     <lb/>
     still think in matters of patronage and the 
     <lb/>
     like he always thinks first of his own com<lb break="no"/>patriots—(laughter)—for which neither do I 
     <lb/>blame him. But this theory of race is some<lb break="no"/>times carried to an anti-christian and un<lb break="no"/>philosophical excess. Whose words are 
     <lb/>those—" GOD hath made of one blood all the 
     <lb/>nations that dwell on the face of the earth ?" 
     <lb/>Is not that the true theory of race ? For 
     <lb/>my part, I am not afraid of the French Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian majority in the future Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment doing injustice, except accidentally ; 
     <lb/>not because I am of the same religion as 
     <lb/>themselves ; for origin and language are bar<lb break="no"/>riers stronger to divide men in this world 
     <lb/>than is religion to unite them. Neither do 
     <lb/>I believe that my Protestant compatriots 
     <lb/>need have any such fear. The French Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians have never been an intolerant people ; 
     <lb/>it is not in their temper, unless they had been 
     <lb/>persecuted, perhaps, and then it might have 
     <lb/>been as it has been with other races of all 
     <lb/>religions. Perhaps, on this subject, the 
     <lb/>House will allow me to read a very striking 
     <lb/>illustration of the tolerance of French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian character from a book I hold in my 
     <lb/>hand, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Digest of the Synod Minutes of 
     <lb/>the Presbyterian Church of Canada</hi>, by my 
     <lb/>worthy friend, the Rev. Mr. KEMP, of the

     on page seven of the introduction :-<lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">About the year 1790 the Presbyterians of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal of all denominations, both British and 
     <lb/>
     American, organized themselves into a Church,

     and in the following year secured the services of 
     <lb/>
     the Rev. JOHN  YOUNG. At this time they met in 
     <lb/>
     the Recollet Roman Catholic Church, but in the

     year following they erected the edifice which is

     now known as St. Gabriel Street Church—the

     oldest Protestant Church in the province. In

     (Laughter.) I beg my hon. friends, who may 
     <lb/>
     have different notions of Christian intercourse 
     <lb/>
     at this time of day, just to fancy doings of that 
     <lb/>
     sort. (Hear, hear.) Here, on the one hand,are 
     <lb/>
     the Recollet Fathers giving up one of their 
     <lb/>
     own churches to the disciples of JOHN KNOX 
     <lb/>
     to enable them to worship GOD after their 
     <lb/>
     own manner, and perhaps to have a gird at 
     <lb/>
     Popery in the meantime—(great laughter)-<lb/> and here, on the other hand, are the grateful 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterians presenting to these same Semi<lb break="no"/>nary priests wine and wax tapers in acknow<lb break="no"/>ledgment of the use of their church, for 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterian service. Certainly a more 
     <lb/>
     characteristic instance of true tolerance on 
     <lb/>
     both sides can hardly be found in the history 
     <lb/>
     of any other country. I cite this little 
     <lb/>
     incident to draw from it this practical moral 
     <lb/>
     -that those who are seeking, and, in some 
     <lb/>
     particulars, I believe justly seeking, the set<lb break="no"/>tlement of Protestant education in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada on firmer ground than it now occu<lb break="no"/>pies, might well afford to leave the two great 
     <lb/>
     Seminaries of Montreal and Quebec at peace. 
     <lb/>
     No  two institutions in Christendom ever 
     <lb/>
     more conscientiously fulfilled the ends of 
     <lb/>
     their erection ; and whoever does not know 
     <lb/>
     all, but even a little, of the good services 
     <lb/>
     they have rendered to both the people and 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Lower Canada, to the 
     <lb/>
     civilization and settlement of this country, 
     <lb/>
     has much yet to learn of the history of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear.) To close this topic, 
     <lb/>
     I have no doubt whatever, with a good deal 
     <lb/>
     of moderation and a proper degree of firm<lb break="no"/>ness, all that the Protestant minority in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada can require, by way of secu<lb break="no"/>rity to their educational system, will be 
     <lb/>
     cheerfully granted to them by this House. 
     <lb/>
     I, for one, as a Roman Catholic, will cor<lb break="no"/>dially second and support any such amend<lb break="no"/>ments, properly framed. I will merely add 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     in relation to an observation of my friend 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. BROWN) last night on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of the Catholic Separate Schools of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, that I accepted for my own 
     <lb/>
     part, as a finality, the amended act of 1863. 
     <lb/>
     I did so because it granted all the petitioners 
     <lb/>
     asked, and I think they ought to be satisfied. 
     <lb/>
     I will be no party to the re-opening of the 
     <lb/>
     question ; but I say this, that if there are to 
     <lb/>
     be any special guarantees or grants extended 
     <lb/>
     to the Protestant minority of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     I think the Catholic minority in Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada ought to be placed in precisely the same 
     <lb/>
     position—neither better nor worse. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     car.) At present I shall not add another 
     <lb/>
     word on this subject, as I am not aware of 
     <lb/>
     the particular nature of the amendments 
     <lb/>
     asked for at present, either east or west. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) All who have spoken on this 
     <lb/>
     subject have said a good deal, as was natural, 
     <lb/>
     of the interests at stake in the success or 
     <lb/>
     failure of this plan of Confederation. I 
     <lb/>
     trust the House will permit me to add a few 
     <lb/>
     words as to the principle of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     considered in itself. In the application of 
     <lb/>
     this principle to former constitutions, there 
     <lb/>
     certainly always was one fatal defect, the 
     <lb/>
     weakness of the central authority. Of all 
     <lb/>
     the Federal constitutions I have ever heard 
     <lb/>
     or read of, this was the fatal malady : they 
     <lb/>
     were short-lived, they died of consumption. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) But I am not prepared to say 
     <lb/>
     that because the Tuscan League elected its 
     <lb/>
     chief magistrates for two months and lasted a 
     <lb/>
     century, that therefore the Federal principle 
     <lb/>
     failed. On the contrary, there is something 
     <lb/>
     in the frequent, fond recurrence of mankind 
     <lb/>
     to this principle, among the freest people, in 
     <lb/>
     their best times and worst dangers, which 
     <lb/>
     leads me to believe, that it has a very deep 
     <lb/>
     hold in human nature itself—an excellent 
     <lb/>
     basis for a government to have. But indeed, 
     <lb/>
     sir, the main question is the due distribution 
     <lb/>
     of powers—a question I dare not touch to<lb break="no"/>night, but which I may be prepared to say 
     <lb/>
     something on before the vote is taken. The 
     <lb/>
     principle itself seems to me to be capable of 
     <lb/>
     being so adapted as to promote internal peace 
     <lb/>
     and external security, and to call into action a 
     <lb/>
     genuine, enduring and heroic patriotism. It is 
     <lb/>
     a fruit of this principle that makes the modern 
     <lb/>
     Italian look back with sorrow and pride over 
     <lb/>
     a dreary waste of seven centuries to the 
     <lb/>
     famous field of Legnano ; it was this princi<lb break="no"/>ple kindled the beacons which burn yet on 
     <lb/>
     the rocks of Uri ; it was this principle that 
     <lb/>
     broke the dykes of Holland and overwhelm<lb break="no"/><pb n="145" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0145.jpg"/><fw type="num">145</fw>ed the Spanish with the fate of the Egyptian 
     <lb/>
     oppressor. It is a principle capable of 
     <lb/>
     inspiring a noble ambition and a most 
     <lb/>
     salutary emulation. You have sent your 
     <lb/>
     young men to guard your frontier. You 
     <lb/>
     want a principle to guard your young 
     <lb/>
     men, and thus truly defend your fron<lb break="no"/>tier. For what do good men (who make 
     <lb/>
     the best soldiers) fight ?. For a line of 
     <lb/>
     scripture or chalk line—for a pretext or for 
     <lb/>
     a principle ? What is a better boundary 
     <lb/>
     between nations than a parallel of latitude, 
     <lb/>
     or even a natural obstacle ?—what really 
     <lb/>
     keeps nations intact and apart ?—a princi<lb break="no"/>ple. When I can hear our young men say 
     <lb/>
     as proudly, " our Federation" or " our 
     <lb/>
     Country," or " our Kingdom," as the young 
     <lb/>
     men of other countries do, speaking of their 
     <lb/>
     own, then I shall have less apprehension for 
     <lb/>
     the result of whatever trials the future may 
     <lb/>
     have in store for us. (Cheers.) It has 
     <lb/>
     been said that the Federal Constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the United States has failed. I, sir, have 
     <lb/>
     never said it. The Attorney General West 
     <lb/>
     told you the other night that he did not con<lb break="no"/>sider it a failure ; and I remember that in 
     <lb/>
     1861, when in this House I remarked the 
     <lb/>
     same thing, the only man who then applauded 
     <lb/>
     the statement was the Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West—so that it is pretty plain he did not 
     <lb/>
     simply borrow the argument for use the 
     <lb/>
     the other night, when he was advocating a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union among ourselves. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It may be a failure for us, paradoxi<lb break="no"/>cal this may seem, and yet not a failure 
     <lb/>
     for them. They have had eighty years' use 
     <lb/>
     of it, and having discovered its defects, may 
     <lb/>
     apply a remedy and go on with it eighty 
     <lb/>
     years longer. But we also are lookers on, 
     <lb/>
     who saw its defects as the machine worked, 
     <lb/>
     and who have prepared contrivances by 
     <lb/>
     which it can be improved and kept in more 
     <lb/>
     perfect order when applied to ourselves. 
     <lb/>
     And one of the foremost statesmen in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, distinguished alike in politics and 
     <lb/>
     literature, has declared, as the President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council informed us, that we have com<lb break="no"/>bined the best parts of the British and the 
     <lb/>
     American systems of government, and this 
     <lb/>
     opinion was deliberately formed at a distance, 
     <lb/>
     without prejudice, and expressed without 
     <lb/>
     interested motives of any description. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have, in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     head of the Government, in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     judiciary, in relation to the second chamber 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislature, in relation to the financial 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of the General Government, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     and in relation to the public officials whose 
     <lb/>
     tenure of office is during good behaviour, 
     <lb/>
     instead of at the caprice of a party—in all 
     <lb/>
     these respects we have adopted the British 
     <lb/>
     system ; in other respects we have learned 
     <lb/>
     something from the American system, and I 
     <lb/>
     trust and believe we have made a very 
     <lb/>
     tolerable combination of both (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The principle of Federation is a generous 
     <lb/>
     principle. It is a principle that gives men 
     <lb/>
     local duties to discharge, and invests them 
     <lb/>
     at the same time with general supervision, 
     <lb/>
     that excites a healthy sense of responsibility 
     <lb/>
     and comprehension. It is a principle that 
     <lb/>
     has produced a wise and true spirit of states<lb break="no"/>manship in all countries in which it has 
     <lb/>
     ever been applied. It is a principle emi<lb break="no"/>nently favorable to liberty, because local 
     <lb/>
     affairs are left to be deat with by local 
     <lb/>
     bodies and cannot be interfered with by 
     <lb/>
     those who have no local interest in them, 
     <lb/>
     while matters of a general character are 
     <lb/>
     left exclusively to a general goverment. It 
     <lb/>
     is a principle coincident with every govern<lb break="no"/>ment that ever gave extended and important 
     <lb/>
     services to a country, because all govern<lb break="no"/>ments have been more or less confederations 
     <lb/>
     in their character. Spain was a federation, 
     <lb/>
     for although it had a king reigning over the 
     <lb/>
     whole country, it had its local governments 
     <lb/>
     for the administration of local affairs. The 
     <lb/>
     British Isles are a confederation, and the 
     <lb/>
     old French dukedoms were confederated in 
     <lb/>
     the States General. It is a principle that 
     <lb/>
     runs through all the history of civilization 
     <lb/>
     in one form or another, and exists alike in 
     <lb/>
     monarchies and democracies ; and having 
     <lb/>
     adopted it as the principle of our future 
     <lb/>
     government, there were only the details to 
     <lb/>
     arrange and agree upon. Those details are 
     <lb/>
     before you. It is not in our power to alter 
     <lb/>
     any of them even if the House desires it. 
     <lb/>
     If the House desires it can reject the treaty, 
     <lb/>
     but we cannot, nor can the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     which took part in its negotiation, consent 
     <lb/>
     that it shall be altered in the slightest parti<lb break="no"/>cular. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry to have detained the House so long, 
     <lb/>
     and was not aware till I had been some time 
     <lb/>
     on my legs that my physical force was so 
     <lb/>
     inadequate to the exposition of these few 
     <lb/>
     points which, not specially noticed by my 
     <lb/>
     predecessors in this debate, I undertook to 
     <lb/>
     speak upon. We stand at present in this 
     <lb/>
     position : we are bound in honor, we are 
     <lb/>
     bound in good faith, to four provinces 
     <lb/>
     occupied by our fellow-colonists, to carry out 
     <lb/>

<fw type="num">146</fw>
           
     the measure agreed upon here in the last 
     <lb/>
     week of October. We are bound to carry it to 
     <lb/>
     the foot of the Throne, and ask there from 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty, according to the first resolution 
     <lb/>
     of the Address, that She will be graciously 
     <lb/>
     pleased to direct legislation to be had on this 
     <lb/>
     subject. We go to the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the common arbiter of us all, in our 
     <lb/>
     true Federal metropolis—we go there to ask 
     <lb/>
     for our fundamental Charter. We hope, by 
     <lb/>
     having that Charter that can only be amended 
     <lb/>
     by the authority that made it, that we will 
     <lb/>
     lay the basis of permanency for our future 
     <lb/>
     government. The two great things that all 
     <lb/>
     men aim at in any free government, are 
     <lb/>
     liberty and permanency. We have had 
     <lb/>
     liberty enough—too much perhaps in some 
     <lb/>
     respects—but at all events, liberty to our 
     <lb/>
     heart's content. There is not on the face of 
     <lb/>
     the earth a freer people than the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of these colonies. But it is necessary there 
     <lb/>
     should be respect for the law, a high central 
     <lb/>
     authority, the virtue of civil obedience, 
     <lb/>
     obeying the law for the law's sake ; even 
     <lb/>
     when a man's private conscience may con<lb break="no"/>vince him sufficiently that the law in some 
     <lb/>
     cases may be wrong, he is not to set up his 
     <lb/>
     individual will against the will of the country 
     <lb/>
     expressed through its recognised constitu<lb break="no"/>tional organs. We need in these provinces, 
     <lb/>
     we can bear, a large infusion of authority. 
     <lb/>
     I am not at all afraid this Constitution errs 
     <lb/>
     on the side of too great conservatism. If it 
     <lb/>
     be found too conservative now, the down<lb break="no"/>ward tendency in political ideas which 
     <lb/>
     characterizes this democratic age, is a suffi<lb break="no"/>cient guarantee for amendment. That is the 
     <lb/>
     principle on which this instrument is strong 
     <lb/>
     and worthy of the support of every colonist, 
     <lb/>
     and through which it will secure the warm 
     <lb/>
     approbation of the Imperial authorities. 
     <lb/>
    We have here no traditions and ancient 
     <lb/>venerable institutions ; here, there are no 
     <lb/>aristocratic elements hallowed by time or 
     <lb/>bright deeds ; here, every man is the first 
     <lb/>settler of the land, or removed from the first 
     <lb/>settler one or two generations at the furthest ; 
     <lb/>here, we have no architectural monuments 
     <lb/>calling up old associations ; here, we have 
     <lb/>none of those old popular legends and stories 
     <lb/>which in other countries have exercised a 
     <lb/>powerful share in the government ; here, 
     <lb/>every man is the son of his own works. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) We have none of those 
     <lb/>influences about us which, elsewhere, have 
     <lb/>their effect upon government just as much 
     <lb/>as the invisible atmosphere itself tends to 
     <lb/>influence life, and animal and vegetable 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     existence. This is a new land—a land of 
     <lb/>
     pretension because it is new ; because classes 
     <lb/>
     and systems have not had that time to grow 
     <lb/>
     here naturally. We have no aristocracy 
     <lb/>
     but of virtue and talent, which is the only true 
     <lb/>
     aristocracy, and is the old and true meaning 
     <lb/>
     of the term. (Hear, hear.) There is a class 
     <lb/>
     of men rising in these colonies, superior in 
     <lb/>
     many respects to others with whom they 
     <lb/>
     might be compared. What I should like 
     <lb/>
     to see is—that fair representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian and Acadian aristocracy, should be 
     <lb/>
     sent to the foot of the Throne with that 
     <lb/>
     scheme, to obtain for it the royal sanction<lb break="no"/>a scheme not suggested by others, or imposed 
     <lb/>
     upon us, but one the work of ourselves, the 
     <lb/>
     creation of our own intellect and of our own 
     <lb/>
     free, unbiassed and untrammelled will. I 
     <lb/>
     should like to see our best men go there, 
     <lb/>
     and endeavor to have this measure carried 
     <lb/>
     through the Imperial Parliament—going 
     <lb/>
     into Her Majesty's presence, and by their 
     <lb/>
     manner, if not actually by their speech, 
     <lb/>
     saying—" During Your Majesty's reign we 
     <lb/>
     have had Responsible Government conceded 
     <lb/>
     to us ; we have administered it for nearly a 
     <lb/>
     quarter of a century, during which we have 
     <lb/>
     under it doubled our population and more 
     <lb/>
     than quadrupled our trade. The small colon<lb break="no"/>ies which your ancestors could scarcely see 
     <lb/>
     on the map have grown into great communi<lb break="no"/>ties. A great danger has arisen in our near 
     <lb/>
     neighborhood. Over our homes a cloud 
     <lb/>
     hangs, dark and heavy. We do not know 
     <lb/>
     when it may burst. With our own strength 
     <lb/>
     we are not able to combat against the storm, 
     <lb/>
     what we can do, we will do cheerfully and 
     <lb/>
     loyally. But we want time to grow—we 
     <lb/>
     want more people to fill our country, more 
     <lb/>
     industrious families of men to develope our 
     <lb/>
     resources—we want to increase our prosper<lb break="no"/>ity—we want more extended trade and com<lb break="no"/>merce—we want more land tilled—more men 
     <lb/>
     established through our wastes and wilder<lb break="no"/>nesses. We of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces want to be joined together, that 
     <lb/>
     if danger comes, we can support each other 
     <lb/>
     in the day of trial. We come to Your Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty, who have given us liberty, to give us 
     <lb/>
     unity, that we may preserve and perpetuate 
     <lb/>
     our freedom ; and whatsoever Charter, in the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom of Your Majesty and of Your Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, you give us, we shall loyally obey and 
     <lb/>
     fulfil it as long as it is the pleasure of Your 
     <lb/>
     Majesty and Your Successors to maintain the 
     <lb/>
     connection between Great Britain and these 
     <lb/>
     Colonies." (The hon. gentleman then sat 
     <lb/>
     down amid prolonged cheers.)

     the debate be adjourned till Thursday, 13th

     <lb/>
     Day, after half-past seven. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> said :—MR. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, we on this side had some doubt lest the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition might be placed at a disadvan<lb break="no"/>tage, by allowing the speeches of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to go to the country, without any 
     <lb/>
     comment on them. But if these five speech<lb break="no"/>es, to which we have now listened, contain 
     <lb/>
     all that can be said in favor of this scheme, 
     <lb/>
     we have no fear of letting them go unan<lb break="no"/>swered. I listened to the speech of the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West with great disap<lb break="no"/>pointment. The cause of that disappointment 
     <lb/>
     was simple enough. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     was, in that speech, giving the lie to twenty 
     <lb/>
     years of his political life. He was offering 
     <lb/>
     to the cause he is now advocating one speech 
     <lb/>
     against his continuous voice and vote for 
     <lb/>
     twenty years. He was struggling, all through 
     <lb/>
     that speech, against the consciousness of the 
     <lb/>
     falseness of his political position, and what 
     <lb/>
     every one conceived would be the brightest 
     <lb/>
     effort of his life was the feeblest address he 
     <lb/>
     ever delivered on any important question, 
     <lb/>
     during the twenty years he has sat in this 
     <lb/>
     House. The Attorney General West was 
     <lb/>
     followed by the Attorney General East. I 
     <lb/>
     know not how to characterize the speech of 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman, further than to say that 
     <lb/>
     it was quite characteristic. It was perfectly 
     <lb/>
     characteristic. I doubt whether any attor<lb break="no"/>ney general who ever existed, since attorneys 
     <lb/>
     general were first invented, besides that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, could have delivered, on an 
     <lb/>
     occasion like this, the speech which he de<lb break="no"/>livered. It may be said of that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, as the poet said of a very different 
     <lb/>
     style of man—one who was not an hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in the sense in which we are 
     <lb/>
     now speaking—" None but himself can be his 
     <lb/>
     parallel " (Laughter.) No attorney gen<lb break="no"/>eral, I repeat, since attorneys general were 
     <lb/>
     first invented, could have delivered a speech 
     <lb/>
     at all like that pronounced by the Attorney 
     <lb/>
    General East, in opening his side of the great 
     <lb/>question now submitted to the consideration 
     <lb/>of Parliament. Then followed the singular<lb break="no"/>ly able speech of my hon. friend the Fin<lb break="no"/>ance Minister, which was delivered with all 
     <lb/>that ease and grace that mark all his efforts 
     <lb/>in this House, and with that fluency of dic<lb break="no"/>tion which we all admire, and which I am 
     <lb/>always ready to acknowledge. But I think 
     <lb/>it will also be admitted by that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/><cb/>man's own friends, that his speech was 
     <lb/>
     chiefly remarkable for an adroit avoidance of 
     <lb/>
     the very topics on which he was expected, 
     <lb/>
     or might have been expected, to address the 
     <lb/>
     House, and for a very adroit assumption of 
     <lb/>
     those very things which he might have been 
     <lb/>
     expected to prove. Such, at least, was the 
     <lb/>
     impression which that speech made upon my 
     <lb/>
     mind. Then came the speech—the hercu<lb break="no"/>lean effort—of my hon. friend, the President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council, who, I am sorry to see, is not 
     <lb/>
     in his seat, and with reference, therefore, to 
     <lb/>
     whose speech I shall not make the remarks I 
     <lb/>
     might have done, if he were in his place. I 
     <lb/>
     must say, however, that that speech was a 
     <lb/>
     disappointing speech. (Cries of " oh ! oh !" 
     <lb/>
     and " hear, hear") I did expect, from the 
     <lb/>
     conspicuous part which that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has so long played in the politics of the 
     <lb/>
     country—from the leading part he has had 
     <lb/>
     in all the proceedings which have conduct<lb break="no"/>ed to the project now before the House<lb break="no"/>that we should have had from him, at all 
     <lb/>
     events, some vindication of the steps which 
     <lb/>
     he has seen fit to take—some vindication of 
     <lb/>
     the principles of the proposed union, so con<lb break="no"/>trary to all those principles which he has 
     <lb/>
     hitherto advocated. I say, we did expect 
     <lb/>
     that we would have had something of that 
     <lb/>
     kind from that hon. gentleman. But, in<lb break="no"/>stead of that, his whole speech was mainly 
     <lb/>
     an apology for his abandonment of all those 
     <lb/>
     objects for which he has contended through 
     <lb/>
     his political life, saving only the shadow of 
     <lb/>
     representation by population, to attain which 
     <lb/>
     shadow he seems to have sacrificed all the 
     <lb/>
     material objects, all the real objects, for the 
     <lb/>
     attainment of which the agitation for that 
     <lb/>
     change has proceeded on his part. Then we 
     <lb/>
     have had, to-night, the speech of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, the Minister of Agriculture, a speech 
     <lb/>
    which I admit was one of very great inter<lb break="no"/>est, as a historical essay—one which will 
     <lb/>read very nicely in those reports which we 
     <lb/>are to get in a few days—one which does 
     <lb/>very great credit to his literary research and 
     <lb/>literary taste—but one, which I do venture 
     <lb/>to say, had very little practical bearing on 
     <lb/>the question that is now before us. Well, I 
     <lb/>repeat, I am not afraid that these speeches 
     <lb/>should go to the country unanswered. The 
     <lb/>country will see that these hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>have utterly failed to establish a cause for 
     <lb/>revolution. They are proposing revolution, 
     <lb/>and it was incumbent upon them to estab<lb break="no"/>lish a necessity for revolution. All revolu<lb break="no"/>tions are unjustifiable, except on the ground 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="148" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-09_Page_0148.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">148</fw>
         
     of necessity. These hon. gentlemen were, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, bound to establish this necessity. 
     <lb/>
     The country will see too, that they have 
     <lb/>
     failed to explain, to vindicate and to justify 
     <lb/>
     the disregard of parliamentary law and of 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary usage by which they are at<lb break="no"/>tempting to extort from this House an as<lb break="no"/>sent, not merely to the principle of union-<lb/>which would be perfectly proper—but to all 
     <lb/>
     the clumsy contrivances adopted by that self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     constituted junta which sat in Quebec a few 
     <lb/>
     weeks since, for giving effect to that union, 
     <lb/>
     and to all those huxtering arrangements by 
     <lb/>
     which the representatives of the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were induced to give in their ad<lb break="no"/>hesion, and, so far as they could, the adhes<lb break="no"/>ion of their provinces to this scheme. I say, 
     <lb/>
     they quite failed to explain this and to vindi<lb break="no"/>cate it. The country too will see that these 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen have carefully refrained from 
     <lb/>
     entering into any explanation of the con<lb break="no"/>comitants of this scheme—of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     constitutions of the local governments for 
     <lb/>
     instance, which are, at least, as important 
     <lb/>
     as the Constitution of the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It is quite manifest that a union, 
     <lb/>
     even if generally desirable, might become 
     <lb/>
     undesirable from the bad, or inconvenient, 
     <lb/>
     or expensive arrangements incident to the 
     <lb/>
      adoption of that union. And that really ex<lb break="no"/>plains the position of many hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in this House, who, like myself, are not op<lb break="no"/>posed to the Federal principle, but who find 
     <lb/>
     themselves obliged to go counter apparently 
     <lb/>
     to their own convictions, because they can<lb break="no"/>not accept a union clogged with such condi<lb break="no"/>tions as this union is. (Hear, hear.) Then 
     <lb/>
     it might have been expected that some fur<lb break="no"/>ther, some more distinct, information might 
     <lb/>
     have been given than has been given, on the 
     <lb/>
     all-important question of education, in res<lb break="no"/>pect of which, we have been given to under<lb break="no"/>stand, that some final and permanent system 
     <lb/>
     will be enacted by this Legislature, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the proposed federation of the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     We might also have expected that some in<lb break="no"/>formation would have been vouchsafed to us 
     <lb/>
     in respect  to the Intercolonial Railway-<lb/> which we are in fact voting for, without having 
     <lb/>
     gone into Committee of the Whole. Without 
     <lb/>
     having in point of fact any information with 
     <lb/>
     regard to it whatever, we are voting the cost 
     <lb/>
     of that road, so far as this Legislature can 
     <lb/>
     do so—a road which will certainly cost us 
     <lb/>
     $20,000,000, and, for aught we know, may 
     <lb/>
    cost us $40,000,000. I do think we should  
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     have had some information with respect to 
     <lb/>
     that road from those hon. gentlemen, in order 
     <lb/>
     that the whole case might have gone to the 
     <lb/>
     country. (Hear, hear.) And then, with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the defences of the country-<lb/>what sort of utterances have we had on that 
     <lb/>
     subject ? We were told by the President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council that the subject was engaging the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the Imperial Government, and 
     <lb/>
     he vindicated union, because defence can be 
     <lb/>
     better given by united, than by separate 
     <lb/>
     colonies. And what have we been told to<lb break="no"/>night by the Minister of Agriculture ? That 
     <lb/>
     despatches are received by every second mail 
     <lb/>
     from England telling us that we are entering 
     <lb/>
     on a new era with reference to the question 
     <lb/>
     of defence. What does all this mean ? It 
     <lb/>
     means that, in connection with this union, 
     <lb/>
     we are to have entailed upon us untold ex<lb break="no"/>penditures for the defence of the country. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Ought they not to place this 
     <lb/>
     information, these despatches, before the 
     <lb/>
     House and the country, before any final and 
     <lb/>
     irrevocable action is taken with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the scheme ? These are a few, and but a 
     <lb/>
     few, of the leading topics which constitute 
     <lb/>
     the contents of this scheme of Federation, 
     <lb/>
     in respect to which we had a right to expect 
     <lb/>
     the fullest possible information, but in res<lb break="no"/>pect to which hon. gentlemen have either 
     <lb/>
     maintained a studied reserve, or have spoken, 
     <lb/>
     like the Delphic oracles, in language which  
     <lb/>
     defies interpretation. (Laughter.) I say, 
     <lb/>
     then, let these speeches go to the country, 
     <lb/>
     and if the country, by perusing them, is not 
     <lb/>
     awakened to the dangers which threaten 
     <lb/>
     it from the adoption of this crude, immature, 
     <lb/>
     ill-considered scheme of hon. gentlemen—a 
     <lb/>
     scheme which threatens to plunge the coun<lb break="no"/>try into measureless debt—into difficulties 
     <lb/>
     and confusions utterly unknown to the pres<lb break="no"/>ent constitutional system—imperfect as that 
     <lb/>
     system confessedly is—if the country is not 
     <lb/>
     awakened to a sense of its danger by the 
     <lb/>
     perusal of these speeches—I do not say I 
     <lb/>
     will despair of my country, for I will never 
     <lb/>
     despair of my country—(cheers)—but I 
     <lb/>
     anticipate for my country a period of calami<lb break="no"/>ties, a period of tribulation, such as it has 
     <lb/>
     never heretofore known. (Cheers and coun<lb break="no"/>ter cheers.)  
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The motion for the adjournment of the 
     <lb/>
     debate was agreed to, and the House then 
     <lb/>
     adjourned.
