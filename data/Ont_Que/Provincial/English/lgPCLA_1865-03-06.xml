 <!--<p>
     Much has been said, and I believe felt also, 
     <lb/>
     about the uncertainty of our future. We are 
     <lb/>
     forcibly reminded that the future is not in our 
     <lb/>
     own hands; neither by any prudence or wisdom 
     <lb/>
     of our own, can we determine it. We are 
     <lb/>
     from day to day debating upon our present 
     <lb/>
     position, devising new arrangements for the 
     <lb/>
     future, and discussing the probabilities of their 
     <lb/>
     success or failure. It proclaims our own im<lb break="no"/>potence and our absolute dependence upon a 
     <lb/>
     higher Power. I feel deeply, sir—and I make 
     <lb/>
     no apology for expressing it—that we ought 
     <lb/>
     to look above for Divine guidance; and I 
     <lb/>
     regret that our religious differences should so 
     <lb/>
     operate as to prevent our performing together 
     <lb/>
     a public act of invoking God's blessing on our 
     <lb/>
     proceedings, without which all our deliberations 
     <lb/>
     will fail of success. (Cheers.)

     HON. MR. ALLEYN moved that the debate

            <p>

     MONDAY, <hi rendition="simple:italic">March</hi> 6, 1865. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>— 
     <lb/>Before the debate on the resolutions in your 
     <lb/>hands, Mr. SPEAKER, is continued, I wish 
     <lb/>to say a few words. The Government is 
     <lb/>well aware that the House must naturally feel 
     <lb/>anxious and desirous of information—and 
     <lb/>that no doubt questions will be asked—as 
     <lb/>to the course which the Government will 
     <lb/>pursue in consequence of the news that has 
     <lb/>been received from the Province of New 
     <lb/>Brunswick, with reference to the result of 
     <lb/>the elections in that province. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The Government are quite prepared to state 
     <lb/>their policy on the question before the 
     <lb/>House, in view of that information. Although 
     <lb/>we have no official information as to the 
     <lb/>result of those elections, and would not be 
     <lb/>justified, constitutionally, in making up our 
     <lb/>minds as to that result, until the Legislature 
     <lb/>of New Brunswick has declared itself either 
     <lb/>for or against the Confederation scheme; 
     <lb/>yet we know, as a matter of fact—and we 
     <lb/>cannot shut our eyes to the fact—that the 
     <lb/>Premier and several of his colleagues 
     <lb/>in the Government of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
    

     have been defeated, and that so far 
     <lb/>
     there has been a declaration against 
     <lb/>
     the policy of Federation. Of course, 
     <lb/>
    in a general election, it is not to be supposed 
     <lb/>that the question of Confederation is the 
     <lb/>only one discussed at the polls. Being a 
     <lb/>general election, there was the usual fight 
     <lb/>between the ins and the outs, the Minister<lb break="no"/>ialists and the Opposition; and, of course, a 
     <lb/>lot of other influences were at work, such as 
     <lb/>questions between the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>on the one hand, and lines of railway to 
     <lb/>connect with the United States on the other. 
     <lb/>Still, we should not be treating the House 
     <lb/>with candor if we did not state that we must 
     <lb/>consider the result of those elections as a 
     <lb/>check upon the Confederation project. The 
     <lb/>Canadian Government however, I may say 
     <lb/>at once, do not consider that the result of 
     <lb/>these elections should in any way alter their 
     <lb/>policy or their course upon this question. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) They wish it to be most de<lb break="no"/>cidedly understood, that instead of thinking 
     <lb/>ita reason for altering their course, they 
     <lb/>regard it as an additional reason for prompt 
     <lb/>and vigorous action. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>do not consider that in these events to which 
     <lb/>I have alluded, there is any cause whatever 
     <lb/>for the abandonment of the project, or for 
     <lb/>its postponement. In fact, the only reason 
     <lb/>why we should consider them to be a matter 
     <lb/>of grave import is, that they form the first 
     <lb/>check that the project has received since 
     <lb/>the question was submitted to the people of 
     <lb/>these provinces, at the time of the formation 
     <lb/>of the present Government of Canada. If 
     <lb/>we only look back to June last, and then 
     <lb/>regard the present condition of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, we cannot but feel surprise at the 
     <lb/>advance which has been made. In June 
     <lb/>last we would have been satisfied if we could 
     <lb/>have contemplated that so soon as this the 
     <lb/>question would even have been favorably 
     <lb/>entertained by the governments of the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent provinces. But, within the short 
     <lb/>period which has since elapsed, a conference 
     <lb/>has been held, and the measure framed by 
     <lb/>that conference has received the sanction of 
     <lb/>the governments of all the provinces, and 
     <lb/>each of the governments of the five colonies 
     <lb/>is pledged to submit, not only the question 
     <lb/>of Confederation, but the scheme as pre<lb break="no"/>pared by the Conference, to the legislature 
     <lb/>of each of those provinces. And we have 
     <lb/>gained more than this. Not only has every 
     <lb/>government of every colony been pledged 
     <lb/>to the scheme, and pledged also to use all 
     <lb/>its legitimate influence as a Government to 
     <lb/>
  

            <pb n="649" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0649.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">649</fw>


     obtain the endorsation of the project by their 
     <lb/>
     respective legislatures, but we have also 
     <lb/>
     obtained the sanction and approval of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of the Mother Country. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) That approval has been 
     <lb/>
     conveyed to us by a formal dispatch from 
     <lb/>
     the Colonial Office, and in addition, we have 
     <lb/>
     had, subsequently, the approval of the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Government as expressed in Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's own words in the Speech from the 
     <lb/>
     Throne in opening the Parliament of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. And not only this, but we know 
     <lb/>
     that it has met, or will meet, with the un<lb break="no"/>mistakable approbation and sanction of the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, the press and the people of 
     <lb/>
     England. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, instead 
     <lb/>
     of being at all surprised that the whole 
     <lb/>
     scheme should not have been begun, carried on, 
     <lb/>
     and ended without one check, we should be 
     <lb/>
     well satisfied that we have only received one 
     <lb/>
     such check from the commencement. The 
     <lb/>
     obligations under which the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Government entered at the time that the 
     <lb/>
     Conference was concluded, and those resolu<lb break="no"/>tions finally agreed to, still remain in full 
     <lb/>
     force, and we feel that force. We feel it our 
     <lb/>
     duty to call upon the Legislature of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and to use all the legitimate influence of the 
     <lb/>
     Government to obtain from the Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Canada a favorable opinion upon the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions that have been submitted for its consider<lb break="no"/>ation. (Hear, hear.) And, sir, in view of 
     <lb/>
     the intelligence that has reached us from New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, we think it of more importance 
     <lb/>
     than ever that the scheme should be carried 
     <lb/>
     out as a whole—that it should be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     as a treaty, to be endorsed without one single 
     <lb/>
     amendment or alteration. (Hear, hear.) As 
     <lb/>
     every hon. member of the House who is 
     <lb/>
    desirous of carrying Confederation must see, 
     <lb/>it is now more especially necessary that that 
     <lb/>course should be taken, so that no other 
     <lb/>province shall have the opportunity of say<lb break="no"/>ing, "Why, even the Province of Canada 
     <lb/>itself, through its Legislature, does not ap<lb break="no"/>prove of the scheme as settled by the Con<lb break="no"/>ference." We must give no excuse to any 
     <lb/>one of the colonies to say, "It is open to us 
     <lb/>to deal with the question as we like ; for 
     <lb/>even the Province of Canada, which pressed 
     <lb/>the subject upon us of the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>did not express its approval of the scheme, 
     <lb/>but propounded a new one of its own, which 
     <lb/>it is open to us either to accept or reject." 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Sir, not only do we feel that 
     <lb/>the obligation and expediency of press<lb break="no"/>ing this measure upon the attention of the 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
           

     Legislature remain as before, but we feel it 
     <lb/>
     all the more necessary now to call for prompt 
     <lb/>
     and immediate action. The Government 
     <lb/>
     will, therefore, at once state, that it is our 
     <lb/>
     design to press, by all proper and parlia<lb break="no"/>mentary modes of procedure within our 
     <lb/>
     power, for an early decision of the House 
     <lb/>
     —yes or no—whether they approve of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme or do not. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     One great reason, among others, calling 
     <lb/>
     for promptness, is to provide as much 
     <lb/>
     as possible against the reaction which will 
     <lb/>
     take place in England from the disap<lb break="no"/>pointment that will pervade the minds of 
     <lb/>
     the people of England, if they get the 
     <lb/>
     impression that the project of the union of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces is abandoned. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I believe that if one thing more than an<lb break="no"/>other has raised British America, or the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Canada, its chief component 
     <lb/>
     part, in the estimation of the people and 
     <lb/>
     Government of England, it is that by this 
     <lb/>
     scheme there was offered to the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country a means by which these colonies 
     <lb/>
     should cease to be a source of embarrassment, 
     <lb/>
     and become, in fact, a source of strength. 
     <lb/>
     This feeling pervades the public mind of 
     <lb/>
     England. Every writer and speaker of note 
     <lb/>
     in the United Kingdom, who has treated of 
     <lb/>
     the subject, says a new era of colonial exist<lb break="no"/>ence has been inaugurated, and that if these 
     <lb/>
     colonies, feeble while disunited, were a source 
     <lb/>
     of weakness, they will, by forming this 
     <lb/>
     friendly alliance, become a strong support to 
     <lb/>
     England. The disappointment of the corres<lb break="no"/>ponding reaction would be great in the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, if they got the idea 
     <lb/>
     that the project was to be given up; 
     <lb/>
     and we appeal to honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     not to fall away from the position we have 
     <lb/>
     obtained by the mere submission of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme to the Government and the people 
     <lb/>
     of England, and not to allow Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     whole of British America to lose all its 
     <lb/>
     vantage ground by showing any signs of 
     <lb/>
     weakness, any signs of receding on this 
     <lb/>
     question. (Hear, hear.) Another reason 
     <lb/>
     why this question must be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     promptly and an early decision obtained, is, 
     <lb/>
     that it is more or less intimately connected 
     <lb/>
     with the question of defence, and that is a 
     <lb/>
     question of the most imminent necessity. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) No one can exaggerate the 
     <lb/>
     necessity which exists for the Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     this country considering at once the defences 
     <lb/>
     that are called for in the present position of 
     <lb/>
     affairs on this continent. I need not say 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="650" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0650.jpg"/>

     that this subject has engaged our anxious 
     <lb/>
     attention as a Government. The Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Government has been in continued corres<lb break="no"/>pondence with the Home Government as to the 
     <lb/>
     best means of organizing an efficient de<lb break="no"/>fence against every hostile pressure, from 
     <lb/>
     whatever source it may come. And, as this 
     <lb/>
     House knows, the resolutions themselves 
     <lb/>
     speak of the defence question as one that 
     <lb/>
     must immediately engage the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation. We had hoped that the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme would have assumed 
     <lb/>
     such an aspect that the question could have 
     <lb/>
     been adjudged of as a whole, and that one 
     <lb/>
     organized system of defence could have been 
     <lb/>
     arranged between the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     and the Imperial Government at an early 
     <lb/>
     day. But we cannot disguise, nor can we 
     <lb/>
     close our eyes to the fact that the course of 
     <lb/>
     events in New Brunswick will prevent an 
     <lb/>
     early united action among the provinces on 
     <lb/>
     the subject of defence; and, therefore, that 
     <lb/>
     question comes up as between Canada and 
     <lb/>
     England, and we feel that it cannot be post<lb break="no"/>poned. (Hear, hear.) In fact the subject 
     <lb/>
     has already been postponed quite too long. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is time, high time, that it 
     <lb/>
     was taken up and dealt with in a vigorous 
     <lb/>
     manner. (Hear, hear.) These are two of 
     <lb/>
     the reasons which, the Government feel, 
     <lb/>
     press for a prompt decision of the House 
     <lb/>
     upon the resolutions before it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Then there is a third reason, which is found 
     <lb/>
     in the state of the commercial relations exist<lb break="no"/>ing between Canada and the United States. 
     <lb/>
     The threatened repeal of the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     treaty, the hazard of the United States 
     <lb/>
     doing away with the system of bonding goods 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">in transitu</hi>, and the unsatisfactory position 
     <lb/>
     generally of our commercial relations with 
     <lb/>
     the neighboring country—all this calls for 
     <lb/>
     immediate action. And the fact of the union 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces being postponed, and of 
     <lb/>
     the construction, therefore, of the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway being put off indefinitely, ren<lb break="no"/>ders this all the more imperative. It is, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, the intention of the Government — 
     <lb/>
     and they seek the support of this House and 
     <lb/>
     of the country to the policy which I now 
     <lb/>
     announce—first, to bring this debate to an 
     <lb/>
     end with all convenient speed, with a view 
     <lb/>
     to having a declaration of the House upon 
     <lb/>
     the question of Confederation. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, to this end, will press for a vote by 
     <lb/>
     every means which they can properly use. 
     <lb/>
     Then, secondly, as soon as that is obtained, 
     <lb/>
     it is the intention of the Government to ask 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>


     the Legislature for a vote of credit, and pro<lb break="no"/>rogue Parliament at the earliest possible 
     <lb/>
     date. (Hear, hear.) It is their intention 
     <lb/>
     to provide that all the unfinished business of 
     <lb/>
     the present session shall be so arranged, that 
     <lb/>
     it can be proceeded with next session, from 
     <lb/>
     the point where it is dropped at the close of 
     <lb/>
     this session. Upon the prorogation of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, the Government will send a mission 
     <lb/>
     to England at once, for the purpose of dis<lb break="no"/>cussing and arranging these important points 
     <lb/>
     to which I have alluded—the question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, under its present aspect—the 
     <lb/>
     question of defence—and) all matters bearing 
     <lb/>
     upon our commercial relations with the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring country; with instructions to 
     <lb/>
     press their work forward with the least pos<lb break="no"/>sible delay, with the view of enabling the 
     <lb/>
     Government to submit the result of the mis<lb break="no"/>sion—which we hope will be satisfactory—to 
     <lb/>
     this House at an early summer session. 
     <lb/>
     (Loud cheers.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName> said—The 
     <lb/>
     manner and spirit in which the Government 
     <lb/>
     have made the announcement of their de<lb break="no"/>cision is so far satisfactory. They have, 
     <lb/>
     however, adopted a new policy and announced 
     <lb/>
     a change of tactics, and one which this 
     <lb/>
     House is to be called upon to enforce. They 
     <lb/>
     have departed widely from the policy that 
     <lb/>
     they decided upon not long since. I beg 
     <lb/>
     leave to call the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>
     the words used by the Hon. Premier of the 
     <lb/>
     Government himself, at the opening of the 
     <lb/>
    session. He says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>They had assumed the charge of affairs with 
     <lb/>an understanding that they would have a right to 
     <lb/>appeal to the country; and while they were con<lb break="no"/>sulting about it, they received an intimation from 
     <lb/>the real chief of the Opposition, through one of 
     <lb/>their own friends, to the effect that he was 
     <lb/>desirous of making overtures to them, with the 
     <lb/>view of seeking to accommodate the difficulties. 
     <lb/>The hon. gentleman and some of his friends then 
     <lb/>came into contact with the leaders of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and it was agreed between them to try to 
     <lb/>devise a scheme which would put an end to the 
     <lb/>misunderstandings, and at the same time secure 
     <lb/>for Canada and the other provinces a position 
     <lb/>which would ensure their future safety, and pro<lb break="no"/>cure for them the respect and confidence of other 
     <lb/>nations. They arranged a large scheme and a 
     <lb/>smaller one. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     And now, Mr. SPEAKER, I wish to call the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House to this point. " If 
     <lb/>
     the larger failed, then they were to fall back 
     <lb/>
     upon the minor, which provided for a Feder<lb break="no"/>ation of the two sections of the province." 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="651" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0651.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">651</fw>
        

     The larger scheme, Mr. SPEAKER, is 
     <lb/>
     evidently a failure. (Hear, hear.) And I 
     <lb/>
     will tell you why I think it a failure. This 
     <lb/>
     scheme was to be agreed to by all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and the different Governments were 
     <lb/>
     to bring it down for the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     their several Houses of Parliament. The 
     <lb/>
     leaders of the Opposition in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, as well as the  Government of that 
     <lb/>
     province agreed to a treaty, as it is called, 
     <lb/>
     and went back to submit that treaty to their 
     <lb/>
     Legislature for approval. But being defeated 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick, it is not possible for the 
     <lb/>
     arrangement to be carried out. What reason 
     <lb/>
     has the Government for believing that those 
     <lb/>
     who have been just elected in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick as opponents of the scheme will allow 
     <lb/>
     it to be brought down for the consideration 
     <lb/>
     of their  Legislature ? How can it be expected 
     <lb/>
     that a free people will agree to a scheme, 
     <lb/>
     from the terms of which they entirely dis<lb break="no"/>sent ? It seems to be the idea of honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite, that if this Legislature 
     <lb/>
     adheres to the scheme, it will be forced upon 
     <lb/>
     the unwilling people of New Brunswick— 
     <lb/>
     that some process will be found by which 
     <lb/>
     the Government of that province will be 
     <lb/>
     induced to submit it to their Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     They seem to imagine that the rejection of 
     <lb/>
     the TILLEY Government, and, consequently, 
     <lb/>
     of their Confederation scheme, by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, is a matter that can be traced only to 
     <lb/>
     the annexation proclivities of a large section 
     <lb/>
     of the people of New Brunswick. If that is 
     <lb/>
     so, we ought immediately to appoint a day 
     <lb/>
     of general thanksgiving, in this appropriate 
     <lb/>
     time of Lent, for the blessing of being 
     <lb/>
     relieved from any danger of union with such 
     <lb/>
     a people. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) It 
     <lb/>
     would be one of the greatest misfortunes 
     <lb/>
     that could happen our province to be con<lb break="no"/>nected with those annexationists. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. HOLTON—But it is not true 
     <lb/>
     that the annexation feeling was the cause of 
     <lb/>
     the defeat.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. J. S. MACDONALD—I do not say 
     <lb/>
     it is so, but I am referring to what members of 
     <lb/>
     the Government have said  about this defeat 
     <lb/>
     being caused by the disloyal and annexation 
     <lb/>
     proclivities of the people of New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>    <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—Who <lb/>did ?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON J. S. MACDONALD—Well, I find 
     <lb/>
     their organ of this morning attributing it to 
     <lb/>
     that cause. And what did the Minister of 
     <lb/>
      Agriculture (HON. Mr. McGEE  say on Fri<lb break="no"/>day night, on the reception of the news ? He 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
  

     said there were many in that portion of the 
     <lb/>
     province who were influenced by a desire for 
     <lb/>
     connection with the United States, and that 
     <lb/>
     there were capitalists from Boston and from 
     <lb/>
     Maine whose interests lay in having New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick more closely coupled with the 
     <lb/>
     destiny of the United States. If these are 
     <lb/>
     the feelings that induced the gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     have been elected to repudiate the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings of the Convention, then, I say again. 
     <lb/>
     they are a people with whose views we of 
     <lb/>
     Canada should have no sympathy. If the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the Treasury benches suppose 
     <lb/>
     that by passing these resolutions they will 
     <lb/>
     compel the gentlemen, who have been 
     <lb/>
     returned to that Parliament on the express 
     <lb/>
     condition that they shall oppose the treaty 
     <lb/>
     or Convention scheme, to turn round and 
     <lb/>
     support it, then what shall we say of such 
     <lb/>
     men ? What shall we say of men who, 
     <lb/>
     after having obtained the  suffrages of the 
     <lb/>
     people as opponents of the scheme, shall turn 
     <lb/>
     round immediately after they have got into 
     <lb/>
     oflice, and in effect perjure themselves ? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have, unfortuuately, 
     <lb/>
     enough of that class of legislators in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     without linking our destinies with like 
     <lb/>
     persons from New Brunswick. If that is 
     <lb/>
     the character of the people to whom we are 
     <lb/>
     to be united, then all I can say is, that they 
     <lb/>
     are not a desirable class to have added to 
     <lb/>
     Canada. If it is contemplated that they are 
     <lb/>
     going to compel those gentlemen to vote 
     <lb/>
     approval of the scheme, who have been 
     <lb/>
     elected specially to oppose it, it would be 
     <lb/>
     very interesting to know by what process it 
     <lb/>
     is to be done. Are they to be bribed into 
     <lb/>
     acquiescence, or forced into  submission ? If 
     <lb/>
     the latter, then we must presume that they 
     <lb/>
     are not of the race of British freemen who, 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere, would resent with indignation— 
     <lb/>
     ay, rebel—before yielding up their indepen<lb break="no"/>dence ; and in that view, they are again 
     <lb/>
     unworthy of association with us. There is 
     <lb/>
     no doubt that the gentlemen who have been 
     <lb/>
     elected in New Brunswick have deliberately 
     <lb/>
     considered their position, and whether it is 
     <lb/>
     attempted to bribe them or coerce them, they 
     <lb/>
     will manfully resent it. I do not believe it 
     <lb/>
     is desirable to have a Confederation 
     <lb/>
     adopted by either course. What are we to 
     <lb/>
     gain by compelling such a community to 
     <lb/>
     come in with us ? Will they not, for all 
     <lb/>
     time to come, cast upon us the reflection 
     <lb/>
     that they became part and parcel of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy without their consent ? Is it 
     <lb/>
     desirable to have to do with neighboring 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="652" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0652.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">652</fw>
  

     colonists, who have been either forced or 
     <lb/>
     bribed to accept what is repugnant to them ? 
     <lb/>
     Will they not always be a source of discord 
     <lb/>
     by endeavoring to make the scheme work 
     <lb/>
     badly ? (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     we have before us an instance of the danger 
     <lb/>
     of men undertaking to make treaties without 
     <lb/>
     authority. This is the kind of penalty 
     <lb/>
     which they pay, and I think we have an 
     <lb/>
     instalment of the punishment that is justly 
     <lb/>
     due to them, and which they will receive. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, we find that in New Brunswick, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and Prince Edward Island, a union 
     <lb/>
     took place between the Government and the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition for the purpose of arranging a 
     <lb/>
     plan by which those provinces should be 
     <lb/>
     joined together. They had the authority of 
     <lb/>
     their respective governments and legislatures 
     <lb/>
     before entering into that Conference. They 
     <lb/>
     met together by deliberate pre-arrangement, 
     <lb/>
     with full consent, unlike the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen opposite precipitated them<lb break="no"/>selves into a union fever, growing out of a 
     <lb/>
     political contingency. When the delegates 
     <lb/>
     went to Charlottetown, from their respective 
     <lb/>
     provinces, to treat of matters of great impor<lb break="no"/>tance to the people of those provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     considered it to be a desirable object to obtain 
     <lb/>
     the union of the Maritime Provinces, they 
     <lb/>
     were interrupted in their deliberations by the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Canadian Government— 
     <lb/>
     Greater inducements were then offered them, 
     <lb/>
     and they were filled with higher hopes and 
     <lb/>
     expectations of the good things to be derived 
     <lb/>
     from the Confederation ol all the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant-governorships, chief-justiceships, 
     <lb/>
     and lite-memberships of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council were all held out in the prospective 
     <lb/>
     by the Canadian Ministers. By these means 
     <lb/>
     they inveigled these men from the object for 
     <lb/>
     which they met, and undermined the purpose 
     <lb/>
     they were assembled to promote. The Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Ministers said :—"Never mind your 
     <lb/>
     union of these provinces. Come away from 
     <lb/>
     Charlottetown with us, and we will show you 
     <lb/>
     plans by which your ambition may be better 
     <lb/>
     gratified, although you may thereby betray 
     <lb/>
     the trust of the people who sent you here. 
     <lb/>
     They may not be satisfied, but never mind 
     <lb/>
     them—they can be managed in some way 
     <lb/>
     afterwards. We will show you the way." 
     <lb/>
     This, in effect, was the language used towards 
     <lb/>
     the delegates. They took the bait offered 
     <lb/>
     them, and the next thing we heard of 
     <lb/>
     was the adjournment of the Convention 
     <lb/>
     to Halifax, where the delegates enjoyed the 
     <lb/>
     " feast of reason and the flow of soul" for a 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
       

     week. They then sped off to St. John, 
     <lb/>
     where convivialities were renewed, and finally 
     <lb/>
     they all agreed to come to Quebec, and we 
     <lb/>
     all recollect the subsequent feastings in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto and 
     <lb/>
     Hamilton. I will not allude to the meeting 
     <lb/>
     that took place here, because it is well known 
     <lb/>
     what the result of the Conference was; but I 
     <lb/>
     will speak of the sequel to these proceedings 
     <lb/>
     —the events that subsequently happened in 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces. Hon. Mr. TILLEY knew 
     <lb/>
     he could have submitted the scheme of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference to the people of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick—that he could have summoned 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament of that province and ascer<lb break="no"/>tained what its wishes were—as early as the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government could. But he did 
     <lb/>
     nothing of the kind. He knew he had vio<lb break="no"/>lated the trust reposed in him, and that he 
     <lb/>
     had given reason for a withdrawal of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple's confidence; but he thought that by 
     <lb/>
     bringing on an election in the country, he 
     <lb/>
     could gain his own ends by the unsparing use 
     <lb/>
     of all the influence a government can employ 
     <lb/>
     on such occasions, and by employing all the 
     <lb/>
     arts of cajolery for the purpose of deceiving 
     <lb/>
     the people and winning them over to his own 
     <lb/>
     selfish purposes. Well, what is the result ? 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. TILLEY and his followers are routed 
     <lb/>
     horse and foot by the honest people of the 
     <lb/>
     province, scouted by those whose interests 
     <lb/>
     he had betrayed and whose behests he had 
     <lb/>
     neglected; and I think his fate ought to be a 
     <lb/>
     warning to those who adopted this scheme 
     <lb/>
     without authority, and who ask the House to 
     <lb/>
     ratify it <hi rendition="simple:italic">en bloc</hi>, without having sought or 
     <lb/>
     seeking to obtain the sanction of the people.

     (Hear, hear.) I come now, sir, to a matter 
     <lb/>
     personal perhaps more to myself than to any 
     <lb/>
     one else. I would ask the House who was it 
     <lb/>
     that assailed the Government of Canada more 
     <lb/>
     by his speeches and letters than this same 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. TILLEY? Who was it that charged 
     <lb/>
     the Government of this country with a breach 
     <lb/>
     of faith towards the Lower Provinces in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the construction of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway; and whose statement was it that 
     <lb/>
     was reëchoed on the floor of this House over 
     <lb/>
     and over again, that Canada had lowered its 
     <lb/>
     character and dignity by failing to go on with 
     <lb/>
     that undertaking? Was it not the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     TILLEY who made these false accusations, 
     <lb/>
     and were they not, on his authority, repeated 
     <lb/>
     here by an honorable gentleman now in the 
     <lb/>
     Government, at the head of the Bureau of 
     <lb/>
     Agriculture (Hon. Mr. MCGEE)? Recollect<lb break="no"/>ing these things, sir, I have a pleasure—a 
     <lb/>
     mischievous pleasure—(hear, hear, and laugh<lb break="no"/>

ter) —I have a mischievous pleasure, I say, in 
     <lb/>
     knowing that the Hon. Mr. TILLEY has been 
     <lb/>
     defeated. (Ironical cheers.) I repeat that I 
     <lb/>
     have experienced to-day a considerable degree 
     <lb/>
     of happiness in announcing that the man who, 
     <lb/>
     at the head of the Government of New Brun<lb break="no"/>wick, betrayed the trust of the people, who 
     <lb/>
     failed to carry out their wishes in respect to 
     <lb/>
     the union of the Maritime Provinces, who 
     <lb/>
     exceeded the authority with which he was 
     <lb/>
     entrusted, who betrayed the interests of his 
     <lb/>
     province and abandoned everything that he 
     <lb/>
     was sent to Charlottetown to obtain—the man 
     <lb/>
     who went throughout the length and breadth 
     <lb/>
     of his province crying out against the good 
     <lb/>
     faith of the then Canadian Government—I 
     <lb/>
     say I have happiness in announcing that he 
     <lb/>
     has been disposed of by the people. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Hon. Mr. TILLEY came to Quebec in 
     <lb/>
     1863, with Hon. Mr. TUPPER, and although 
     <lb/>
     he made the charge of bad faith against the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government, he knew as well as 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. TUPPER that the agreement of 1862 
     <lb/>
     respecting the Intercolonial Railway was to 
     <lb/>
     be abandoned, except so far as the survey of 
     <lb/>
     the line was concerned.

     he did not write a letter to a gentleman in 
     <lb/>
     this province, in which he said that the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of 1862 was abandoned by the Canadian Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.

     <lb/>
     by me to make it public. Hon. Mr. TILLEY, 
     <lb/>
     so far from believing the scheme abandoned, 
     <lb/>
     went back to New Brunswick with a very dif<lb break="no"/>ferent impression ; and I ask the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman whether he did not say to him while 
     <lb/>
     here: —" I declare to God, TILLEY, if I 
     <lb/>
     thought by resigning my office we could get 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway, I would do it." 
     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman is out of office now, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps he will say whether he made this 
     <lb/>
     declaration or not. (Hear, hear.)

     deny that. I was then, and always have 
     <lb/>
     been, in favor of the Intercolonial Railway, 
     <lb/>
     and am desirous that it should be built. 
     <lb/>
     I think that an outlet to the ocean on Bri<lb break="no"/>tish soil, at all seasons of the year, is a 
     <lb/>
     very desirable thing to be obtained, and upon 
     <lb/>
     that point I have never changed my opinon. 
     <lb/>
     But I do say that Hon. Mr. TUPPER and Hon. 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
           

     Mr. TILLEY understood that it was not to he 
     <lb/>
     proceeded with at that time, and a memoran<lb break="no"/>dum was drawn up by Dr. TUPPER at the time 
     <lb/>
     (I am now speaking in the presence of my 
     <lb/>
     late colleagues, who are aware of all the facts), 
     <lb/>
     embodying the decision at which the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment arrived, but which was not signed, because 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. TILLEY asked that Mr. FLEMING 
     <lb/>
     might be considered as engaged to proceed 
     <lb/>
     with the survey, and wished to reserve it for 
     <lb/>
     the formal ratification of his colleagues when 
     <lb/>
     he went back to New Brunswick. When he 
     <lb/>
     did go back, his colleagues dissented from the 
     <lb/>
     views he had formed, and, in order to get 
     <lb/>
     himself out of the awkward position in which 
     <lb/>
     he was placed, he took the ground that the 
     <lb/>
     abandonment of the project was owing to the 
     <lb/>
     bad faith of the Canadian Government. Now 
     <lb/>
     I say it is a matter of great satisfaction to 
     <lb/>
     me that the honorable gentleman who cir<lb break="no"/>culated this charge, and gave ground for 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen now on the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches to attack the Government of which 
     <lb/>
     was a member, and accuse it of bad faith to the 
     <lb/>
     sister provinces, has for these bold and auda<lb break="no"/>cious statements met his just deserts. He has 
     <lb/>
     been scouted and rejected by his own people. 
     <lb/>
     He has lost their confidence, and with that 
     <lb/>
     loss of confidence this great scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation has come to woeful grief. I say 
     <lb/>
     punishment has overtaken him. It was a 
     <lb/>
     long time coming, but it has come at last with 
     <lb/>
     terrible effect. (Hear, hear.) The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West says that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will ask for a vote of credit, but he has 
     <lb/>
     not told us how long this vote will extend. 
     <lb/>
     He does not tell what they will do if the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme fails, as it is pretty 
     <lb/>
     sure to fail. He does not say that it is going 
     <lb/>
     to carry, nor does he say that it will be suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded by any other. Where, I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know, is the smaller scheme—the pet scheme 
     <lb/>
     of the member for South Oxford—of a Feder<lb break="no"/>ation of Canada first, to be followed, if 
     <lb/>
     need be, by a Federation of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ? What is the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to do with this scheme ? Is it to be 
     <lb/>
     brought down to the House, or, the larger one 
     <lb/>
     having failed, is it to be kept in hand for use 
     <lb/>
     at some future time? Have we not a right 
     <lb/>
     to know what this scheme is and what the 
     <lb/>
     Government proposes to do in regard to it? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Are the people of the country 
     <lb/>
     to be left in a feverish state of excitement, 
     <lb/>
     because the Government has no definite policy, 
     <lb/>
     until the mission spoken of goes to England, 
     <lb/>
     in the hope that the people of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces will in the meantime repent of the 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">654</fw>
          
       

     action they have taken ? Why, sir, not only 
     <lb/>
     have the minds of the people of Canada been 
     <lb/>
     unhinged by the proceedings of the past year, 
     <lb/>
     not only have they been made dissatified with 
     <lb/>
     the institutions under which they have lived and 
     <lb/>
     prospered for a number of years, but political 
     <lb/>
     parties have also been demoralized. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Yes, the Reform party has become so 
     <lb/>
     disorganized by this Confederation scheme, 
     <lb/>
     that there is scarcely a vestige of its greatness 
     <lb/>
     left—hardly a vestige of that great party that 
     <lb/>
     demanded reform for a number of years, but 
     <lb/>
     which unfortunately, in 1864 as in 1854, 
     <lb/>
     went over to the other side when its leaders 
     <lb/>
     could no longer endure to remain in the cold 
     <lb/>
     shades of opposition. (Hear, hear.) Is it 
     <lb/>
     too much to ask honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches to tell us something of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme for federating these two provinces— 
     <lb/>
     to give us an inkling of what is to be done, 
     <lb/>
     now that the other scheme has failed, and of 
     <lb/>
     the liabilities to be assumed by the respective 
     <lb/>
     sections of Canada? Are we to be kept in 
     <lb/>
     ignorance on these subjects ? Are the affairs 
     <lb/>
     of the country to continue in the unsettled 
     <lb/>
     state in which they now are ? Is all legisla<lb break="no"/>tion to remain at a stand-still until the more 
     <lb/>
     and more doubtful prospect of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     is realized ? (Hear, hear.) What amount 
     <lb/>
     of money is required by the Government to 
     <lb/>
     meet the danger that is said to have suddenly 
     <lb/>
     threatened us? Are the people not to know 
     <lb/>
     what preparations are to be made and what 
     <lb/>
     sums are to be expended in our defence ? I 
     <lb/>
     am not opposed to any proper measures being 
     <lb/>
     taken to defend the country, but at the same 
     <lb/>
     time prudence dictates that we should know 
     <lb/>
     what the are to cost before we blindly vote for 
     <lb/>
     them. If Confederation is not to take  place, 
     <lb/>
     what is the use of going on with measures of 
     <lb/>
     defence that depends upon Confederation 
     <lb/>
     being carried ? Why not come down now 
     <lb/>
     with a scheme that will  apply to Canada alone, 
     <lb/>
     and let us know precisely  what burdens the 
     <lb/>
     people will have to bear for their defence, 
     <lb/>
     what additional taxation will be  required, and 
     <lb/>
     all other information connected wit the sub<lb break="no"/>ject ? ( Hear, hear.) I do say that it is 
     <lb/>
     anything but satisfactory to be told that we 
     <lb/>
     are to postpone the promised scheme for our 
     <lb/>
     defence at this time, to adjourn over till sum<lb break="no"/>mer, and in the meantime to send commissioners 
     <lb/>
     home to treat with the Imperial Government. 
     <lb/>
     If the danger is so imminent as it is said to 
     <lb/>
     be, why this long delay ? (Hear, hear.) Sir, 
     <lb/>
     I never was myself an advocate of any change 
     <lb/>
     in our Constitution ; I believed it was capable 
     <lb/>
     of being well worked to the satisfaction of the 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
   

     people, if we were free from demagogues and 
     <lb/>
     designing persons who so ht to create strife 
     <lb/>
     between the sections. (Hear, hear.) I am 
     <lb/>
     not disposed to extend my remarks further at 
     <lb/>
     present. All I can say is, that the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West has done the House 
     <lb/>
     justice if he has given us all the information 
     <lb/>
     in his possession with regard to the present 
     <lb/>
     aspect of the Confederation question ; and yet 
     <lb/>
     it appears to me somewhat absurd to proceed 
     <lb/>
     with the debate, when even the Government 
     <lb/>
     itself admits the measure to be a failure. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. Mr. DORION</persName>—I think the an<lb break="no"/>nouncement made by the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral West must have taken the House a little 
     <lb/>
     by surprise. (Hear, hear.) The policy 
     <lb/>
     agreed on by the Government in June, 1864, 
     <lb/>
     was certainly not the one carried out at the 
     <lb/>
     opening of this  session, and still less that which 
     <lb/>
     has just been announced. The policy, as we 
     <lb/>
     find it in a memorandum then communicated 
     <lb/>
     to the House, was that a measure for the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the two Canadas, with pro<lb break="no"/>visions for the admission of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, should be brought before the House 
     <lb/>
     this session. I will give the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     memorandum, in order that there may be no 
     <lb/>
     doubt about it. When explanations were 
     <lb/>
     given in June last, by the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment two memoranda were communicated to 
     <lb/>
     the house. One was a memorandum that 
     <lb/>
     had been communicated to the Hon. the 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council, and marked " Con<lb break="no"/>fidential." It was in these words :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     communicated to the Honorable President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council. It was a proposition on behalf 
     <lb/>
     of the members of the then Government to 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable President of the Council, to 
     <lb/>
     the effect that the Government would be pre<lb break="no"/>pared, immediately after that session, to take 
     <lb/>
     measures for obtaining a Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, and, failing in that scheme, to 
     <lb/>
     bring into the House at the next session— 
     <lb/>
     that is the resent session—a scheme for the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the two Canadas, with a 
     <lb/>
     provision that the Maritime Provinces might 
     <lb/>
     come into the union when they saw fit. But 
     <lb/>
     this proposition was not accepted, and another 
     <lb/>
     memorandum was submitted to the Honor<lb break="no"/>able President of the Council in the following 
     <lb/>
     terms :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Government are prepared to pledge them<lb break="no"/>selves to bring in a measure next session for the

     purpose of removing existing difliculties, by in<lb break="no"/>troducing the Federal rinciple into Canada,

     This, then, is what the Government pledged 
     <lb/>
     itself to do. The first memorandum to open 
     <lb/>
     negotiations for a Confederation with the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces was rejected by the Honor<lb break="no"/>able President of the Council, and he agreed

     to go into the Government on this pledge, 
     <lb/>
     that it would be prepared to bring in a mea<lb break="no"/>sure, this session, for the purpose of removing

     promised by the Government ; this is the 
     <lb/>
     measure that honorable gentlemen on the

     other side, at the end of last session, said 
     <lb/>
     they would be prepared to introduce to the

     Legislature this session. But instead of that 
     <lb/>
     the whole scheme has been altered. (Hear,

     the remainder of it to qualify the pledge then

     <lb/>
     is a distinct and positive pledge given by hon.

    gentlemen in their places on the Treas 
     <lb/>benches, that at this session of Parliament 
     <lb/>they would bring in a measure for the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the two Canadas, leavi it to

     And the Government will seek, by sending

     England, to secure the assent of those interests

     We find, from these explanations, that a 
     <lb/>
     measure for the Confederation of the whole 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces did not suit the Hon. Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council and the Liberal party in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, that it was rejected by him 
     <lb/>
     and his party as not the proper remedy 
     <lb/>
     for our difficulties, and that another meas<lb break="no"/>ure was accepted by him, applying the 
     <lb/>
     principle of Federation to the two Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and in order to secure to that measure the 
     <lb/>
     acquiescence of those interests which were 
     <lb/>
     beyond the control of the Government of this 
     <lb/>
     country, delegates were to be sent to confer 
     <lb/>
     with the Lower Provinces with the view of 
     <lb/>
     bringing them into this union. Well, sir, 
     <lb/>
     I must say that if the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite had not been untrue to their pledge 
     <lb/>
     — if they had brought to this House the 
     <lb/>
     measure they then promised—we in this 
     <lb/>
     country would, at all events, have been saved 
     <lb/>
     the humiliation of seein the Government 
     <lb/>
     going on its knees and begging the little 
     <lb/>
     island of Prince Edward to come into this 
     <lb/>
     union, and then going to Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick and supplicating them to re<lb break="no"/>lieve us of our difficulties; and saved the 
     <lb/>
     humiliation of seeing these su plieations and 
     <lb/>
     the bribes in ever direction with which they 
     <lb/>
     were accompanied, in the shape of subsidies 
     <lb/>
     to New Brunswick and Newfoundland, and 
     <lb/>
     of the Intercolonial Railway, rejected by 
     <lb/>
     those to whom they were offered. Canada 
     <lb/>
     would, at all events, have held a dignified 
     <lb/>
     position, and not suffered the humiliation of 
     <lb/>
     seeing all the offers of our Government in<lb break="no"/>dignantly rejected by the people of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. The Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West says that the scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     has obtained the consent of the governments 
     <lb/>
     of all the provinces; but where are those 
     <lb/>
     governments now ? Where is the Government 
     <lb/>
     of New Brunswick? Where is the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Prince Edward Island ? (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) As for the Government of Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, it pledged itself to bring the scheme be<lb break="no"/>fore the Legislature; but it is wellknown that 
     <lb/>
     it dare not press it, and still less appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the people upon it. The members of that 
     <lb/>
     Government were wiser than the Government 
     <lb/>
     of New Brunswick, and would not appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the people. And here I must say that I 
     <lb/>

     compliment the Government upon the wisdom 
     <lb/>
     it shows in not appealing to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Honorable gentlemen have shown far 
     <lb/>
     more foresight in this matter than the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of New Brunswick, in refusing to 
     <lb/>
     let the people have an opportunity of pro<lb break="no"/>nouncing upon this scheme, for the petitions 
     <lb/>
     coming down daily against it show conclu<lb break="no"/>sively that the people, of Lower Canada at 
     <lb/>
     all events, are almost unanimously against 
     <lb/>
     it, and that an appeal to them would meet, 
     <lb/>
     as regards the members of the Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada Administration, with the same fate 
     <lb/>
     which befel the members of the New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick Government. (Hear.) I do not wish, 
     <lb/>
     sir, to prolong this ebate more than neces<lb break="no"/>sary, out I must say that I am surprised to 
     <lb/>
     hear the Hon. Attorney General West say that 
     <lb/>
     the defences of the country require such im<lb break="no"/>mediate attention that the matter cannot be 
     <lb/>
     delayed for a moment. If I mistake not, the 
     <lb/>
     Government have had in their hands a report 
     <lb/>
     from Col. JERVOIS upon the defences, since 
     <lb/>
     the 12th of October last, and yet since that 
     <lb/>
     time not a single thing has been done towards 
     <lb/>
     defence. We are now told with startling 
     <lb/>
     emphasis that the country is about to be in<lb break="no"/>vaded, or is in most imminent danger; and 
     <lb/>
     all at once, now that the great scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is defeated, we learn that not 
     <lb/>
     an hour's delay can be allowed, and that we 
     <lb/>
     cannot even wait to vote the supplies, so 
     <lb/>
     urgent is the necessity of sending a mission to 
     <lb/>
     England about this matter. Between Friday 
     <lb/>
     last and this morning the Government has dis<lb break="no"/>covered that this imminent danger threatens 
     <lb/>
     us, and so anxious is it about it that we 
     <lb/>
     cannot even stop to vote the ordinary sup<lb break="no"/>plies, but must pass at once a vote of credit. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And, sir, while I am on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the defences, I must say it is most 
     <lb/>
     astonishing that although we have repeatedly 
     <lb/>
     asked for information on the subject, in con<lb break="no"/>nection with this great scheme, we can not 
     <lb/>
     get it. (Hear, hear.) At the earliest mo<lb break="no"/>ment after the commencement of the session, 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Drummond and 
     <lb/>
     Arthabaska (Mr. J. B. E. DORION) made a 
     <lb/>
     motion for any despatches, reports, or com<lb break="no"/>munications, or for extracts thereof, which 
     <lb/>
     might be in the possession of the Government 
     <lb/>
     on the question of the defences of the country, 
     <lb/>
     and the Hon. Attorney General West rose 
     <lb/>
     and replied that to give this information would 
     <lb/>
     endanger the safety of the province. The 
     <lb/>
     Ministry of Canada therefore refused us that 
     <lb/>
    which we now find in the report which comes 
     <lb/>from England.

     the country by giving the House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     such information as will enable Parliament to 
     <lb/>
     take the necessary steps to provide for the 
     <lb/>
     defences of any part of the British Empire. 
     <lb/>
     I moved another Address at a later period, 
     <lb/>
     asking for such information on the subject of 
     <lb/>
     our defences as the Government might deem 
     <lb/>
     it proper to give; ' and although that Address 
     <lb/>
     was voted a full fortnight ago, I have been 
     <lb/>
     unable to obtain an answer to it up to the 
     <lb/>
     present time. Nor can we get information in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the finances—in fact every kind 
     <lb/>
     of information which is necessary to enable us 
     <lb/>
     to form roper and correct judgments is 
     <lb/>
     refused. But, sir, I must say that at the 
     <lb/>
     present moment I am unaware of any reason 
     <lb/>
     which could be urged for our being called upon 
     <lb/>
     to act with such precipitate haste as to grant 
     <lb/>
     a vote of credit to hon. gentlemen. ( Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The session has been called at the 
     <lb/>
     usual time—rather earlier than the usual 
     <lb/>
     time for holding our meetings of Par<lb break="no"/>liament—and I say it is a most extraor<lb break="no"/>dinary thing that we should be asked by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen on the other side to give 
     <lb/>
     them a vote of credit. (Hear, hear.) Why, 
     <lb/>
     air, is the whole business of the country to be 
     <lb/>
     thrown into a condition of derangement in 
     <lb/>
     order to allow the honorable gentlemen to get 
     <lb/>
     themselves out of a difficulty—not to get the 
     <lb/>
     country, but themselves, out of the difieulty 
     <lb/>
     which they have acknowledged to have over<lb break="no"/>taken them? (Hear, hear.) Are all the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of the province to be thrown over, for 
     <lb/>
     such a reason, until next session, which may 
     <lb/>
     not be held for six months or nine months, or 
     <lb/>
     until the honorable gentlemen choose to call us 
     <lb/>
     again together ? Because " an early summer 
     <lb/>
     session " may be the month of; August or the 
     <lb/>
     month of September, or it may mean even a 
     <lb/>
     later period than that. Do they expect a 
     <lb/>
     vote of credit of six millions of dollars to enable 
     <lb/>
     them to construct these defences which are 
     <lb/>
     spoken of by Col. JERVOIS?

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. Mr. DORION</persName>—Then, if we do not

     hear.) We are told that there is urgent ne<lb break="no"/>cessity for expending money on our defences, 
     <lb/>
     and that the danger is imminent. Well, sir,

     I apprehend if there is imminent danger, we

     ought to be kept sitting here until provision

     is made to meet that danger, or at all events, 
     <lb/>
     affairs ought to be placed in such a position 
     <lb/>
     that, at any moment, we can be called to<lb break="no"/>gether to provide for the danger. (Hear, hear.)

            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—It puzzles the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen to reply. I think that they 
     <lb/>themselves never discovered there was any 
     <lb/>cause for alarm until Friday last, when there 
     <lb/>was imminent danger of the defeat of their 
     <lb/>scheme, and imminent danger also of the loss 
     <lb/>of their position. (Laughter.) This, sir, is the 
     <lb/>real danger the hon. gentlemen want to avert, 
     <lb/>and they proceed to do so by asking us, in lieu 
     <lb/>of granting the ordinary supplies, to pass a vote 
     <lb/>of credit. We will then be sent away, with 
     <lb/>the prospect before their friends and support<lb break="no"/>ers of another session this summer, when the 
     <lb/>additional sessional allowance will of course 
     <lb/>be welcome to all. (Hear, hear, and laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) I simply rose, sir, to protest against 
     <lb/>the continuance of this scheme by the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen opposite. I think they are 
     <lb/>bound to proceed in some other way, seeing 
     <lb/>that this scheme cannot be carried, as it cer<lb break="no"/>tainly cannot. It has been rejected not only 
     <lb/>by New Brunswick, but by Prince Edward 
     <lb/>Island, one of whose delegates to Quebec, Mr. 
     <lb/>WHELAN, has been holding meetings, and all 
     <lb/>that he has been able to accomplish is the 
     <lb/>passing of resolutions of confidence in himself, 
     <lb/>and the assertion that no such scheme should 
     <lb/>be given effect to without being first submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the people. That is the most favora<lb break="no"/>ble expressron of opinion that can be obtained 
     <lb/>in Prince Edward Island. It is well known, 
     <lb/>too, that the Legislature of Nova Scotia is 
     <lb/>against the scheme by a large majority. And 
     <lb/>now we find that New Brunswick has pro<lb break="no"/>nounced against it also. Will hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>go to England and press on the scheme under 
     <lb/>such circumstances? Will they argue that 
     <lb/>because we are 2,500,000 and they only 900,<lb break="no"/>000, we ought to swallow them up by press<lb break="no"/>ing them into Confederation against their 
     <lb/>wishes? (Hear, hear.) I do not suppose 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen on the other side pur<lb break="no"/>pose attempting to coerce, by means of their 
     <lb/>influence with the Imperial Government, the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces to come into this Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. Therefore it is that I say that this scheme 
     <lb/>is killed. (Hear, hear, and derisive Opposition 
     <lb/>cheers.) I repeat that it is killed. I claim 
     <lb/>that it is the duty of hon. gentlemen opposite, 
     <lb/>and particularly is it the duty of the Hon. 
     <lb/>President of the Council, to insist upon their 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
          

     colleagues keeping to the pledges they have 
     <lb/>
     made. It is the duty of the Liberal members 
     <lb/>
     generally to insist on these pledges being 
     <lb/>
     redeemed, without which they would have 
     <lb/>
     refused to sanction the taking of office by the 
     <lb/>
     three Liberal members of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and in accordance with which alone they 
     <lb/>
     could justify that step before their consti<lb break="no"/>tuents. It was only the knowledge that, 
     <lb/>
     failing the success of this measure, they would 
     <lb/>
     carry out a scheme which was within the 
     <lb/>
     power of the Government to carry, that the 
     <lb/>
    Liberal party of Upper Canada approved of 
     <lb/>their three friends making part of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The Administration could not give 
     <lb/>a pledge that they would carry the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of all the provinces, but they could 
     <lb/>pledge, and did pledge themselves to bring 
     <lb/>in, in the event of the failure of that scheme, 
     <lb/>a measure for the federation of Upper and 
     <lb/>Lower Canada. And, sir, not only was this 
     <lb/>promise made at that time, but we have since 
     <lb/>seen, this session, the head of the Government, 
     <lb/>Hon. Sir E. P. TACHÉ, renewing the pledge 
     <lb/>then given in these words :—" They arranged 
     <lb/>a large scheme and a smaller one. If the 
     <lb/>larger failed, then they would fall back upon 
     <lb/>the minor, which provided for a federation of 
     <lb/>the two sections of the province." And it 
     <lb/>was expressly stated that during this session, 
     <lb/>if the present scheme failed, they should bring 
     <lb/>in a measure to federate the two provinces. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) That was the promise given 
     <lb/>to the Honorable President of the Council, 
     <lb/>and, if it is not redeemed, I fear his position 
     <lb/>will be a most unenviable one in the country.

     <persName ref="pers:WALL4">MR. WALLBRIDGE</persName>—I understood the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General West to state that the

     American railway influence had had some

     <lb/>
     repeat to the honorable gentleman what I did 
     <lb/>
     say. It was this: that I had no doubt the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation was one of the subjects 
     <lb/>
     which influenced the people of St. John. 
     <lb/>
     But I did not pretend that that was the only 
     <lb/>
     one. There were other local questions which, 
     <lb/>
     I have no doubt, had their due weight of 
     <lb/>
     influence. There was, for instance, the 
     <lb/>
     usual struggle between the ins and the outs, 
     <lb/>
     and I presume there was the influence to 
     <lb/>
     be contended against of those who were 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the railways to the American 
     <lb/>
     frontier—the Coast Line or Western Exten<lb break="no"/>sion Railway—as opposed to the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway interest.

     But not quite so fast, good friends. This is 
     <lb/>
     not the first we have heard of this "military" 
     <lb/>
     railway. Last summer, a committee of Congress, 
     <lb/>
     composed mostly of shrewd New Englanders, 
     <lb/>
     came from Washington to examine and report as 
     <lb/>
     to the expediency of constructing a "military" 
     <lb/>
     road to the frontier of New Brunswick. They 
     <lb/>
     were not allowed, however, to stop at the fron<lb break="no"/>tier, for when they arrived there they found an 
     <lb/>
     invitation inviting them to go on to St. John. 
     <lb/>
     They went, and St. John was in a perfect furore 
     <lb/>
     of interesting excitement. A public meeting was 
     <lb/>
     called; we are not sure whether Mr. TILLEY was 
     <lb/>
     present or not—we think he was accidentally 
     <lb/>
     absent from some inevitable cause, but sent a 
     <lb/>
     message with his compliments and sympathies. 
     <lb/>
     The mayor occupied the chair; the viands were 
     <lb/>
     excellent; the champagne flowed "<hi rendition="simple:italic">à la Ottawa</hi>;" 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
        

     the speeches were eloquent; and although St. 
     <lb/>
     John but recently been all in a blaze with 
     <lb/>
     sympathy with the poor suffering Southerners, 
     <lb/>
     somehow it happened—under what genial influ<lb break="no"/>ences we cannot say—that they managed to 
     <lb/>
     create a most agreeable impression, not only upon 
     <lb/>
     the stomachs, but upon the loyal hearts, of the 
     <lb/>
     committee of Congress. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But this was not all. The provincial railway 
     <lb/>
     was placed at their disposal free of expense, and 
     <lb/>
     they were <hi rendition="simple:italic">chaperoned</hi> over it by leading men, to 
     <lb/>
     Shediac and back to St. John. Mr. TILLEY, we 
     <lb/>
     think, was on this trip; and after all was over, 
     <lb/>
     they went back with a wondering appreciation of 
     <lb/>
     the "good lord, good devil" versatility of our 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick friends.

     Strange to say, we find Mr. TILLEY, not only 
     <lb/>
     investing the public funds of New Brunswick in 
     <lb/>
     the construction of a military road from Portland 
     <lb/>
     to St. John (of course only the Yankee end of

     the line is military), but the delegates themselves

     <lb/>
     the delegates to explain this little matter to the 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction of the old ladies whom they have been

     In the face of these extracts is it not idle to 
     <lb/>
     say that Hon. Mr. TILLEY was defeated by 
     <lb/>
     American railway influences? The presump<lb break="no"/>tion would be the contrary. Looking to their 
     <lb/>
     interest those shrewd New Englanders spoken 
     <lb/>
     of would have supported the candidate who 
     <lb/>
     is willing to invest the funds of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick in a railway connecting with their line. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. TILLEY, the leader of the New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick Government, was defeated, not 
     <lb/>
     through American influence, but because of 
     <lb/>
     the unpopularity of the Federation scheme,

     as presented to the people of his province ; 
     <lb/>
     and it is wrong to introduce this new cry 
     <lb/>
     into our politics. Canada has been cursed 
     <lb/>
     with party cries, and it is time for us to clear 
     <lb/>
     the political arena of such false issues and 
     <lb/>
     dangerous contests. To introduce this new 
     <lb/>
     element of discord can only gain for its 
     <lb/>
     promoters a temporary relief, whilst the 
     <lb/>
     damage it will inflict upon the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country are positive. Our critical 
     <lb/>
     relations, at this moment, with the American 
     <lb/>
     people are mainly traceable to cries of this 
     <lb/>
     kind. By rendering the people suspicious 
     <lb/>
     of such influence, the promoters of the cry 
     <lb/>
     are hastening the accomplishment of what 
     <lb/>
     they pretend to oppose. Once render the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country dissatisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     working of their system of government, and 
     <lb/>
     there will be danger of their continuing 
     <lb/>
     what will then seem inevitable. If there 
     <lb/>
     be any who desire annexation, they could 
     <lb/>
     not better forward their views than by raising 
     <lb/>
     the false cry of American interference in our 
     <lb/>
     political contests. Once destroy public confi<lb break="no"/>dence in our institutions, and it is impossible to 
     <lb/>
     predict what extremes may not be resorted to. 
     <lb/>
     If the Ministry have information of the kind 
     <lb/>
     alleged, of an interference by foreigners in 
     <lb/>
     the political contest now going on in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, they are bound to lay it before 
     <lb/>
     the House. Such an interference could not 
     <lb/>
     be tolerated, and the country should know the 
     <lb/>
     truth of the allegation at the earliest possible 
     <lb/>
     moment. If the vote of credit asked for is 
     <lb/>
     for military purposes, for fortifications, the 
     <lb/>
     Government will find their hands strength<lb break="no"/>ened by the support of every hon. member 
     <lb/>
     of this House. It is not necessary to cry 
     <lb/>
     loyalty to obtain the vote, no more than it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary to cry annexation to secure the 
     <lb/>
     passage of an act to unite the provinces. 
     <lb/>
    I have been surprised at the alternative 
     <lb/>that has so often been put by hon. members, 
     <lb/>—Federation, or Annexation. Yes, and by 
     <lb/>hon. members who, in 1858, helped to laugh 
     <lb/>out of the House the resolutions of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Hon. Finance Minister, on the ground 
     <lb/>that if they were carried and confederation 
     <lb/>follow, there would be a movement in the 
     <lb/>direction of annexation. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>ask where is the consistency of the two 
     <lb/>positions—in 1858 federation was a move 
     <lb/>towards annexation, in 1865 it is the 
     <lb/>only measure that will prevent annexation ? 
     <lb/>The language of Her Majesty and of some 
     <lb/>" noble lords" has been referred to as a 
     <lb/>reason why this scheme should be accepted 
     <lb/>without enquiry. But it should be remem<lb break="no"/>
       

    
            <cb/>
    

     bered that this is not the first time that 
     <lb/>
     language has been put in an Address from the 
     <lb/>
     Throne, to palliate the sacrifice of the true 
     <lb/>
     interests of Canada. We are as capable of 
     <lb/>
     judging here, on the floor of this House, 
     <lb/>
     what is for the true interests of the country, 
     <lb/>
     as any of the noble lords of the realm. If 
     <lb/>
     their speeches contain the sum of wisdom 
     <lb/>
     in regard to our affairs, pray how is it that 
     <lb/>
     our frontier has been in times past so exten<lb break="no"/>sively sacrificed ? Every one who has given 
     <lb/>
     any attention to the subject will see that 
     <lb/>
     under the Ashburton treaty our frontier 
     <lb/>
     was shamefully surrendered to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, and that it received the sanction of 
     <lb/>
     noble lords at home ; and now we have 
     <lb/>
     to build our railway over the rocks of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and Nova Scotia, to the seaboard. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) This question of Federation is a 
     <lb/>
     question which concerns our country, which 
     <lb/>
     concerns our allegiance, which concerns our 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Home Government and 
     <lb/>
     the future of this country ; and when our in<lb break="no"/>terests are at stake, we are the proper parties 
     <lb/>
     to judge of what is best. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, to raise a false cry to enable hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the opposite side to carry out 
     <lb/>
     their measure without amendment and with<lb break="no"/>out consulting the peeple of this province, 
     <lb/>
     is unjust in practice and wrong in principle 
     <lb/>
     It is a dangerous experiment. Had hon. 
     <lb/>
     members been aware of the whole circum<lb break="no"/>stances of the New Brunswick elections, they 
     <lb/>
     would perhaps have reflected before placing 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. TILLEY in a false position.

     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. MCGEE</persName>—It is all a mistake.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WALL4">MR. WALLBRIDGE</persName>—The extracts read 
     <lb/>
     are confirmatory of this view. I know 
     <lb/>
     something of the railways of New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     and I am aware that a. scheme was favored 
     <lb/>
     by the people of St. John to extend their 
     <lb/>
     railways to the American frontier, as Canada 
     <lb/>
     has done in several instances. It was their 
     <lb/>
     interest to connect with the Portland road, 
     <lb/>
     just as it was the interest of Canada to con<lb break="no"/>nect the Grand Trunk with the road from 
     <lb/>
     Montreal to Portland. And with Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     TILLEY as the advocate of such extension, is 
     <lb/>
     it reasonable to infer that the American rail<lb break="no"/>way men opposed his election ? The scheme 
     <lb/>
     before us is fraught with a job of greater 
     <lb/>
     proportions than the New Brunswick people 
     <lb/>
     ever thought of. The lurking influences of 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Trunk Railway, or of the well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     known contractors, who are uppermost when<lb break="no"/>ever this union is spoken of, are at work.

way, by the longest route it will be 
     <lb/>
     possible to find, is the pivot on which 
     <lb/>
     the scheme revolves. If it be the desire 
     <lb/>
     to get to the seaboard, and not to give 
     <lb/>
     certain contracting firms a job, why is not 
     <lb/>
     the shortest, cheapest and best route, from 
     <lb/>
     every point of view, selected ? Why climb 
     <lb/>
     over the mountains of the centre of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, or along the seacoast, when a 
     <lb/>
     road can be constructed by a better but 
     <lb/>
     shorter route, for much less money, by the 
     <lb/>
     valley of the St. John ? I contend that the 
     <lb/>
     route this road is to run should be made 
     <lb/>
     known to this House. It is a question in<lb break="no"/>volving the expenditure of millions, and if 
     <lb/>
     the cheaper route be built, the saving to 
     <lb/>
     Canada will also be many millions of dollars. 
     <lb/>
     I know that certain honorable gentlemen are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to vote on this question phlegmati<lb break="no"/>cally. (Laughter.)

     <persName ref="pers:WALL4">MR. WALLBRIDGE</persName>—An hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man asks me what a phlegmatic vote is? 
     <lb/>
     I would inform him it is to vote on this

     question, which so deeply concerns our fu<lb break="no"/>ture interests, without inquiry. It will cause 
     <lb/>
     some honorable gentlemen to give the lie to 
     <lb/>
     their whole political lives. It is to vote 
     <lb/>
     away, without enquiry, our rights to the 
     <lb/>
     North-West territory. It is to seal up that 
     <lb/>
     country hermetically for all time to come. 
     <lb/>
     That is what I call giving a phlegmatic 
     <lb/>
     vote. (Hear, hear.) We find that the re<lb break="no"/>presentatives at the Conference from Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick made it a point 
     <lb/>
     of the proposed Constitution to construct 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway, also took good 
     <lb/>
     care to make the opening of the North-West 
     <lb/>
     contingent upon the state of the finances, 
     <lb/>
     and the Confederation will commence life 
     <lb/>
     with a debt of $150,000,000. It is evident, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that the North-West is hermeti<lb break="no"/>cally sealed, as far as Canada is concerned. 
     <lb/>
     What shall we gain by this particular scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation ? We have been running 
     <lb/>
     with railway speed into bankruptcy. and 
     <lb/>
     this scheme is one which will add immense<lb break="no"/>ly to our debt, and especially to our debt on 
     <lb/>
     account of unproductive and useless rail<lb break="no"/>ways, and of which we do not even know 
     <lb/>
     the route, although, now that the elections 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick are over, it cannot affect 
     <lb/>
     the position in that province to give the 
     <lb/>
     information we are seeking. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am in favor of a union of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces. But the union 
     <lb/>
     that is desirable is a union in fact, not an 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
      

     organized system of discord, with a number 
     <lb/>
     of petty legislatures that will only serve to 
     <lb/>
     create strife and prevent our moving forward 
     <lb/>
     in the career of civilization and improvement. 
     <lb/>
     The scheme of the hon. gentlemen, to some 
     <lb/>
     extent, will give us the advantages of a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union, but it is incumbered with 
     <lb/>
     objectionable details—details which, in their 
     <lb/>
     importance, amount to principles, and to 
     <lb/>
     secure their rejection or amendment I shall 
     <lb/>
     employ what energy I can bring to hear. 
     <lb/>
     The scheme has been submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people in New Brunswick, and it has there 
     <lb/>
     been admitted, as well as in Nova Scotia, that 
     <lb/>
     it was subject to amendment. Why should 
     <lb/>
     Canada not have the same right accorded ? 
     <lb/>
     Why should we take the scheme in its en<lb break="no"/>tirety, when its authors cannot justify certain 
     <lb/>
     provisions which specially relate to this coun<lb break="no"/>try ? It is treating Canada with contempt, 
     <lb/>
     and hon. gentlemen will be held responsible. 
     <lb/>
     I have very great confidence in several of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentlemen opposite. I have very 
     <lb/>
     great confidence in the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council and the two other hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men whom he took into the Ministry with 
     <lb/>
     him. But, when the Hon. the President of

     the Council consented to go into the Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration without getting a fair represent<lb break="no"/>ation in it of the party with which he was 
     <lb/>
     acting, both in Upper and in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     he miscarried. (Laughter.) That may ac<lb break="no"/>count for some of the objectionable features 
     <lb/>
     of this measure. It may account for Canada 
     <lb/>
     consenting, and for the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council giving his consent, that the voting 
     <lb/>
     at the Conference should be by provinces, 
     <lb/>
     instead of by numbers. They took very 
     <lb/>
     good care to arrange that we should pay 
     <lb/>
     according to population. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     they voted by provinces, and in that way 
     <lb/>
     hampered the scheme with many objectionable 
     <lb/>
     details. And I think, therefore, it is now 
     <lb/>
     competent for this House to criticise those 
     <lb/>
     details, and to take such steps as will en<lb break="no"/>sure their exclusion from the Imperial Act.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>— Before these ex<lb break="no"/>planations are over—and I have no desire to 
     <lb/>
     prolong them further than is necessary—I 
     <lb/>
     would like to ask the Hon. Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     as to the course to be pursued with referenc 
     <lb/>
     to the Lower Canada School Law, which was 
     <lb/>
     promised to be introduced this session. We

     are now told a prorogation is to take place,

     House since the session commenced, is 
     <lb/>
     intended to be carried out, or whether it is 
     <lb/>
     to be modified—because it must be obvious 
     <lb/>
     that that matter has an important bearing 
     <lb/>
     on the question of Confederation, with which 
     <lb/>
     it has been connected by honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—I think the statement 
     <lb/>
     made this afternoon by the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West is perfectly explicit. The 
     <lb/>
     Government intend to ask for a vote on the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions now in the hands of the Speaker. 
     <lb/>
     With regard to the School question, the 
     <lb/>
     Government are under the same ledge as 
     <lb/>
     they have always been : it will be legislated 
     <lb/>
     upon by this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—This session ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—It will not be legis<lb break="no"/>lated upon this session, because, as the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West has stated, it is the 
     <lb/>
     intention of the Government to prorogue the 
     <lb/>
     House at the earliest date. But all the con<lb break="no"/>ditions connected with the resolutions will 
     <lb/>
     he legislated upon as a matter of course. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I understand, then, 
     <lb/>
     that the pledge to bring down that question 
     <lb/>
     this session is withdrawn—the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Government on that point having been 
     <lb/>
     modified by the result of the elections in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—There is no change 
     <lb/>
     in the policy of the Government on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of Confederation, or any of the other 
     <lb/>
     measures connected with it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—But the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman must permit me to recall the 
     <lb/>
     nature of the pledge given by himself and 
     <lb/>
     his colleagues at Sherbrooke and in this 
     <lb/>
     House—that there would be a bill brought 
     <lb/>
     down by the Government during this ses<lb break="no"/>sion of Parliament, for the amendment 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Canada School laws. This 
     <lb/>
     was repeated by the Honorable Solicitor 
     <lb/>
     General East, on behalf of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, in the course of certain interpellations 
     <lb/>
     made on this subject in the absence of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the Finance Minister. And the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion of the whole matter now is, that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman states emphatically that 
     <lb/>
     this is not to be done. The people of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, therefore, among the other mis<lb break="no"/>chiefs they have wrought by the free exercise 
     <lb/>
     of their franchise in the rejection of the 
     <lb/>
     Government which undertook, without legis<lb break="no"/>lative or other authority, to enter into ar<lb break="no"/>rangements for revolutionizing the country— 
     <lb/>
     among other mischiefs they have wrought 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     has been this, that the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     and his colleagues conceive themselves to be 
     <lb/>
     relieved thereby of the obligations they 
     <lb/>
     undertook to the country and to the House— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—No! no! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The obligations 
     <lb/>
     they undertook to the country and to the 
     <lb/>
     House to bring in an amendment to the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada School laws during this ses<lb break="no"/>sion of Parliament. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     knows full well—none better than he—the 
     <lb/>
     point of these remarks. It may not be ap<lb break="no"/>preciated by the House generally, especially 
     <lb/>by the members from Upper Canada, but 
     <lb/>the hon. gentleman knows well the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of it, and that the English Protestants of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada desire to know what is to be done 
     <lb/>in this matter of education, before the final 
     <lb/>voice of the people of this country is pro<lb break="no"/>nounced on the question of Confederation. 
     <lb/>The assurances given by the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>led them to believe—and in point of fact they 
     <lb/>do generally believe—that. that measure is to 
     <lb/>be brought down before the final vote of this 
     <lb/>House is taken on the question of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. That is the point of the whole matter. 
     <lb/>And the honorable gentleman now tells us, 
     <lb/>through his leader, that the Confederation 
     <lb/>resolutions are to be put through this session 
     <lb/>immediately, and that commissioners are 
     <lb/>going to England to press legislation founded 
     <lb/>on those resolutions, while on the other hand 
     <lb/>he himself, the great Protestant champion of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, who claims the confidence 
     <lb/>of Lower Canada Protestants in an especial 
     <lb/>manner, now tells them that this promised 
     <lb/>legislation is not to be had until next session 
     <lb/>of Parliament, when it will be too late per<lb break="no"/>haps to petition this House. or even to send 
     <lb/>popular petitions to the Imperial Parliament 
     <lb/>against this measure. Therefore it is, I 
     <lb/>repeat, that among the many curious results 
     <lb/>of the free exercise of their franchise by the 
     <lb/>people of New Brunswick, we have this, 
     <lb/>that the Protestant champion of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada is not going to do that which he 
     <lb/>undertook to do on behalf of his fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>countrymen and co-religionists—that which 
     <lb/>he promised this session, but now postpones 
     <lb/>till another session, when all the circum<lb break="no"/>stances may be changed. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>HON. MR. GALT.—I think the interest 
     <lb/>evinced by the hon. member for Chateauguay  
     <lb/>in this matter is somewhat remarkable. I 
     <lb/>feel grateful indeed to him for the kind soli<lb break="no"/>citude he expresses on my behalf, that I 
     <lb/>should cause no disappointment to the class 
     <lb/>which to a certain extent looks to me. Still 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="662" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0662.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">662</fw>
         

     I think he is guilty of rather a paltry 
     <lb/>
     quibble in the statement he has just made. 
     <lb/>
     The position of the Government was most 
     <lb/>
    distinctly stated by the Attorney General 
     <lb/>West, and no misunderstanding can exist 
     <lb/>with regard to it. It is admitted frankly that 
     <lb/>the events in New Brunswick call for some 
     <lb/>special action by this Government, and the 
     <lb/>action which they propose to take was stated 
     <lb/>in the most distinct terms by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. As regards the education question, 
     <lb/>statements have been made already as to the 
     <lb/>nature of the amendments which are to be 
     <lb/>proposed to the existing School law. The 
     <lb/>Government will unquestionably take care 
     <lb/>that that law shall be amended in the sense 
     <lb/>of those statements before the Confederation 
     <lb/>scheme finally becomes law in Canada. I 
     <lb/>think no further statement is necessary. I 
     <lb/>can add nothing to the assurances which 
     <lb/>have already been given on that subject. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME2">HON. J. H. CAMERON</persName>—There is one 
     <lb/>
     point on which I should like an explaination 
     <lb/>
     from the Hon. Attorney General West. He 
     <lb/>
     says there will be a vote of credit asked from 
     <lb/>
     the House, until the next meeting of the Le<lb break="no"/>gislature. That, I suppose, will not be until 
     <lb/>
     July or August, but the appropriation for the 
     <lb/>
     services of the volunteer force on the frontier 
     <lb/>
     expires in May. Will that vote of credit include 
     <lb/>
     the amount necessary to continue the volun<lb break="no"/>teers on their present service, if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment find that they require it to be continued 
     <lb/>
     up to a subsequent period, say the first of 
     <lb/>
     August? I should like an answer to this 
     <lb/>
    question, if the Government have made up 
     <lb/>their minds on this part of the subject. I 
     <lb/>may remark, also, that one cannot help feel<lb break="no"/>ing it to be a matter of regret that the pub<lb break="no"/>lic business of the country could not go on. 
     <lb/>Of course, if the Government determine 
     <lb/>that the question of Confederation shall 
     <lb/>be pressed to a speedy decision by the 
     <lb/>House, and the Hon. Atty. Gen. West and 
     <lb/>other members of the Government proceed 
     <lb/>immediately thereafter to the other side of 
     <lb/>the Atlantic, it will be necessary that the 
     <lb/>House should rise, without getting through 
     <lb/>the ordinary business of the country. 
     <lb/>At the same time, a few weeks more would 
     <lb/>enable the House to get through all that 
     <lb/>business, and when we met again in July 
     <lb/>or August, we would be able to devote our 
     <lb/>whole time to the measures which the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment may submit to us, as the result of 
     <lb/>the mission to England. If this debate is  
     <lb/>
         


    
            <cb/>
        

     to be pressed as rapidly as the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General indicates, I have no doubt we would 
     <lb/>
     be able to dispose of it, and also to get rid 
     <lb/>
     of the whole of the public and private 
     <lb/>
     business on the Orders, so as to allow the 
     <lb/>
     prorogation to take place before the first of 
     <lb/>
     April. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—I will answer the 
     <lb/>
     question put by my honorable friend to the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General West. The intention 
     <lb/>
     of the Government is to ask such a vote of 
     <lb/>
     credit from this House, as in their opinion 
     <lb/>
     the necessities of the country will demand, 
     <lb/>
     until the period when Parliament may again 
     <lb/>
     be called together. With reference to that, 
     <lb/>
     I would remind the House that the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     supplies have been voted up to the 30th June, 
     <lb/>
     and this will have to be borne in mind in 
     <lb/>
     considering the sum the House will be asked 
     <lb/>
     to vote. The Government will unquestion<lb break="no"/>ably have in view the continuance of the 
     <lb/>
     protection of the frontier. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     As the Hon. Attorney General has stated 
     <lb/>
     the intention of the Government is to 
     <lb/>
     meet Parliament again, so soon as they 
     <lb/>
     are in a position to state to them frankly the 
     <lb/>
     views of the Imperial Government; and 
     <lb/>
     that of course, to a certain extent, depends 
     <lb/>
     on the time during which they may be de<lb break="no"/>layed in London in getting a final answer. 
     <lb/>
     But the intention of the Government is to 
     <lb/>
     lose no time in meeting Parliament again. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—I have a 
     <lb/>
     word or two to say. The Government have 
     <lb/>
     changed their policy so quickly, that we can 
     <lb/>
     now place no reliance on the statements of 
     <lb/>
     Ministers of the Crown. I have not the 
     <lb/>
     slightest doubt that hon. gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches at this moment contem<lb break="no"/>plate—and I ask the attention of the House 
     <lb/>
     to what I am saying, because it is a bold 
     <lb/>
     statement I am to make—I say it is my 
     <lb/>
     deliberate opinion, that if we pass these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, the gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     will go home and find a justification in Eng<lb break="no"/>land for manufacturing a bill of perhaps an 
     <lb/>
     entirely different character, that will cover all 
     <lb/>
     points, and that they will come back and 
     <lb/>
     force that on the people of this country at 
     <lb/>
     all hazards, having embodied in it what<lb break="no"/>ever regulations they please as to schools, 
     <lb/>
     and whether there shall be one House 
     <lb/>
     or two Houses in the Local Parliament, 
     <lb/>
     and all other such matters. I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that that is their plan. They know 
     <lb/>
     well they cannot go to an unwilling people 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="663" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0663.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">663</fw>
      

     with this scheme—they dare not submit it 
     <lb/>
     to the country—and they propose, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     to steal a march on the people, and will 
     <lb/>
     come back with a bill manufactured in 
     <lb/>
     London, as was done in 1840, and press it 
     <lb/>
     on the people of Canada. We know how it 
     <lb/>
     was in 1852 or 1853, when an act came 
     <lb/>
     over to us, making an alteration in our Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, with respect to the increase of 
     <lb/>
     representation in Parliament, of which no 
     <lb/>
     one to this day has been able to trace the 
     <lb/>
     origin. What was done on that occasion 
     <lb/>
     may be done again. They will be met in 
     <lb/>
     England by gentlemen from New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and Nova Scotia, and they will manufacture 
     <lb/>
     there a Constitution for the people of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada—which the people of Canada will be 
     <lb/>
     compelled to take, or else expose themselves 
     <lb/>
     to be called traitors and rebels. They will 
     <lb/>
     come out with the authority of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and invoke the name of the Queen, 
     <lb/>
     and will attempt to impose the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     thus manufactured on all the colonies, stig<lb break="no"/>matising as traitors all who oppose them. 
     <lb/>
     This is not the first time that that game has 
     <lb/>
     been played. Honorable gentlemen, failing 
     <lb/>
     to obtain the assent of an unwilling people 
     <lb/>
     here, will take that course—especially when, 
     <lb/>
     as is well known, the people and Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of England are only too anxious to 
     <lb/>
     throw upon us a large burden for the de<lb break="no"/>fence of this country. Influenced by the 
     <lb/>
     attentions and blandishments they will re<lb break="no"/>ceive in England, Ministers will sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     our interests, and, as the price of it, will 
     <lb/>
     perhaps come back with high-sounding 
     <lb/>
     titles. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—That has been 
     <lb/>
     done already.   
     <lb/>
     
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—And what 
     <lb/>has been done before may be done again. 
     <lb/>They will go to England as if armed, as 
     <lb/>they suppose, with a <hi rendition="simple:italic">carte blanche</hi> from the 
     <lb/>people of this country, because of the adoption 
     <lb/>of the scheme by this House to obtain a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, such as is shadowed forth in these 
     <lb/>resolutions—imperfectly as they themselves 
     <lb/>admit—for Upper and Lower Canada and the 
     <lb/>provinces generally. The English Parliament 
     <lb/>will say, " We have here the best intel<lb break="no"/>lects of the provinces, the leaders of both 
     <lb/>parties, the men who have played their part 
     <lb/>before the country for the last eight or ten 
     <lb/>years, with the confidence of their respective 
     <lb/>parties." But, if they were to read at the 
     <lb/>same time what these leading men have in 
     <lb/>that period said of one another, they might 
     <lb/>
        
    
            <cb/>
          

     well question whether the men who had 
     <lb/>
     branded each other with infamy and dis<lb break="no"/>grace, were the men best fitted to unite in 
     <lb/>
     framing a bill to secure the peace and quiet<lb break="no"/>ness of this country—a measure, in the 
     <lb/>
     language of the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     Oxford (Hon. Mr. BROWN), forever to settle 
     <lb/>
     the difficulties between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear.) I protest vehem<lb break="no"/>ently against these attacks on our rights. I 
     <lb/>
     protest against our being asked thus blindly 
     <lb/>
     to vote away our rights and liberties. How<lb break="no"/>ever clever these gentlemen may be, we know 
     <lb/>
     to our cost what our cleverest financiers 
     <lb/>
     have done and will do again when they get 
     <lb/>
     out of the reach of public opinion, for the 
     <lb/>
     moment. When the country got tired of 
     <lb/>
     them, they entered into this Coalition to 
     <lb/>
     strengthen themselves. These are the men 
     <lb/>
     who will give us a new Constitution made in 
     <lb/>
     England. I do not pretend to has prophet ; 
     <lb/>
     but I ask you, Mr. SPEAKER, to remember, 
     <lb/>
     that I have declared now what is my 
     <lb/>
     deliberate conviction as to the game that 
     <lb/>
     will be played by hon. gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—It does astonish 
     <lb/>
     me that an hon. gentleman in the position 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. member for Cornwall has 
     <lb/>
     occupied for so many years, should deliber<lb break="no"/>ately rise and make such statements as we 
     <lb/>
     have heard from him, after the grave an<lb break="no"/>nouncement made from the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     with the assent of the Governor General of 
     <lb/>
     this province. The hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     been told that the Government intend, if 
     <lb/>
     the House sanction this measure, to carry it 
     <lb/>
     home with the honest intention of giving 
     <lb/>
     effect to it, and of having arrangements 
     <lb/>
     made with reference to the other grave 
     <lb/>
     matters which have to be considered there.

     defence, and the question of the commercial

     <lb/>
     it is the intention that members of the

     <lb/>
     their return, at the earliest possible moment, 
     <lb/>

     sanctioned the making of this announcement 
     <lb/>
     to the House—

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I rise to a point of

     <lb/>
     the House the authority and name of the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I am quite in 
     <lb/>
     order. I apprehend it is quite impossible 
     <lb/>
     that we could have made to the House the 
     <lb/>
     statement with regard to the prorogation, 
     <lb/>
    and the intention of sending members of  
     <lb/>the Government to England, in the way we 
     <lb/>propose, unless we had the direct sanction 
     <lb/>of His Excellency. 
     <lb/>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Of course. With 
     <lb/>
     the duty we owed to His Excellency, it was 
     <lb/>
     impossible we could make such a statement, 
     <lb/>
     without first obtaining His Excellency's 
     <lb/>
     sanction. The hon. gentleman knows it 
     <lb/>
     well, and when he ventured to get up and 
     <lb/>
     make the rash charge that the whole thing 
     <lb/>
     is a trick, to get some scheme entirely 
     <lb/>
     different from this carried through the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament, he assumes a liberty 
     <lb/>
     that is entirely unworthy of a member of 
     <lb/>
     this House. (Hear, hear.) And I can 
     <lb/>
     tell the honorable gentleman and my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Hochelaga, who 
     <lb/>
     are so anxious about the position 
     <lb/>
     which has been taken on this side by 
     <lb/>
     myself and by my hon. friends the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General and the Provincial Secretary—I 
     <lb/>
     can tell them that we are quite alive to the 
     <lb/>
    position in which we are placed, and that we 
     <lb/>have no fear with regard to the course we have 
     <lb/>taken, are now taking, and shall continue to 
     <lb/>take, till this measure is brought to a satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory conclusion, but we will be able to justify 
     <lb/>ourselves in the eyes of those who placed us 
     <lb/>here. (Cheers.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The statement 
     <lb/>
     just made by the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council is one, I conceive, of very great 
     <lb/>
     importance, as it puts a meaning on the 
     <lb/>
     declaration made by the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West, which some of us, at all events 
     <lb/>
     —myself among the rest—did not catch 
     <lb/>
     when the hon. gentleman made his state<lb break="no"/>ment. We are to understand now, by the 
     <lb/>
     declaration of the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, that the Government do not intend 
     <lb/>
     to have anything concluded in this matter 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
      

     of Confederation till the next meeting of 
     <lb/>
     the House.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I did not say any<lb break="no"/>thing of the sort. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Then what was 
     <lb/>
     the point of attack on the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Cornwall? That hon. member indicated 
     <lb/>
     his fear and his belief that a Constitution 
     <lb/>
     would be framed in England, at the instance 
     <lb/>
     and, perhaps, under the supervision of certain 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches, which would prove to be utterly dis<lb break="no"/>tasteful and unpalatable to the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country. And the Hon President of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil gets up and repels that with the greatest 
     <lb/>
     possible indignation. It appears to me that, 
     <lb/>
     if there is any point in his indignation, it 
     <lb/>
     must be here—that some further action is 
     <lb/>
     to be sought from this House before any 
     <lb/>
     effect is given to the question of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. I take it, that is the fair inference 
     <lb/>
     from the statement now made by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council. I ask whether that 
     <lb/>
     is the inference to be deduced—whether that 
     <lb/>
     is what the hon. gentleman meant ? (A 
     <lb/>
     pause.) The honorable gentleman declines 
     <lb/>
     to answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Go on, and finish 
     <lb/>
     your speech. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I would like an 
     <lb/>
     answer now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">HON. MR. GALT</persName>—No, no. Finish your 
     <lb/>
     speech. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman knows well that this is not part of 
     <lb/>
     the regular debate. I did not rise to make a 
     <lb/>
     speech. The Hon. Attorney General West did 
     <lb/>
     not rise to make a speech. No one has done 
     <lb/>
     so. The Hon. Attorney General, on behalf 
     <lb/>
     of the Government, made a statement. That 
     <lb/>
     statement has led to some observations, and 
     <lb/>
     some enquiries, that the House might under<lb break="no"/>stand its full purport. The regular debate is 
     <lb/>
     to be resumed by my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Quebec (Hon. Mr. ALLEYN), who, having 
     <lb/>
     moved its adjournment, is entitled to the floor, 
     <lb/>
     and I should be sorry to keep it from him, 
     <lb/>
     by making a speech. But I want those points 
     <lb/>
     to be clearly understood, for it is in the inter<lb break="no"/>est of all parties that they should be. Though 
     <lb/>
     I do not go quite so far as my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from Cornwall in his observations— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Though I do not 
     <lb/>
     go so far as he has done, yet I thought there 
     <lb/>
     might be some danger, but I look upon the 
     <lb/>
     statement made by the Hon. President of the

     Council, and the indignation with which he 
     <lb/>
     repelled the charge of my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Cornwall, as calculated to reassure the 
     <lb/>
     House. And I merely rose for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     asking honorable gentlemen whether we are 
     <lb/>
     really to understand from the supplementary 
     <lb/>
     statement made on behalf of the Government 
     <lb/>
     by the Hon. President of the Council, that 
     <lb/>
     the further consideration of this House is to 
     <lb/>
     be invited to all these measures—to the new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution for the country, as well as the 
     <lb/>
     arrangements that may be come to with 
     <lb/>
     respect to our defences, and with respect to 
     <lb/>
     our commercial relations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—If I 
     <lb/>
     supposed for a moment that the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Chateauguay really required an 
     <lb/>
     answer, he should get it. I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. President of the Council would 
     <lb/>
     gladly give an answer, if he really thought he 
     <lb/>
     had any information to give to the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman. But no one understands better 
     <lb/>
     than the honorable member for Chateauguay 
     <lb/>
     the way in which the case was put. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Cornwall (Hon. J. S. 
     <lb/>
     MACDONALD) rose, and in rather an un<lb break="no"/>parliamentary way—after a statement had 
     <lb/>
     been formally made to inform the House and 
     <lb/>
     the country what was the policy of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment—upon his honor declared his belief 
     <lb/>
     that the Government were not sincere in the 
     <lb/>
     explanations they had made, and that their 
     <lb/>
     design was to get a bill passed by the Impe<lb break="no"/>rial Parliament, contrary to the feelings of 
     <lb/>
     this country and of the Lower Provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     to force that upon the people. That was the 
     <lb/>
     declaration of the honorable gentleman. I do 
     <lb/>
     not know if he was sincere in making it. He 
     <lb/>
     seemed to be sincere, and pledged his honor 
     <lb/>
     and his conscience to it. (Laughter.) But 
     <lb/>
     his doing so only convinces me, that, if he 
     <lb/>
     had been in office himself, that is the course 
     <lb/>
     he would have adopted ; no such suggestion 
     <lb/>
     would have risen to any man's mind, unless 
     <lb/>
     he had thought it a feasible one. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) For our part we do not consider such 
     <lb/>
     a course to be in accordance with our position 
     <lb/>
     in this House, or in accordance with our 
     <lb/>
     principles as men of honor ; and the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council rose to repel the dis<lb break="no"/>honoring insinuation with that just indigna<lb break="no"/>tion which was felt by every man who heard 
     <lb/>
     it, and to declare that the belief of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman was utterly untrue, un<lb break="no"/>founded, and unwarranted. But I shall re<lb break="no"/>peat the anouncement in a way that it may be 
     <lb/>
     understood by the hon. member for Cornwall 
     <lb/>
     —in language that will be plain to the meanest 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     capacity— (laughter) — so that no man can 
     <lb/>
     mistake it. Our intention is to get the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of this House to the Address I 
     <lb/>
     have moved, and this having been done, 
     <lb/>
     the two branches of the Legislature will have 
     <lb/>
     given their votes in favor of the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion scheme, and there is the end to that, so 
     <lb/>
     far as Canada is concerned. We will then 
     <lb/>
     go over to England with that in our hands, 
     <lb/>
     and will say to the Imperial Government :— 
     <lb/>
     " Canada has agreed to this, New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     has not agreed to it, and we wish to take 
     <lb/>
     counsel with the Imperial Government as to 
     <lb/>
     our position. This is the unmistakable voice 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Canada through their  repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, and we, as representing the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada, which has three-fourths 
     <lb/>
     of the whole population of the provinces, come 
     <lb/>
     to consult with the authorities of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country what is best for the interests of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces." (Hear, hear.) We shall also 
     <lb/>
     discuss the question of defence, and, I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt, we shall be met in a most large<lb break="no"/>hearted and liberal spirit by the English Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and that England will now, in jus<lb break="no"/>tice to Canada, pledge herself to her utmost 
     <lb/>
     resources in men and money for our defence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Then there is a third ques<lb break="no"/>tion—that of the Reciprocity treaty ; and we 
     <lb/>
     will also take counsel with the British Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment as to the best means of treating that 
     <lb/>
     subject. And the honorable gentleman knows 
     <lb/>
     —at least he ought to know, for I cannot an<lb break="no"/>swer for the limits of his understanding—that 
     <lb/>
     we can only discuss that through Imperial 
     <lb/>
     avenues, that we can have no direct commu<lb break="no"/>nication in such matters with the American 
     <lb/>
     Government. Having taken counsel with the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government on those three points, 
     <lb/>
     we shall call the House together at the ear<lb break="no"/>liest period, I hope long before the current 
     <lb/>
     half-year terminates, that is, before the 30th 
     <lb/>
     June. We will submit the result of our mis<lb break="no"/>sion, and it will then be before the House for 
     <lb/>
     discussion. Though another session, it will 
     <lb/>
     be in effect a continuation of this session, and 
     <lb/>
     when we have debated and disposed of the 
     <lb/>
     most pressing subjects, we will then take up 
     <lb/>
     what remains of the Confederation scheme— 
     <lb/>
     such as the constitution of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments and the school question, with regard to 
     <lb/>
     which, as the Hon. Minister of Finance has 
     <lb/>
     stated, we shall propose to carry out to the 
     <lb/>
     letter the pledges we gave at the Conference, 
     <lb/>
     and which we ask the House to endorse, and 
     <lb/>
     hope it will. (Hear, hear.) We will also 
     <lb/>
     submit the result of our negotiations on the 
     <lb/>
     question of defence, and on all those matters 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="666" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0666.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">666</fw>
   

     connected with the relations between Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain and the United States, so far as Brit<lb break="no"/>ish America is concerned, and on which we 
     <lb/>
     are authorized to take action by the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     authorities. We cannot know at what stage 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations between the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and the United States Government 
     <lb/>
     may have arrived when the House meets 
     <lb/>
     again ; but the result of the mission of 
     <lb/>
     those members of the Canadian Government 
     <lb/>
     who go home, will be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     House. We shall lay before the House all 
     <lb/>
     that the British Government resolve upon, 
     <lb/>
     after hearing what we have to say as to 
     <lb/>
     the question of Confederation in its general 
     <lb/>
     aspect, and in its relation to the position it 
     <lb/>
     may have assumed in the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     We shall then lay before the House the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of the local governments for the 
     <lb/>
     two Canadas. We shall lay before them the 
     <lb/>
     action necessary to be taken with reference to 
     <lb/>
     the School question, the matter of defence and 
     <lb/>
     the Reciprocity treaty. The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Cornwall gets up, and, because he 
     <lb/>
     finds the Government, are resolved to take 
     <lb/>
     a firm and proper course in this matter, he 
     <lb/>
     chooses to throw improper and insulting 
     <lb/>
     remarks across the floor. But the House has 
     <lb/>
     learned what value is to be attached to the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman's statements, when a 
     <lb/>
     little while ago it heard him—an honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who professes to be such a patriot 
     <lb/>
     —stating, with reference to this scheme, in 
     <lb/>
     favor of which a large majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada had declared, that he had a " mis<lb break="no"/>chievous satisfaction " in seeing it checked. 
     <lb/>
     It was in the same spirit of causeless, sense<lb break="no"/>less mischief that he got up to prophecy all 
     <lb/>
     sorts of improper conduct on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     Government. (Hear, hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Whatever

     views may be entertained by the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West of my capacity, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose I have got along in my own way as he 
     <lb/>
    has got along in his way. But I think the 
     <lb/>House may thank me for having obtained at 
     <lb/>last—notwithstanding the castigation the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman has dealt out to me, and 
     <lb/>which I hope I shall be able to survive, as I 
     <lb/>have borne up heretofore under similar aval<lb break="no"/>anches of hard words about my want of judg<lb break="no"/>ment, want of capacity, and so forth—I think 
     <lb/>the House may thank me for having obtained 
     <lb/>at last from the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>the explicit statement he has made, that the 
     <lb/>scheme is to come back again for the consider<lb break="no"/>ation of this House.

     Attorney General West did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—He said—if 
     <lb/>
     not the scheme itself—that all the arrange<lb break="no"/>ments connected with it, as to the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments, the proportions we are to assume of 
     <lb/>
     the defence of the country, and the School 
     <lb/>
     question—which the Honorable Finance Min<lb break="no"/>ister told us, but for this untoward affair in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, would have been submitted 
     <lb/>
     before this session closed—that all these things 
     <lb/>
     will be brought back and be submitted next 
     <lb/>
     session, before the Confederation scheme is 
     <lb/>
     finally concluded. This was not so explicitly 
     <lb/>
     stated in the honorable gentleman's first speech. 
     <lb/>
     I have been accused of being so unpatriotic as 
     <lb/>
     to take a mischievous pleasure in any check 
     <lb/>
     upon the scheme. What I said was, that I 
     <lb/>
     had mischievous pleasure in seeing that the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman who had charged the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government with bad faith had been 
     <lb/>
     defeated and ousted from his place. And I 
     <lb/>
     say that, if this scheme were likely to prove 
     <lb/>
     for the advantage of the people of this province, 
     <lb/>
     no one would rejoice more than I in seeing it 
     <lb/>
     carried. But I have always felt, and do now 
     <lb/>
     feel, that the Constitution of this country can 
     <lb/>
     be well worked out. I have never given a 
     <lb/>
     vote for Federation. I have never given a 
     <lb/>
     vote for a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">AN HON. MEMBER</persName>—Or for annexation.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—No ; I did 
     <lb/>
     not sign the annexation manifesto. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) I have not assented or 
     <lb/>
     given countenance to any scheme for changing 
     <lb/>
     our present Constitution, and it is not right 
     <lb/>
     for the honorable gentleman, because I do 
     <lb/>
     not choose to assent to this scheme without 
     <lb/>
     knowing all the details, to taunt me with 
     <lb/>
     being unpatriotic. (Hear, hear.) The hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman would have the House 
     <lb/>
     to understand that I was ignorant of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that this Government could not deal directly 
     <lb/>
     with the American Government with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the Reciprocity treaty. And yet in the 
     <lb/>
     face of this charge, he must have known that 
     <lb/>
     the only record which an Address of this 
     <lb/>
     House brought down the other day was a 
     <lb/>
     Minute of Council addressed to the Secretary 
     <lb/>
     of State by myself and colleagues, on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of reciprocity.

     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—They have

     done nothing since, of course. We were attacked 
     <lb/>
     by the Hon. President of the Council because 
     <lb/>
     we did nothing with regard to the Reciprocity

tleman is entirely mistaken. He is thinking 
     <lb/>
     of the time when I privately urged upon him, 
     <lb/>
     as Prime Minister, the necessity of taking 
     <lb/>
     steps, and prompt steps, for ascertaining what 
     <lb/>
     was the mind of the Washington Government, 
     <lb/>
     and whether or not a new treaty could be 
     <lb/>
     negotiated. He explained to me the obstacle 
     <lb/>
     that stood in his way ; and, though I con<lb break="no"/>sidered the difficulties in his way ought to 
     <lb/>
     have been overcome, yet the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     were such that I never blamed him.

     we could in the way of making representations

     to the Imperial Government. And what have

     honorable gentlemen opposite done since ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—We have been acting

     in the same direction ever since, and I think 
     <lb/>
     it would have been well for the interests of 
     <lb/>
     this country if we had not been fettered as we 
     <lb/>
     have been.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Well, I say 
     <lb/>
     that this explanation of the Honorable Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General is more explicit and much more 
     <lb/>
     elaborate than the explanation we had from 
     <lb/>
     him in the first instance. In commenting 
     <lb/>
     upon that first explanation, I hope I did not 
     <lb/>
     make use of unparliamentary language. But 
     <lb/>
     I am entitled surely to draw deductions from 
     <lb/>
     the announcements made to us from the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches, and I am not bound to 
     <lb/>
     mince matters if I feel alarmed at the conse<lb break="no"/>quences which may result from the giving of 
     <lb/>
     this dreadful blow to the Constitution we 
     <lb/>
     have so long lived under. It is surely not 
     <lb/>
     unseemly that I should feel keenly on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, and that, before the Constitution to 
     <lb/>
     which I am sincerely attached is swept away, 
     <lb/>
     I should express that indignation which I may 
     <lb/>
     have expressed somewhat warmly this after<lb break="no"/>noon. (Hear, hear.) Much stronger lan<lb break="no"/>guage has been expressed on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House, when the motives of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the Treasury benches have been 
     <lb/>
     questioned by honorable gentlemen whose 
     <lb/>
     intellect perhaps as far transcends mine as day 
     <lb/>
     outshines night. (Laughter.)  But I think 
     <lb/>
     the country and the House will yet thank me 
     <lb/>
     for stating, even in the earnest manner I did, 
     <lb/>
     my alarm in connection with this matter. 
     <lb/>
     At all events, I have a sincere belief in the 
     <lb/>
     truth of what I stated. (Hear, hear.)

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—The explanations 
     <lb/>
     given to-day by the Honorable Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral West are fuller than those at first given ; 
     <lb/>
     yet I am afraid that there is still some mis<lb break="no"/>understanding.  The Honorable Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West stated that the scheme for the 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
        

     constitution of the local governments would 
     <lb/>
     be submitted to the House next session. Is 
     <lb/>
     it the intention of the Government, or the 
     <lb/>
     delegation when in England, to press the 
     <lb/>
     scheme upon the Imperial Government with<lb break="no"/>out the concurrence of the Lower Provinces ? 
     <lb/>
     If the Lower Provinces do not come in, will 
     <lb/>
     the Government press the adoption of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme so as to apply it to the two provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Canada ? For, if I understood the Hon<lb break="no"/>orable Attorney General West, he said that 
     <lb/>
     next session they will bring in the constitu<lb break="no"/>tions of the local legislatures. Now, if they 
     <lb/>
     are not to press the scheme at all, there would 
     <lb/>
     be no necessity for local legislatures. (Hear, 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—I de<lb break="no"/>sire simply to state, as I have said before, that 
     <lb/>
     after these resolutions are carried, those who 
     <lb/>
     go to confer with the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     will doubtless adopt such steps as they think 
     <lb/>
     are best suited to us. (Hear, hear, and 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">MR. RANKIN</persName>—I feel obliged to the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Cornwall if he elicited the 
     <lb/>explanations just given, though I cannot ap<lb break="no"/>prove of what he said otherwise. To me the 
     <lb/>intelligence is most acceptable. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>I learn that it is the intention of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to go on without regard to the action of 
     <lb/>the Lower Provinces, and to press this meas<lb break="no"/>ure through without being influenced by the 
     <lb/>action of New Brunswick. I hold that it is 
     <lb/>common sense for us to remember that we are 
     <lb/>considering the interests of the people at 
     <lb/>large, and this scheme, if acceptable to the 
     <lb/>people of Canada, is acceptable to four-fifths 
     <lb/>of the people of British North America.— 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) It must be evident to the mean<lb break="no"/>est capacity—to make use of the words of the 
     <lb/>Honorable Attorney General West a few min<lb break="no"/>utes ago—that one of two destinies awaits us : 
     <lb/>either we must extend and strengthen British 
     <lb/>influence and British power on this continent, 
     <lb/>or these provinces must, one by one, be ab<lb break="no"/>sorbed by the neighboring republic. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) That has been my opinion for years, 
     <lb/>and it is my opinion still. However, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, I simply rose for the purpose of 
     <lb/>soliciting more distinct information upon one 
     <lb/>point on which I have heard nothing said, al<lb break="no"/>though the explanations may have been given 
     <lb/>before I came into the House. I wish to 
     <lb/>know what is the intention of the Government 
     <lb/>with reference to the volunteers now on the 
     <lb/>frontier,—whether they have provided the 
     <lb/>means to maintain this force, if required, be<lb break="no"/>yond the 1st of May next ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RANK1">MR. RANKIN</persName>—I only hope the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will ask the House for means to keep up

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GIBB1">Mr. GIBBS</persName>—I think that the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the Government, as announced to-day by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General West, is bold, manly, 
     <lb/>
     and straightforward, and such as will entitle 
     <lb/>
     them to the confidence of this House and of 
     <lb/>
     the country. (Hear, hear.) It shows that 
     <lb/>
     they, at least, are in earnest on this great 
     <lb/>
     question of Confederation which they have 
     <lb/>
     introduced, and whatever may have been the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the Opposition as to the motive 
     <lb/>
     which induced them to lay this measure 
     <lb/>
     before the House at the opening of the ses<lb break="no"/>sion, I think it must be utterly dispelled by 
     <lb/>
     the announcement just made to the House. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) If the scheme was worth any<lb break="no"/>thing when the Government, in the opening 
     <lb/>
     Speech this session, declared its intention of 
     <lb/>
     asking the consideration of the House for 1t, 
     <lb/>
     the same scheme must be worth as much 
     <lb/>
     now, and I trust that none of the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     which may for a moment interpose, will pre<lb break="no"/>vent the Administration from carrying it 
     <lb/>
     through. (Hear, hear.) It has been said 
     <lb/>
     that the measure which they should have 
     <lb/>
     brought down was the smaller one, whilst 
     <lb/>
     they have introduced the larger. Now, sir, I 
     <lb/>
     hold that the greater always includes the less; 
     <lb/>
     and that the Government, instead of being 
     <lb/>
     blamed for the course they have taken, are en<lb break="no"/>titled to the thanks of this House for bring<lb break="no"/>ing down the more important one at the out<lb break="no"/>set. (Hear, hear.) It is not often that ques<lb break="no"/>tions of the importance of that now before the 
     <lb/>
     House are carried without considerable oppo<lb break="no"/>sition. I need only refer, as an example, to 
     <lb/>
     that of the Clergy Reserves, during the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of which there were fights, fierce and 
     <lb/>
     numerous, lasting for many years, until the 
     <lb/>
     measure was carried at last. And now, as we 
     <lb/>
     are about to obtain what Upper Canada has 
     <lb/>
     sought for years—representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion—we find, unfortunately, difficulties inter<lb break="no"/>posing; but I hope that notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     these, the Government will not falter, but will 
     <lb/>
     carry out the wish of the majority of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House and of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and consummate the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     uniting the British North American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. (Hear, hear.) I am very happy to 
     <lb/>
     find that the Government have taken into 
     <lb/>
     consideration the negotiations on reciprocal 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
      

     trade with the United States. That is a most 
     <lb/>
     important question, and I should have been 
     <lb/>
     glad, for that alone, if the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     scheme had been carried out successfully, 
     <lb/>
     because it would have been much easier to 
     <lb/>
     discuss the matter through the British <choice><sic>Gov<lb break="no"/>ment</sic><corr>Government</corr></choice> by means of representatives from the 
     <lb/>
     General Confederacy, than by representatives 
     <lb/>
     from the various disunited provinces. Now 
     <lb/>
     I say, Mr. SPEAKER, that the course the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment have pursued must inspire confidence 
     <lb/>
     in them on the part of their supporters, and I 
     <lb/>
     believe that the country will approve of it too. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I hope they will relax no 
     <lb/>
     effort to see the scheme carried to completion. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:PARK2">DR. PARKER</persName>—If I understand cor<lb break="no"/>rectly the statement just made by the 
     <lb/>
     Government, they propose to send a delega<lb break="no"/>tion to England for the purpose of discussing 
     <lb/>
     the three questions of the Reciprocity treaty, 
     <lb/>
     the defences, and the scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion now before the House. The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General says that the question of 
     <lb/>
     the defences is very pressing, and that 
     <lb/>
     immediate action should also be taken with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the Reciprocity treaty. If these 
     <lb/>
     subjects are so pressing, they should be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with at once, irrespective of whether this 
     <lb/>
     scheme is carried or not. (Hear, hear.) A 
     <lb/>
     period of constitutional changes is most 
     <lb/>
     unfavorable for the proper consideration of 
     <lb/>
     these questions; and if the necessity is as 
     <lb/>
     urgent as represented, they should be taken 
     <lb/>
     up and considered at once, even in advance 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation. Earl RUSSELL, then Lord 
     <lb/>
     JOHN RUSSELL, was severely ridiculed by the 
     <lb/>
     British press because he introduced a Reform 
     <lb/>
     bill during the Crimean war. I deprecate 
     <lb/>
     most strongly the attempt made to coerce 
     <lb/>
     constitutional changes upon this House 
     <lb/>
     and the country under the pressure of 
     <lb/>
     danger and coming war. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     He is no friend of Canada who is constantly 
     <lb/>
     creating alarm and raising the cuckoo cry 
     <lb/>
     of loyalty. (Hear, hear.) This Government 
     <lb/>
     was formed for the express purpose of dis<lb break="no"/>covering a remedy for our constitutional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, and I hold them to that engage<lb break="no"/>ment. This scheme is to unite the whole of 
     <lb/>
     the British North American Colonies; and 
     <lb/>
     if the treaty is adopted by the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government, if an Imperial Act is passed 
     <lb/>
     on the basis of these resolutions, and the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces persist in their present 
     <lb/>
     refusal to come in, in what position are we 
     <lb/>
     then placed? Is this plan of Federation to 
     <lb/>
     be applied to the two Canadas? Sir, this is 
     <lb/>

     not the constitutional remedy we desired 
     <lb/>
     and sought? And I ask the House if it is 
     <lb/>
     prepared to accept this union for ourselves? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I think that the Government 
     <lb/>
     should have confined themselves simply to 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional question, and should not 
     <lb/>
     have tacked on to it our commercial and 
     <lb/>
     defensive relations, for the purpose of ob<lb break="no"/>taining a little prestige. They have not 
     <lb/>
     put the question before Parliament fairly, 
     <lb/>
     or as it has been placed before the legis<lb break="no"/>latures of any of the other provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     think the House should look at the question 
     <lb/>
     in this way—is an Imperial Act to be 
     <lb/>
     passed, establishing a Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     two Canadas on the basis of these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions? I am not prepared to accept that as 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional remedy. I do not want 
     <lb/>
     it in that form. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. MCGEE</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has just sat down says that we have 
     <lb/>
     put this question before the House as it has 
     <lb/>
     not been put in any of the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Now, my information, which perhaps is as 
     <lb/>
     correct as his, leads me to believe that the 
     <lb/>
     same course has been pursued here as has 
     <lb/>
     been or will be adopted in three of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces—Newfoundland, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, and Nova Scotia. The last inform<lb break="no"/>ation received shows that there is, as I am 
     <lb/>
     informed, a fair chance of the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     being adopted in Newfoundland. In Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia the resolutions were brought down by 
     <lb/>
     the Provincial Secretary, and it was then 
     <lb/>
     stated that the adoption of the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     would be moved, on a future day. So Dr. 
     <lb/>
     TUPPER, the Provincial Secretary, stated. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PARK2">DR. PARKER</persName>—Read His Excellency's 
     <lb/>
     Speech.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. MCGEE</persName>—Well, it was a very 
     <lb/>
     proper one. But the hon. gentleman will 
     <lb/>
     see that out of the four provinces he is wrong 
     <lb/>
     in regard to three of them. Then, my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the member for North Hastings (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     T. C. WALLBRIDGE) repudiated the idea 
     <lb/>
     that American influence had anything to do 
     <lb/>
     with the result of the elections in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick. Now, I may say to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend that one of the successful candidates 
     <lb/>
     is the agent of the American line of steamers 
     <lb/>
     —the International line—which does all the 
     <lb/>
     carrying trade to New Brunswick; and there 
     <lb/>
     is not, I am told, a pound of the stock of 
     <lb/>
     that company held in New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Does any one suppose that 
     <lb/>
     the influence of that company was not used 
     <lb/>
     for his election? Both steamboat and rail<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
      
way, and mining and fishery influences were 
     <lb/>
     brought to bear; and I think it will not be 
     <lb/>
     saying too much—and I have no hesitation 
     <lb/>
     in saying, for my part—that in that portion 
     <lb/>
     of the country, as well as in others, that the 
     <lb/>
     fight was between parties pro-Yankee and 
     <lb/>
     pro-British. It was a fair stand-up fight of 
     <lb/>
     Yankee interests on the one side and British 
     <lb/>
     interests on the other; and those who are 
     <lb/>
     here ungenerously and unwisely rejoicing over 
     <lb/>
     the defeat of Hon. Mr. TILLEY, are in reality 
     <lb/>
     rejoicing in the triumph of Yankee interests. 
     <lb/>
     I state this from the knowledge I have 
     <lb/>
     obtained from ten different visits to that 
     <lb/>
     country, and I am quite sure, if my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend had been there all the times that I 
     <lb/>
     have been, and had the same opportunities 
     <lb/>
     for observation, that he would understand that 
     <lb/>
     there are influences there quite apart from the 
     <lb/>
     real merits of Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Among other cries, Hon. Mr. TILLEY was 
     <lb/>
     assailed because it was said that Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     MACDONALD had stated the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway could not be made—as of course a 
     <lb/>
     railway could not be made—a part of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. That is a sample of the cries 
     <lb/>
     against Hon. Mr. TILLEY. ln fact, it was a 
     <lb/>
     contest between prejudice and patriotism; be<lb break="no"/>tween ignorance and intelligence; between 
     <lb/>
     Yankee influence and the broad principles 
     <lb/>
     of British North American policy. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Those who rejoice over that 
     <lb/>
     state of things may congratulate themselves 
     <lb/>
     if they choose, but it is for us to stand by the 
     <lb/>
     true public opinion of the country; it is for 
     <lb/>
     us to show an example of firmness and good 
     <lb/>
     faith in carrying out this scheme; it is for 
     <lb/>
     us to show the rest of the Empire that we 
     <lb/>
     are determined to adhere to our original 
     <lb/>
     resolution, and that we are not a people who 
     <lb/>
     do not know our own minds for three weeks, 
     <lb/>
     and make proposals one day or one week to 
     <lb/>
     breathe them down the next. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am sure if my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     North Hastings only knew that country as 
     <lb/>
     well as I do, that he would come to the same 
     <lb/>
     conclusions.

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ALLE1">HON. MR. ALLEYN</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     those whose fortune it has been to sit since 
     <lb/>
     1854 in the reformed Legislature of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     have had to deal with and settle matters of 
     <lb/>
     the highest importance to the province. 
     <lb/>
     Questions which in other and older lands 
     <lb/>
     have loosened the bonds of society, have 
     <lb/>
     caused bloodshed and almost led to anarchy, 
     <lb/>
     such as our Seigniorial Tenure and Clergy 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="670" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0670.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">670</fw>
        

     Reserve Acts, have been finally and peace<lb break="no"/>ably disposed of, not possibly without injus<lb break="no"/>tice to a few, but certainly to the satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     of the community at large. Yet all those 
     <lb/>
     things, though of the greatest importance 
     <lb/>
     to us in Canada, sink into insignificance 
     <lb/>
     in comparison with that now before this 
     <lb/>
     House. While they related to our own 
     <lb/>
     affairs only, and were designed to pro<lb break="no"/>mote the peaceful working of our own 
     <lb/>
     province, the question which we have 
     <lb/>
     now to pronounce upon concerns and relates 
     <lb/>
     to a Constitution for all the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America, and for a country 
     <lb/>
     which may eventually comprise half a con<lb break="no"/>tinent, and extend in one unbroken chain 
     <lb/>from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. 
     <lb/> (Cheers.) But although the consideration 
     <lb/>of this great question has consumed a good 
     <lb/>deal of the time of this House, and 
     <lb/>though it is one of such great importance, 
     <lb/>and so wide in its extent that it does 
     <lb/>not excite those strong personal and party 
     <lb/>feelings in the minds of honorable members 
     <lb/>which much less important questions, of 
     <lb/>a more local nature, generally excite, still, 
     <lb/>sir, I think there is no one who looks 
     <lb/>at the future of this country for which we 
     <lb/>are called upon to act, who can avoid coming 
     <lb/>to the conclusion that the question is one 
     <lb/>deserving of so much deliberate considera<lb break="no"/>tion at our hands, that no amount of time 
     <lb/>can be considered wasted in debating and 
     <lb/>deciding upon it. Yet Mr. SPEAKER, this 
     <lb/>is no new question. It has been brought 
     <lb/>up several times in Parliament, and before 
     <lb/>the people, and has occupied the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of our ablest men, more or less, for 
     <lb/>the past forty or fifty years. It has been 
     <lb/>presented, theoretically, to the minds of the 
     <lb/>public of every province in British North 
     <lb/>America, in articles and pamphlets that have 
     <lb/>been written upon it ; but now for the first 
     <lb/>time, by an extraordinary combination of 
     <lb/>events such as may never occur again, it 
     <lb/>presents itself to those empowered to deal 
     <lb/>with it practically and to give it life and 
     <lb/>vitality. (Hear, hear.) We have a great re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility resting upon us with reference to 
     <lb/>the decision we shall come to on this impor<lb break="no"/>tant question. When I say that there 
     <lb/>has been an extraordinary combination of 
     <lb/>events, I think not the least extraordinary was 
     <lb/>the coming together of the leading men from 
     <lb/>all parts of the provinces, entertaining widely 
     <lb/>different and hostile views, yet determining 
     <lb/>to keep those views in abeyance while they 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     devised a scheme for the benefit of our com<lb break="no"/>mon country. When before has the spectacle 
     <lb/>
     been witnessed of the leaders of adverse 
     <lb/>
     political camps surrendering that advantage 
     <lb/>
     which a resistance to any great change must 
     <lb/>
     always give in party politics, and meeting 
     <lb/>
     together to settle upon a common ground of 
     <lb/>
     action ? This we saw last summer in the 
     <lb/>
     meeting of the delegates from all the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Many of these gentlemen must have known 
     <lb/>
     that they risked their political positions, and 
     <lb/>
     we now know it in a practical way. But far 
     <lb/>
     better for a public man to be defeated in a 
     <lb/>
     great cause than to succeed in a bad one. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We cannot look upon the 
     <lb/>
     action of those men without conceding to 
     <lb/>
     them, first of all, a great amount of credit for 
     <lb/>
     the honorable and patriotic spirit which they 
     <lb/>
     evinced. Whatever views we may hold of 
     <lb/>
     their judgment, it must be conceded on all 
     <lb/>
     hands that their conduct deserves a high 
     <lb/>
     mood of praise. (Hear, hear.) But when 
     <lb/>
     we see this question taken up in all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and receiving so much attention 
     <lb/>
     in England, and even in other portions of 
     <lb/>
     Europe, in so short a period of time, I think 
     <lb/>
     we must feel that there must be some great 
     <lb/>
     overruling cause at work to induce so vast 
     <lb/>
     an amount of attention to be given to the 
     <lb/>
     subject. I have examined the question 
     <lb/>
     carefully in this aspect, and I venture to 
     <lb/>
     express an opinion respecting the cause, 
     <lb/>
     by reference to the history of nations. I 
     <lb/>
     recollect in a speech from Lord MACAULAY, 
     <lb/>
     in addressing the University of Aberdeen 
     <lb/>
     I think it was, speaking of the events of 
     <lb/>
     1848, the remark occurs that since the inva<lb break="no"/>sion of the Huns civilization never ran such 
     <lb/>
     risks as in that year. (Hear, hear.) Its 
     <lb/>
     dangers passed away, but the results remain. 
     <lb/>
     The wave which threatened to submerge, 
     <lb/>
     obeying a natural law, retired beyond low- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     water mark, and has left exposed more than 
     <lb/>
     one coast. Small nations seem not to be 
     <lb/>
     considered, the faith of treaties is laughed 
     <lb/>
     at, and in this boasted age of civilization the 
     <lb/>
     doctrine that might is right prevails as 
     <lb/>
     strongly as in the seventeenth century. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The Danes, a brave and Vir<lb break="no"/>tuous people, have been exposed to a hopeless 
     <lb/>
     war with Austria and Prussia, chiefs of the 
     <lb/>
     Teutonic race, while England and France 
     <lb/>
     remonstrated, by words and proto cols, but 
     <lb/>
     acted not. The iron heel of Russia has crushed 
     <lb/>
     out the last sparks of freedom in Poland— 
     <lb/>
     long-suffering Poland, for whom so much 
     <lb/>
     sentiment has been expended, and free En<lb break="no"/>

gland and generous France stood silent 
     <lb/>
     lookers on. (Hear, hear.) From the Caucasus 
     <lb/>
     we have had the exodus of a nation from the 
     <lb/>
     land they defended for centuries, in bitter 
     <lb/>
     pilgrimage, losing thousands and tens of 
     <lb/>
     thousands on the way, to seek in the wilds 
     <lb/>
     of Asia for subsistence and freedom. On this 
     <lb/>
     continent the great nation which adjoins us 
     <lb/>
     has resorted to the bitter arbitrament of the 
     <lb/>
     sword, and an internecine and deplorable 
     <lb/>
     combat is being waged on a scale unknown 
     <lb/>
     since the Russian campaign and the great 
     <lb/>
     Napoleonic wars. These things, according to 
     <lb/>
     the stern rules of statecraft, may be right, 
     <lb/>
     and nations possibly cannot break the hard 
     <lb/>
     law of non-intervention ; but when we see 
     <lb/>
     such events passing around us, must we not 
     <lb/>
     come to the conclusion that power must of 
     <lb/>
     necessity increase and encroach, or that it is 
     <lb/>
     as unreasonable now as it ever has been, and 
     <lb/>
     that pure justice and abstract right, without 
     <lb/>
     armed battalions to support them, will neither 
     <lb/>
     preserve integrity of territory nor secure pro<lb break="no"/>tection of person. Again, in the discoveries in 
     <lb/>
     the arts and sciences, we can perceive how 
     <lb/>
     much the power of great states have become 
     <lb/>
     increased as compared with the smaller ones. 
     <lb/>
     The telegraph has annihilated time, railroads 
     <lb/>
     and steamers have devoured space. War can 
     <lb/>
     only be waged by nations possessing vast 
     <lb/>
     resources in money, warlike engines and 
     <lb/>
     materials. One iron-clad man-of-war, with 
     <lb/>
     her complement of Armstrong guns, would 
     <lb/>
     cost the year's revenue of a province. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And if we look around us we see this 
     <lb/>
     principle of territorial aggrandizement, this 
     <lb/>
     gathering together of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">disjecta membra</hi> of 
     <lb/>
     nations ; this girding up of the loins of em<lb break="no"/>pires for coming events is steadily carried 
     <lb/>
     out. The principle of centralization is ra<lb break="no"/>pidly going on, is pressing together the great 
     <lb/>
     nations, and rendering it necessary for smaller 
     <lb/>
     nations and provinces to unite, and cen<lb break="no"/>tralize for their common defence. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The subject is not one of theory, 
     <lb/>
     but of fact. Look at Italy, such a short time 
     <lb/>
     ago a weak and scattered congeries of states, 
     <lb/>
     now united into one powerful government. 
     <lb/>
     VICTOR EMMANUEL is King of some twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     five millions of people ; France has Nice 
     <lb/>
     and Savoy and possibly a portion of Central 
     <lb/>
     America; Prussia and Austria have robbed 
     <lb/>
     Denmark; Russia has absorbed the Caucasus 
     <lb/>
     and is advancing into Central Asia; Mexico 
     <lb/>
     is springing  into a powerful empire; the 
     <lb/>
     United States are, in men and the materials 
     <lb/>
     of war, showing a power which the world has 
     <lb/>
     seldom seen excelled. Such things passing 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     round us, it would ill become us not seriously 
     <lb/>
     to consider our position, and, if possible, profit 
     <lb/>
     by the occasion. (Cheers) What I have 
     <lb/>
     already said applies to all the provinces and 
     <lb/>
     to all small powers; but we in Canada have 
     <lb/>
     had peculiar difficulties of our own. Usually 
     <lb/>
     great questions strengthen governments. 
     <lb/>
     Aaron's rod swallows up the rods of the magi<lb break="no"/>cians; but, though we have settled great ques<lb break="no"/>tions, our governments have fallen like houses 
     <lb/>
     of cards. Coalition and party governments 
     <lb/>
     alike have met the same fate, and it had 
     <lb/>
     become seriously to be considered as to 
     <lb/>
     whether responsible government was not a 
     <lb/>
     failure in Canada. Before the cry for an 
     <lb/>
     increased representation for Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     several of our best public men were driven 
     <lb/>
     from political life; and it must have become 
     <lb/>
     clear to those who watched events that there 
     <lb/>
     must soon have been a readjustment of the 
     <lb/>
     representation based partly, at least, on 
     <lb/>
     numbers, or a dissolution of the union. I 
     <lb/>
     think, sir, that those who have read and 
     <lb/>
     profited by the events of the past, and have 
     <lb/>
     considered what is likely to occur in the 
     <lb/>
     future, must be satisfied that a repeal of the 
     <lb/>
     union between Upper and Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     would be a very great misfortune. And as 
     <lb/>
     to representation according to population, 
     <lb/>
     the appeals to prejudices and passions, and 
     <lb/>
     possibly well grounded fears which must 
     <lb/>
     result from granting that to Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     would be must disastrous. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We should have had, in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     a very large amount of discontent and 
     <lb/>
     even disaffection; and, therefore, I con<lb break="no"/>sider it a great advantage to Canada that 
     <lb/>
     the adoption of Confederation will meet these 
     <lb/>
     difficulties without causing the discontent 
     <lb/>
     and disaffection which either of the above 
     <lb/>
     measures would inevitably arouse. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, I may be asked, will these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, if united, become a great power? 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I shall frankly answer that I think 
     <lb/>
     not at present, nor will I venture to predict 
     <lb/>
     what the future has in store for us; but I 
     <lb/>
     think thereby we obtain a greater chance of 
     <lb/>
     obviating the evils to which I have referred, 
     <lb/>
     and we in Canada shall also overcome our 
     <lb/>
     peculiar difficulties — and this I say, that 
     <lb/>
     united, we shall possess advantages which 
     <lb/>
     separate, though portions of the same empire, 
     <lb/>
     we cannot realize. (Cheers.) We shall be 
     <lb/>
     one to deliberate, to decide and to act. We 
     <lb/>
     shall have but one tariff; trade will be un<lb break="no"/>shackled, our intercommunication will be 
     <lb/>
     unbroken, the Lower Provinces will give us 
     <lb/>
     a seaboard, while the manufacturing capa<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="num">672</fw>
  

     cities of Lower Canada and the agricultural 
     <lb/>
     wealth of Upper Canada will be theirs. A 
     <lb/>
     worthy field will be opened for the ambition 
     <lb/>
     of our young men, and our politicians will 
     <lb/>
     have a future before them, and may fairly 
     <lb/>
     aspire to the standing and rewards of state- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     men. (Cheers) I therefore think it cannot 
     <lb/>
     but be a very great advantage to all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces to be united together, and I think 
     <lb/>
     that we in Canada especially have peculiar 
     <lb/>
     reasons for desiring Confederation. If united, 
     <lb/>
     with the assistance of Great Britain, and 
     <lb/>
     true to ourselves, not calling on Jupiter 
     <lb/>
     without putting our shoulders to the wheel, 
     <lb/>
     we need fear no foe, and if the day should 
     <lb/>
     come when it shall be necessary for us to 
     <lb/>
     stand among the nations of the earth, we 
     <lb/>
     shall do so under far more favorable cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances than should we remain till then 
     <lb/>
     separate provinces. (Hear, hear.) I forbear 
     <lb/>
     to criticize the details of the scheme; in 
     <lb/>
     the nature of things one portion or another 
     <lb/>
     must be displeasing to each of us; but I am 
     <lb/>
     ready to accept the lesser evil for the geater 
     <lb/>
     good. I know, too, when worked out the 
     <lb/>
     united Parliament will alter and amend as 
     <lb/>
     the evils become serious. Holding these 
     <lb/>
     opinions, it is needless for me to say that I 
     <lb/>
     shall vote for the Address and the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     unchanged. On Friday night I heard an 
     <lb/>
     hon. member (Col. HAULTAIN) declare that 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant minority of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     entertained apprehensions with regard to 
     <lb/>
     their religious liberty, and that hon. 
     <lb/>
     member expressed grave doubts as to the 
     <lb/>
     toleration of Catholics in matters of religion. 
     <lb/>
     While I give the hon. gentleman full credit 
     <lb/>
     for his sincerity and the temperate manner 
     <lb/>
     in which he expressed himself, I think it 
     <lb/>
     would have been far better had that portion 
     <lb/>
     of his speech been omitted. It would cer<lb break="no"/>tainly have had much greater weight with 
     <lb/>
     the country without that portion than with 
     <lb/>
     it. I do not believe the Protestants of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada fear persecution, and there are those 
     <lb/>
     in this House, their natural representatives, 
     <lb/>
     yielding to none here in talent and know<lb break="no"/>ledge, well able to speak for them. But, 
     <lb/>
     sir, had the hon. gentleman read history 
     <lb/>
     as carefully as he seems to have studied 
     <lb/>
     polemics and theology, he would not have 
     <lb/>
     fallen into the error into which he has. 
     <lb/>
     He would have found that all sects of 
     <lb/>
     Christians have had reason to blush for the 
     <lb/>
     persecutions of their fellow-men, and that 
     <lb/>
     the best course we can pursue is to allow 
     <lb/>
     the veil to fall over the errors of the past. 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     (Hear, hear.) But, sir, he would have 
     <lb/>
     learned this, also, that those who laid the 
     <lb/>
     foundations of the British Constitution were 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics; that the barons who 
     <lb/>
     wrung the <hi rendition="simple:italic">magna charta</hi> from King JOHN 
     <lb/>
     were Catholics. (Hear, hear.) It was a 
     <lb/>
     Catholic Parliament, the Diet of Hungary, 
     <lb/>
     that alone granted full, free, unrestricted 
     <lb/>
     and unqualified emancipation to Protestants, 
     <lb/>
     and Catholic Bavaria has followed the 
     <lb/>
     example. In America, the Catholic State 
     <lb/>
     of Maryland first adopted, without limit, 
     <lb/>
     religious toleration. Had the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     visited Rome he might have seen a Protest<lb break="no"/>ant Church, and have attended service 
     <lb/>
     every Sunday in the year under the eyes of 
     <lb/>
     the Pope.

     though the church is not attractive, but

     there is full tolerance in respect to the

     <lb/>
     growing out of the remarks of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peterborough, In making the 
     <lb/>
     observations I have, I trust he will not 
     <lb/>
     think I have intended to say anything that 
     <lb/>
     might prove personally disagreeable to him 
     <lb/>
     or to any hon. member, because the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which he stated his propositions to the 
     <lb/>
     House was all that could be expected or 
     <lb/>
     desired from an hon. gentleman of his 
     <lb/>
     position, and I should be very sorry to 
     <lb/>
     say anything that would be considered offen<lb break="no"/>sive. My hon. friend asked me if I ever 
     <lb/>
     went to church. In reply I would say 
     <lb/>
     that I only go when I can be sure the 
     <lb/>
     preacher is a properly admitted clergy<lb break="no"/>man. Had the hon. gentleman travelled in 
     <lb/>
     France, he might have found the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     clergyman received from the state an allow<lb break="no"/>ance of one-fifth more than his Catholic 
     <lb/>
     brother, on the ground that he may have a 
     <lb/>
     family to support. In Lower Canada a 
     <lb/>
     Catholic Legislature gave equal rights to 
     <lb/>
     Jews a generation before enlightened Eng<lb break="no"/>land emancipated Catholics. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And, sir, the history of the Jews gave a 
     <lb/>
     terrible warning to all who persecute for 
     <lb/>
     belief's sake. They, GOD'S own people, set 
     <lb/>

     that bad exemple. For belief they crucified, 
     <lb/>
     and during a thousand years for belief they 
     <lb/>
     were oppressed and wronged as no nation 
     <lb/>
     ever suffered. Sir, it has not been by perse<lb break="no"/>cution that while all other denominations of 
     <lb/>
     Christians scarcely number 120,000,000, the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Roman Catholic Church are 
     <lb/>
     at least 150,000,000. Had her's been a rule 
     <lb/>
     of intolerance and persecution, by an inevit<lb break="no"/>able law they would long ere this have caused 
     <lb/>
     the destruction of that which used them, and

     In reading this extract and bringing it to 
     <lb/>
     bear in this connection, I hope my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend will not think I intended to shock 
     <lb/>
     his feelings by alluding to an early fall of 
     <lb/>
     London Bridge, or a speedy decay of the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     this passage alike for its novelty as knowing 
     <lb/>
     it will be particularly agreeable to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the member for Peterborough. I can 
     <lb/>
     assure my hon. friend the feeling per<lb break="no"/>vading the Catholics of Lower Canada is a 
     <lb/>
     disposition to give the utmost tolerance to 
     <lb/>
     all religious sects. For my part, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, persecution for religious belief I 
     <lb/>
     know to be a crime against humanity, and I 
     <lb/>
     therefore believe it to be a sin against the 
     <lb/>
     Creator. I have to say, however, once more, 
     <lb/>
     in conclusion, that I shall vote for the reso<lb break="no"/>lution now before the House. (Cheers)

     <persName ref="pers:MACK2">MR. HOPE MACKENZIE</persName> said—As
<lb/>there seems to be a lull in the debate, Mr.
<lb/>SPEAKER, I will embrace the opportunity of
<lb/>briefly stating what I have to say in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to this scheme. And to begin, I
<lb/>congratulate the Government upon the stand
<lb/>they have taken on this matter. There was
<lb/>a degree of anxiety, a feeling of uncertainty
<lb/>amongst the friends and supporters of the
<lb/>Administration, as to the mode of dealing 
     <lb/>with this question after the reception of<lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     

     unfavorable news from the Lower Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     For my own part I have not shared in that 
     <lb/>
     feeling, but continued to have confidence 
     <lb/>
     that the Government would pursue the only 
     <lb/>
     proper course, and ask the House to pro<lb break="no"/>nounce upon the scheme on its merits. If 
     <lb/>
     the result of the first elections held in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick is a true indication of the state 
     <lb/>
     of feeling in that province, then it is plain 
     <lb/>
     that defeat awaits the present proposition 
     <lb/>
     for union in that quarter ; but as yet no 
     <lb/>
     province has pronounced upon it, either for 
     <lb/>
     it or against it ; and the intelligence received 
     <lb/>
     that the union party have met with unlooked 
     <lb/>
     for reverses at the New Brunswick elections, 
     <lb/>
     however dampening to the prospects of early 
     <lb/>
     success, is no sufficient reason why we, the 
     <lb/>
     originators of the scheme, should set the 
     <lb/>
     bad example of summarily giving it up. 
     <lb/>
     We have a plain duty to discharge in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the proposition laid before Par<lb break="no"/>liament by the Government, and that is, 
     <lb/>
     either to accept or reject it as a whole. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Sir, I will not occupy the 
     <lb/>
     time of the House so long as I probably 
     <lb/>
     would have done, had I spoken at an earlier 
     <lb/>
     stage of the debate, and that for two reasons, 
     <lb/>
     because the ground has been all gone over 
     <lb/>
     by those who have spoken already, and 
     <lb/>
     because I think the Government have good 
     <lb/>
     ground for urging upon the House the pro<lb break="no"/>priety of bringing the debate to a close as 
     <lb/>
     soon as possible. I can easily understand 
     <lb/>
     that it is a matter of paramount importance 
     <lb/>
     to have the views of the Canadian Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment laid before the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     at the earliest possible moment. I cannot, 
     <lb/>
     however, feel it to be consistent with a pro<lb break="no"/>per discharge of my duty to give a silent 
     <lb/>
     vote. Having spent some time amongst 
     <lb/>
     my constituents prior to the opening of this 
     <lb/>
     session, and had conversations with the 
     <lb/>
     peeple in reference to this scheme, at my 
     <lb/>
     meetings with them I gave expression to 
     <lb/>
     certain objections which I felt in my own 
     <lb/>
     mind to certain details of the scheme, if I 
     <lb/>
     did not express those objections on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     the House. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr.SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, while I discussed freely and candidly 
     <lb/>
     what appeared to me the objectionable feat<lb break="no"/>ures of the scheme, I stated most distinctly 
     <lb/>
     to my constituents that in the event of no 
     <lb/>
     alteration being agreed to by the governments 
     <lb/>
     of the several provinces, the scheme as a 
     <lb/>
     whole, just as it stood, ought to be accepted ; 
     <lb/>
     and that in the event of the alternative being 
     <lb/>
     offered to Parliament of accepting or rejecting 
     <lb/>
     the scheme as it stood, I should feel it my 
     <lb/>

     duty to vote for it. (Hear, hear.) And I 
     <lb/>
     may say here in regard to the question of 
     <lb/>
     an appeal to the people upon this subject, 
     <lb/>
     that I at any rate can vote freely against any 
     <lb/>
     proposition of that kind. I stated to the 
     <lb/>
     people of North Oxford that in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     an appeal to the people upon this scheme 
     <lb/>
     was entirely uncalled for, and they agreed 
     <lb/>
     with me. I may, perhaps, take the liberty 
     <lb/>
     of saying to those honorable members who 
     <lb/>
     clamour for a dissolution, merely for the sake 
     <lb/>
     of ascertaining the mind of the people upon 
     <lb/>
     the measure, and who do not take to the 
     <lb/>
     untenable ground of denying the right of 
     <lb/>
     this Parliament to legislate on the subject, 
     <lb/>
     that if they did not consult their constituents 
     <lb/>
     with a view to obtaining an expression of 
     <lb/>
     public opinion, they ought to have done so. 
     <lb/>
     They had the scheme before them in all its 
     <lb/>
     details for months, and I think they ought to 
     <lb/>
     be in a position, when they came here, to 
     <lb/>
     know whether their constituents were in 
     <lb/>
     favor of the scheme or against it. In the 
     <lb/>
     meetings which were held in my county, I 
     <lb/>
     met with only two individuals who were 
     <lb/>
     prepared to go the length of denouncing the 
     <lb/>
     scheme <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi>, although many would prefer 
     <lb/>
     to see it, in some respects, different from 
     <lb/>
     what it is. So well disposed did the people 
     <lb/>
     show themselves to be towards the union 
     <lb/>
     scheme, that in the town of Woodstock, 
     <lb/>
     where a very large and influential meeting 
     <lb/>
     was held, the editor of a newspaper that 
     <lb/>
     had been, up to that night, urging the 
     <lb/>
     necessity for a dissolution of Parliament 
     <lb/>
     before the adoption of the scheme, was the 
     <lb/>
     first to rise to move a resolution approving 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme in all its features, and neither 
     <lb/>
     in his speech nor in his resolution did he 
     <lb/>
     even hint at an appeal to the people ; and 
     <lb/>
     that meeting voted for the scheme without 
     <lb/>
     a single dissentient voice. (Hear. hear.) 
     <lb/>
     MR. RYMAL—The circular had been

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK2">MR. H. MACKENZIE</persName>—Well, if so, I am
<lb/>not aware that it has done him any good or
<lb/>produced any change in his political course.
<lb/>I am quite satisfied, Mr. SPEAKER, that the
<lb/>people are perfectly willing that this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment should deal with this Confederation
<lb/>scheme. I will now, sir, state briefly what
<lb/>I think of the general features or underly<lb break="no"/>ing principles of the scheme. The honorable
<lb/>member for Brome the other night enter<lb break="no"/>tained the House by a very elaborate ex<lb break="no"/>amination of the scheme, and, among other
<lb/>things, he proposed to show that the pro<lb break="no"/>pose Constitution was an entire departure  
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
        

     from the British model, and had in it so 
     <lb/>
     large an infusion of the republican system 
     <lb/>
     of the United States as to render it obnox<lb break="no"/>ious to Britons ; but, in opposition to his 
     <lb/>
     own premises, he succeeded in proving to a 
     <lb/>
     demonstration, if he proved anything, that 
     <lb/>
     in scarcely a single particular is it modelled 
     <lb/>
     after the pattern of the republic. He even 
     <lb/>
     denounced this scheme because it is so very 
     <lb/>
     different from and, in his opinion, inferior 
     <lb/>
     to the United States Constitution. Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I accept of it because of its British 
     <lb/>
     and monarchical features,—I accept of it 
     <lb/>
     because of its monarchical character. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I look upon it as a scheme more 
     <lb/>
     national than federal in its character—as 
     <lb/>
     looking more to a national union of the 
     <lb/>
     people than a union of sections, and it is 
     <lb/>
     chiefly because of this feature of it that 
     <lb/>
     it commends itself to my judgment. 
     <lb/>
     Hear, hear.) The honorable member for 
     <lb/>

     Lotbinière dissented from this view the other 
     <lb/>
     night, and argued that unless the supreme 
     <lb/>
     power was placed in the hands of the separate 
     <lb/>
     provinces, it could not be acceptable to 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, as otherwise their institutions 
     <lb/>
     would be endangered ; and yet oddly enough, 
     <lb/>
     he elaborated an argument to prove the 
     <lb/>
     fleeting and unstable character of federations 
     <lb/>
     established upon the only principle that he 
     <lb/>
     seems disposed to accept for this country. 
     <lb/>
     In the course of his remarks on this head, 
     <lb/>
     he said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>The Hon. Minister of Agriculture said of 
     <lb/>Federalism, that it was on account of the weakness 
     <lb/>of the central power confederations had failed ; 
     <lb/>and it was argued in our case, that there would 
     <lb/>not be so much weakness in the central power. 
     <lb/>This was precisely why the French-Canadians— 
     <lb/>his fellow-countrymen—looked with suspicion on 
     <lb/>the proposition to establish a Confederation with 
     <lb/>a central power—a power so strong that the local 
     <lb/>parliaments would possess, so to speak, no power 
     <lb/>at all. (Hear, hear.) All the confederations he 
     <lb/>had referred to had at least this excuse, they were 
     <lb/>sovereign states, and, when menaced by other 
     <lb/>powers, leagued themselves together for the com<lb break="no"/>mon interest. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, sir, while the honorable member will 
     <lb/>
     have nothing to do with it, because of 
     <lb/>
     the supreme central power that is provided 
     <lb/>
     in the scheme, I take it just because of 
     <lb/>
     that controlling central power. I stand 
     <lb/>
     as an advocate of national unity, and I would 
     <lb/>
     not accede to the principle of state sover<lb break="no"/>eignty in this Confederation, the provinces 
     <lb/>
     delegating certain powers to the General 
     <lb/>
     Government and reserving the residuum of 
     <lb/>
     power to themselves. (Hear, hear.) We

    need not go to the history of the South 
     <lb/>
     American republics, as the member for Lot<lb break="no"/>binière did, to find an illustration of the 
     <lb/>
     working of the principle of Confederation as 
     <lb/>
     applicable to our case. Being not only re<lb break="no"/>publican in their character, but based upon 
     <lb/>
     the principle of divided sovereignty, and in<lb break="no"/>habited by a people who had no aptitude for 
     <lb/>
     working democratic institutions, they can 
     <lb/>
     bear no comparison with this proposed Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. But if the hon. gentleman de<lb break="no"/>sired to travel to South America to find 
     <lb/>
     something approaching a parallel to this 
     <lb/>
     scheme of union, he could find it in the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional monarchy of Brazil, where 
     <lb/>
     the wide-spreading provinces of the empire 
     <lb/>
     have their local parliaments for their local 
     <lb/>
     affairs, and a central parliament and execu<lb break="no"/>tive over all—elected and chosen pretty 
     <lb/>
     much as our Central Parliament and Execu<lb break="no"/>tive will be, and exercising similar powers ; 
     <lb/>
     and he would find that while the republics 
     <lb/>
     founded upon the doctrine of state sover<lb break="no"/>eignty were in a state of perpetual turmoil, 
     <lb/>
     and whose daily bread was, according to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member, anarchy and revolution, the 
     <lb/>
     Empire of Brazil was flourishing and shewed 
     <lb/>
     signs of stability that predicated its future 
     <lb/>
     greatness. (Hear, hear.) But to come 
     <lb/>
     nearer home, sir, we have abundant evi<lb break="no"/>dence of the dangerous character of the doc<lb break="no"/>trine of state supremacy in a confederation. 
     <lb/>
     I would remind the House of the early ruin 
     <lb/>
     that threatened the United States under 
     <lb/>
     their first Constitution, which was an 
     <lb/>
     embodiment of this vicious principle, 
     <lb/>
     and how clearly the great men of the 
     <lb/>
     first year of the republic foresaw the ruin 
     <lb/>
     it threatened to bring upon them. WASH<lb break="no"/>INGTON, perceiving the rapid decline of 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation, was incessant in his 
     <lb/>
     correspondence with the leading patriots of 
     <lb/>
     the day to obtain their opinions upon a new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, and MADISON replies as follows :

     I read these extracts to show how rapidly 
     <lb/>
     the Central Government of the United States 
     <lb/>
     was falling into contempt because of its 
     <lb/>
     subordination to the separate states, and to 
     <lb/>
     show that the leading minds of America, 
     <lb/>
     while the republic was yet in its infancy, 
     <lb/>
     felt that the doctrine of state supremacy 
     <lb/>
     was one calculated to foster anarchy, and 
     <lb/>
     that was sure to bring the early destruction 
     <lb/>
     of the fabric they had reared, and also to 
     <lb/>
     show how earnestly they labored to remove 
     <lb/>
     the evil and transfer the sovereignty to the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government, as their only hope of 
     <lb/>
     maintaining permanent peace and order, and 
     <lb/>
     of imparting stability to their system. I 
     <lb/>
     think, sir, it becomes us in framing a Consti<lb break="no"/>tution for these provinces to profit, not only 
     <lb/>
     by the early but by the later experience of 
     <lb/>
     our neighbors—to enquire how far they 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in eradicating the evil from their 
     <lb/>
     new Constitution, and to what extent their 
     <lb/>
     present troubles are chargeable to what is 
     <lb/>
     left in their system of the dangerous prin<lb break="no"/>ciple referred to. Let us profit by the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom of the framers of the American 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, and by the experiences of that 
     <lb/>
     country under it—not to copy their work, 
     <lb/>
     but to help us when framing a Constitution 
     <lb/>
     for ourselves to steer clear of evils that they 
     <lb/>
     have felt. Believing that the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference has done so and have presented to 
     <lb/>
     us the framework of a Constitution, the lead<lb break="no"/>ing features of which are in unison with the

     constitutional principles of the British mon<lb break="no"/>archy, and consistent with that allegiance

     which we all owe and cheerfully yield to the 
     <lb/>
     Throne of Britain, I cheerfully endorse the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. (Hear, hear.) I will now, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, look at the scheme in its sectional aspect ; 
     <lb/>
     and, in my judgment, it is in this respect a 
     <lb/>
     fair one. The apportionment of the debt 
     <lb/>
     and other financial arrangements is a theme 
     <lb/>
     upon which many remarks and explanations 
     <lb/>
     have been made in this, as well as in the 
     <lb/>
     other branch of the Legislature ; and charges 
     <lb/>
     are made of having bribed the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces into the scheme, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Delegates in the Conference sacri<lb break="no"/>ficed the interests of Canada in their 
     <lb/>
     eagerness to consummate a scheme that had 
     <lb/>
     its origin in their political necessities. One 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman complains that population is 
     <lb/>
     not the proper basis upon which to distribute 
     <lb/>
     the burden of the public debt, and that by 
     <lb/>
     adopting it Canada has been saddled with 
     <lb/>
     many millions more than her share. " Re<lb break="no"/>venue," it is contended, " is the true test of 
     <lb/>
     ability to pay, therefore revenue is the basis 
     <lb/>
     upon which the apportionment should be 
     <lb/>
     made." Were the taxation alike in all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, there would, at least, be the 
     <lb/>
     appearance of justice in the argument ; but 
     <lb/>
     with revenue raised under the operation of 
     <lb/>
     different tariffs, in the several provinces, I 
     <lb/>
     think population is a juster basis than 
     <lb/>
     revenue. Taking, however, the revenues as 
     <lb/>
     we find them under existing tariffs, and 
     <lb/>
     adjusting the debt by that standard, we find 
     <lb/>
     that it will differ but little from the appor<lb break="no"/>tionment that has been agreed upon ; and 
     <lb/>
     were the tariffs of the Maritime Provinces 
     <lb/>
     somewhat higher than they are now, I 
     <lb/>
     apprehend, sir, that the consuming ability 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces would demonstrate not 
     <lb/>
     only their ability to pay according to this 
     <lb/>
     test, but also that Canada is in no way 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon in regard to the amount of 
     <lb/>
     debt with which these provinces are to be 
     <lb/>
     permitted to enter the union. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     every one of the five provinces has had its in<lb break="no"/>terests well consulted in this scheme, and that 
     <lb/>
     it is so well balanced throughout in reference 
     <lb/>
     to those interests, that there is very little to 
     <lb/>
     complain of. (Hear, hear.) But speaking 
     <lb/>
     from an Upper Canadian point of view— 
     <lb/>
     which I deem it my duty to do, as one of the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of that section—I will glance 
     <lb/>
     at one or two of the objections urged by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for North Ontario, very 
     <lb/>
     briefly. That honorable gentleman accuses 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canadians of disregarding and forget<lb break="no"/>ting their former professions on the represent<lb break="no"/>ation question, and broadly asserts that the 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        

     Honorable President of the Council, as the 
     <lb/>
     leader in the agitation for representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, has agreed to a measure that is a 
     <lb/>
     mere delusion, that in point of fact puts Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada in a worse position than she now 
     <lb/>
     occupies. He says that instead of occupying 
     <lb/>
     a position of equality in the legislature, as 
     <lb/>
     now, she will be found in the new union with 
     <lb/>
     a majority of thirty arrayed against her. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman builds his argument upon 
     <lb/>
     false and erroneous premises, when he says 
     <lb/>
     that Upper Canada does not get by this 
     <lb/>
     scheme what its people have long sought, 
     <lb/>
     representation according to its population; 
     <lb/>
     and when he points out that all the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, unitedly, will outvote her in the 
     <lb/>
     General Legislature by thirty votes, I submit, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that his ent is exceedingly unfair, 
     <lb/>
     and is founded on the assumption that Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada asked for an increase of representa<lb break="no"/>tion for the purpose of obtaining supremacy 
     <lb/>
     in the Government. Now, I deny that most 
     <lb/>
     emphatically on behalf, not only of myself, 
     <lb/>
     but of every man from Upper Canada who de<lb break="no"/>manded a change in the representation. We 
     <lb/>
     did not advocate that change for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of' gaining the supremacy, but simply and 
     <lb/>
     solely as a measure of justice to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada, and to place them on an 
     <lb/>
     equal footing, man for man, with the people 
     <lb/>
     ot Lower Canada. We had certain grievances 
     <lb/>
     and wrongs which we complained of, and 
     <lb/>
     which the granting of representation would 
     <lb/>
     not of itself redress; we complained that a 
     <lb/>
     larger proportion of the public revenues, to 
     <lb/>
     which we contributed seventy per cent, was 
     <lb/>
     spent in Lower Canada than in Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada; we complained also of legislative acts 
     <lb/>
     passed by majorities from Lower Canada and 
     <lb/>
     which concerned Upper Canada chiefly; we 
     <lb/>
     did not ask representation by population be<lb break="no"/>cause we believed it, of itself, would sweep 
     <lb/>
     away all this injustice, but because it would 
     <lb/>
     give us this advantage, that we would in tins 
     <lb/>
     House have our due proportion of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation, every man in Upper Canada having 
     <lb/>
     an equal, and no more than equal, voice In 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature with every man in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada. This was all we asked, we never de<lb break="no"/>manded more than what was just; we asked 
     <lb/>
     but fair play—British fair play—an equal 
     <lb/>
     representation, man for man, and we would 
     <lb/>
     be willing to take our chance in the political 
     <lb/>
     struggle for the redress of the evils we com<lb break="no"/>plained of. We never sought or wished for 
     <lb/>
     supremacy, but only our just and fair in<lb break="no"/>fluence according to our numbers and the 
     <lb/>
     public burdens we bore, and having obtained 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="677" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0677.jpg"/>

     this we were willing to take our chance 
     <lb/>
    whether that influence, employed in a legiti<lb break="no"/>mate and constitutional way, succeeded in re<lb break="no"/>moving our grievances or not. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>To say now that we do not obtain what we 
     <lb/>have contended for—to say that we do not 
     <lb/>get representation by population because the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces, including Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>will have thirty more votes in the General 
     <lb/>Legislature, is simply doing Upper Canada 
     <lb/>an injustice and a wrong ; and the history of 
     <lb/>the British parliamentary system and our own 
     <lb/>experience in Canada, warrant the conclusion 
     <lb/>that in the General Legislature we shall not 
     <lb/>have, as alleged by honorable gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posed to the scheme, parties divided against 
     <lb/>one another because of the provinces which they 
     <lb/>represent. Under our present Constitution 
     <lb/>we are not divided sectionally, but as political 
     <lb/>parties, for we find gentlemen from both 
     <lb/>sections taking sides according to their poli<lb break="no"/>tical predilections, irrespective of sectional 
     <lb/>considerations ; and so it will be under the 
     <lb/>proposed Confederation. We have conserva<lb break="no"/>tives and radicals, and always will have them. 
     <lb/>Do we not find men of both races in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince voting on both sides politically ? It is 
     <lb/>true the demand for constitutional changes 
     <lb/>has to some extent, but only to some extent, 
     <lb/>divided us as the representatives of sections 
     <lb/>in this House ; but on all other questions— 
     <lb/>such as commerce, banking, customs tariffs, 
     <lb/>excise, and other questions—we find gentle<lb break="no"/>men voting according to their political views, 
     <lb/>and not as representing sections. So it will 
     <lb/>be under the Confederation. People will be 
     <lb/>divided into parties by their political opinions 
     <lb/>and leanings, and not by sectional considera<lb break="no"/>tions. (Hear, hear.) In claiming, then, that 
     <lb/>under it there will, on all questions, be a 
     <lb/>majority against Upper Canada, is to assume 
     <lb/>that Upper Canada will be at war with all the 
     <lb/>other provinces, and that they will be con<lb break="no"/>tinually at war with it. Well, what right 
     <lb/>has any man to assume that this will be the case 
     <lb/>—that Upper Canada will be the Ishmael of the 
     <lb/>Confederation ? I think he has none what<lb break="no"/>ever. (Hear, hear.) The addition of seven<lb break="no"/>teen members to Upper Canada in the outset, 
     <lb/>with the proposed arrangement for re-adjust<lb break="no"/>ment every ten years according to the increase 
     <lb/>or decrease of population in each of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, is substantial justice to all, and is all 
     <lb/>that Upper Canada ever asked for or expected. 
     <lb/>But, Mr. SPEAKER, the honorable member for 
     <lb/>North Ontario not only accuses the Upper 
     <lb/>Canadians who support this scheme of an 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     abandonment of their principles on this point, 
     <lb/>
     and of offering to the people of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     the very opposite of what they asked for, 
     <lb/>
     but charges that we have sacrificed our cash 
     <lb/>
     as well as our principles. An honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the other House has taken similar 
     <lb/>
     ground, and charges in effect that the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces have been bribed into this scheme 
     <lb/>
     at the expense of Upper Canada, and that as 
     <lb/>
     regards Lower Canada, we undertake to pay 
     <lb/>
     her in perpetuity a subsidy of $167,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year; and the honorable gentleman asks if ever 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada asked for anything like that 
     <lb/>
     under our present system ? He tells us, too, 
     <lb/>
     that for each of the seventeen additional mem<lb break="no"/>bers we get in the Federal Government, we 
     <lb/>
     pay at the rate of $16,000 each. As regards 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, I submit that it 
     <lb/>
     cannot be shewn that their union with us 
     <lb/>
     will be to our detriment in money matters. 
     <lb/>
     They will contribute as large an amount per 
     <lb/>
     head to the general revenue as we do in 
     <lb/>
     Uper Canada, and if any financial effect 
     <lb/>
     will be felt by Upper Canada in consequence 
     <lb/>
     of the union of these provinces with us, I 
     <lb/>
     think it must be in the direction of lessening 
     <lb/>
     her burdens ; such, at all events, is the con<lb break="no"/>clusion I have arrived at, and such, I think, is 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion any man will arrive at who 
     <lb/>
     will take the trouble to inform himself of the 
     <lb/>
     position of these provinces as regards the fin<lb break="no"/>ancial questions between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I do not know where the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member gets his figures, nor can I very well 
     <lb/>
     understand them, but in regard to the subsidy 
     <lb/>
     of $167,000 a year that he speaks of, what 
     <lb/>
     are the facts of the case ? Let it be borne in 
     <lb/>
     mind, sir, that as Upper Canadians we claimed 
     <lb/>
     that we were paying an enormous price for 
     <lb/>
     the present union with Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     that we urged this as one reason why we were 
     <lb/>
     entitled to the concession of representation by 
     <lb/>
     population as an act of justice, that we might 
     <lb/>
     have our due share of influence in controlling 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure of the revenues of the country 
     <lb/>
     to which we contributed so largely. We com<lb break="no"/>plained, and it was advanced in this Assembly 
     <lb/>
     over and over again, as one of the reasons for 
     <lb/>
     demanding representation by population, that 
     <lb/>
     our money was given away to sections which 
     <lb/>
     contributed little or nothing to the general re<lb break="no"/>venue ; that while we paid seventy per cent. 
     <lb/>
     of the revenue and Lower Canada only thirty 
     <lb/>
     per cent., an equal proportion of the expen<lb break="no"/>diture was enjoyed by Lower Canada ; and 
     <lb/>
     that under this system Upper Canada was 
     <lb/>
    paying not only for its own local improvements 
     <lb/>
    

            <pb n="678" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0678.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">678</fw>
         

     and sustaining not only the cost of carrying 
     <lb/>
     on its own local affairs, but contributing 
     <lb/>
     largely as well to the local wants of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear.) Now, it was in re<lb break="no"/>ference to these local matters that the evil 
     <lb/>
     was chiefly felt and that complaints were 
     <lb/>
     louder than with reference to general expen<lb break="no"/>diture, for they were tangible grievances, 
     <lb/>
     things that were easily understood, and that 
     <lb/>
     presented themselves as an injustice every 
     <lb/>
    year in the estimates presented to this House. 
     <lb/>There was a sum of two millions, or more 
     <lb/>voted every year for the support of local in<lb break="no"/>terests and to promote local works or improve<lb break="no"/>ments, including such items as the support of 
     <lb/>education, hospitals and charities, and the 
     <lb/>opening up of colonization roads ; and of this 
     <lb/>sum one-half was applied to local purposes 
     <lb/>in Lower Canada. Now, our argument 
     <lb/>was, that of this money taken out of the 
     <lb/>public chest, Upper Canada contributed 
     <lb/>seventy per cent., and Lower Canada the 
     <lb/>remainder. If this was true—and I think it 
     <lb/>was incontrovertibly so—then it was perfectly 
     <lb/>clear that we in Upper Canada had to pay not 
     <lb/>only the appropriations made for local pur<lb break="no"/>poses in that section, but also nearly one-half 
     <lb/>of the appropriations for local purposes in 
     <lb/>Lower Canada. Let me remark here that I 
     <lb/>do not think any man will complain that we 
     <lb/>in Upper Canada are paying this large portion 
     <lb/>of the public revenue. Under our system of 
     <lb/>indirect taxation, or indeed under any system, 
     <lb/>it must be that the richest part of the com<lb break="no"/>munity shall bear the largest share of the 
     <lb/>public burdens, and they have a right to do 
     <lb/>so. I do not complain that the people of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada pay a larger amount of the 
     <lb/>revenue of the country than those of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, because if they choose to consume 
     <lb/>the imported articles upon which duties are 
     <lb/>levied, they do so because they are able to pay 
     <lb/>for them. They are not required to consume 
     <lb/>them, but if they do, and are made to pay 
     <lb/>indirectly to the public exchequer, they have 
     <lb/>no right to complain that the people of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, more frugal and economical, consume 
     <lb/>less dutiable goods and therefore contribute 
     <lb/>less to the revenue. We in Upper Canada do 
     <lb/>not complain of this, but we give it as a 
     <lb/>reason why we should have our just share of 
     <lb/>influence in the legislature and government 
     <lb/>of the country. We do not argue that because 
     <lb/>we contribute more we ought to have a larger 
     <lb/>representation than Lower Canada ; but we 
     <lb/>say that if we really do pay more to the public 
     <lb/>exchequer, it is an additional reason—our 
     <lb/>population being greater—that we should have 
     <lb/>
      

    
            <cb/>
           

     an equal voice with Lower Canada, in propor<lb break="no"/>tion to our numbers, in controlling the expen<lb break="no"/>diture of the country. (Hear, hear.) Well, 
     <lb/>
     this being the case that Upper Canada con<lb break="no"/>tributes the largest share of the revenue, it is 
     <lb/>
     perfectly clear to my mind—and I think it 
     <lb/>
     will be to that of any man who examines the 
     <lb/>
     subject intelligently—that Upper Canada pays 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada, under our present system, 
     <lb/>
     a considerable sum of money, amounting to 
     <lb/>
     half a million of dollars yearly, for the sup<lb break="no"/>port of its local interests and institutions ; 
     <lb/>
     and if the honorable member for North On<lb break="no"/>tario will balance the proportion that Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada pays of the eighty cents per head 
     <lb/>
     proposed to be paid to Lower Canada with 
     <lb/>
     the amount now paid to it by Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     he will find that a large saving will be effected 
     <lb/>
     by the plan now proposed for our acceptance. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We have thus, I think, gained 
     <lb/>
     by this scheme, not only representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, saving us from the imputation of 
     <lb/>
     having sacrificed this principle in order to 
     <lb/>
     obtain Confederation, but we have also, by the 
     <lb/>
     same measure, gained a substantial redress of 
     <lb/>
     the grievances to remove which representation 
     <lb/>
     by population was demanded. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Not only has a saving of money been effected, 
     <lb/>
     but also a removal from this Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     those subjects upon which angry, intemperate, 
     <lb/>
     and painful discussions have taken place in 
     <lb/>
     times past. For these reasons, I think it is 
     <lb/>
     a most desirable thing that the scheme should 
     <lb/>
     be carried out. (Hear, hear.) It is marvel<lb break="no"/>lous how inconsistent some honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men show themselves to be in their desire to 
     <lb/>
     oppose this measure. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Lotbinière, speaking of it from a sectional 
     <lb/>
     point of view, has also, I think, exposed him<lb break="no"/>self to this charge. He charges the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Attorney General East with inconsist<lb break="no"/>ency, if not something worse, in occupying 
     <lb/>
     the position he now does as affecting  the in<lb break="no"/>terests of Lower Canada, forgetful of his own 
     <lb/>
     relative position. He said :—

     Mr. BROWN) is here represented as having 
     <lb/>
     earned his popularity by attacking the insti<lb break="no"/>tutions of Lower Canada, and the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Montreal East (Hon. Mr. CAR<lb break="no"/>TIER) as having earned his by defending these 
     <lb/>
     same institutions, and the insinuation is that 
     <lb/>
     he has now abandoned the defence of these 
     <lb/>
     institutions and handed them over to the ten<lb break="no"/>der mercies of the Honorable President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council. Let me ask the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Lotbinière, if being in company with 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for South Oxford be 
     <lb/>
     evidence of hostility to the institutions of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, how he explains his own po<lb break="no"/>sition, and that of his party, when they cast 
     <lb/>
     in their lot with the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford, while earning his popularity 
     <lb/>
     by, as he says, attacking the institutions of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, and abandoned the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General East when doing battle in 
     <lb/>
     defence of those institutions ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I think the question is one not easily an<lb break="no"/>swered. The honorable gentleman must either 
     <lb/>
     have been politically dishonest before, or po<lb break="no"/>litically dishonest now, and he can take 
     <lb/>
     either horn of the dilemma he pleases.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—I never supported the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Attorney General East, and if I have 
     <lb/>
     been forced upon the same side as the honor<lb break="no"/>orable member for South Oxford, it was be<lb break="no"/>cause we were united together in opposition 
     <lb/>
     to that honorable gentleman. That was the 
     <lb/>
     only bond of union that connected us to<lb break="no"/>gether. On the question of representation by 
     <lb/>
     population we were always divided. What I 
     <lb/>
     meant in the observation I made, that has 
     <lb/>
     been alluded to by the honorable member, is 
     <lb/>
     this, that the Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council had gained the position he occupies 
     <lb/>
     now by attacking Lower Canada, and the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Attorney General East his, by as<lb break="no"/>suming to defend it ; and when at length they 
     <lb/>
     found that the game would no longer answer, 
     <lb/>
     when the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     saw himself excluded forever from a seat in 
     <lb/>
     the Ministry if he continued to play it, they 
     <lb/>
     banded together, and we now see the result.

     hon. member has contributed his mite to the 
     <lb/>
     influence the hon. member for South Oxford 
     <lb/>
     had in this House, by attacking, as he 
     <lb/>
     declares, the institutions of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     I have already said that all parties are not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with this scheme ; and while on 
     <lb/>
     this point, I wish to allude for a moment to 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     It is the only reference I shall make on this 
     <lb/>
     branch of the subject. When addressing 
     <lb/>
     my constituents, I took exception to this 
     <lb/>
     portion of the resolutions. I did so, not 
     <lb/>
     because I cared very much whether we had 
     <lb/>
     in this country a Legislative Council nomi<lb break="no"/>nated by the Crown or elected by the people, 
     <lb/>
     but, the nominative system having been 
     <lb/>
     superseded by the elective, I preferred to 
     <lb/>
     have it as it was. It was in these terms that 
     <lb/>
     I spoke to the people. After having ad<lb break="no"/>dressed one or two meetings, I saw the 
     <lb/>
     despatch of the Colonial Secretary, and I 
     <lb/>
     noticed that this matter of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     of the Council was pointed out as one which 
     <lb/>
     required revision ; and I took it for granted 
     <lb/>
     that communications would be opened be<lb break="no"/>tween the several Colonial Governments such 
     <lb/>
     as would possibly lead to a change. Doubtless 
     <lb/>
     there are sufficient reasons why this has not 
     <lb/>
     been done. But, although I would have 
     <lb/>
     liked it to have been so, and although it 
     <lb/>
     would have concurred more closely with the 
     <lb/>
     views of Upper Canada, I do not think it of 
     <lb/>
     sufficient importance to warrant me in reject<lb break="no"/>ing the scheme on that account. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If it involves the rejection of the 
     <lb/>
     whole scheme, I do not feel myself warranted 
     <lb/>
     in pressing lor an amendment on the point. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) In framing a constitution of this kind, 
     <lb/>
     everybody must be aware that an agreement 
     <lb/>
     could never have been arrived at except on 
     <lb/>
     the principle of compromise and concession. 
     <lb/>
     It is perfectly useless—it is worse than useless 
     <lb/>
     —to suppose that any of the several sections 
     <lb/>
     of a wide-spread territory could come together 
     <lb/>
     with a view to the formation of a union 
     <lb/>
     among themselves, unless each one of these 
     <lb/>
     sections was prepared to sacrifice and give 
     <lb/>
     up something. What right, I would ask, 
     <lb/>
     had we to expect that all the other colonies 
     <lb/>
     would agree to the views of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     or to the views of Canada as a whole ? What 
     <lb/>
     right had we to expect that the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia would agree with us in our 
     <lb/>
     views with reference to every particular 
     <lb/>
     matter ? What right had we in Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     to expect that in framing this scheme we 
     <lb/>
     would be able to expunge the separate school 
     <lb/>
     clauses from the School Act ? If that could 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="680" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0680.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">680</fw>
        

     be done, it would no doubt be agreeable to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada, because we think 
     <lb/>
     that in our Common School system there 
     <lb/>
     should be no element of sectarianism. As 
     <lb/>
     a people, we are desirous of having our 
     <lb/>
     School law without any provision for separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. It is perhaps a bold statement to 
     <lb/>
     make, but I believe the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada as a whole, Roman Catholics as well 
     <lb/>
     as Protestants, would be content with our 
     <lb/>
     school system without a particle of sectarian<lb break="no"/>ism in it. We could scarcely expect that 
     <lb/>
     if we were to succeed in framing a basis of 
     <lb/>
     union under a new Constitution, we could 
     <lb/>
     get the sectarian clauses of the School Act 
     <lb/>
     removed, if they were insisted upon as <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine 
     <lb/>
     qua non</hi> by the Roman Catholics in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada in <choice><sic>conjunctien</sic><corr>conjunction</corr></choice> with the adherents of 
     <lb/>
     the same faith in Upper Canada. But not<lb break="no"/>withstanding this, although it is a sensitive 
     <lb/>
     point in Upper Canada, and particularly 
     <lb/>
     among my own constituents, I venture to 
     <lb/>
     say that the people of the west generally, in 
     <lb/>
     their willingness at all times to listen to 
     <lb/>
     reason, will be quite content to accept the 
     <lb/>
     scheme as a whole, as it has been presented 
     <lb/>
     to us. (Hear, hear.) I hope that no 
     <lb/>
     attempt will be made to increase the pri<lb break="no"/>vileges of the advocates of separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     but that the question will be left where 
     <lb/>
     we now find it. (Hear, hear.) It is 
     <lb/>
     worth while, perhaps, to read a single 
     <lb/>
     passage, written by a distinguished man, in 
     <lb/>
     reference to this principle of concession. I 
     <lb/>
     have already instanced the views of e 
     <lb/>
     framers of the American Constitution when 
     <lb/>
     they set to work to do away with the first 
     <lb/>
     Federation scheme and to adopt a new Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. When they had framed the new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, we find WASHINGTON accom<lb break="no"/>panying the document with a letter, in 
     <lb/>
     which this passage occurs :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It is obviously impracticable in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government of these states to secure all rights of 
     <lb/>
     independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide 
     <lb/>
     for the interest and safety of all. Individuals 
     <lb/>
     entering into society must give up a share of 
     <lb/>
     liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of 
     <lb/>
     the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and 
     <lb/>
     circumstances as on the object to be attained. 
     <lb/>
     It is at all times difficult to draw with precision

     Doubtless, sir, the members of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Conference encountered the same difficulties 
     <lb/>
     as the framers of the American Constitution 
     <lb/>
     did. They must have found it difficult to 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
        

     draw the line exactly where it should be 
     <lb/>
     drawn. I presume it could not be done, 
     <lb/>
     and that each one felt it incumbent upon him 
     <lb/>
     to make certain concessions, and that all they 
     <lb/>
     could hope to do was to have some broad 
     <lb/>
     margin, some neutral ground, on which to 
     <lb/>
     draw the line, so as to be able to say they 
     <lb/>
     did the best they could to unite the sectional 
     <lb/>
     interests of the provinces and to further 
     <lb/>
     something like a nationality for the country. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I do not desire to trespass 
     <lb/>
     upon the House ; I have purposely passed 
     <lb/>
     over much that I intended to have said, had 
     <lb/>
     the Government desired to encourage dis<lb break="no"/>cussion at greater length ; and I pass on 
     <lb/>
     rapidly to a conclusion. (Cries of " Go on !") 
     <lb/>
     I think the union desirable, not only as a 
     <lb/>
     benefit to ourselves, but as a means for con<lb break="no"/>solidating the British Empire on this conti<lb break="no"/>nent, and to save us from a degrading 
     <lb/>
     dependency on the United States, especially 
     <lb/>
     as we have the means within ourselves of 
     <lb/>
     making them to a certain extent dependent 
     <lb/>
     upon us. Look at the map of this country, 
     <lb/>
     look at the position we occupy geographic<lb break="no"/>ally ; see the outlet we possess to the ocean ; 
     <lb/>
     look at the magnificent St. Lawrence, with 
     <lb/>
     the vast grain growing country beyond it. 
     <lb/>
     Is it not in our power to draw the trade of 
     <lb/>
     the Great West through this its natural 
     <lb/>
     outlet to the ocean ? Is it not possible to so 
     <lb/>
     improve this channel as to bring the produce 
     <lb/>
     of the great Western States to market 
     <lb/>
     through our territory ? Is it not possible, 
     <lb/>
     by means of a little judicious outlay, to make 
     <lb/>
     the people of the United States dependent 
     <lb/>
     on us, instead of us being dependent 
     <lb/>
     on them ? (Hear, hear.) There is 
     <lb/>
     much that could be said on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, and the means that might be resorted 
     <lb/>
     to for securing to us these benefits of trade 
     <lb/>
     and commerce. It is not so much to the en<lb break="no"/>largement of the Welland and St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     canals, although that is necessary, as to the 
     <lb/>
     construction of a ship canal to Lake Huron 
     <lb/>
     through the Ottawa country, that in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion we must look for the ultimate com<lb break="no"/>mercial greatness of this country, as furnish<lb break="no"/>ing the shortest and safest route for the 
     <lb/>
     conveyance of the contents of the great 
     <lb/>
     granaries of the west to foreign markets. 
     <lb/>
     The proposed Ottawa canal may not run 
     <lb/>
     through a country as fertile as the valley of 
     <lb/>
     the St. Lawrence ; it is of a different geolo<lb break="no"/>gical formation; nevertheless, I believe it 
     <lb/>
     to be a country of great riches, whose re<lb break="no"/>sources are as yet undeveloped. I think that 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="681" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0681.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">681</fw>
         

     a ship canal from Georgian Bay in that 
     <lb/>
     direction would not only furnish a satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory outlet for the produce of the west, but 
     <lb/>
     would lead to a splendid market for the lum<lb break="no"/>ber trade, and find employment for a class of 
     <lb/>
     vessels to which we cannot at present give 
     <lb/>
     profitable occupation ; and, besides, it would 
     <lb/>
     open a channel for such vessels and imple<lb break="no"/>ments of war as may be necessary for the 
     <lb/>
     defence of the country. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     would conclude by saying that I think union 
     <lb/>
     desirable, not only because of its present ad<lb break="no"/>vantages, but on account of our future pros<lb break="no"/>pects. Looking at the future, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     it desirable that one government should exer<lb break="no"/>cise sway over the whole of the North Ameri<lb break="no"/>can continent. (Hear, hear.) Nor do I 
     <lb/>
     think it desirable that such a government 
     <lb/>
     should be a republican government. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Taking this view of the case; looking 
     <lb/>
     back to the history of the past; reflecting 
     <lb/>
     upon the evils which have followed hasty 
     <lb/>
     constitution-making, and the troubles that 
     <lb/>
     have occurred in consequence of blundering 
     <lb/>
     at the outset, it becomes as to consider 
     <lb/>
     whether the scheme which has now been 
     <lb/>
     laid before us has in it the elements of 
     <lb/>
     stability. I think it has, so far as human 
     <lb/>
     foresight can determine. (Hear, hear.) Geo<lb break="no"/>graphically this country covers a vast extent 
     <lb/>
     of territory. We can lean our backs on the 
     <lb/>
     snows of the north, and from that quarter no 
     <lb/>
     enemy can attack us ; and if we have no great 
     <lb/>
     breadth from north to south, we have a large. 
     <lb/>
     expanse westwards. Although, too, we are 
     <lb/>
     in a northern clime, although our latitude is 
     <lb/>
      higher than that of our southern neighbor, 
     <lb/>
     yet this is no obstacle to the growth 
     <lb/>
     of population or to the increase of pros<lb break="no"/>perity. (Hear, hear.) Teaming millions 
     <lb/>
     will in future inhabit this land, and 
     <lb/>
     we are called upon now to lay deep and 
     <lb/>
     broad the foundations of a great empire. 
     <lb/>
     Let us shew that we value the free institu<lb break="no"/>tions of Britain transplanted to this soil ; 
     <lb/>
     institutions founded upon principles of 
     <lb/>
     freedom and universal toleration ; institutions 
     <lb/>
     that have made the parent land great, and 
     <lb/>
     that mark it out as the one bright spot in 
     <lb/>
     the old world to which the eyes of the 
     <lb/>
     nations turn when their liberties are im<lb break="no"/>perilled, and as the city of refuge to which 
     <lb/>
     crowned heads, as well as the victims of 
     <lb/>
     their misrule, can alike flee for safety in the 
     <lb/>
     hour of their misfortune. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     have no hesitation, MR. SPEAKER, in en<lb break="no"/>dorsing the scheme before us. I do so 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          
     because I believe its leading principles are 
     <lb/>
     in harmony with the principles upon which 
     <lb/>
     the British constitutional system is founded, 
     <lb/>
     and because I think it is a fair arrangement 
     <lb/>
     between all the provinces; and, as an Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, I accept it because I think it 
     <lb/>
     concedes to us the <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> we are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     occupy. I accept it, further, because of the 
     <lb/>
     prospect it holds out to us of building up a 
     <lb/>
     great nationality here, and of handing down 
     <lb/>
     to our children institutions which our  
     <lb/>
     fathers have bought with their blood. (Loud

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, the 
     <lb/>
     intelligence received from New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     since the last sitting has caused the question 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, now under discussion, to 
     <lb/>
     lose much of its interest. Every one is now 
     <lb/>
     convinced that it is a question which no 
     <lb/>
     longer has any real existence, and which 
     <lb/>
     may safely be shelved for some time to come 
     <lb/>
     at all events. I deem it, however, to be my 
     <lb/>
     duty to make a few observations in reply to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Montmorency, and to 
     <lb/>
     allude in passing to the speech of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General East (Honorable Mr. 
     <lb/>
     LANGEVIN). The honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency began his speech by saying 
     <lb/>
     that the members of this House ought 
     <lb/>
     to raise their views above all paltry consid<lb break="no"/>erations of a personal or party character, 
     <lb/>
     and discuss the question of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     upon its own merits, that thereby its advan<lb break="no"/>tages or disadvantages might be made ap<lb break="no"/>parent. And yet the honorable member has 
     <lb/>
     devoted at least one-third of his speech to 
     <lb/>
     calling to mind and discussing what I may 
     <lb/>
     or may not have said in past times. I have 
     <lb/>
     already said, and I repeat it, that I defy any 
     <lb/>
     member of this House to cite a single passage 
     <lb/>
     from any one of my speeches, or one single 
     <lb/>
     line of anything I may have ever written, to 
     <lb/>
     prove that I have ever been in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. In order to produce a semblance 
     <lb/>
     of proof, and with the view of making me 
     <lb/>
     contradict myself, it has been necessary to 
     <lb/>
     torture my words, to falsify my speeches, to 
     <lb/>
     make false translations of them ; and even 
     <lb/>
     then with all the skill that has been used, the 
     <lb/>
     attempt has been unsuccessful. The speech 
     <lb/>
     which has been quoted with the greatest 
     <lb/>
    complacency, to shew that I was in favor of 
     <lb/>the Confederation of all the provinces, is 
     <lb/>that which I delivered on the 3rd May, 
     <lb/>1860. This speech, which occupied nearly 
     <lb/>two hours in its delivery, was reported in 
     <lb/>about twenty-five lines of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Morning 
     <lb/>Chronicle</hi>, and only occupied a column in 
     <lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror of Parliament</hi>. These two re<lb break="no"/>ports are completely at variance one with 
     <lb/>the other, and neither of them is exact ; but 
     <lb/>they are sufficient, nevertheless, to estab<lb break="no"/>lish the contrary of what it has been 
     <lb/>tried to prove. When it was desired to 
     <lb/>shew that I was in favor of representation 
     <lb/>based upon population, a part of the report 
     <lb/>in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror</hi> has been cited, and when it is 
     <lb/>sought to establish that I was in favor of 
     <lb/>Confederation, the report of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chronicle</hi> 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
      

     is triumphantly brought forward. But the 
     <lb/>
     portion of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror</hi> report, which is cited 
     <lb/>
     in relation to representation, is so absurd 
     <lb/>
    that it suffices to read it to be convinced that 
     <lb/>I could never have made use of the expres<lb break="no"/>sions which it contains. For instance, on 
     <lb/>the occasion of a discussion which has but 
     <lb/>an incidental relation to representation based 
     <lb/>on population, but which relates to a Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the two provinces, I am made 
     <lb/>to say that I have always been opposed to 
     <lb/>representation by population, but that if 
     <lb/>Upper Canada desired to have it, that I was 
     <lb/>ready to concede it. This is nearly the 
     <lb/>contrary of what I said on that occasion, for 
     <lb/>I invariably make my speeches coincide with 
     <lb/>my votes ; and as I have invariably voted 
     <lb/>against every proposition tending to the 
     <lb/>concession of representation based upon 
     <lb/>population, so I have never declared that I 
     <lb/>was in favor of that measure, but on the 
     <lb/>contrary, I have always declared that Lower 
     <lb/>Canada could never consent to such a 
     <lb/>proposition, because it offered no guarantee 
     <lb/>for her institutions. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>now that the question of Confederation is 
     <lb/>under discussion, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror</hi> report is set 
     <lb/>aside and that of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chronicle</hi> is quoted. 
     <lb/>This report made me say, in substance, that 
     <lb/>I looks upon the Federal union of Upper 
     <lb/>and Lower Canada as the nucleus of the 
     <lb/>great Confederation of the British North 
     <lb/>American Provinces, that every one foresaw 
     <lb/>must sooner or later be effected. The 
     <lb/>expression used in the report is " to which 
     <lb/>all looked forward." The hen. member for 
     <lb/>Montmorency, who has brought this report 
     <lb/>to light, although he could not be ignorant 
     <lb/>that an entirely different one was contained 
     <lb/>in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mirror of Parliament</hi>, has given the 
     <lb/>text of it by substituting the word " he " 
     <lb/>for the word " all," and as translated it so 
     <lb/>as to make me say, in speaking of the 
     <lb/>Confederation of all the provinces, " <hi rendition="simple:italic">que je 
     <lb/>l'appelais de tous mes vœux</hi>," and in trans<lb break="no"/>lating this last expression into English, in 
     <lb/>the pamphlet written by him in 1865, he 
     <lb/>makes me say, " which (Confederation) I 
     <lb/>strongly desire to see." It is enough to

     He urged that the principle of the double ma<lb break="no"/>jority could only be applied by giving to each

     section of the province the contral of its local

     much as did those of Upper and Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     it was the only way to govern them in a satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory manner. He hoped, however, that a time 
     <lb/>
     might come when it would be desirable to effect 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation with the Lower Provinces, but 
     <lb/>
     the time had not yet arrived for a measure of this

     kind.

     But those who were in favor of a Fede<lb break="no"/>ral union of all the provinces ought to bear in 
     <lb/>
     mind that a Federal union between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada was the best means of establishing 
     <lb/>
     a nucleus around which the great Confederation 
     <lb/>
     might be formed when the proper time arrived.

     If in this citation the word "believed" were 
     <lb/>
     substituted for the word " hoped," my idea 
     <lb/>
    would be correctly given, in very nearly the 
     <lb/>language I made use of in May, 1860. As 
     <lb/>is quite clear, there is a great difference be<lb break="no"/>tween what I said and the report given by 
     <lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chronicle</hi>, which the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Montmorency has been obliged to disguise in 
     <lb/>citing it, and which he has translated in the 
     <lb/>most absurd manner, and all to make it 
     <lb/>appear that I had expressed myself in a 
     <lb/>manner favorable to Confederation, and 
     <lb/>thereby shew that I have contradicted my<lb break="no"/>self. That I may have declared that at some 
     <lb/>future period, when the population of the 
     <lb/>different provinces should have so increased 
     <lb/>as to render the settlements contiguous, when 
     <lb/>the means of communication should have 
     <lb/>been improved, and when, by commercial in<lb break="no"/>tercourse, our interests should have become 
     <lb/>identical, and the different populations 
     <lb/>should constitute, so to speak, one united 
     <lb/>people, it might be of advantage to have a 
     <lb/>Confederation of all the provinces, this I am 
     <lb/>quite willing to admit; but there is a great 
     <lb/>difference between this anticipation and the 
     <lb/>expression of a desire for a Confederation to 
     <lb/>which I have always been opposed, because 
     <lb/>I did not consider it advisable under present 
     <lb/>circumstances. I find no change in the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances of the country to lead me now 
     <lb/>to desire what I expressed my disap<lb break="no"/>proval of in 1860. I again assert that 
     <lb/>I no more pronounced myself in favor 
     <lb/>of Confederation then than I have since ; 
     <lb/>only speaking of a proposition for establish<lb break="no"/>ing a Confederation of the two Canadas, 
     <lb/>and after several members had spoken in 
     <lb/>favor of a Confederation of all the provinces, 
     <lb/>I made use of the very natural argument,<lb/>"That for those who desired the great<lb/> 
        Confederation, there could be no objection 
     <lb/>to the proposition then under consideration, 
     <lb/>because that Confederation would be the 
     <lb/>nucleus around which the other provinces 
     <lb/>  


            <cb/>


     might gather when the proper time arrived." 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Montmorency has spoken 
     <lb/>
     of the contradictions which he has imagined to 
     <lb/>
     exist between the opinions which I expressed 
     <lb/>
     in 1856, 1858 and 1860, and those which I 
     <lb/>
     entertain at the present time on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the Confederation of the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     But these contradictions do not really exist. 
     <lb/>
     I have never expressed an opinion in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a Confederation of all the provinces, but of 
     <lb/>
     the two Canadas only, and that Confederation 
     <lb/>
     to which I would have agreed as a remedy 
     <lb/>
     for the difficulties created by the question of 
     <lb/>
     the representation, had no resemblance what<lb break="no"/>ever to that which is now proposed to us. 
     <lb/>
     By that plan Lower Canada would have had 
     <lb/>
     complete control of all her local affairs ; 
     <lb/>
     under the present scheme her control is 
     <lb/>
     surrounded by so many restrictions, that in 
     <lb/>
     fact it is the central government which has 
     <lb/>
     the control, not only of what relates to all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, but also of what may relate 
     <lb/>
     to one of the provinces only. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Before speaking of contradictions, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Montmorency ought to bear in 
     <lb/>
     mind that he is more vulnerable on this 
     <lb/>
     head than any one else. He ought to 
     <lb/>
     remember his two pamphlets—one published 
     <lb/>
     in 1858, and the other in 1865 ; one going 
     <lb/>
     to prove the absurdity of a Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     all the British North American Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and the other pointing out the advantages 
     <lb/>
     we should derive from such a Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     In the first of these pamphlets the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber, after having proposed 27 questions with a 
     <lb/>
     view to examine under all its different aspects 
     <lb/>
     the question of a Federal union of the two 
     <lb/>
     Canadas and that of a Federal or Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union of all the provinces, rejects alike both 
     <lb/>
     these projects, because he only saw in them 
     <lb/>
     the annihilation of Lower Canada. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member was so thoroughly convinced of 
     <lb/>
     that, that of all the propositions he gave the 
     <lb/>
     preference to a legislative union, because it 
     <lb/>
     would come to an end all the sooner. He 
     <lb/>
     found it more logical, looking at the imme<lb break="no"/>diate results of the union. "In fact, if we 
     <lb/>
     must have a union of some kind of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and if Lower Canada is destined 
     <lb/>
     to lose the little influence which she yet exer<lb break="no"/>cises on legislation under the existing union, 
     <lb/>
     it would be better to attain our object by a 
     <lb/>
     machinery more simple, less complicated 
     <lb/>
     and less costly." An a little further on he 
     <lb/>
     adds, " As far as we are concerned, we are 
     <lb/>
     opposed to it. We want no union under 
     <lb/>
     any form, as it is certain to attain the same 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="684" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0684.jpg"/>

     end, no matter under what form it may be 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon us." That is the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     at which the hon. member arrived in 1858, 
     <lb/>
     after a careful examination of the whole 
     <lb/>
     question. In 1865, matters are completely 
     <lb/>
     changed, and the hon. member has discover<lb break="no"/>ed that the only possible safety for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada is to be found in that very Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the provinces which he 
     <lb/>
     rejected with all his might in 1858. This 
     <lb/>
     is the conclusion at which he arrived in his 
     <lb/>
     latest pamphlet. "After having carefully 
     <lb/>
     considered the various schemes of union 
     <lb/>
     with their various conditions of existence we, 
     <lb/>
     have proved that Confederation was, in our 
     <lb/>
     present circumstances, the system best calcu<lb break="no"/>lated for our protection and for securing our 
     <lb/>
     prosperity in the future." The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Montmorency explains this complete 
     <lb/>
     change in his views since 1858, as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Until lately we admit we were more in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a Confederation of the two Canadas than of 
     <lb/>
     the grander scheme, because then we had no 
     <lb/>
     national aspirations, and we believed that we 
     <lb/>
     should find in it more protection for the interests 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada. We acted as though we had

     to deal with present or probable enemies, and

     like a good tactician we desired to have as few

     our constant communications during the sittings of

     So that the mere contact which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member enjoyed with the political men of 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces, during the fifteen 
     <lb/>
     days they were here, has been sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     dispel all his apprehensions for the fate of the 
     <lb/>
     institutions of Lower Canada in the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the provinces. It is the 
     <lb/>
     confidence with which these gentlemen have 
     <lb/>
     inspired him, and not the guarantees offered 
     <lb/>
     by the plan of Confederation, which have 
     <lb/>
     changed his opinions of 1858. I find in the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journal de Québec</hi>, a newspaper edited by 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Montmorency, a 
     <lb/>
     few very amusing passages upon the question 
     <lb/>
     of the confidence which ought to be reposed 
     <lb/>
     in political friends. These articles also date 
     <lb/>
     from 1858. The honorable member was 
     <lb/>
     then in opposition. It is true that he did 
     <lb/>
     not look at the honorable member for South 
     <lb/>
     Oxford and myself in such an unfavorable light 
     <lb/>
     as he has since done. At that time he was 
     <lb/>
     laying the whip pretty severely upon the 
     <lb/>
     shoulders of his present friends. But the 
     <lb/>
     doctrines he then held appear to be still 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        

     applicable. On the 26th of August, 1858, 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member wrote an article under 
     <lb/>
     the heading "<hi rendition="simple:italic">Les Amis les Ennemis</hi>," in

     The hon. member for Montmorency then

     proceeded to speak of his present friends, 
     <lb/>
     and of the excuses offered by the Ministe<lb break="no"/>rial supporters for blindly voting for and 
     <lb/>
     approving whatever their friends desired 
     <lb/>
     them to vote for. Did an Orangeman de<lb break="no"/>mand anything at which their Catholic con<lb break="no"/>sciences might take alarm, their consciences 
     <lb/>
     were soon quieted by the fact that " it was 
     <lb/>
     a friend," and the Orangeman obtained at 
     <lb/>
     once what he sought; and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Montmorency declared that all this had 
     <lb/>
     been done by a power which had soiled and 
     <lb/>
     corrupted everything in the order of morality 
     <lb/>
     and political integrity. Now, he heartily 
     <lb/>
     approves of all that he then held to be abomin<lb break="no"/>able and atrocious, so long as it was pro<lb break="no"/>posed by his friends. Then he was opposed 
     <lb/>
     to Confederation of any kind, because it was 
     <lb/>
     a certain means of obliterating the influence 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, and he preferred a legis<lb break="no"/>lative union to a Confederation. But now 
     <lb/>
     his friends propose a Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, and he heartily approves of 
     <lb/>
     it. I quote again from what he said on the

     During this session Confederation was found to 
     <lb/>
     be so unpopular, that Mr. GALT did not dare to 
     <lb/>
     ask a vote on his informal resolutions. But 
     <lb/>
     hardly had he obtained power and his views 
     <lb/>
     were triumphant, and Canada is to bow her head 
     <lb/>

     that of Mr. GALT on the same subject, and yet the

            <p>
     At that time the enemies, that is to say the 
     <lb/>
     present friends of the hon. member, were 
     <lb/>
     desirous of changing the Constitution with<lb break="no"/>out consulting the people, and he considered 
     <lb/>
     that an atrocity; but now they propose to 
     <lb/>
     effect a revolution in our political institu<lb break="no"/>tions without giving the people an opportu<lb break="no"/>nity of pronouncing on their scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Montmorency warmly 
     <lb/>
     approves. It seems, when the other day I 
     <lb/>
     asserted that this scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     was planned by the Grand Trunk Company, 
     <lb/>
     that I did but express the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Montmorency. It was he 
     <lb/>
     who first made this assertion, and not I. 
     <lb/>
     "If the Grand Trunk," said he, " wants 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, we are sure to have it." In 
     <lb/>
     those days his <hi rendition="simple:italic">friends</hi> the <hi rendition="simple:italic">enemies</hi> desired to 
     <lb/>
     sell the country; now he seeks to save it by 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same means that they took to 
     <lb/>
     ruin it. Now he no longer seeks to ascer<lb break="no"/>tain whether the plan of Confederation is 
     <lb/>
     good or bad; he only looks to see that it comes 
     <lb/>
     from his friends, and that is sufficient to secure 
     <lb/>
     for it his hearty approval. This scheme be<lb break="no"/>ing proposed by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">friends</hi> and supporters of 
     <lb/>
     good principles, it cannot contain anything 
     <lb/>
     that may endanger the institutions of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) But 
     <lb/>
     formerly it was quite a different matter, when 
     <lb/>
     the same scheme was proposed by <hi rendition="simple:italic">enemies</hi>, the 
     <lb/>
     present friends of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency. What constitutes the excel<lb break="no"/>lence of this scheme in the eyes of the honor<lb break="no"/>able member, is that it is not submitted by 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">rouges</hi> or annexationists, but by the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of good principles, the guardians of 
     <lb/>
     the interests of Lower Canada. (Hear, hear, 
     <lb/>
     and laughter.) Besides, the delegates from the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, whom he had looked upon as 
     <lb/>
     enemies to Lower Canada, inspired him with 
     <lb/>
     such confidence during the dinners and balls of 
     <lb/>
     the Conference, as to have removed any appre<lb break="no"/>hensions under which the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     might before have labored. He told us so 
     <lb/>
     himself. For my part I do not believe that 
     <lb/>
     the communication which the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber enjoyed with the delegates from the Lower 
     <lb/>

     Provinces during their sojourn here had the 
     <lb/>
     effect of changing his opinion on this question. 
     <lb/>
     He looked to see from what side the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion came, and seeing that it came from the 
     <lb/>
     side on which his friends sat, he was at once 
     <lb/>
     convinced that it contained nothing that could 
     <lb/>
     endanger the institutions of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     It is evident that he votes for it with certain<lb break="no"/>ty. In 1858 he reproached those members 
     <lb/>
     who, like the honorable member for Mont<lb break="no"/>calm (Mr. Jos. DUFRESNE), look quietly to see 
     <lb/>
     from which side measures come before pro<lb break="no"/>nouncing upon them, with only thinking 
     <lb/>
     and acting according to word of command 
     <lb/>
     given by the present Ministers. Has not 
     <lb/>
     he also been obliged to write a pamphlet 
     <lb/>
     of 150 pages in 1865 to refute the one 
     <lb/>
     of forty pages which he then wrote?  Then 
     <lb/>
     he held to be absurd all that was connected, 
     <lb/>
     either nearly or remotely, with Confederation ; 
     <lb/>
     now he holds everything to be right and per<lb break="no"/>fect ; he is quite satisfied, and gets the promise 
     <lb/>
     of all his members to vote for the scheme be<lb break="no"/>fore us without amendment. He throws his 
     <lb/>
     hat in the air and exclaims—" Let us vote for 
     <lb/>
     Confederation and for our friends." (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) That honorable member 
     <lb/>
     may be able to discover contradictions in my 
     <lb/>
     conduct. He sees a mote in his neighbor's 
     <lb/>
     eyes and seeth not the beam in his own. But 
     <lb/>
     let us continue our examination of that pamph<lb break="no"/>let of 1858. It contains most precious inform<lb break="no"/>ation. At page 15 I find the following pas<lb break="no"/>sage :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The best possible condition under which Con<lb break="no"/>federation could exist, would be that in which 
     <lb/>
     the two chambers would be elected and would 
     <lb/>
     both have population as the basis of their num<lb break="no"/>ber, for no other system excepting that of having 
     <lb/>
     but one chamber only with the number of its 
     <lb/>
     members based on population, would give us ab<lb break="no"/>solutely one vote in three in the Federal <choice><sic>Legis<lb break="no"/>ture</sic><corr>Legislation</corr></choice>. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     So in 1858 he found that the best we could 
     <lb/>
     hope for, under Confederation, was that we 
     <lb/>
     might have two elective chambers, with a num<lb break="no"/>ber of members proportioned to the popula<lb break="no"/>tion in each province, which would have given 
     <lb/>
     us one vote in three. It was the elective 
     <lb/>
     system, with representation based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation in each chamber. In view of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the provinces, that plan was 
     <lb/>
     decidedly better than the one now proposed 
     <lb/>
     to us, in which Lower Canada is only to have 
     <lb/>
     65 out of 194 in the Lower House, and 24 
     <lb/>
     out of 76 in the Legislative Council, less 
     <lb/>
     than the proportion which we should have 
     <lb/>
     had under the elective system, without taking 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
        

     into account, that as the legislative council<lb break="no"/>lors are to be appointed by the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, Lower Canada will exercise but 
     <lb/>
     little influence as regards the appointment of 
     <lb/>
     her councillors. But let us see what the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Montmorency now thinks 
     <lb/>
     of the elective system. After having, in 1856, 
     <lb/>
     himself brought in the bill to render the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council elective, and having thus 
     <lb/>
     done more than anyone else to effect the 
     <lb/>
     change which then took place in the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of that body, and after having, in 
     <lb/>
     1858, declared in writing that " the best pos<lb break="no"/>sible terms that could be obtained in Confed<lb break="no"/>eration would be the making of the two 
     <lb/>
     chambers elective," in 1865 he says, at 
     <lb/>
     page 65 of his second pamphlet :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It was in obedience to the general sentiment, 
     <lb/>
     and not by conviction, that he who now writes 
     <lb/>
     gave up, in 1856, an opinion which he had always 
     <lb/>
     held, and himself drafted the present constitution 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Council, and it is with genuine 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction, and a conviction strengthened by 
     <lb/>
     experience, that we greet the revival of the 
     <lb/>
     principle of Crown nomination to theLegislative 
     <lb/>
     Council under conditions superior to those of 
     <lb/>
     former times. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     It would seem, then, that in 1856 the honor<lb break="no"/>able member altered the Constitution, not as 
     <lb/>
     the result of conviction, and because he con<lb break="no"/>sidered it was defective, but in obedience to 
     <lb/>
     the general sentiment ; that is to say, that 
     <lb/>
     being a Minister, he did not wish to displease 
     <lb/>
     his friends, who demanded that this change 
     <lb/>
     should be made, and that, rather than sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     his portfolio as a Minister, he preferred to 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice his principles and convictions. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear,  and aughter.) Now, the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member has no other sacrifice to make than 
     <lb/>
     that of his personal dignity ; this is but a 
     <lb/>
     trifling one ; and he returns to his old opinions, 
     <lb/>
     so as not to displease his present friends. 
     <lb/>
     He clung to power in 1856 ; to-day he pays 
     <lb/>
     homage to it ; that is the whole difference. 
     <lb/>
     When the wind blew in the direction of re<lb break="no"/>form, the honorable member was a Reformer, 
     <lb/>
     not from conviction but from interest ; and 
     <lb/>
     when it blows in the direction of absolutism, 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member becomes by instinct a 
     <lb/>
     Conservative and a Tory. So he who, in 
     <lb/>
     1856, obtained the passing of an act to render 
     <lb/>
     the Council elective ; who, in 1858, again pro<lb break="no"/>nounced himself in favor of the elective prin<lb break="no"/>ciple as applied to the Council, tells us in 1865 
     <lb/>
     that he greets with genuine satisfaction the 
     <lb/>
     revival of the principle of Crown nomination 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Councillors. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Ministers went on their knees to the Lower 
     <lb/>

     Provinces beseeching them to come to an 
     <lb/>
     understanding as regarded a change of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, and with respect to a scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation.  Explanations were the result, 
     <lb/>
     which have only been given on a few impor<lb break="no"/>tant points ; the delegates of the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, after having obtained the most favor<lb break="no"/>able financial stipulations for those whom they 
     <lb/>
     represented, have still further imposed their 
     <lb/>
     views and have modified the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation in a manner at variance with the 
     <lb/>
     views of our Ministers; and yet, after the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces have repudiated the action of 
     <lb/>
     their delegates, the Government still obstin<lb break="no"/>ately persists in obtaining the adoption of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme without any amendment whatsoever. 
     <lb/>
     If that resolution passes, we shall ask England 
     <lb/>
     to change our Constitution, and to give us 
     <lb/>
     one which will not be in accordance with the 
     <lb/>
     views of our ministers, and still less with those 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this province. But let us see 
     <lb/>
     what the honorable member for Montmorency 
     <lb/>
     said in 1858 on this subject. I cite from 
     <lb/>
    page 12:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     To ask England to change the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     is to give her an opportunity of changing it to 
     <lb/>
     suit her own views or those of our enemies. Nay, 
     <lb/>
     more, to ask that we should take the first step is 
     <lb/>
     to claim it for all the provinces, it is to call upon 
     <lb/>
     them too to say upon what conditions they will 
     <lb/>
     accept the Federal union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But in the conflict of all these voices one only 
     <lb/>
     will never be heard from the Imperial Throne, 
     <lb/>
     because it would be in the French language. It 
     <lb/>
     is no prejudice, it is but the history of our fifty 
     <lb/>
     years of trial and sorrow.

     Have circumstances so greatly changed since 
     <lb/>
     1858 ? What has occurred since that period 
     <lb/>
     to give the honorable member for Montmorency 
     <lb/>
    more confidence now in the justice of England, 
     <lb/>or in the efficacy of our petitions than he then 
     <lb/>had ? Is not the history of our fifty years of 
     <lb/>sufferings vivid in the memories of all ? When 
     <lb/>we asked the Imperial Government to change 
     <lb/>the constitution of the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>did they not unnecessarily, and without our 
     <lb/>having sought it, repeal the clause which ren<lb break="no"/>dered necessary a two-thirds vote to change 
     <lb/>the basis of the representation ? That safe<lb break="no"/>guard of the interests of Lower Canada was 
     <lb/>taken away from us without our knowing, 
     <lb/>and at the present moment we do not know 
     <lb/>at whose instance that clause of the Union Act 
     <lb/>was expunged. Have we not similar reason 
     <lb/>to fear that they may impose on Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada a new Constitution, with conditions which 
     <lb/>will encroach upon the rights solemnly guar<lb break="no"/>anteed to us by treaty? And this is the more 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
        

     probable from the fact that, this scheme having 
     <lb/>
    been rejected by the Lower Provinces, England 
     <lb/>will not be desirous of enforcing it upon 
     <lb/>them, and that if it is adopted by the Imperial 
     <lb/>Parliament, it can only be so adopted with 
     <lb/>such modifications as will make it applicable 
     <lb/>to Canada alone, leaving to the Lower Prov<lb break="no"/>inces the right of accepting it hereafter ; and 
     <lb/>Heaven alone knows what these modifications 
     <lb/>will be, and how they may affect our institu<lb break="no"/>tions. (Hear. hear.) If the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament thinks proper to take up this Consti<lb break="no"/>tution without the acceptance of it by the 
     <lb/>Maritime Provinces, it will come back to us, 
     <lb/>as did the answer to the Address in relation 
     <lb/>to the Legislative Council, entirely different 
     <lb/>from the Address we are about to vote.

     in this new Constitution which is to be given 
     <lb/>

     upon us. (Hear, hear.) And this is the

     The object of Confederation is external pro<lb break="no"/>tection ; it can defend itself from enemies from

     <lb/>
     itself. It was not with a view to social improve<lb break="no"/>ment, not to attain a more perfect and complete

     internal political organization, that the American

     a necessity of the Federal system; and if Lower

     I think I need say no more. I think that 
     <lb/>
     the reasons adduced by the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Montmorency from the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dian point of view, against the union of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces in 1858, exist at the present day, 
     <lb/>
     and that they have greater force now than 
     <lb/>
     they had then ; and this is the more evident 
     <lb/>
     when we see all the members from Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada declare that Confederation is not 
     <lb/>
     what they want, but that they would prefer 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union. This fact ought to add 
     <lb/>
     to our alarm, and convince us of the danger to 
     <lb/>
     which we should be exposed by this union. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member for Montmorency now 
     <lb/>
     encourages his friends to proceed to England 
     <lb/>
     and obtain its adoption by the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and its imposition on the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces as well as upon Canada. It is an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to Great Britain to pass a measure 
     <lb/>
     upon the application of the Canadian Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and to impose it upon the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, after making such modifications to it 
     <lb/>
     as would satisfy them. The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Montmorency, animadverting upon a

            <cb/>
      

     letter which I wrote last autumn to my con<lb break="no"/>stituents, in which I asserted that no prece<lb break="no"/>dent existed for a Federal union between 
     <lb/>
     mere colonies, has cited, in refutation of my 
     <lb/>
     statement, the case of New Zealand. New 
     <lb/>
     Zealand is composed of three islands, divided 
     <lb/>
     into eleven provinces, each of which possesses 
     <lb/>
     a sort of municipal council which is called 
     <lb/>
     a government, just as the municipalities are 
     <lb/>
     called provinces. Each province has a head 
     <lb/>
     or executive officer, elected by the people, 
     <lb/>
     and charged with the carrying out of the 
     <lb/>
     laws. The municipal councils have the power 
     <lb/>
     of legislating, but their powers are restricted 
     <lb/>
     within very narrow limits. They cannot in<lb break="no"/>terfere even with the laws relating to wills 
     <lb/>
     and successions, whilst, on the other hand, the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government has the right to legislate 
     <lb/>
     on all matters affecting the colony. The po<lb break="no"/>litical system of New Zealand is exactly like 
     <lb/>
     our county and parish municipal system. 
     <lb/>
     Our county municipalities represent the cen<lb break="no"/>tral power, and our parish municipalities re<lb break="no"/>present the local governments. Had the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Montmorency examined the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution of Belgium, he would have seen that 
     <lb/>
     there, there are provinces which each have a 
     <lb/>
     Governor and a Local Parliament, and these 
     <lb/>
     parliaments have much greater powers than 
     <lb/>
     the local councils in New Zealand, and are 
     <lb/>
     much more important; yet no one has ever 
     <lb/>
     ventured to assert that Belgium was a Con<lb break="no"/>federation, although it was divided into pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Neither is the French Empire a Con<lb break="no"/>federation, although its departments are gov<lb break="no"/>erned by <hi rendition="simple:italic">Préfets</hi>. ( Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Montmorency has told us that 
     <lb/>
     our interests would be perfectly protected by 
     <lb/>
     the proposed Constitution. I find that the 
     <lb/>
     powers assigned to the General Parliament 
     <lb/>
     enable it to legislate on all subjects whatso<lb break="no"/>ever. It is an error to imagine that these 
     <lb/>
     powers are defined and limited by the 29th 
     <lb/>
     clause of the resolutions. Were it desirous 
     <lb/>
     of legislating on subjects placed under the 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction of the local legislatures, there is 
     <lb/>
     not a word in these resolutions which can be 
     <lb/>
     construed to prevent it, and if the local legis<lb break="no"/>latures complain, Parliament may turn away 
     <lb/>
     and refuse to hear their complaints, because 
     <lb/>
     all the sovereignty is vested in the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, and there is no authority to de<lb break="no"/>fine its functions and attributes and those of

     moment. I say that the Federal Parliament 
     <lb/>
     will exercise sovereign power, inasmuch as it 
     <lb/>
     can always trespass upon the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     local governments without there being any 
     <lb/>
     authority to prevent it. What authority have 
     <lb/>
     you constituted which can come forward and 
     <lb/>
     say to the Federal Parliament—" You shall

     not do such and such a thing, you shall 
     <lb/>
     not legislate upon such and such a subject, 
     <lb/>
     because these matters are reserved to the local 
     <lb/>
     governments." There will be no such author<lb break="no"/>ity, and consequently it will have sovereign 
     <lb/>
     power, and can do all that it pleases, and may 
     <lb/>
     encroach upon all the rights and attributes of 
     <lb/>
     the local governments whenever it may think 
     <lb/>
     proper. We shall be—I speak as a Lower

     it may exercise its right of veto on all the

     <lb/>
     again we shall have no remedy. In case of

     Parliament is all-powerful, every one admits

     <lb/>
     proposed to give to the Federal Parliament the

     If all the courts of justice are to have the

     or commissioner of small causes setting them 
     <lb/>
     aside, under the pretext that they are not

     <lb/>
     as is now done in the case of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">procès-verbal</hi>

     adopt. If the differences between the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral and the Local Parliaments are not to be

     charged with the decision of matters in dis<lb break="no"/>pute between the legislatures, but they will 
     <lb/>only have to give final judgments in cases de<lb break="no"/>cided by the local inferior courts. Well, for 
     <lb/>my part I cannot approve of the creation of 
     <lb/>this court. The great inconveniences of it 
     <lb/>to us Lower Canadians may easily be seen. 
     <lb/>Thus, when a cause shall have been argued 
     <lb/>and decided in all our courts, we shall still 
     <lb/>have to go before a Federal Court of Appeal 
     <lb/>composed of judges of all the provinces, and 
     <lb/>in which we shall probably have only one 
     <lb/>judge, who may be selected out of the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish population. And this is the protection 
     <lb/>afforded to us. I repeat that I see no protec<lb break="no"/>tion whatever for our interests, as Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, in the constitution of the political and 
     <lb/>judicial powers, for the Federal Parliament 
     <lb/>can encroach upon our rights without any 
     <lb/>authority having the power to interfere, and 
     <lb/>then we shall have a Federal Court of Appeal 
     <lb/>in which we shall only be represented by one 
     <lb/>judge against six or seven of other origins. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) There is another and very 
     <lb/>important question to be considered, and that 
     <lb/>is as to what is meant by paragraph 30 of the 
     <lb/>29th resolution, in relation to marriage and 
     <lb/>divorce. I see, not without apprehension 
     <lb/>that it is left to the General Parliament to 
     <lb/>legislate on all matters relating to marriage 
     <lb/>and divorce. The question of marriage is in<lb break="no"/>timately connected with a large portion of our 
     <lb/>

     code and civil rights, for upon marriage de<lb break="no"/>pends the settlement of family interests and 
     <lb/>
     successions, and the civil condition of the 
     <lb/>
     population. If the right of legislating on all 
     <lb/>
     matters connected with marriage is left to 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Parliament, it will have the 
     <lb/>
     right to declare that a marriage contract<lb break="no"/>ed elsewhere will be valid in the Confed<lb break="no"/>acy, provided it has been contracted in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the laws of the country 
     <lb/>
     in which it took place, as stated by the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Solicitor General East, for it is a 
     <lb/>
     principle of international law perfectly under<lb break="no"/>stood in every country of the civilized Wurld, 
     <lb/>
     and which it would be impossible to alter, 
     <lb/>
     and it was of no use whatever to insert it in 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution. I say, then, that not only 
     <lb/>
     will the Federal Government have this power, 
     <lb/>
     but they will also be able to change the civil 
     <lb/>
     conditions of marriage which now constitute 
     <lb/>
     apart of our code. But if it is sought to 
     <lb/>
     remove from the local legislatures the right of 
     <lb/>
     legislating respecting the conditions under 
     <lb/>
     which a marriage may be contracted, the age 
     <lb/>
     at which marriage is to be allowed, the degree 
     <lb/>
     of relationship which shall be an impediment to 
     <lb/>
     marriage, the consent of the relations, and the 
     <lb/>
     requisite dispensations which are now required 
     <lb/>
     to be obtained from the ecclesiastical authori<lb break="no"/>ties, then I can understand why this article 
     <lb/>
     has been inserted in the resolutions, and that 
     <lb/>
     the right to do all this is to be : vested in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament. If it is desired that a 
     <lb/>
     minor should be allowed to marry, as he can 
     <lb/>
     in countries in which the laws of England 
     <lb/>
    prevail, without the consent of his relations, 
     <lb/>I can conceive the reason for placing the right 
     <lb/>to legislate respecting marriage in the hands 
     <lb/>of the Federal power ; but if that was not the 
     <lb/>object in view, I see no reason why the right 
     <lb/>to legislate on this subjct has not been left 
     <lb/>to the local governments. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>should see with considerable apprehension and 
     <lb/>alarm this power given to the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, because it will be composed of men who 
     <lb/>have ideas entirely at variance with ours in 
     <lb/>relation to marriage. As regards the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of divorce, we have had every kind of 
     <lb/>explanation as to the meaning of the resolution 
     <lb/>of the Conference. The Honorable Solicitor 
     <lb/>General of Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. LANGE<lb break="no"/>VIN), who last year made so great a fuss 
     <lb/>because a divorce suit came before the House, 
     <lb/>and who even moved the rejection of the bill 
     <lb/>at its first reading, has been brought to terms 
     <lb/>on the subject. and has discovred that it 
     <lb/>would be a good thing to have an authority 
     <lb/>for the settlement of this matter. Last year 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
           

     he said that it was impossible for a Catholic 
     <lb/>
     to sanction even the first reading of a divorce 
     <lb/>
     bill, and he made us a long speech on the 
     <lb/>
     subject, but he has found out his mistake, 
     <lb/>
     and he is unwilling that the local legislature 
     <lb/>
     should legislate on divorce, but he vests this 
     <lb/>
     right in the Federal Parliament, and author<lb break="no"/>izes it to do so. He cannot himself legislate, 
     <lb/>
     but he allows another to do so for him. Well, 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that this is any improvement 
     <lb/>
     on the existing state of things, and I think 
     <lb/>
     that divorce is more likely to be prevented by 
     <lb/>
     leaving the subject among the functions of 
     <lb/>
     the local legislatures, at all events as far as 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada is concerned, than by leaving 
     <lb/>
     it to the Federal Parliament. But I go 
     <lb/>
     further, and I say that the leaving of this 
     <lb/>
     question to the Federal Legislature is to in<lb break="no"/>troduce divorce among the Catholics. It is 
     <lb/>
     certain that at present no Catholic could 
     <lb/>
     obtain a divorce either in the present House 
     <lb/>
     or lrom the Local Legislature of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada under Confederation. But suppose that 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Parliament were to enact that 
     <lb/>
     there shall be divorce courts in each section 
     <lb/>
     of the province, the Catholics will have the 
     <lb/>
     same access to them as the Protestants. And 
     <lb/>
     who is to prevent the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>
     from establishing a tribunal of this kind in 
     <lb/>
     Lowu' Canada, if they are established else<lb break="no"/>where? In that case—if tribunals of this 
     <lb/>
     kind are established—will not the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General, if he votes for this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, have voted for the establishment of 
     <lb/>divorce courts over the whole country, to 
     <lb/>which Catholics and Protestants can have 
     <lb/>recourse tor obtaining a divorce ? That is 
     <lb/>the only conclusion it is possible to arrive at, 
     <lb/>and the legitimate consequence of the votes 
     <lb/>of those Catholics who will vote to vest this 
     <lb/>power in the Federal Parliament. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) It is evident that a Catholic who 
     <lb/>thinks that he cannot vote for a Divorce bill 
     <lb/>ought not to vote indirectly for the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of Divorce courts, any more than to vote 
     <lb/>directly for it. The Honorable Solicitor 
     <lb/>General East told us the other day that he 
     <lb/>had recently obtained the annulment of a mar<lb break="no"/>riage, because the parties, being relations, had 
     <lb/>married without dispensation. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—I never 
     <lb/>
     pretended that that was a divorce. I said 
     <lb/>
     that if the case of annulment of marriage to 
     <lb/>
     which I referred had arisen in Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     the Ecclesiastical courts might have declared 
     <lb/>
     the marriage null as far as the canon law was 
     <lb/>
     concerned, but not as regarded the civil laws, 
     <lb/>
     for the law of Upper Canada does not recog<lb break="no"/>

     nize the impediments to marriage provided by 
     <lb/>
     the Canon law, and that the husband and wife 
     <lb/>
     would have been obliged to apply to Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to obtain their separation. And I stated 
     <lb/>
     that this separation could not be looked upon 
     <lb/>
     as a divorce from a Catholic point of view, 
     <lb/>
     although the Act of Parliament might be 
     <lb/>
     called a Divorce bill.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—I can cite 
     <lb/>
     other cases, as, for instance, that of a Catholic

     <lb/>
     marriage that this impediment existed. If 
     <lb/>
     he discovers the fact afterwards, he is not 
     <lb/>
     married as far as the Canon law is concerned. 
     <lb/>
     If the wife is not willing to consent to the 
     <lb/>
     obtaining of the necessary dispensations to 
     <lb/>
     render her marriage valid, she may, in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, apply to the Ecclesiastical court to 
     <lb/>
     have it annulled, but in Upper Canada she

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—It would 
     <lb/>
     be proved before Parliament that the mar<lb break="no"/>riage contracted under these circumstances is 
     <lb/>
     null as regards the Canon law and the law of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. There are ecclesiastical au<lb break="no"/>thorities in Upper Canada just as there are in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, but as the Civil law there is 
     <lb/>
     not the same as it is here, the couple whose 
     <lb/>
     marriage would be void under the Canon law 
     <lb/>
     but not under the Civil law—for in the eyes 
     <lb/>
     of the law the marriage would be valid and 
     <lb/>
     binding, and neither husband nor wife could 
     <lb/>
     remarry without having obtained a divorce— 
     <lb/>
     the couple, I say, would have the right of ap<lb break="no"/>plying to Parliament, who might legally de<lb break="no"/>clare that marriage null which had been so 
     <lb/>
     declared by the ecclesiastical authorities. 
     <lb/>
     But the nullity of the marriage must first be 
     <lb/>
     proved to the satisfaction of the ecclesiastical 
     <lb/>
     authorities and under the Canon law, and 
     <lb/>
     then Parliament might annul it on that evi<lb break="no"/>dence, for it would be omnipotent.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Yes, in 
     <lb/>
     that respect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—But even supposing 
     <lb/>
     that the Federal Parliament would interfere 
     <lb/>
     in such a case, which is a matter of doubt, 
     <lb/>
     the Local Government would also have had 
     <lb/>
     the right to interfere if the power so to do 
     <lb/>
     had been given to it. Moreover, this would 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
          

     not be a case of divorce; it would simply be 
     <lb/>
     the declaration that no marriage had ever 
     <lb/>
     taken place, which is quite a different matter. 
     <lb/>
     In Lower Canada the Canon law forms part 
     <lb/>
     of our Civil law, but in Upper Canada it is 
     <lb/>
     not so, and the law there does not recognize 
     <lb/>
     the right of the ecclesiastical authorities to 
     <lb/>
     declare a marriage null. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     think, then, that the explanation of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General is not of more value than 
     <lb/>
     that which he gave us on the subject of mar<lb break="no"/>riage, for it does not in the least prove that 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Parliament have not the power 
     <lb/>
     to establish Divorce courts in all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and the resolution does not admit of 
     <lb/>
     the construction that the Federal Parliament 
     <lb/>
     will only have the right of declaring void 
     <lb/>
     marriages declared to be so by the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     ecclesiastical authorities. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
    perceive that the subject of immigration is 
     <lb/>left to the General Government, concurrently 
     <lb/>with the local governments. I think that 
     <lb/>danger lies in the provision that the General 
     <lb/>Government is to appoint all our judges. It 
     <lb/>is said, as the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>East stated the other day, that there will be 
     <lb/>French-Canadians in the Executive of the 
     <lb/>Federal Government, but their number will 
     <lb/>be limited, and if the Executive is composed 
     <lb/>of fifteen members for instance, there will 
     <lb/>only be one or two French-Canadians at the 
     <lb/>most. Well, suppose the French-Canadian 
     <lb/>Ministers recommend the appointment of a 
     <lb/>person as judge, and that all their colleagues 
     <lb/>oppose it, the former will have the right to 
     <lb/>protest, but the majority will carry the day, 
     <lb/>and all that the minority can do will be to 
     <lb/>retire from the Government. But in that 
     <lb/>case they will be replaced, and things will go 
     <lb/>on as before. That is all. The same argu<lb break="no"/>ment applies to the appointment of legislative 
     <lb/>councillors; and when I call to mind all the 
     <lb/>injustices committed by the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil of Lower Canada, which was nominated 
     <lb/>by the Crown, and in a spirit hostile to the 
     <lb/>great mass of the population, I cannot con<lb break="no"/>ceive that French-Canadians can be found 
     <lb/>who are willing to return to that system. 
     <lb/>Will they not remember that it was that sys<lb break="no"/>tem which closed our common schools, by re<lb break="no"/>fusing to vote the supplies granted by the 
     <lb/>Legislative Assembly, and thereby delayed, 
     <lb/>for years and years, the progress of education 
     <lb/>in Lower Canada. The honorable member 
     <lb/>for Montmorency says that we must have a 
     <lb/>conservative chamber, and that our Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council. under Confederation, will be 
     <lb/>less conservative than the Belgian Senate, be<lb break="no"/>
           

            <pb n="693" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0693.jpg"/>

cause the elective qualification of the Belgian 
     <lb/>
     senators is higher than that of our legislative 
     <lb/>
     councillors. The Belgian Senate is elected 
     <lb/>
     for eight years, and is renewed by one-fourth 
     <lb/>
     at a time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—Every four years, 
     <lb/>
     by one-half. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Yes; the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member is right. The term for which each 
     <lb/>
     senator is elected is eight years, and the 
     <lb/>
     elections take place for one-half of them every 
     <lb/>
     four years, and another change in the compo<lb break="no"/>sition of the Senate can also take place, because 
     <lb/>
     it may be dissolved like the Lower House. 
     <lb/>
     Now, under these circumstances, there can be 
     <lb/>
     no clashing of any duration between the two 
     <lb/>
     Belgian Chambers, and the Senate cannot 
     <lb/>
     obstruct, for an indefinite period, the action of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower House. If a difference should 
     <lb/>
     arise between the two bodies, the Government 
     <lb/>
     can remedy it by new elections, by which 
     <lb/>
     senators would be returned favorable to the 
     <lb/>
     views of the people. Thus the Senate is not 
     <lb/>
     conservative, from the sole fact of the 
     <lb/>
     electoral qualification of the senators being 
     <lb/>
     very high. What I consider excessive and of 
     <lb/>
     a too conservative character in the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Legislative Council of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation, is that no power exists which can 
     <lb/>
     change its composition in the case of a col<lb break="no"/>lision between it and the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. The councillors will be appointed for 
     <lb/>
     life, and their number is fixed. By what 
     <lb/>
     means shall we be able to prevent the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council from stopping the progress of 
     <lb/>
     business if a difference should arise with the 
     <lb/>
     Lower House? The honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency says that the obstacle will be 
     <lb/>
     broken down; but if no other remedy than 
     <lb/>
     that is provided, I say that the principle is 
     <lb/>
     faulty. It does not do, when we frame a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, to open the door to obstacles 
     <lb/>
     which can only be surmounted by breaking 
     <lb/>
     them down. (Hear, hear.) In England, 
     <lb/>
     where the House of Lords is very conserva<lb break="no"/>tive, the Crown has power to name new peers, 
     <lb/>
     and it is precisely the possession of that 
     <lb/>
     power of creating new peers which has pre<lb break="no"/>vented the breaking down of the obstacle— 
     <lb/>
     which prevented a revolution in 1832. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montmorency himself 
     <lb/>
     admits that at that period England was on 
     <lb/>
     the eve of a revolution, and that it would 
     <lb/>
     have happened if the House had any longer 
     <lb/>
     refused to sanction the measures of reform 
     <lb/>
     passed by the House of Commons and de<lb break="no"/>manded by the people; and that revolution 
     <lb/>
     was only avoide because the King, having 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     declared that he would create new peers, a 
     <lb/>
     certain number of the lords, to escape this 
     <lb/>
     danger, absented themselves and permitted 
     <lb/>
     the passing of the Parliamentary Reform 
     <lb/>
     Bill. (Hear, hear.) There are two or three 
     <lb/>
     other matters which are left to the joint juris<lb break="no"/>diction of the Federal and Local Legislatures, 
     <lb/>
     such as agriculture, emigration, and the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries; but the laws of the Federal Par<lb break="no"/>liament will always prevail in these matters 
     <lb/>
     over those of the local parliaments; thus, for 
     <lb/>
     instance, a Local Legislature may pass a law 
     <lb/>
     in relation to agriculture, but it may be over<lb break="no"/>ridden the next day by a law of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. (Hear, hear.) I shall not 
     <lb/>
     touch upon the question of the finances, but I 
     <lb/>
     must say that the figures given by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General East do not agree with 
     <lb/>
     those in the Public Accounts. I do not know  
     <lb/>
     where he obtained them, but for my part I 
     <lb/>
     have been unable to find them. When I 
     <lb/>
     enquired whether Lower Canada was to 
     <lb/>
     pay the Municipal Loan Fund debt, he 
     <lb/>
     did not think proper to answer. When I 
     <lb/>
     asked the Hon. Minister of Finance whether 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada would be charged with the 
     <lb/>
     debt contracted for the redemption of the 
     <lb/>
     Seigniorial dues, with the Common School 
     <lb/>
     Fund, the Municipal Loan Fund, and the in<lb break="no"/>demnity payable to the townships, amount<lb break="no"/>ing in the whole to $4,500,000, he re<lb break="no"/>plied that he would bring down a pro<lb break="no"/>position at some future period for the 
     <lb/>
     settlement of these questions, but he has not 
     <lb/>
     thought proper to give any explanations. 
     <lb/>
     Well, I have stated that besides the debt of 
     <lb/>
     $67,000,000 due by the province, there are 
     <lb/>
     more than $3,000,000 due to Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     as compensation for the Seigniorial indemnity, 
     <lb/>
     and that in fixing at $62,500,000 the debt 
     <lb/>
     to be assumed by the Federal Government, 
     <lb/>
     there will remain about $9,000,000 to divide 
     <lb/>
     between Upper and Lower Canada. With 
     <lb/>
     the amount of the Municipal Loan Fund 
     <lb/>
     debt and of the other items which I have 
     <lb/>
     mentioned, Lower Canada will find herself 
     <lb/>
     charged with a local debt of $4,500,000. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) When we entered the union 
     <lb/>
     we had a debt of $500,000; we have expend<lb break="no"/>ed since the union, on public works in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, about $13,000,000, and we go out of 
     <lb/>
     the union with a debt of $27,500,000 as our 
     <lb/>
     proportion of the Federal debt, besides our 
     <lb/>
     own special debt of $4,500,000, whilst Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada will go out of it without any local 
     <lb/>
     debt on giving up the indemnity to which 
     <lb/>
     she is entitled under the Seigniorial Act of 
     <lb/>
     1859. Well, I assert that it is an unjust 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="694" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0694.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">694</fw>
          

     treaty, and that it is also unfair that the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry should refuse us all explanations on 
     <lb/>
     this point, before we are called upon to give 
     <lb/>
     our votes on the resolutions. (Hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Solicitor General East told us the other 
     <lb/>
     day that in the plan of Confederation which 
     <lb/>
     I had proposed for the two Canadas, I intend<lb break="no"/>ed to leave the administration and ownership 
     <lb/>
     of the Crown lands to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and he said that under Confederation 
     <lb/>
     the Crown lands would belong to the local 
     <lb/>
     governments, and this, in his opinion, was a 
     <lb/>
     great improvement on the plan which I pro<lb break="no"/>posed. Well, it must be observed that a very 
     <lb/>
     large amount is due on sales of Crown lands; 
     <lb/>
     there is about $1,000,000 due in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and $5,000,000 or $6,000,000 in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. If these lands had remained in the 
     <lb/>
     union there would have been about one million 
     <lb/>
     from Lower Canada, and five or six millions 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada towards the payment of 
     <lb/>
     the general debt. We should have benefited to 
     <lb/>
     that amount by the extinction of so much of 
     <lb/>
     the public debt; instead of that, under the 
     <lb/>
     plan of the Government, Upper Canada is to 
     <lb/>
     have the benefit of the five or six millions 
     <lb/>
     due on the lands sold in Upper Canada, whilst 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada will only have one million of 
     <lb/>
     dollars at the outside. If it were only the 
     <lb/>
     public lands, there would be no injustice in 
     <lb/>
     caving them to the local governments, but 
     <lb/>
     the difference in the amounts due on the lands 
     <lb/>
     sold gives a considerable advantage to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. There is another very serious ob<lb break="no"/>jection to the Constitution of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council. The honorable member for Mont<lb break="no"/>morency said that the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     would serve as a protection and safeguard to 
     <lb/>
     the interests of the French-Canadians, be<lb break="no"/>cause in it we would have an equality of 
     <lb/>
     members with the other provinces. A curi<lb break="no"/>ous equality that will be! That of which 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Montmorency spoke 
     <lb/>
     when he pronounced himself in favor of two 
     <lb/>
     elective chambers, because in that case we 
     <lb/>
     should have one member in three, was in<lb break="no"/>finitely preferable. In the Lower House we 
     <lb/>
     shall not have one member in three, nor shall 
     <lb/>
     we in the Upper House either, for we shall 
     <lb/>
     only have twenty-four councillors out of sev<lb break="no"/>enty-six. Thus we shall have equality neither 
     <lb/>
     in the Lower House nor in the Council. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But then the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment will nominate the councillors, and 
     <lb/>
     we shall be in a great minority in the Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive Council. Another objection is that 
     <lb/>
     the nomination of the legislative councillors 
     <lb/>
     on the recommendation of the Executive Coun<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     cil of the General Government, and this offers 
     <lb/>
     no guarantee for the institutions of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, because the predominating influ<lb break="no"/>ence in that Council will not be that of 
     <lb/>
     the majority of Lower Canada. To offer 
     <lb/>
     an effectual guarantee, it would be neces<lb break="no"/>sary that they should be elected by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, or, at all events, only appointed on the 
     <lb/>
     recommendation of the local governments. 
     <lb/>
     These resolutions, we are told, are only as it 
     <lb/>
     were the headings to the chapters of the new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, and the new Constitution may 
     <lb/>
     be anything else than what is now under con<lb break="no"/>sideration. It will come back to us in the 
     <lb/>
     form of an Imperial Act, to which we shall 
     <lb/>
     have <hi rendition="simple:italic">nolentes volentes</hi> to submit. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear) Supposing even that the scheme 
     <lb/>
     should not be modified, I could not approve 
     <lb/>
     it. I cannot with a joyful heart give up the 
     <lb/>
     imprescriptible rights of the people who have 
     <lb/>
     sent me here to represent them. I cannot 
     <lb/>
     consent to a change which is neither more nor 
     <lb/>
     less than a revolution, a political revolution it 
     <lb/>
     is true, but which does not the less, on that 
     <lb/>
     account, affect the rights and interests of a 
     <lb/>
     million of inhabitants, the descendants of the 
     <lb/>
     first settlers in America, of those who have 
     <lb/>
     given their names to the vast regions which 
     <lb/>
     they discovered, and whose careers have been 
     <lb/>
     rendered famous by so many heroic traits. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I am opposed to this Confed<lb break="no"/>eration in which the militia, the appointment 
     <lb/>
     of the judges, the administration of justice 
     <lb/>
     and our most important civil rights, will be 
     <lb/>
     under the control of a General Government 
     <lb/>
     the majority of which will be hostile to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, of a General Government invested 
     <lb/>
     with the most ample powers, whilst the 
     <lb/>
     powers of the local governments will be 
     <lb/>
     restricted, first, by the limitation of the 
     <lb/>
     powers delegated to it, by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">veto</hi> reserved 
     <lb/>
     to the central authority, and further, by the 
     <lb/>
     concurrent jurisdiction of the general author<lb break="no"/>ity or government. Petitions, with more than 
     <lb/>
    20,000 signatures attached to them, have al<lb break="no"/>ready been presented to this House against 
     <lb/>the scheme of Confederation. Numerous pub<lb break="no"/>lic meetings have been held in nineteen 
     <lb/>counties in Lower Canada, and one in the 
     <lb/>city of Montreal. Everywhere this scheme 
     <lb/>has been protested against, and an appeal to 
     <lb/>the people dcmanded; and yet, in defiance of 
     <lb/>the expressed opinions of our constituents, we 
     <lb/>are about to giye them a Constitution, the 
     <lb/>effect of which will be to snatch from them 
     <lb/>the little influence which they still enjoy 
     <lb/>under the existing union. We are about, on 
     <lb/>their behalf, m surrender all the rights and 
     <lb/>

     privileges which are dearest to them, and that 
     <lb/>
     without consulting them. It would be mad<lb break="no"/>ness—it would be more, it would be a crime. 
     <lb/>
     On these grounds I shall oppose this scheme 
     <lb/>
     with all the power at my command, and insist 
     <lb/>
     that under any circumstances it shall be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the people before its final adoption.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName> —Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I received intelligence this evening that the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. member for Hochelaga was about to 
     <lb/>
     reply to my speech of the 2nd of March, and 
     <lb/>
     that is why I came here. Otherwise, as I have 
     <lb/>
     not yet quite recovered, I should have re<lb break="no"/>mained at home ; but I frankly acknowledge 
     <lb/>
     that if I had foreseen that I should have 
     <lb/>
     had to listen to such a speech as that which 
     <lb/>
     we have just heard, I should not have put 
     <lb/>
     myself out of the way for so little. Any one 
     <lb/>
     hearing him speak must have said: " Either 
     <lb/>
     he is not a very powerful reasoner, or this 
     <lb/>
     hon. member has but a poor idea of the 
     <lb/>
     intelligence of this House and but little 
     <lb/>
     respect for his colleagues." But for my two 
     <lb/>
     pamphlets and for the speech of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General, which he read and com 
     <lb/>
     mented upon as he knows how to do, he 
     <lb/>
     would very speedily have found himself 
     <lb/>
     aground ; but by deriving assistance in the 
     <lb/>
     way I have mentioned, he contrived to find 
     <lb/>
     the means of speaking for three hours. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Is it necessary for me to 
     <lb/>
     repeat that I have never denied the opinions 
     <lb/>
     which I held in former days ? Nor will I 
     <lb/>
     deny them to-night. I acknowledge freely 
     <lb/>
     that my opinions on certain matters have 
     <lb/>
     changed. Of what advantage, then, can it be 
     <lb/>
     to him to spend his time in repeating what 
     <lb/>
     I admit myself ? If I proved to him that 
     <lb/>
     he had changed several times himself, I did 
     <lb/>
     not do so to lay blame upon him, but to 
     <lb/>
     reproach him with denying his past career, 
     <lb/>
     in order that he might be more at his ease 
     <lb/>
     in that which he is at present following. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But, for that matter, what 
     <lb/>
     does it signify to the country that he or I 
     <lb/>
     held one opinion yesterday and that we hold 
     <lb/>
     another to-day ? What the country requires 
     <lb/>
     to know is whether the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation which is submitted to us by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment is good or bad. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     man who declares that he has never changed 
     <lb/>
     his opinion on any subject whatever is, to 
     <lb/>
     my thinking, a simpleton. The public re<lb break="no"/>quirements change with circumstances, and 
     <lb/>
     necessarily bring with them other ideas. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We do not eat when we are 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

      no longer hungry, nor drink when our thirst 
     <lb/>
     is satisfied. Did the hon. member, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, put in practice, when in power, the 
     <lb/>
     doctrine which he enunciated respecting the 
     <lb/>
     double majority, when he was seated on the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition benches ? When the House was 
     <lb/>
     engaged in debating a resolution, the object 
     <lb/>
     of which was to affirm the principle of the 
     <lb/>
     double majority, the present Hon. President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council having got up to say that he 
     <lb/>
     would never have governed Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     by means of a Lower Canada majority, the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Hochelaga rose in his turn 
     <lb/>
     to declare that he also would never consent 
     <lb/>
     to govern in opposition to the will of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. And yet, in 1858, did he not enter 
     <lb/>
     a Cabinet which was refused by nearly all 
     <lb/>
     the members from Lower Canada ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I said that at the 
     <lb/>
     time of the formation of the BROWN-DORION 
     <lb/>
     Ministry. I told the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN) that I would 
     <lb/>
     not undertake to carry through the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture the four great measures which were 
     <lb/>
     then in question, without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the representatives from Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—Ah, yes ! An 
     <lb/>
     excellent reason can always be found for 
     <lb/>
     retaining power when we have it, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of our own declarations. In 1862, did he 
     <lb/>
     not form part of a Government situated in 
     <lb/>
     the same position ? And from 1863 to 1864 
     <lb/>
     did he not govern Lower Canada with a rod 
     <lb/>
     of iron, supported only by a weak Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadian minority ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—The only measure 
     <lb/>
     passed in 1863, that relating to Separate 
     <lb/>
     Schools in Upper Canada, was carried by a 
     <lb/>
     majority in both provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—That is not so, 
     <lb/>
     as the Upper Canadian majority voted 
     <lb/>
     against that bill, which owed its safety to 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadians only. But it is the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple which is in question here, and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member cannot divert the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House from that fact. If the double ma<lb break="no"/>jority was good in one case, it must be so in 
     <lb/>
     all cases, in legislation as in administration, 
     <lb/>
     but more especially in administration, which 
     <lb/>
     cannot and ought not to be based on any<lb break="no"/>thing except publie opinion. Now, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga certainly governed 
     <lb/>
     his country despite the majority of its 
     <lb/>
     representatives. (Hear, hear.) He has 
     <lb/>
     spoken to us of the petitions presented to 
     <lb/>
    this House against the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>
       

            <pb n="696" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-06_Page_0696.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">696</fw>
         

     ation, but what do those petitions amount 
     <lb/>
     to ? The way in which they were covered 
     <lb/>
     with signatures is well known. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I shall here cite an anecdote relating to 
     <lb/>
     the parliamentary history of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     at a period shortly before the Union. A 
     <lb/>
     member was talking a great deal about peti<lb break="no"/>tions in a debate upon a bill. " Petitions !" 
     <lb/>
     said his opponent, " I will undertake within 
     <lb/>
     a fortnight to present a petition to this House 
     <lb/>
     praying that you may be hanged, and which 
     <lb/>
     shall be covered with good and valid signa<lb break="no"/>tures !" The challenge was accepted, and 
     <lb/>
     at the end of three weeks the petition arri<lb break="no"/>ved, praying for the hanging of the man who 
     <lb/>
     had so much faith in the virtue of petitions ! 
     <lb/>
     How had it been obtained ? By posting at 
     <lb/>
     a tavern situated at four cross-roads a skilful 
     <lb/>
     and knowing agent, who incessantly said to 
     <lb/>
     the frequenters of the tavern—" Do you like 
     <lb/>
     good roads ?" " Yes." " Well, then, sign 
     <lb/>
     this petition." All signed, without reading 
     <lb/>
     it. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Exactly 
     <lb/>
     in this manner were obtained most of the 
     <lb/>
     signatures against Confederation. At Mont<lb break="no"/>real, agents went from tavern to tavern and 
     <lb/>
     induced all who were there to sign, or signed 
     <lb/>
     for those who resided in the vicinity without 
     <lb/>
     even consulting them. (Hear, hear.) Have 
     <lb/>
     we not also seen petitions coming from coun<lb break="no"/>ties in which the Opposition were not even 
     <lb/>
     able to find candidates ? They may easily 
     <lb/>
     obtain signatures of this description, and by 
     <lb/>
     this means; but that does not constitute an 
     <lb/>
     expression of the opinion of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and those petitions will not carry elections. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member ought to know something 
     <lb/>
     about it, he who was in power at the time of 
     <lb/>
     the last general election. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     He endeavored to explain away his contra<lb break="no"/>dictions by saying that he had never been 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the Confederation of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I did not state that he was in favor 
     <lb/>
     of this Confederation of all the provinces ; I 
     <lb/>
     only said that he was willing, as a member 
     <lb/>
     of the BROWN–DORION Government, in 
     <lb/>
     1858, to have representation based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation, with checks, guarantees and assur<lb break="no"/>ances ; that then, in 1859, he proposed as an 
     <lb/>
     alternative to that measure, in his Montreal 
     <lb/>
     manifesto, Confederation of the two Canadas ; 
     <lb/>
     and then, in 1860-'61 he was ready to 
     <lb/>
     accept any possible change, even Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of all British North America. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) To prove that he was in favor of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of all the provinces, I quoted 
     <lb/>
     one of his speeches, in which he said, on the 
     <lb/>
     6th July, 1858 :—

     Is not this admitting everything ? Is it not 
     <lb/>
     saying that there is nothing between us but 
     <lb/>
     a question of time and of expediency ? Why 
     <lb/>
     then should he make the opinions of us, the ma<lb break="no"/>jority, such a crime, when he himself arrives, 
     <lb/>
     at the end of a four hours' speech, at the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that Confederation will be good or 
     <lb/>
     necessary at a time which is more or less near ? 
     <lb/>
     In his manifesto against the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation he adheres so far to his previous 
     <lb/>
     opinions as to consider the scheme which is 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us as merely premature. There 
     <lb/>
     again, then, it was only a question of time, 
     <lb/>
     and in declaring himself to-day opposed to 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, he therefore changes his 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to the very basis of the question. 
     <lb/>
     I do not cast it up to him as a reproach ; for, 
     <lb/>
     as I said but a minute ago, he who main<lb break="no"/>tains that he has never changed, conveys but 
     <lb/>
     a poor opinion of his judgment and of his 
     <lb/>
     aptitude for public affairs. Events, in 
     <lb/>
     changing, absolutely compel men to change 
     <lb/>
     also. (Hear.) A general was once boasting 
     <lb/>
     to the great TURENNE that he had never 
     <lb/>
     committed an error of strategy. " He who 
     <lb/>
     boasts that he has never been mistaken," 
     <lb/>
     returned TURENNE, " proves thereby that he 
     <lb/>
     knows nothing of the art of war." These 
     <lb/>
     words, which are full of wisdom, may be 
     <lb/>
     applied to the hon. member for Hochelaga, 
     <lb/>
     who, by his persistence in maintaining that 
     <lb/>
     be has never contradicted himself nor been 
     <lb/>
     mistaken, proves that he is no statesman. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But, I say it again, it would 
     <lb/>
     have been better tor him to lay aside per<lb break="no"/>sonal questions. (Hear, hear.) On the 6th 
     <lb/>
     July, 1858, he said :—

     But to-day he changes his opinion. Then 
     <lb/>
     he was willing to grant representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, or Confederation based on the 
     <lb/>
     same principle. It had to be conceded in 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
         

     order that we might not be carried away by 
     <lb/>
     the tempest. But to-day, according to his 
     <lb/>
     shewing, the storm no longer impends ; the 
     <lb/>
     whole sky is calm and serene ; public opinion 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada no longer threatens to 
     <lb/>
     break asunder the frail bands of the union, 
     <lb/>
     and changes are useless. Ah ! and yet we 
     <lb/>
     have had as many as three ministerial crises 
     <lb/>
     in one year. (Hear, hear.) He mistakes 
     <lb/>
     then ; the difficulties have but increased, 
     <lb/>
     and it is better to-day to provide against the 
     <lb/>
     storm, than to be carried away by it at a 
     <lb/>
     later period. The greatest wisdom directs 
     <lb/>
     its efforts, not to cure the disease, but to 
     <lb/>
     prevent it ; this truth is as applicable to 
     <lb/>
    politics as it is to medicine. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The hon. member for Hochelaga talked to 
     <lb/>us of conflicts between the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and the local Houses, and of the 
     <lb/>sovereign power of the Central Government 
     <lb/>over the legislatures of the provinces. But 
     <lb/>what, then, is this sovereign power over the 
     <lb/>attributes of the provincial legislatures ? If 
     <lb/>it exists it must be in the Constitution. If 
     <lb/>it is not to be found there, it is because it 
     <lb/>does not exist. He says that the Federal 
     <lb/>Legislature will always predominate ; and 
     <lb/>why ? Who then will decide between the 
     <lb/>one and the others ?—the judicial tribunals 
     <lb/>being sworn to respect the laws and the 
     <lb/>Constitution in their entirety, and charged 
     <lb/>by the very nature of their functions to 
     <lb/>declare whether such a law of the Federal 
     <lb/>Parliament or of the local legislatures does 
     <lb/>or does not affect the Constitution. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) There will be no absolute sovereign 
     <lb/>power, each legislature having its distinct 
     <lb/>and independent attributes, not proceeding 
     <lb/>from one or the other by delegation, either 
     <lb/>from above or from below. The Federal Par<lb break="no"/>liament will have legislative sovereign power 
     <lb/>in all questions submitted to its control in 
     <lb/>the Constitution. So also the local legis<lb break="no"/>latures will be sovereign in all matters which 
     <lb/>are specifically assigned to them. How is 
     <lb/>the question of a conflict now settled in the 
     <lb/>United States, when it arises between the 
     <lb/>legislation of Congress and that of individual 
     <lb/>states ? I do not speak of the present time 
     <lb/>when nearly the whole of the territory of 
     <lb/>that great country is under military rule, 
     <lb/>and overrun in every direction by an army of 
     <lb/>500,000 soldiers. I allude to what occurs in 
     <lb/>their normal condition. (Hear) The sovereign 
     <lb/>power is vested in the Federal Government 
     <lb/>with respect to all Federal matters, and in 
     <lb/>the states with respect to all matters con<lb break="no"/>nected with their special attributes. By

     reading STOREY, or rather the Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member will ascertain that the 
     <lb/>
     states are not paramount with respect to 
     <lb/>
     questions of war and peace, the tariff, trade, 
     <lb/>
     treaties and all relations with foreign coun<lb break="no"/>tries. Their authority is void so far as 
     <lb/>
     relates to those questions, and the sovereign 
     <lb/>
     power is vested exclusively in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government. If any conflict arises between 
     <lb/>
    the Federal Legislature and that of the 
     <lb/>states, it is decided by the judicial tribunals. 
     <lb/>I am not aware that any difficulty of this 
     <lb/>nature has ever arisen, and so far as relates 
     <lb/>to the legislative attributes of the states, 
     <lb/>that Federal legislation has ever predomina<lb break="no"/>ted over local legislation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Why then should the case be otherwise so 
     <lb/>far as we are concerned? Is it because we 
     <lb/>are differently constituted, and because our 
     <lb/>nature is subservient to other laws? These 
     <lb/>are wretched arguments, and he has even 
     <lb/>been reduced to splitting hairs since he has 
     <lb/>attended the school of the member for 
     <lb/>Brome, whose place he almost fills since he 
     <lb/>has been ill. (Laughter.) The honorable 
     <lb/>member for Hochelaga considered my first 
     <lb/>pamphlet much better written than my last, 
     <lb/>doubtless for the same reason that he con<lb break="no"/>sidered my speeches of 1858 greatly superior 
     <lb/>to that which I delivered here the other day. 
     <lb/>He thinks now as I thought in 1858; he 
     <lb/>has therefore receded by six years. Allud<lb break="no"/>ing to my speech of the 2nd March, he 
     <lb/>appears to impute it to me as a crime, that I 
     <lb/>yielded to the influence of my relations with 
     <lb/>the delegates from the Maritime Provinces, 
     <lb/>and that under the action of that influence, 
     <lb/>I changed my opinions respecting Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. I admit the fact of that influence 
     <lb/>legitimately exercised. We lose nothing by 
     <lb/>coming in contact with intelligent men. 
     <lb/>The members of this House, who last autumn 
     <lb/>visited those provinces, returned amazed at 
     <lb/>what they had seen. They were convinced 
     <lb/>that those provinces were possessed of great 
     <lb/>resources. Contact with the most eminent 
     <lb/>men of those countries could be productive 
     <lb/>of no evil, and the hon. member would have 
     <lb/>gained by it. Perhaps if he had experi<lb break="no"/>enced that contact, he would not to-day have 
     <lb/>recourse to the means which he is employing 
     <lb/>to cast discredit on the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and to cause it to be rejected. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Among those men there are some who 
     <lb/>are endowed with magnificent abilities, and at 
     <lb/>whose side I should be happy and proud to 
     <lb/>sit in a deliberative assembly. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Yes, we were gainers by coming in contact 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
        

     with them, and I venture to believe that, on 
     <lb/>
     their parts, they were divested of many 
     <lb/>
     prejudices which they may possibly have 
     <lb/>
     entertained against us, just as we had some 
     <lb/>
     such against them. The hon. member quoted 
     <lb/>
     certain articles from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journal de Québec</hi> 
     <lb/>
    of 1856 and 1858 to prove that I said that 
     <lb/>then the Government was the worst I 
     <lb/>had ever seen. Perhaps I was right at the 
     <lb/>time, but I could not say the same thing 
     <lb/>since it has been my lot to look upon the 
     <lb/>hon. member's Government! (Hear, and 
     <lb/>laughter.) If there was ever a tyrannical 
     <lb/>and dishonest Government, it was certainly 
     <lb/>that of 1863, and accordingly it succumbed 
     <lb/>before the attacks of all honest men. Ex<lb break="no"/>cept for some accident, such as that which 
     <lb/>occurred in 1862, who ventures to hope 
     <lb/>to see the hon. member return to power? 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) He told us that it was not 
     <lb/>expedient to change the Constitution without 
     <lb/>first having recourse to an appeal to the 
     <lb/>people. But the first question to be decided 
     <lb/>is the constitutional question, and the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of expediency and convenience comes 
     <lb/>after. He talks to us without ceasing of 
     <lb/>consulting the electors. His doing so may 
     <lb/>be easily understood; on the elections rest 
     <lb/>his only hopes. Always deceived in every 
     <lb/>election, he hopes, but hopes in vain, that 
     <lb/>the next will give him the victory. He 
     <lb/>ought to know, however, that our Constitution 
     <lb/>is constructed upon the model of the British 
     <lb/>Constitution, and that members do not and 
     <lb/>cannot receive an imperative order from their 
     <lb/>electors. Each representative, although 
     <lb/>elected by one particular county, represents 
     <lb/>the whole country, and his legislative re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility extends to the whole of it. If, 
     <lb/>therefore, I am convinced that any legislative 
     <lb/>measure presented by the Government or by 
     <lb/>a member of this House, is of a nature to 
     <lb/>save Lower Canada, I must vote for that 
     <lb/>measure, even though my constituents are 
     <lb/>opposed to it. My electors might punish 
     <lb/>me afterwards, but they could not impose 
     <lb/>upon me duties which I consider to be en<lb break="no"/>tirely beyond their jurisdiction, and to relate 
     <lb/>to the very Constitution of the country. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) If there are any members 
     <lb/>who consider that the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation is a bad one and opposed to the inte<lb break="no"/>rests of Lower Canada, even if the majority 
     <lb/>of our people think otherwise, it is their duty 
     <lb/>to oppose it on precisely the same principle. 
     <lb/>They may also, if they choose, demand an 
     <lb/>appeal to the people. But would they be 
     <lb/>justified in so doing, and ought this House 
     <lb/>

     to demand it simply in order to compensate for 
     <lb/>
     that absence of opposition which gives inces<lb break="no"/>sant trouble to the hon. member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga? (Hear, hear.) The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Hochelaga spoke of public meetings 
     <lb/>
     held in certain counties in the district 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal; but those meetings are far 
     <lb/>
     from possessing the importance which he 
     <lb/>
     assigns to them. We all know how they 
     <lb/>
     can be got up everywhere, and what they 
     <lb/>
     amount to. However the case may be there, 
     <lb/>
     there have been none such in the district of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, and even in the district of Three 
     <lb/>
     Rivers, against Confederation, and it cannot 
     <lb/>
     be said that the members who represent 
     <lb/>
     those districts, and who vote for this mea<lb break="no"/>sure, are acting in opposition to the wishes 
     <lb/>
     of their constituents. Such meetings are 
     <lb/>
     only found to occur in the district of Mon<lb break="no"/>treal, where the party of the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber is most strongly represented; but an 
     <lb/>
     opinion may be formed as to those meetings 
     <lb/>
     from what is going on at Quebec at this 
     <lb/>
     moment. While the whole body of citizens 
     <lb/>
     are calling for the suspension of the present 
     <lb/>
     municipal council, some individuals inter<lb break="no"/>ested in keeping it in authority are calling 
     <lb/>
     public meetings in the nooks and corners of 
     <lb/>
     the suburbs. (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member made tremendous efforts to prove 
     <lb/>
     that the interests of our religion, our na<lb break="no"/>tionality and our institutions would be in a 
     <lb/>
     position of much greater safety in his hands 
     <lb/>
     than they would be in those of the majority. 
     <lb/>
     For my part, I am willing to leave to public 
     <lb/>
     opinion the care of deciding that question; 
     <lb/>
     and as he declares himself to hold that 
     <lb/>
     opinion in great respect, I must suppose 
     <lb/>
     that he will agree with me on this point. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I would not assert that the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member is himself personally hos<lb break="no"/>tile to the religion and the institutions of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada; but I may say that all the 
     <lb/>
     tendencies of the party which he represents 
     <lb/>
     are adverse to those same institutions. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There is sufficient proof of 
     <lb/>
     this in the writings and the acts of that 
     <lb/>
     party. As to my opinion respecting Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, I may repeat here what I have 
     <lb/>
     already said on a former occasion, and that 
     <lb/>
     is, that no one knew what that opinion was, 
     <lb/>
     how I should write, and on what side I 
     <lb/>
     should write, when I began my work. I 
     <lb/>
     kept silence that I might not be annoyed 
     <lb/>
     either by friends or by opponents, and in 
     <lb/>
     order that I might be able to judge of the 
     <lb/>
    question in the fulness of my liberty. 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
      

     (Hear.) Mention has been made of the 
     <lb/>
     dangers of Confederation. I know that 
     <lb/>
     every question has its dangers, and it is 
     <lb/>
     probable that this one presents some such in 
     <lb/>
     the same way as all others do; but the 
     <lb/>
     greatest danger that we could incur would 
     <lb/>
     be the bringing on of a conflict between the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics and Protestants, by appeals like 
     <lb/>
     those which certain members on the left 
     <lb/>
     have made to the religious passions of our 
     <lb/>
     population. (Hear, hear.) In what posi<lb break="no"/>tion should we find ourselves, we Catholics, 
     <lb/>
     if we provoked such a conflict? The 
     <lb/>
     258,000 Catholics of Upper Canada are re<lb break="no"/>presented in this House by but two mem<lb break="no"/>bers, those for Cornwall and Glengarry 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. J. S. and Mr. D. A. MACDONALD), 
     <lb/>
     whilst the Protestants of Lower Canada are 
     <lb/>
     represented by fifteen or sixteen members; 
     <lb/>
     and in case of a conflict between the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics and the Protestants, what would become 
     <lb/>
     of us? (Hear, hear.) From the justice, 
     <lb/>
     the wisdom and the liberality of our acts 
     <lb/>
     alone have we hitherto found our strength 
     <lb/>
     and our protection to proceed, and from 
     <lb/>
     them shall we again find them to proceed 
     <lb/>
     under Confederation. (Hear.) The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Hochelaga quoted a 
     <lb/>
     garbled portion of my first pamphlet, to give 
     <lb/>
     it a meaning which it does not convey; he 
     <lb/>
     then accuses me of having changed my 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to the Constitution of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council. But I can tell him that I 
     <lb/>
     have never changed my opinion on that 
     <lb/>
     question; I have never been in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle being applied to the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council; and if in 1858 I prepared 
     <lb/>
     and introduced the law which changed the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of that body, it was only that I 
     <lb/>
     might gratify the universal opinion which 
     <lb/>
     desired an elective Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     But, the honorable member for Hochelaga 
     <lb/>
     will reply, did you not write in 1858 :—

     tion, and having to select from two alterna<lb break="no"/>tives, numbers or the State, I preferred 
     <lb/>
     numbers, because it would have conferred 
     <lb/>
     upon us a larger share of representation and 
     <lb/>
     of influence. The words which follow, and 
     <lb/>
     which I will give, clearly prove my thought 
     <lb/>
     at that time :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Constitution of the United States, on 
     <lb/>
     which, perhaps, ours would be modeled, would 
     <lb/>
     not give to us Lower Canadians the same pro<lb break="no"/>tection and the same guarantee of safety, as 
     <lb/>
     by it we should in reality enjoy a little pro<lb break="no"/>tection only in the House of Representatives, in

     which we should be one to three.

     Thus the protection would have been vested 
     <lb/>
     in the Legislative Council itself, if it had 
     <lb/>
     been created on the principle of the State 
     <lb/>
     and not of numbers. To shew that my mind 
     <lb/>
     was then filled with but one idea—that of 
     <lb/>
     obtaining the greatest share of influence in 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Legislature for Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     by any constitutional system whatever, I 
     <lb/>
     also wrote in the same pamphlet :—

     <lb/>
    Edward as much as the twelve hundred and fifty 
     <lb/>thousand souls of Lower Canada.

            </p></quote>

    
   
            <p>
     Having no information to go upon, I then 
     <lb/>
     thought that the American system would be 
     <lb/>
     adopted, which gives in the Federal Senate 
     <lb/>
     to the little states of Rhode Island, Jersey, 
     <lb/>
     Maine, Vermont and Connecticut the same 
     <lb/>
     representation as it gives to the large states 
     <lb/>
     of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. But 
     <lb/>
     the scheme that we have before us proves 
     <lb/>
     that I was mistaken, as Prince Edward's 
     <lb/>
     Island, instead of having as many represen<lb break="no"/>tatives in the Legislative Council as we shall 
     <lb/>
     have, will only have one-sixth of the number. 
     <lb/>
     For the purpose of representation in the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, the three Atlantic Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are grouped together, and are to be 
     <lb/>
     represented together by but twenty-four 
     <lb/>
     votes, just the same as Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) As the question was as to 
     <lb/>
     the establishment of equilibrium between 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, if the scheme of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Conference gives me the same result as an 
     <lb/>
     elective Legislative Council, what contradic<lb break="no"/>tion is there in my returning to the nomina<lb break="no"/>tive principle, which I always preferred to 
     <lb/>
     the elective principle? The conditions of 
     <lb/>
     equilibrium being the same, I give the pre<lb break="no"/>ference to the principle which confers on 
     <lb/>
     legislation the best guarantee of wisdom and 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     

     mature judgment. (Hear, hear.) But sup<lb break="no"/>posing—what is non the case-that I had 
     <lb/>
     contradicted myself, in what way could my 
     <lb/>
     contradictions have affected the merits of the 
     <lb/>
     question under discussion? If it can be 
     <lb/>
     proved that my opinions of to-day are not 
     <lb/>
     based on reasonable grounds, let it be proved. 
     <lb/>
     If it cannot be proved, do not let anyone 
     <lb/>
     imagine that he has answered me by saying: 
     <lb/>
     "You thought differently six years ago." 
     <lb/>
     Because I reasoned in 1858 on hypotheses 
     <lb/>
     which are controverted by facts to-day, must 
     <lb/>
     I then, in order to appear consistent, adhere 
     <lb/>
     to those suppositions which substantive 
     <lb/>
     truths so completely contradict? (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The hon. member for Hochelaga 
     <lb/>
     told us that the Constitution of the Belgian 
     <lb/>
     Senate is less conservative than that of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council which we propose to 
     <lb/>
     establish under the Confederation, because 
     <lb/>
     the members of the Belgian Senate are in 
     <lb/>
     part changed every four years. To this I 
     <lb/>
     reply, that the conservative principle may he 
     <lb/>
     found elsewhere than in the manner of select<lb break="no"/>ing the councillors or the senators, and that 
     <lb/>
     in Belgium it is found in the excessively 
     <lb/>
     high standard of qualification which is re<lb break="no"/>quired of candidates for the Senate; so much 
     <lb/>
     so that only men of large fortune, who are 
     <lb/>
     everywhere few in number, can aspire to 
     <lb/>
     enter it. In Belgium the Constitution re<lb break="no"/>quires that there shall be one man qualified 
     <lb/>
     in every six thousand souls of population, 
     <lb/>
     and that man must pay one thousand florins 
     <lb/>
     of direct taxes. Will it be said that the 
     <lb/>
     Belgian Senate, so constituted, is not more 
     <lb/>
     conservative than our Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     will be—the Belgian Senate, in which none 
     <lb/>
     can sit but very rich men and large landed 
     <lb/>
     proprietors? (Hear, hear.) I am answered 
     <lb/>
     that one-half this Senate is renewed every 
     <lb/>
     four years, and that the Crown may dissolve 
     <lb/>
     it at pleasure. But can the Crown prevent 
     <lb/>
     men of large fortune and large landped pro<lb break="no"/>prietors from entering it? It is proved that 
     <lb/>
     it is with difficulty that there can be found 
     <lb/>
     in the House of Lords any scions of the 
     <lb/>
     great families who flourished there under 
     <lb/>
     CHARLES II.; but that House is constantly 
     <lb/>
     recruited from among the territorial nobility 
     <lb/>
     and from among men who render great poli<lb break="no"/>tical or military services to the state. By 
     <lb/>
     renewing it thus with the same elements, does 
     <lb/>
     the Crown take away its conservative charac<lb break="no"/>ter? (Hear, hear.) The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     stands in perpetual dread of conflicts and 
     <lb/>
     disagreements. Supposing that the House 
     <lb/>
     of Lords had persisted in its opposition to

     the Reform Bill in 1832, what would have 
     <lb/>
     happened if WILLIAM IV. had refused to 
     <lb/>
     overwhelm it by numerous nominations to 
     <lb/>
     the peerage? Does any one believe that it 
     <lb/>
     would have persisted to the last? No; 
     <lb/>
     after having long resisted, it would have 
     <lb/>
     bent before the storm which threatened to 
     <lb/>
     sweep it away. (Hear, hear.) In 1832 the 
     <lb/>
     struggle was between the great proprietors 
     <lb/>
     and the middle classes, who wished to make 
     <lb/>
     their way; for the English people, properly 
     <lb/>
     termed the populace, have no political privi<lb break="no"/>leges; they are of no account in the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution, they hold no political position, and 
     <lb/>
     have no energy for the struggle, which, 
     <lb/>
     moreover, would not be productive of any 
     <lb/>
     benefit to them. It resembles in no respect 
     <lb/>
     the populations of the great towns in France, 
     <lb/>
     which make and unmake governments by 
     <lb/>
     insurrections or revolutions. In England it 
     <lb/>
     is the middle classes who make revolutions 
     <lb/>
     or who threaten to make them. Growing 
     <lb/>
     richer daily, they advance slowly but surely 
     <lb/>
     towards the securing of political privileges 
     <lb/>
     and immunities. The Radical school of 
     <lb/>
     Manchester at bottom wishes for nothing 
     <lb/>
     more, although it asserts that it is de<lb break="no"/>sirous of obtaining privileges for the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. If the great nobility, in 1832, 
     <lb/>
     offered such determined opposition to the 
     <lb/>
     Reform Bill, it was because they feared that 
     <lb/>
     it would annihilate their influence and place 
     <lb/>
     them at the mercy of the will of the masses. 
     <lb/>
     But we have no <hi rendition="simple:italic">caste</hi> here, and fortune, like 
     <lb/>
     political honors, is the property of every man 
     <lb/>
     who labors to attain it. Here every one, if 
     <lb/>
     he chooses, can almost without an effort be<lb break="no"/>come a proprietor and possess the right of 
     <lb/>
     having a deliberative voice in the discussion 
     <lb/>
     of national questions of the highest import<lb break="no"/>ance. To be a legislative councillor it will 
     <lb/>
     be sufficient to possess real estate of the value 
     <lb/>
     of four thousand dollars. The legislative 
     <lb/>
     councillors will form part of the people, will 
     <lb/>
     live with the people and by their opinions, 
     <lb/>
     and will know and appreciate their wants; 
     <lb/>
     the only difference that there will be between 
     <lb/>
     them and the members of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons will be, that being appointed for 
     <lb/>
     life, they will not be as directly brought 
     <lb/>
     under external influence; that they will 
     <lb/>
     have more freedom of action and of thought, 
     <lb/>
     and that they will be able to judge with 
     <lb/>
     greater calmness of the legislation which 
     <lb/>
     will be submitted to them. For what reason 
     <lb/>
     then would they provoke contests which 
     <lb/>
     would neither be conducive to their interests 
     <lb/>
     nor in accordance with their feelings; they 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
       

     will not, like the House of Lords, have pri<lb break="no"/>vileges to save from destruction. In the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution they will have but one part to 
     <lb/>
    play, that of maturing legislation in the 
     <lb/>interests of the people. The hon. member 
     <lb/>for Hochelaga said in his last manifesto, and 
     <lb/>repeated here, that if we applied to England 
     <lb/>to amend our Constitution, we should expose 
     <lb/>ourselves to having alterations, for which we 
     <lb/>do not ask, made by some mischievous hand. 
     <lb/>The thing is possible I admit. It is possi<lb break="no"/>ble, as it is also possible for the Imperial 
     <lb/>Parliament to change our Constitution with<lb break="no"/>out even waiting for us to take the initiative, 
     <lb/>as it did in 1840, but if there is any harm 
     <lb/>now in asking Great Britain for the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration of all the provinces, because she 
     <lb/>may subject us to something which is not 
     <lb/>contained in the scheme, why did the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Hochelaga wish for constitutional 
     <lb/>changes in 1858? Did he hope to change 
     <lb/>the Constitutional Act of 1840 without the 
     <lb/>concurrence of the Imperial Parliament? 
     <lb/>And will he be good enough to tell us by what 
     <lb/>supernatural proceeding he hoped to succeed 
     <lb/>in doing so? If there is danger in 1865, 
     <lb/>there must also have been danger in 1858. 
     <lb/>Why then should he, to day, impute to others 
     <lb/>as a crime that which he wished to do him<lb break="no"/>self then? Has he forgotten all that? 
     <lb/>Does he wish to deny it? Differing slightly 
     <lb/>from the Bourbons, he has learned nothing 
     <lb/>and has forgotten everything. (Hear, and 
     <lb/>laughter.) To frighten us, he also spoke of 
     <lb/>direct taxation, to which we should have to 
     <lb/>submit, if we had Confederation. Now, in 
     <lb/>his constitutional scheme of 1858, with 
     <lb/>which we are all acquainted, he gave to the 
     <lb/>Federal Government the customs revenue. 
     <lb/>We should, therefore, have had to have re<lb break="no"/>course to direct taxation to meet the expen<lb break="no"/>diture of the local governments. The plan of 
     <lb/>Constitution which is submitted to us treats 
     <lb/>us better than that, for it gives us enough, 
     <lb/>and more than we require, to ensure the 
     <lb/>easy working of the local organizations.

     scheme which may save the country without 
     <lb/>
     its being necessary to have recourse to this 
     <lb/>
     extreme and objectionable remedy. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If the scheme becomes law, not 
     <lb/>
     only shall we have a sufficient revenue 
     <lb/>
     to meet our local expenditure, but we 
     <lb/>
     shall also have a surplus with which, 
     <lb/>
     if we practise wise economy, to pay off 
     <lb/>
     by degrees the residue of the debt which 
     <lb/>
     will remain to us. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga tells us that Lower Canada will 
     <lb/>
     be burthened with a local debt of more than 
     <lb/>
     $4,500,000; but we have clear and palpable 
     <lb/>
     proof that the debt of Canada, deducting the 
     <lb/>
     part of the Sinking Fund which has been 
     <lb/>
     paid, amounts to only $67,500,000. Now 
     <lb/>
     our share of the Federal debt is established 
     <lb/>
     at $62,500,000. There will consequently 
     <lb/>
     remain less than $5,000,000 to be divided 
     <lb/>
     between the two Canadas, and all the argu<lb break="no"/>ments of the hon. member will not change 
     <lb/>
     so incontestable a fact as this. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We do not get these figures from the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance. They are given to us 
     <lb/>
     by a man who is perfectly independent of all 
     <lb/>
     Ministers and of all parties—a man whom I 
     <lb/>
     myself formerly reproached with being too 
     <lb/>
     much so; I allude to Mr. LANGTON, the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor of Accounts. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     do not yet know, it is true, how this debt of 
     <lb/>
     four millions and some hundred thousand 
     <lb/>
     dollars will be divided between the two 
     <lb/>
     Canadas, but we do know, without any possi<lb break="no"/>bility of doubt, that the local revenues will 
     <lb/>
     belong to the local governments, and 
     <lb/>
     that they will amply suffice for all their 
     <lb/>
     requirements. (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga complains that Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada retains her public lands and what is 
     <lb/>
     owing to Government on those lands, and he 
     <lb/>
     maintains that Lower Canada ought to have 
     <lb/>
     her share of what those lands produce. But 
     <lb/>
     did those lands beleng to us before the 
     <lb/>
     union, and have we not our own public 
     <lb/>
     lands, together with the revenue accruing 
     <lb/>
     from them? Have we not more lands to 
     <lb/>
     settle than Upper Canada? Since the 
     <lb/>
     discovery of our gold and copper mines the 
     <lb/>
     amount produced by the sale of our public 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
       

     lands has increased fivefold, whilst Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada has hardly any land left to sell. Let 
     <lb/>
     our mines be opened, and we shall find that 
     <lb/>
     we have no reason to envy Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Everything is well adjusted; 
     <lb/>
     for if we have a less considerable revenue 
     <lb/>
     than Upper Canada, our population is also less 
     <lb/>
     numerous. Upper Canada possesses a more 
     <lb/>
     considerable revenue, but one which must 
     <lb/>
     diminish with the decrease of the quantity of 
     <lb/>
     land to be sold, whilst we have a revenue 
     <lb/>
     which is gradually increasing. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member would no doubt hand over 
     <lb/>
     the public lands to the Confederation so as 
     <lb/>
     to be in accordance with his plan of 1859, 
     <lb/>
     as set forth in the Montreal manifesto; but 
     <lb/>
     I am certain that Lower Canada does not 
     <lb/>
     share his opinion. He talked to us also of 
     <lb/>
     marriage and divorce. He said: " Now, 
     <lb/>
     you will not vote directly for divorce, but 
     <lb/>
    you vote to establish divorce courts." Well! 
     <lb/>no one condemns divorce more than I do 
     <lb/>myself, and I am convinced that the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Hochelaga would accept it 
     <lb/>sooner than I would. But if no mention 
     <lb/>was made of divorce in the Constitution, 
     <lb/>if it was not assigned to the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, it would of necessity belong to the 
     <lb/>local parliaments as it belongs to our Legis<lb break="no"/>lature now, although there is not one word 
     <lb/>respecting it in the Union Act. For my 
     <lb/>part, I would rather see that power removed 
     <lb/>to a distance from us, since it must exist 
     <lb/>somewhere in spite of us. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>These reasonings on the question of marriage 
     <lb/>are extraordinary to a degree, coming from 
     <lb/>a man holding a position at the bar. They 
     <lb/>are so extraordinary, and so inconsistent 
     <lb/>with all logic and all law, that I shall not 
     <lb/>take the trouble of controverting them. The 
     <lb/>explanations of the Government have satis<lb break="no"/>fied me on that point. The legislative power 
     <lb/>of the Federal Parliament in relation to 
     <lb/>marriage will only be that which is conferred 
     <lb/>by the Constitution, notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>singular assertions of the honorable member. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear, and cheers.)
