     <lb/>
            
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PERR2">MR. PERRAULT</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, it is 
     <lb/>
     not without a degree of hesitation easy to 
     <lb/>
     be understood that I venture to give my 
     <lb/>
     reasons for my vote on the question of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     North America. I hesitate, because I am 
     <lb/>
     conscious how much I fall short in respect 
     <lb/>
     of solid information and political experience 
     <lb/>
     to enable me to form a healthy and reliable 
     <lb/>
     judgment of the various reasons to be alleged 
     <lb/>
     on both sides of that vast question, the 
     <lb/>
     decision of which is pregnant with such 
     <lb/>
     serious consequences to the future welfare 
     <lb/>
     of the country. A further cause of my 
     <lb/>
     hesitation, Mr. SPEAKER, is that I see on 
     <lb/>
     the Ministerial benches men grown old in 
     <lb/>
     political warfare—men who for many years 
     <lb/>
     have been the leaders and guides of the 
     <lb/>
     majorities in the two Canadas—supportiug 
     <lb/>
     the scheme now submitted to us, and assur<lb break="no"/>ing us that it is the only remedy for all the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties of our present position. Still 
     <lb/>
     another cause of my hesitation is that I am 
     <lb/>
     aware of the great severity with which the 
     <lb/>
     Ministerial press visits all the adversaries 
     <lb/>
      of the plan of Confederation, and of the 
     <lb/>
     small measure of justice which it metes 
     <lb/>
     out in estimating the motives of those 
     <lb/>
     who oppose this constitutional scheme, 
     <lb/>
     however upright their characters or 
     <lb/>
     honest the motives which actuate them. 
     <lb/>
     But I should consider myself wanting in my 
     <lb/>
     duty as a member if, swayed by these mis<lb break="no"/>givings, I did not state my motives in this 
     <lb/>
     House for my opposition to the project of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. On so important a question 
     <lb/>
     it is a duty to my constituents, it is a 
     <lb/>
     duty which I owe to myself, that I should 
     <lb/>
     justify the responsibility which I take upon 
     <lb/>
     myself in resisting a measure which is so 
     <lb/>
     strongly supported in this House, and I 
     <lb/>
     should think I failed in my duty and 
     <lb/>
     was unworthy of the seat which I fill in it, if 
     <lb/>
     I did not add force to my opposition by 
     <lb/>
     citing the history of the past, by <choice><sic>pourtraying</sic><corr>portraying</corr></choice> 
     <lb/>
     the prosperity of the present, and by point<lb break="no"/>ing out the dangers to be feared in the future 
     <lb/>
     which is preparing for us. I have been 
     <lb/>
     long studying the general question of a Con<lb break="no"/>federation, and I am of opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces of British North America are 
     <lb/>
     destined to form, at some future time which 
     <lb/>
     may be more or less remote, a vast Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, in which the two races of French 
     <lb/>
     and English origin will be seen struggling 
     <lb/>
     in the career of progress for the common 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     prosperity of both ; and for the better con<lb break="no"/>venience of studying the question, I visited 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces in 1863, by way of the 
     <lb/>
     Gulf, and in 1864 by the Bay of Fundy. I 
     <lb/>
     am bound to say that I found the people 
     <lb/>
     everywhere in easy circumstances, and in<lb break="no"/>telligent, and doing honor to that part of 
     <lb/>
     the country. I was then enabled to appre<lb break="no"/>ciate the advantages and the inconveniences 
     <lb/>
     attending on the decision of the question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation generally. On my return 
     <lb/>
     from my last journey, which I made in the 
     <lb/>
     month of August, 1864, in company with a 
     <lb/>
     certain number of the members of both 
     <lb/>
     Houses, it was said by the press that I had 
     <lb/>
     in several companies declared myself favor<lb break="no"/>able to the plan of a Confederation of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. At that time the Conference at 
     <lb/>
     Charlottetown had not taken place, and pub<lb break="no"/>lic opinion had already busied itself with 
     <lb/>
     classifying the members of this House as 
     <lb/>
     favorers or opponents of Confederation. I 
     <lb/>
     had already, at that time, publicly expressed 
     <lb/>
     my opinion on the question through the 
     <lb/>
     press, in order that I might bring it under 
     <lb/>
     the notice of my constituents, and I must 
     <lb/>
     declare that the opinion which I then ex<lb break="no"/>pressed coincides with the line of conduct 
     <lb/>to which I still adhere, and that I have not 
     <lb/>found it necessary to alter my position in 
     <lb/>any one point from what it then was. In 
     <lb/>order that I may show this in the clearest 
     <lb/>manner, I shall read what I wrote in the 
     <lb/>month of August last, as perfectly explana<lb break="no"/>tory of what I always thought of the scheme 
     <lb/>of confederating the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>North America. Here is what I wrote :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     This question of serious import, on which the 
     <lb/>
     minds of all our political world are so busy, in 
     <lb/>
     the present crisis, is so difficult of solution, that 
     <lb/>
     it would be an act of presumption in me to at<lb break="no"/>tempt even to discuss it, while our public men of 
     <lb/>
     the highest mark are still doubtful whether to 
     <lb/>
               favor it or not. As the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Minerve,</hi> however, in 
     <lb/>
     its last number, claims me as one of the new con<lb break="no"/>verts to the great scheme of Confederation, I 
     <lb/>
     should think myself wanting to my duty and my 
     <lb/>
     convictions if I failed to let the world know my 
     <lb/>
     impressions of the present position, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it. Those who consider the inexhaustible 
     <lb/>
     resources of the Provinces of British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica have no doubt that we possess all the ele<lb break="no"/>ments of a great power. In territory we have a 
     <lb/>
     tenth part of the habitable globe, capable of 
     <lb/>
     supporting a population of 100,000,000 of per<lb break="no"/>sons. Bounded on the east by the Atlantic, on 
     <lb/>
     the west by the Pacific, our territory is further 
     <lb/>
     accessible by the navigation of the internal seas, 
     <lb/>
     which bound it on the south. Our rivers com<lb break="no"/>plete the incomparable net-work of communica<lb break="no"/>

     tion by water, and, like vivifying arteries, bear 
     <lb/>
     on their bosom to the ocean and the markets of 
     <lb/>
     the world the heavy produce of the western 
     <lb/>
     plains, the lofty pines of our forests, our ores of 
     <lb/>
     gold and copper, our furs collected in our hunting 
     <lb/>
     grounds, and the produce of our fisheries in the 
     <lb/>
     gulf. In this vast field of productiveness, where 
     <lb/>
     all the materials of immense wealth exist, we 
     <lb/>
     need a moving power, and the inexhaustible coal 
     <lb/>
     fields of Nova Scotia are at hand to furnish it. 
     <lb/>
     British North America, therefore, looms in the 
     <lb/>
     future with gigantic proportions, and it depends 
     <lb/>
     only on ourselves to decide whether the French 
     <lb/>
     element shall have a large share of the power 
     <lb/>
     which is to grow up within its limits. With 
     <lb/>
     energy and union, we shall keep the ground we 
     <lb/>
     have gained in a struggle of a hundred years. 
     <lb/>
     The past is a warranty of success in the future. 
     <lb/>
     Yet must we not hurry matters, nor overrun the 
     <lb/>
     natural progress of events. While we are still 
     <lb/>
     too few to take the offensive, our policy should be 
     <lb/>
     one of resistance. Accordingly, before pledging 
     <lb/>
     myself to the support of Confederation, which is a 
     <lb/>
     total change of the basis of our present Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, I would be perfectly sure that we shall not 
     <lb/>
     lose an inch of ground. More than this ; I would 
     <lb/>
     permit no change to be made in our present Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, except in as far as it would ensure a 
     <lb/>
     larger measure of prosperity for our country, 
     <lb/>
     more powerful protection for our institutions, and 
     <lb/>
     the absolute inviolability of our rights. For I 
     <lb/>
     have not deviated in the smallest degree from the 
     <lb/>
     terms of my address to the electors of Richelieu, 
     <lb/>
     when I had the honor to solicit their votes as their 
     <lb/>
     representative in the Legislative Assembly. In 
     <lb/>
     that address, I declared myself opposed to any 
     <lb/>
    concession whatever to Upper Canada. Accord<lb break="no"/>ingly, if it should appear that the scheme of 
     <lb/>Confederation, which is to be laid before the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Parliament in its next session, would assure 
     <lb/>to French-Canadians greater advantages than they 
     <lb/>enjoy under the present Constitution, I should, as 
     <lb/>a thing of course, be in favor of Confederation. 
     <lb/>But if it should be otherwise; if, in however small 
     <lb/>a degree, Confederation should appear to be a 
     <lb/>concession to Upper Canada, to the detriment of 
     <lb/>our institutions, our language or our laws, I shall 
     <lb/>to the utmost extent of my power oppose any 
     <lb/>change whatever in the present Constitution. Of 
     <lb/>course I am not one of those who would bound 
     <lb/>our political horizon and place limits to our great<lb break="no"/>ness as a people ; on the contrary, nothing would 
     <lb/>render me happier than the creation of a vast 
     <lb/>political organization, spread over an immense 
     <lb/>territory. The heart-burnings between localities 
     <lb/>and individuals would thenceforward cease and die 
     <lb/>out from mere insignificance, as compared with 
     <lb/>the great interests which would be confided to the 
     <lb/>watchful guardianship of our statesmen, and 
     <lb/>become the subject of their deliberations in the 
     <lb/>councils of the nation. Then the laudable ambi<lb break="no"/>tion of achieving a great name in a great country 
     <lb/>would produce a race of great men, of whom we 
     <lb/>might be justly proud. But if this glorious future 
     <lb/>is to be purchased only at the price of our absorp<lb break="no"/>tion, of our language, and all that is dear to 
     <lb/>
          

    
            <cb/>
            
     us as Frenchmen, I for one could not hesitate 
     <lb/>
     between what we may hope for while still remain<lb break="no"/>ing what we are, and the bastardizing of our race 
     <lb/>
     paid as the price of advantages to come. To sum 
     <lb/>
     up all, therefore, I declare for the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     such as it is, which, so far, has yielded us a greater 
     <lb/>
     amount of advantage than all the proposed changes 
     <lb/>
     would ; and such, I venture to say, is the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of the majority of our Legislative Assembly. But 
     <lb/>
     if the projected scheme secures to us in the conven<lb break="no"/>tion all the privileges which the French-Canadiens 
     <lb/>
     now enjoy in the present Parliament, and if, in the 
     <lb/>
     whole and in every part, it secures to us greater 
     <lb/>
     advantages than those which are guaranteed to us 
     <lb/>
     by the Constitution, I shall prefer Confederation 
     <lb/>
     to all other changes.

     I am bound to declare that this way of look<lb break="no"/>ing at the question, in the month of August 
     <lb/>
     last, has undergone no change in my mind, 
     <lb/>
     since I heard the explanations given by the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Administration. The skill 
     <lb/>
     which they have evinced certainly does 
     <lb/>
     them great honor, but neither the arguments 
     <lb/>
     of Ministers, nor those of the members of 
     <lb/>
     the House who support the scheme, have 
     <lb/>
     convinced me ; and I rely on being able to 
     <lb/>
     show in my remarks what are the grounds of 
     <lb/>
     my opposition, and to justify, according to my 
     <lb/>
     way of looking at it, the responsibility which I 
     <lb/>
     undertake in opposing a project which has 
     <lb/>
     found such powerful supporters in this House. 
     <lb/>
     I trust I shall be able to show, first, the 
     <lb/>
     inexpediency of a constitutional change ; 
     <lb/>
     second, the hostile object of Confederation ; 
     <lb/>
     third, the disastrous consequences of the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the project of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     The inexpediency of a constitutional change 
     <lb/>
     must be perfectly evident to any one who 
     <lb/>
     considers for a moment the present prosperity 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, and who takes the trouble to 
     <lb/>
     examine the progress made by United 
     <lb/>
     Canada since 1840. The Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General East says that "the union has done 
     <lb/>
     its work." But is that quite certain? 
     <lb/>
     When we compare the past with the present, 
     <lb/>
     have we not reason to be proud of our growth 
     <lb/>
     since 1840, and of the fact that within the 
     <lb/>
     past twenty-five years, our progress, both 
     <lb/>
     social and material, has kept pace with that 
     <lb/>
     of the first nations in the world? During 
     <lb/>
     the past twenty-five years we have progressed 
     <lb/>
     politically in a manner unprecedented in 
     <lb/>
     colonial history ; and Canada has furnished 
     <lb/>
     a magnificent instance of the good result of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government in an English colony, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding diversity of races and 
     <lb/>
     religions. In 1840, we had just terminated 
     <lb/>
     a glorious struggle, during which, unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately, many lives had been lost— 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="587" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0587.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">587</fw>
           
     struggle undertaken in order to secure 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, which had, up to 
     <lb/>
     that time, been refused, and which was then 
     <lb/>
     accorded us as the reward of the struggle. 
     <lb/>
     At that period Lower Canada was united as 
     <lb/>
     one man ; she had forwarded to England 
     <lb/>
     petitions, bearing 60,000 signatures, asking 
     <lb/>
     for responsible government. We then had 
     <lb/>
     in our ranks men who did not shrink from 
     <lb/>
     the struggle, men accustomed to resist 
     <lb/>
     oppression, men who had grown up in the 
     <lb/>
     midst of a strife with an arrogant minority, 
     <lb/>
     which sought to overrule the majority ; and 
     <lb/>
     these were the great men who secured the 
     <lb/>
     triumph of our nationality, and upheld the 
     <lb/>
     rights of Lower Canada, by securing respon<lb break="no"/>sible government at the same time that the 
     <lb/>
     union was forced upon us. Let us now see 
     <lb/>
     the result of their labors. Is it true that 
     <lb/>
     we have progressed both socially and ma<lb break="no"/>terially since that period ? Any one who 
     <lb/>
     reflects on what Canada was in 1840, and 
     <lb/>
     what it is in 1865, cannot but admit that we 
     <lb/>
     have progressed in a degree almost unpre<lb break="no"/>cedented in the history of the prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     nations ; that we have immensely extended 
     <lb/>
     our territory, by clearing away the forest ; 
     <lb/>
     that our population has increased in a 
     <lb/>
     wonderful manner, that that population is 
     <lb/>
     prosperous and contented, and that we have 
     <lb/>
     progressed materially and socially in a 
     <lb/>
     manner heretoforce unprecedented under the 
     <lb/>
     colonial system. In the social order, let us 
     <lb/>
     examine, first, our legislation and system in 
     <lb/>
     municipal matters. Can a more perfect 
     <lb/>
     system be found anywhere ? Has not every 
     <lb/>
     locality all the powers necessary for effecting 
     <lb/>
     all improvements of real necessity ? It is 
     <lb/>
     since the union that we have perfected this 
     <lb/>
     system, and that we have endowed our rural 
     <lb/>
     districts with the means of effecting all im<lb break="no"/>provements they may desire, and particularly 
     <lb/>
     as regards road matters and the making of 
     <lb/>
     new roads, in order to facilitate the transport 
     <lb/>
     of farm produce to market. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But I need not dwell on the progress we 
     <lb/>
     have made and the reforms we have carried 
     <lb/>
     out, as regards legislation. That which 
     <lb/>
     had chiefly contributed, from the first estab<lb break="no"/>lishment of English rule, to arrest our pro<lb break="no"/>gress in this respect was the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council of the former Legislature, and that 
     <lb/>
     which existed from the union up to 1856. 
     <lb/>
     Since that period have we not obtained an 
     <lb/>
     elective Legislative Council, and must not 
     <lb/>
     our greatest reforms be considered the con<lb break="no"/>sequence ? With the union and responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, did we not also secure the right 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     of being represented by French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     fellow-countrymen in the Executive Coun<lb break="no"/>cil ? And since then have we not enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     all the advantage of a system of government 
     <lb/>
     under which the people can, not only ex<lb break="no"/>press their wants, but enforce their wishes ? 
     <lb/>
     These are reforms of the highest importance, 
     <lb/>
     but we have obtained yet more. When, in 
     <lb/>
     1840, the union of the Canadas took place, 
     <lb/>
     landed property in Lower Canada was sub<lb break="no"/>jected to the feudal system, which had been 
     <lb/>
     introduced with all its features derogatory 
     <lb/>
     to the dignity of man, with all its charges 
     <lb/>
     upon property, and all its vexations for the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">censitaire</hi>. Under that system no property 
     <lb/>
     whatever could change hands without being 
     <lb/>
     submitted to a heavy charge in the form of 
     <lb/>
      <hi rendition="simple:italic">lods et ventes</hi> for the benefit of the seignior, 
     <lb/>
     and to <hi rendition="simple:italic">cens et rentes</hi> which considerably 
     <lb/>
     reduced its value. With the political rights 
     <lb/>
     conferred on us by the union, the seigniorial 
     <lb/>
     system of necessity disappeared, giving us 
     <lb/>
     property in freehold, the same as in the 
     <lb/>
     neighbouring States and in all civilized 
     <lb/>
     nations. It is also since the union that we 
     <lb/>
     have consolidated our laws ; that we have 
     <lb/>
     created a system of public instruction 
     <lb/>
     which imparts the blessings of education 
     <lb/>
     to the most remote parts of the province. 
     <lb/>
     At the present moment we have a school 
     <lb/>
     system which does honor to the country, and 
     <lb/>
     the intelligent, however poor they may be, 
     <lb/>
     can, almost without charge, acquire an edu<lb break="no"/>cation. Now, each village, each concession 
     <lb/>
     has its school, and the child of the back<lb break="no"/>woodsman dwelling in the midst of the forest, 
     <lb/>
     can there obtain a degree of elementary 
     <lb/>
     instruction sufficient to enable him to enter 
     <lb/>
     upon a career of honor and fortune, should 
     <lb/>
     his talents, his industry and his energy fit 
     <lb/>
     him for playing a part in politics, in the 
     <lb/>
     sciences, in the arts or in the ranks of the 
     <lb/>
     clergy of his country. It is a remarkable 
     <lb/>
     fact, Mr. SPEAKER, and one which I deem 
     <lb/>
     it right to mention, that the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     notable men who have attained seats on the 
     <lb/>
     judicial bench, in the Ministry and even in 
     <lb/>
     the Episcopal chair, came forth from our 
     <lb/>
     humble country homes, and qualified them<lb break="no"/>selves in our educational institutions, where 
     <lb/>
     instruction is afforded all but gratuitously, by 
     <lb/>
     dint of talent, perseverance, study and indus<lb break="no"/>try. It was the pressure of want in the 
     <lb/>
     family homestead that in many cases created 
     <lb/>
     in the breasts of our most eminent public 
     <lb/>
     men, the eager desire of attaining a high 
     <lb/>
     position by means of study and labor. Since 
     <lb/>
     the union our system and means of public 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="588" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0588.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">588</fw>
         
     instruction have made immense progress. 
     <lb/>
     Before the union we had no Catholic uni<lb break="no"/>versity in the country. Young men intend<lb break="no"/>ing to enter the liberal professions were 
     <lb/>
     compelled, instead of following a regular 
     <lb/>
     course, to content themselves with what they 
     <lb/>
     could acquire in the office of their patrons, 
     <lb/>
     who were not in all cases competent for the 
     <lb/>
     task they undertook, or else to go abroad at 
     <lb/>
     great expense for many years, in order to 
     <lb/>
     obtain in England or France a certificate of 
     <lb/>
     qualification. To-day we have in Lower and 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada universities rivalling Eu<lb break="no"/>ropean universities of the same class, and we 
     <lb/>
     have also a body of young students, who, 
     <lb/>
     fifteen or twenty years hence, will give proof 
     <lb/>
     of the excellence of our university system, 
     <lb/>
     and of the high curriculum of studies these 
     <lb/>
     institutions have now rendered universal. 
     <lb/>
     Now, in face of the degree of progress I have 
     <lb/>
     just referred to, in the social order, can it be 
     <lb/>
     truly said that the union has run its day, 
     <lb/>
     when all these marvels are its creation ? 
     <lb/>
     When we are stronger and better educated 
     <lb/>
     than we were twenty years ago ; when we 
     <lb/>
     have new political rights : when we have a 
     <lb/>
     free right to the soil, and when we have 
     <lb/>
     created a system of public instruction such 
     <lb/>
     as we now enjoy, can it be said that the union 
     <lb/>
     has done its work, and that it must be broken 
     <lb/>
     up ? For my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I am not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to support that assertion. The union has 
     <lb/>
     been for us a great means of progress, since 
     <lb/>
     it has enabled us to secure all these results 
     <lb/>
     in the social order. The Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral East has told us that Confederation will 
     <lb/>
     procure us material advantages still greater, 
     <lb/>
     and that that is all we want. 1 deny, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that material interests form the 
     <lb/>
     sole ambition of the French-Canadian popu<lb break="no"/>lation. We attach a far higher importance 
     <lb/>
     to the preservation of our own institutions. 
     <lb/>
     But even as regards material interests, apart 
     <lb/>
     from the advantages, in the social order, 
     <lb/>
     derived from the union, we have still a vast 
     <lb/>
     field before us as regards the progress we 
     <lb/>
     have made since 1840. In order to see 
     <lb/>
     what the union has done in this respect, it 
     <lb/>
     is sufficient to look at our system of railroads, 
     <lb/>
     and above all, at the great Grand Trunk line 
     <lb/>
     from Sarnia to Rivière du Loup, which has 
     <lb/>
     increased our commerce tenfold, opened our 
     <lb/>
     dense forests to colonization, and multiplied 
     <lb/>
     our resources to an incalculable extent ; it is 
     <lb/>
     suficient to look at our ports of Montreal 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec during the season of navigation, 
     <lb/>
     filled with vast forests of shipping, to see 
     <lb/>
     our transatlantic steamers bearing off weekly 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     the products of our country to the most 
     <lb/>
     distant European markets, in exchange for 
     <lb/>
     the articles of import we require. And if 
     <lb/>
     we ascend our great River  St. Lawrence, what 
     <lb/>
     do we see ? We find canals, which in their 
     <lb/>
     dimensions, the materials of which they are 
     <lb/>
     constructed, and in their extent, are unsur<lb break="no"/>passed in any part of the world. I main<lb break="no"/>tain, Mr. SPEAKER, that there is nothing to 
     <lb/>
     be found in Europe to compare with our 
     <lb/>
    artificial water communications. In England, 
     <lb/>for instance, the canals are only miserable 
     <lb/>gutters, and the little boys, in rowing their 
     <lb/>boats, can touch both sides at once with the 
     <lb/>ends of their oars. Here our canals pass  
     <lb/>through the whole country, and connect 
     <lb/>the most remote parts of it with the 
     <lb/>markets of Europe. And, in fact, a ship 
     <lb/>of four hundred tons burden can now 
     <lb/>sail from Chicago, cross the ocean, and 
     <lb/>discharge her cargo in the docks at Liver<lb break="no"/>pool. The union which has given us such 
     <lb/>canals, such railways, has not run its 
     <lb/>day, has not done its work, as the Hon. 
     <lb/>Attorney General East pretends. On 
     <lb/>the contrary, with such means as these, 
     <lb/>we are justified in anticipating from the 
     <lb/>union still greater results in the future. If 
     <lb/>we look at our colonization, we behold the 
     <lb/>forest receding before the axe of the settler, 
     <lb/>the products of our land increased tenfold, 
     <lb/>and our settlers locating in advance of the 
     <lb/>surveyor on our wild lands. What the 
     <lb/>union has already done for us is certainly 
     <lb/>great, but the advantages it has in store for 
     <lb/>us are still greater, if we know how to avail 
     <lb/>ourselves of the means it places at our com<lb break="no"/>mand. Therefore it is that I do not think 
     <lb/>the union has done its work, but that, on 
     <lb/>the contrary, it will yet secure our pros<lb break="no"/>perity. And hence it is that I wish to 
     <lb/>preserve the union and remain under 
     <lb/>allegiance to Her Most Gracious Majesty 
     <lb/>the Queen of England, and refuse to accept  
     <lb/>constitutional changes which must of neces<lb break="no"/>sity imperil our future as a nation. (Hear,  
     <lb/>hear.) It has often been said that Lower 
     <lb/>Canada was a drag on Upper Canada, retard<lb break="no"/>ing her advancement in the march of pro<lb break="no"/>gress, and that a new Constitution was 
     <lb/>necessary. I deny the justice of the accusa<lb break="no"/>tion, and I maintain that such a charge 
     <lb/>could only emanate from Upper Canadian 
     <lb/>fanaticism. True, the French Canadian race 
     <lb/>has been characterized at Toronto by a 
     <lb/>Governor General as an "inferior race," but  
     <lb/>the insult thus offered to Lower Canada has

     I am happy to bring forward the testimony 
     <lb/>
     of the Hon. Finance Minister (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     GALT) to refute these assertions, to answer 
     <lb/>
     these insults, and to prove that the prosperity 
     <lb/>
     of Canada is due to the active co-operation 
     <lb/>
     of the French-Canadians—not only in the 
     <lb/>
     Executive, but in the Legislative Assembly. 
     <lb/>
     In a letter written from London in 1860, 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Minister of Finance says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     From 1849 up to this day, the French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     majority has been fairly represented in the Minis<lb break="no"/>try, an it is with its powerful co-operation and 
     <lb/>
     the part it has taken in initiating every measure, 
     <lb/>
     and the support of its votes in Parliament, that 
     <lb/>
     all great reforms have been realized.

            <p>
     Well, if it be true that the French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members of the Government, since 1849, 
     <lb/>
     have, by their unceasing efforts, obtained the 
     <lb/>
     realization of these reforms, why is it now 
     <lb/>
     sought to destroy the Constitution under 
     <lb/>
     which they were obtained, and to create a 
     <lb/>
     new state of things which will diminish that 
     <lb/>
     influence which we now enjoy ? It is be<lb break="no"/>cause, notwithstanding our material pros<lb break="no"/>perity, the old aggression of race against 
     <lb/>
     race, the former state of antagonism and 
     <lb/>
     ill-will, has not disappeared. The end pro<lb break="no"/>posed to be attained by the Government in 
     <lb/>
     making these changes is a vast and noble 
     <lb/>
     end, I admit. It is the creation of an im<lb break="no"/>mense Empire, which will redound to our 
     <lb/>
     glory and to that of England. But it seems 
     <lb/>
     to me that this will not be the necessary 
     <lb/>
     result of the means which are being taken 
     <lb/>
     to attain it. (Hear, hear.) Whenever the 
     <lb/>
     great measures of reform to which I have 
     <lb/>
     already referred have been submitted to 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, we have seen public men devote 
     <lb/>
     themselves exclusively to these measures, 
     <lb/>
     and labor for their realization. We have 
     <lb/>
     seen parties arrayed for or against these 
     <lb/>
     great questions—the abolition of the Seigni<lb break="no"/>orial Tenure, the election of the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Council, the construction 
     <lb/>
     of our railways and canals, &amp;c. In view of 
     <lb/>
     these great questions, there was no room for 
     <lb/>
     the contemptible personal considerations, 
     <lb/>
     and the miserable wrangling of the church 
     <lb/>
     door ; but as soon as these great reforms 
     <lb/>
     were obtained, there was no longer any 
     <lb/>
     ground for opposition to the Government on 
     <lb/>
     these subjects ; yet subjects for the exhibi<lb break="no"/>tion of discontent and opposition had to be 
     <lb/>
     devised, with the view of attaining power, 
     <lb/>
     and of satisfying individual ambition. They 
     <lb/>
     then addressed themselves to the prejudices 
     <lb/>
     of race and religion. A cry was raised in Up<lb break="no"/>
        
            <cb/>
           per Canada that French-Canadian domination 
     <lb/>
     could no longer be endured, and that an end 
     <lb/>
     must be put to it. No heed was taken of 
     <lb/>
     the progress that had yet to be made, but it 
     <lb/>
     seemed as though nothing required to be 
     <lb/>
     done in order to attain success, but to destroy 
     <lb/>
     the national character of a large section of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. They complained of French domi<lb break="no"/>nation, the influence of the clergy, and of the 
     <lb/>
     great number of religious institutions in 
     <lb/>
      Canada ; and what was the remedy proposed 
     <lb/>
     to put an end to all these evils which Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada could no longer tolerate ? The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN) was imported, and brought out 
     <lb/>
     here from Scotland, to cast the flaming torch 
     <lb/>
     of discord between the two populations, and 
     <lb/>
     to inflame them one against the other. I 
     <lb/>
     emagine that since that time the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BUCHANAN must have more than once regret<lb break="no"/>ted this importation, which was not quite in 
     <lb/>
     the regular line of his commercial operations. 
     <lb/>
     And when this gentleman had been imported, 
     <lb/>
     who has been the cause of all our dissen<lb break="no"/>sions up to the present time, parties were 
     <lb/>
     organized under his command as they are 
     <lb/>
     this day. To diminish or destroy the in<lb break="no"/>fluence of the French-Canadians in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, the hon. member for South Oxford 
     <lb/>
     raised a clamour for representation based 
     <lb/>
     upon population, which was reëchoed from 
     <lb/>
     one end of Upper Canada to the other. 
     <lb/>
     These cries, the offspring of fanaticism, were 
     <lb/>
     rejected by Lower Canada with unanimity 
     <lb/>
     on the part of our public men. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South Oxford, finding that 
     <lb/>
     this cry for representation based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation was a magnificent war-horse, made 
     <lb/>
     use of it to form a party. Since that 
     <lb/>
     period he has allowed nothing to stand in 
     <lb/>
     his way. He has calumniated every public 
     <lb/>
     man and all the institutions which were 
     <lb/>
     held in respect by the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada ; he has attacked, with the 
     <lb/>
     greatest fury, all that was dear to us as 
     <lb/>
     Frenchmen and Catholics ; and by this 
     <lb/>
     means he gained his object ; and we have 
     <lb/>
     seen all the western farmers, all the inhabit<lb break="no"/>ants of Canada West, cry out that here we 
     <lb/>
     were all under the domination of the clergy, 
     <lb/>
     and that the English and Protestant popula<lb break="no"/>tion ought not to submit to so heavy a yoke. 
     <lb/>
     He knew that the English element was 
     <lb/>
     fanatic and aggressive, and by means of this 
     <lb/>
     cry the then leader of the Opposition in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada succeeded in forming a 
     <lb/>
     phalanx so strong, that Lower Canada has 
     <lb/>
    been compelled to yield some portion of the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="590" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0590.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">590</fw>
         
     ground which she had conquered in her 
     <lb/>
      struggles of former days. I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     that there  is a single member for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada who would wish to change our 
     <lb/>
     present Constitution in the manner now 
     <lb/>
     proposed, were he not forced to it by Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. We are, then, about to give up 
     <lb/>
     some of our franchises and our rights in 
     <lb/>
     this new struggle against the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     encroachment and domination manifested by 
     <lb/>
     the English race. Hon. members who 
     <lb/>
     support the measure will tell you that they 
     <lb/>
     are giving up a part of our rights, in order 
     <lb/>
     that what remains may be saved from destruc<lb break="no"/>tion, and that they may not lose all they now 
     <lb/>
     enjoy, before any lengthened period shall 
     <lb/>
     have elapsed. But was this clamor in favor 
     <lb/>
     of representation based upon population 
     <lb/>
     sincere on the part of those who used it as 
     <lb/>
     a means of attacking us ? Was it in reality 
     <lb/>
     a remedy for the evils of which they 
     <lb/>
     complained ? No, Mr. SPEAKER, I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it was. It was simply an electoral plat<lb break="no"/>form, by which to attain power and consum<lb break="no"/>mate the encroachment upon our rights con<lb break="no"/>templated by the leaders of the movement. I do 
     <lb/>
     not deem it necessary to repeat here all the 
     <lb/>
     arguments brought to bear against the de<lb break="no"/>mand for representation by population, in 
     <lb/>
     eighty speeches delivered in 1860, during 
     <lb/>
     the discussion of that exciting question ; 
     <lb/>
     but I remember that debate with all the 
     <lb/>
     more pleasure, that the French-Canadians 
     <lb/>
     showed that they retained some vestiges of 
     <lb/>
     firmness in the day of battle, and of perse<lb break="no"/>verance in the maintenance of our rights, 
     <lb/>
     which our fathers had so often manifested. 
     <lb/>
     On that occasion the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) deserved the 
     <lb/>
     approbation of his country for the resistance 
     <lb/>
     he made to that unjust demand on the part 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada, with that energy and 
     <lb/>
     tenacity he is so well known to display ; he 
     <lb/>
     was the champion of our rights. Why, 
     <lb/>
     then, does he to-day come down and propose 
     <lb/>
     a compromise with his opponents of those 
     <lb/>
     days ? Is it just at the moment when the 
     <lb/>
     leaders of the Upper Canadian Opposition 
     <lb/>
     had, by entering the MACDONALD-SICOTTE 
     <lb/>
     Government, absolutely rejected the principle 
     <lb/>
     of  representation based upon population, 
     <lb/>
     that he should abandon the struggle ? Is it 
     <lb/>
     at the moment the MACDONALD-SICOTTE 
     <lb/>
     Government had obtained separate schools 
     <lb/>
     for the Catholics of Upper Canada, that the 
     <lb/>
     party led by the honorable member for South 
     <lb/>
     Oxford was to be dreaded ? Is it at the 
     <lb/>
     moment when the law providing separate 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     schools for the Catholics of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     was the subject of a triumph, which the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General had never suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in obtaining during the whole time 
     <lb/>
     he has been in power, that the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General should cease from further 
     <lb/>
      efforts, throw down his arms, and de<lb break="no"/>clare as a French-Canadian that we could 
     <lb/>
     no longer hold the breach, and that we 
     <lb/>
     must make concessions to Upper Canada ? 
     <lb/>
     Did not the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration make a close question of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population ? Were not all the 
     <lb/>
     members of that Government bound to oppose 
     <lb/>
     it ? Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, the Hon. Attorney-<lb break="yes"/>General East was guilty of a grievous wrong, 
     <lb/>
     when he defeated that Government by a 
     <lb/>
     hostile majority composed of French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians. It was after that hostile vote that 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada insisted on her right to renew 
     <lb/>
     her claims to representation based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation, and that we are compelled to-day to 
     <lb/>
     make concessions. For my part, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I have never been convinced of 
     <lb/>
     the sincerity of those who made use of the 
     <lb/>
     cry for representation based on population, 
     <lb/>
     for I have never seen any other means 
     <lb/>
     employed to obtain the aid of the western 
     <lb/>
     farmers in securing more easily the reins of 
     <lb/>
     power. Has the principle of representation 
     <lb/>
     based on population ever served as the basis 
     <lb/>
     of a government having monarchical ideas, 
     <lb/>
     like those which actuate the existing Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ? Now we are seeking for a Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation for which there is no precedent—not a 
     <lb/>
     Confederation like those to be found in other 
     <lb/>
     countries which have adopted that form of 
     <lb/>
     government, but a monarchical Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear, hear.) It is sought to retain 
     <lb/>
     the English Constitution, and yet it is assert<lb break="no"/>ed that representation by population is a 
     <lb/>
     just principle, and that it must be extended 
     <lb/>
     to Upper Canada. Does not the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) 
     <lb/>
     remember the arguments he urged in 1860 
     <lb/>
     against this principle ? Did he not then declare 
     <lb/>
     with the view of showing that the principle 
     <lb/>
     was neither a just one nor one recognized 
     <lb/>
     in the British Constitution, that if it were 
     <lb/>
     applied to the British Parliament the city 
     <lb/>
     of London alone would have thirty members 
     <lb/>
     instead of sixteen, and that Scotland would 
     <lb/>
     send many more members to Parliament 
     <lb/>
     than she does now ?  Did he not assert that 
     <lb/>
     rotten boroughs, containing only a few hun<lb break="no"/>dred inhabitants, had one representative, 
     <lb/>
     and that counties containing 100,000 in<lb break="no"/>habitants had no more ? Have these argu<lb break="no"/>
         
            <pb n="591" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0591.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">591</fw>
       
     ments, then so full of power, lost all their 
     <lb/>
     force and value to-day? Have they become 
     <lb/>
     futile since the alliance of the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General East and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford? Can they no longer be 
     <lb/>
     used to save our Constitution and our 
     <lb/>
     liberties? How can the party which has 
     <lb/>
     so long been kept together by its opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the principle of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion, say to-day that it is a just principle, 
     <lb/>
     and that it must be conceded? I confess, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, that I cannot understand 
     <lb/>
     why we should concede to-day what we 
     <lb/>
     refused in 1860. It is true that I do not 
     <lb/>
     possess the experience of the hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who now occupy the Ministerial benches, 
     <lb/>
     and that, perhaps, it may be wiser to bend 
     <lb/>
     to-day than to be broken to-morrow ; but 
     <lb/>
     when I study the history of the past, when 
     <lb/>
     I look at things as they are, and look for<lb break="no"/>ward to the future which is now proposed 
     <lb/>
     for us, I only see in the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation a remedy which is more violent 
     <lb/>
     than the disease, and which, instead of 
     <lb/>
     removing the difficulties it is proposed to 
     <lb/>
     eradicate, will only have the effect of pro<lb break="no"/>ducing results the most unfavorable to 
     <lb/>
     the peace and prosperity of our country. 
     <lb/>
     I state then, Mr. SPEAKER, that the 
     <lb/>
     question of representation by population, 
     <lb/>
     which has been the principal cause of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme, was excluded from the 
     <lb/>
     political programme of the MACDONALD-<lb break="yes"/>
     SICOTTE Government, and that the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada majority, the leaders of which, 
     <lb/>
     throughout their whole political career, had 
     <lb/>
     so loudly demanded this concession in favor 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada, had bound itself not to 
     <lb/>
     raise that exciting question within the halls 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislature, at least during the exist<lb break="no"/>ence of the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Ministry. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I stated that, thanks to the 
     <lb/>
     patriotic firmness of that Administration, 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada was enabled for two years to 
     <lb/>
     live in peace and enjoy the fruits of a tran<lb break="no"/>quility unknown for ten years previous, and 
     <lb/>
     during two sessions the question of represen<lb break="no"/>tation based on numbers ceased to be a sub<lb break="no"/>ject of strife and fanatical attack on the part 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada. (Hear, hear.) It was 
     <lb/>
     at that period that the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford asked for a committee to 
     <lb/>
     enquire as to the means of settling the sec<lb break="no"/>tional difficulties, by effecting a change in 
     <lb/>
     the basis of the present Constitution. ( Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Well, Mr. SPEAKER, what took 
     <lb/>
     place then? We saw that able speaker, that 
     <lb/>
     indefatigable and powerful advocate of the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     claims of Upper Canada against the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada section, unable to find in this House 
     <lb/>
     more than forty men prepared to support 
     <lb/>
     him in his unjust demand for a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     change which the present Administration are 
     <lb/>
     about to grant. (Hear, hear.) We saw that 
     <lb/>
     powerful politician humbled, and giving up 
     <lb/>
     in despair all hopes of succeeding with the 
     <lb/>
     House—and, for my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     must say that I felt pained at his position 
     <lb/>
     —asking a leave of absence in order to 
     <lb/>
     avoid a humiliating defeat, and returning to 
     <lb/>
     his home to lament his fall and the loss of 
     <lb/>
     an influence based solely on fanaticism and 
     <lb/>
     prejudice. (Hear, hear.) Subsequently, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, the House witnessed an act 
     <lb/>
     which I do not desire to characterize now ; 
     <lb/>
     we saw the Administration which had the 
     <lb/>
     courage to chain down the monster of re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population, overthrown by a 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian majority! (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Yes, Mr.SPEAKER, that Liberal government, 
     <lb/>
     which had afforded so much security to our 
     <lb/>
     institutions by maintaining intact our present 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, was defeated by a French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dian majority of this House. I do not intend, 
     <lb/>
     when I say this, to attack my fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen, far from it ; but I wish to 
     <lb/>
     trace the parliamentary history of our 
     <lb/>
     country, and I do not hesitate to assert that 
     <lb/>
     that vote gave a fatal blow to our in<lb break="no"/>fluence as French-Canadians, and that 
     <lb/>
     posterity will record that vote, which is now 
     <lb/>
     a matter of history, as a fatal act by which 
     <lb/>
     our public men sacrificed to party spirit 
     <lb/>
     the dearest of our interests. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I fearlessly assert, Mr. SPEAKER, that for 
     <lb/>
     fifteen years our affairs had not been admi<lb break="no"/>nistered by men more sincerely devoted to 
     <lb/>
     our interests and better able- to protect the 
     <lb/>
     political liberties, the interests and the 
     <lb/>
     institutions of Lower Canada. What have 
     <lb/>
     we seen during the past fifteen years in this 
     <lb/>
     House? We have witnessed party appeals 
     <lb/>
     to prejudices and the most insulting person<lb break="no"/>alities; and, in fact, the lowering of the 
     <lb/>
     moral <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> of our national representatives, 
     <lb/>
     as the natural result. We have seen the 
     <lb/>
     men best qualified to enforce, on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     this House, the rights of the people, refusing 
     <lb/>
     to come forward at elections, because they 
     <lb/>
     saw that the position of a member of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment no longer conferred that degree of 
     <lb/>
     dignity and position which made it an object 
     <lb/>
     of ambition in better times. We have seen 
     <lb/>
     men of eminence, who had labored in behalf 
     <lb/>
     of the interests of their constituents for 
     <lb/>
     many long years, abandoning their political 
     <lb/>

     career in disgust, and retiring to the 
     <lb/>
     seclusion of their homes. Then it was that 
     <lb/>
     we saw a French-Canadian majority voting 
     <lb/>
     down a Ministry whose political programme 
     <lb/>
     afforded more effectual guarantees for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada interests than that of any previous 
     <lb/>
     government. (Hear, hear.) But a blind 
     <lb/>
     and paltry party spirit induced them to 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice, for a momentary triumph, the 
     <lb/>
     general interests of their country; and the 
     <lb/>
     majority, by its vote, decreed our national 
     <lb/>
     downfall. (Hear, hear.) Well, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     under the new Government we found repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population again made a subject 
     <lb/>
     of discussion in our Legislature; and now, 
     <lb/>
     there is no denying it, that unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     concession, which places us at the mercy of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, has become an accomplished 
     <lb/>
     fact. (Hear, hear.) I stated, just now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     Oxford was unable to obtain his committee 
     <lb/>
     under the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, an essentially liberal one. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
      hear.) On reference to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journals</hi> of this 
     <lb/>
     House of that period, what do we find? 
     <lb/>
     The Ministry which succeeded that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had hardly taken possession of the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches, when the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN again came before the House ask<lb break="no"/>ing for a committee, and in that instance 
     <lb/>
     with more success. I had the honor to pro<lb break="no"/>pose an amendment to his motion, but my 
     <lb/>
     amendment was rejected, and amongst the 
     <lb/>
     members who figure in that unfortunate divi<lb break="no"/>sion, I find the names of the Hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works, the Hon. Provincial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     and the Hon. Attorney General East. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, this is a very significant fact, and 
     <lb/>
     one extremely deserving of attention at the 
     <lb/>
     present moment. ln pressing that motion 
     <lb/>
     upon the House, I maintained that our policy 
     <lb/>
     was to act on the offensive, instead of merely 
     <lb/>
     defending ourselves, as we had up to that 
     <lb/>
     time done; that we ought to unite as one 
     <lb/>
     man to obtain the re-enactment of the proviso 
     <lb/>
     to the 26th clause of the Act of Union, which 
     <lb/>
     had been shamefully struck out in 1856, 
     <lb/>
     when we obtained an elective Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council. (Hear, hear.) Now, on this point, 
     <lb/>
     which was perfectly clear, we found these 
     <lb/>
     same Ministers voting for the rejection of 
     <lb/>
     the amendment, which asserted a right sacred 
     <lb/>
     to French-Canadians. Did not this vote 
     <lb/>
     imply that those who made this cowardly 
     <lb/>
     concession were prepared to yield again in 
     <lb/>
     the proposed constitutional changes? Yes, 
     <lb/>
    Mr. SPEAKER, I do not hesitate to assert, that 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
            
            from that moment, Upper Canada understood 
     <lb/>that our political leaders, who, up to that 
     <lb/>time, had shown an unyielding front, were 
     <lb/>about to give way. And when the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>BROWN submitted his proposition to the 
     <lb/>House, all the English members united in an 
     <lb/>overwhelming majority, and he carried his 
     <lb/>point successfully, notwithstanding that all 
     <lb/>the French-Canadian members voted against 
     <lb/>it, except the hon. member for Rouville (Mr. 
     <lb/>POULIN), who displayed the questionable 
     <lb/>courage of thus committing an act I shall 
     <lb/>not attempt to qualify. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>need not dwell upon the consequences of 
     <lb/>that vote, for they are now patent to the 
     <lb/>whole country, and the hon. member for 
     <lb/>South Oxford himself has told us in this 
     <lb/>House that the scheme of Confederation was 
     <lb/>the creation of his constitutional committee; 
     <lb/>that the appointment of that committee was 
     <lb/>the first step in the direction of the object 
     <lb/>for which he had struggled during his whole 
     <lb/>political career, and that the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation now before the House was an 
     <lb/>ample reward for his unremitting efforts, 
     <lb/>and a complete justification of the princi<lb break="no"/>ples he has supported in the struggle be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper Canada and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>Subsequently, Mr. SPEAKER, the TACHÉ-<lb break="yes"/>MACDONALD Government succumbed on a 
     <lb/>question of finance, and, finding that they 
     <lb/>could not sustain themselves without the 
     <lb/>assistance of the Opposition, that same Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment called into the Cabinet the man who 
     <lb/>had proved most hostile to Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>interests, and with whom they had ever lived 
     <lb/>in unexampled antagonism. From that 
     <lb/>alliance resulted the scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>which is now submitted to us, and which 
     <lb/>concedes the principle of representation based 
     <lb/>on population. Ought the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>party to have made so important a concession 
     <lb/>to Upper Canada? I am prepared to estab<lb break="no"/>lish by figures that that question contained 
     <lb/>within itself its own remedy; and those who 
     <lb/>voted in favor of its concession are in no way 
     <lb/>justifiable, looking at the question in any 
     <lb/>point of view whatsoever. The future held 
     <lb/>out to us a positive assurance that the grounds 
     <lb/>of this demand would no longer exist at a 
     <lb/>period which is close at hand! When we 
     <lb/>look into the question of the respective 
     <lb/>populations of the two Canadas, we shall 
     <lb/>observe at a glance that that of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada is in great part English and Protest<lb break="no"/>ant, and, by reference to the last census, we 
     <lb/>shall find that a very large proportion of the 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="593" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0593.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">593</fw>
       
     annual increase in that section is the result 
     <lb/>
     of emigration. From 90,000, which was the 
     <lb/>
     total amount during the single year 1847, 
     <lb/>
     immigration gradually fell to 10,000 in the 
     <lb/>
     year 1860. But there is another important 
     <lb/>
     fact which it would be well to bear in mind ; 
     <lb/>
     it is that Lower Canada, which increased 
     <lb/>
     slowly at first, because her material and moral 
     <lb/>
     development was impeded by the political 
     <lb/>
     institutions under which she was governed, 
     <lb/>
     and because she had no colonization roads 
     <lb/>
     through her forests, still beheld her sturdy 
     <lb/>
     children emigrating from their native soil 
     <lb/>
     to the United States in search of daily bread 
     <lb/>
     and liberty. The increase in the population 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada was slow and small then ; 
     <lb/>
     but as railways were built and highways 
     <lb/>
     were opened, the population was found to 
     <lb/>
     increase in nearly the same proportion as 
     <lb/>
     the diminution was observed to be going on, 
     <lb/>
     in respect of annual increase, in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I maintain further, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     that the census of 1861 is no basis from 
     <lb/>
     which to estimate exactly the total popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the two sections ; that census is 
     <lb/>
     merely a tissue of errors of a serious nature, 
     <lb/>
     which demonstrate the inaccuracy of the 
     <lb/>
     whole. Thus when we find it stated that at 
     <lb/>
     Three Rivers there is not a single Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church ; that at Hamilton there is but one ; 
     <lb/>
     that in the year 1861 there were but three 
     <lb/>
     vessels built in Lower Canada, while we know 
     <lb/>
     that at Quebec alone more than sixty were 
     <lb/>
     constructed, we may with perfect safety assert 
     <lb/>
     that similar inaccuracies must needs have 
     <lb/>
     occurred in the totals of the populations of 
     <lb/>
     the two sections. We know that in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada the true total of the population has 
     <lb/>
     been greatly exaggerated. Did not all their 
     <lb/>
     journals declare that the census of 1861 
     <lb/>
     must indicate a very large total population 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Upper Canada over Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada ? And, accordingly, the result shewed 
     <lb/>
     a majority of nearly 300,000 souls in 
     <lb/>
     favor of that province. To such an extent 
     <lb/>
     was the number of the living increased, and 
     <lb/>
     the number of the dead diminished, that the 
     <lb/>
     total number of living children under one year 
     <lb/>
     old was 8,000 more than the total number 
     <lb/>
     of births in the year. (Hear, hear.) I am 
     <lb/>
     quite willing to admit that the climate of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada is most salubrious and highly 
     <lb/>
     favorable to the development of that part of 
     <lb/>
      the population of a less age than one year, 
     <lb/>
     but even then there is some difliculty in 
     <lb/>
     understanding how it is that in twelve 
     <lb/>
     months some of them do not die, and how 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     there can be 8,000 more of less than a year 
     <lb/>
     old than were born during the preceding 
     <lb/>
     twelve months. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     When I observe such results accruing from 
     <lb/>
     our official census, I am compelled to believe 
     <lb/>
     that it is inaccurate, and that it may be 
     <lb/>
     quite as erroneous in respect of the general 
     <lb/>
     population. But if in  the census the 
     <lb/>
     population of Upper Canada was exagger<lb break="no"/>ated, in the case of Lower Canada, on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, it has been considerably diminished. 
     <lb/>
     Here our farmers have always stood in dread 
     <lb/>
     of the census, because they have a suspicion 
     <lb/>
     that it is taken with the sole object of im<lb break="no"/>posing some tax, or of making some draft of 
     <lb/>
     men for the defence of the country. Under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances, I consider that the 
     <lb/>
      difference between the totals of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Upper and Lower Canada is not so 
     <lb/>
     well proved as it is wished to have us believe 
     <lb/>
     that it is. I maintain that it is less in reality 
     <lb/>
     than it is in appearance, and that the figures 
     <lb/>
     of the census are not sufficently accurate to 
     <lb/>
     allow of our taking them as the basis of a 
     <lb/>
     demand for constitutional changes of so im<lb break="no"/>portant a character. But if we study the 
     <lb/>
     increase of the French-Canadian population 
     <lb/>
     in America, we shall find the increase of the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians to have been 1,700,000 
     <lb/>
     between the years 1760 and 1860, the total 
     <lb/>
     having increased tenfold two and a half times 
     <lb/>
     in that period, and this is equivalent to 3.40 
     <lb/>
     per cent. per annum, or a doubling of the 
     <lb/>
     population in twenty-one years ; otherwise 
     <lb/>
     an increase of twenty-five times their num<lb break="no"/>ber in one hundred years. The increase, since 
     <lb/>
     1860, having been 3.60 per cent. in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, these figures show that the natural 
     <lb/>
     increase in the Lower Canadian population 
     <lb/>
     is greater than it is anywhere else. In 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada the average of births has 
     <lb/>
     been 3.40 per cent. per annum, and in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada it has been 4.10 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     per annum ; this is equivalent to a greater 
     <lb/>
     relative increase of 20 per cent. in favor 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada over Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     If a calculation is made of the progres<lb break="no"/>sive increase of the French population 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada, from  1784 to 1851, 
     <lb/>
     the following results will be arrived 
     <lb/>
     at:—

     But the growth of population that would

     have resulted from this increase has been

            <fw type="num">594</fw>
           
     diminished by emigration to the United 
     <lb/>
     States. The difficulties between the sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the province have, during long 
     <lb/>
     years, driven our youth to foreign countries, 
     <lb/>
     and that is why that considerable increase 
     <lb/>
     does not appear, by the census, so great as in 
     <lb/>
     reality it has been. Thus the total number 
     <lb/>
     of French-Canadian emigrants to the United 
     <lb/>
     States amounted, in 1841, to 34,000; from 
     <lb/>
     1844 to 1850 the total amounted to 30,000; 
     <lb/>
     making, in 1850, a grand total of 64,000 of 
     <lb/>
     our countrymen who had passed into foreign 
     <lb/>
     lands. With such an emigration going on, 
     <lb/>
     it is clear that our population could not in<lb break="no"/>crease with rapidity; but now, fortunately, 
     <lb/>
     the movement of our population has assumed 
     <lb/>
     a contrary direction. Many families have 
     <lb/>
     already returned to us, whilst many others 
     <lb/>
     are only awaiting a favorable opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     return to the country, which they ought 
     <lb/>
     never to have left. The French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     population in the United States is still very 
     <lb/>
     considerable, as the following figures will 
     <lb/>
     show: in the State of Vermont there are 
     <lb/>
     14,000 French-Canadians ; in the State of 
     <lb/>
     New York 20,000; in Ohio and Pennsyl<lb break="no"/>vania, 6,000; in Michigan, 30,000; in Illi<lb break="no"/>nois, 20,000; in Wisconsin, 12,000; in 
     <lb/>
     Indiana, 5,000 ; in Minnesota, 15,000—with<lb break="no"/>out taking into consideration the fact that 
     <lb/>
     nearly 35,000 of our young men, besides, are 
     <lb/>
     enrolled in the army of the United States. 
     <lb/>
     What took place in Canada also took place 
     <lb/>
     in Acadia, where the French population also 
     <lb/>
     increased in a manner which was truly 
     <lb/>
     astonishing. From 1707 to 1737 this in<lb break="no"/>crease amounted to a proportion of 6 per 
     <lb/>
     cent. per annum ; in thirty years the total 
     <lb/>
     had increased fivefold. It continued to 
     <lb/>
     increase in nearly a like proportion up to 
     <lb/>
     1755, the memorable date of the deportation 
     <lb/>
     of the Acadians. From 1755 to 1855 the 
     <lb/>
     Acadians increased tenfold by themselves, 
     <lb/>
     and now the French-Acadian population in 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces and in the State of 
     <lb/>
     Maine is distributed as follows :—

     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     one, for it goes to prove that in ten years 
     <lb/>
     the total population of Upper and Lower: 
     <lb/>
     Canada will be equal, and that, consequently, 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional changes resulting from the 
     <lb/>
     question of representation based on popula<lb break="no"/>tion are not called for:—

     This amounts to saying that in thirty years 
     <lb/>
     the proportion of increase has diminished 
     <lb/>
     by more than 50 per cent., and that diminu<lb break="no"/>tion of annual increase has been consequent

     upon the diminution of immigration. The

     In 1854 we had no railways as we have to<lb break="no"/>day, and consequently the European emigra<lb break="no"/>tion which was directed to the United States 
     <lb/>
     did not pass through Canada, as it does now, 
     <lb/>
     towards the Western States. In 1854 the 
     <lb/>
     immigration was 53,000, and all who landed 
     <lb/>
     in Canada settled there at once; but in 1864 
     <lb/>
     the immigration fell to 19,000, of whom not 
     <lb/>
     more than one half remained in the country ; 
     <lb/>
     the remainder went on to the Western States. 
     <lb/>
     Thus it may be said that the immigration, 
     <lb/>
     which numbered more than 53,000 souls in 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="595" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0595.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">595</fw>
           
     1854, has fallen in ten years to 8,000 only for 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, whilst in Lower Canada we 
     <lb/>
     have increased, by natural progress, in the 
     <lb/>
     proportion of from 2.20 per cent. to 2.60 per 
     <lb/>
     cent. during the same period. And it is just at 
     <lb/>
     the time that our population is increasing in 
     <lb/>
     this proportion that it is proposed to grant to 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada representation based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation. Why do we not still resist ? We 
     <lb/>
     are told that if we wait longer the dispro<lb break="no"/>portion will be increased. I maintain, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the above calculations, and in view 
     <lb/>
     of other considerations that I shall by and 
     <lb/>
     by have the honor to submit to this House, 
     <lb/>
     that we can only be the gainers in this matter, 
     <lb/>
     because the proportion of our natural increase 
     <lb/>
     is increasing, while that of immigration is 
     <lb/>
     diminishing. In thirty years, from 1829 to 
     <lb/>
     1860, 942,735 immigrants landed on our 
     <lb/>
     shores, nearly all of whom settled in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. And there is another fact to which 
     <lb/>
     I beg to call the attention of the House, and 
     <lb/>
     that is, that the Irish emigration, which 
     <lb/>
     amounted in 1851 to 22,381, diminished dur<lb break="no"/>ing the ten following years to 376 in 1861, 
     <lb/>
     and it is a well known fact that it was this 
     <lb/>
     wholesale deportation from the Emerald Isle 
     <lb/>
     which has made the population of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada what it is to-day. But it is not ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to consult the census to arrive at the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that the proportionate difference in 
     <lb/>
     the increase of the populations of the two 
     <lb/>
     sections of the province is only due to the 
     <lb/>
     arrival in the country of this million of immi<lb break="no"/>grants. If we study the proportion of births, 
     <lb/>
     or of the natural increase, we shall see that 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada has increased its population 
     <lb/>
     more rapidly than Upper Canada, and that 
     <lb/>
     there are more births in proportion in our 
     <lb/>
     section of the province. As these artificial 
     <lb/>
     sources of increase diminish in Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     we may be certain that the equililbrium will 
     <lb/>
     be established between the two populations. 
     <lb/>
     There is yet another cause which must con<lb break="no"/>tribute to reëstablish this equilibrium, and I 
     <lb/>
     find it in an official report written by the 
     <lb/>
    present Honorable Provincial Secretary (Hon. 
     <lb/>Mr. MCDOUGALL) when he was Commissioner 
     <lb/>of Crown Lands. The cause of colonization 
     <lb/>has attracted, for several years past, the special 
     <lb/>attention of our clergy and of the influential 
     <lb/>inhabitants of the country, so soon as it 
     <lb/>became generally known that the increase of 
     <lb/>the population in Upper Canada would lead 
     <lb/>very soon to constitutional changes, having for 
     <lb/>their object representation based upon popula<lb break="no"/>tion, with all its disastrous results for the 
     <lb/>minority. Since that period new colonization 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     roads have been opened for the surplus popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the old counties, and our youth, 
     <lb/>
     instead of expatriating themselves, plunge 
     <lb/>
     into the forests to clear the land, and thus to 
     <lb/>
     increase the strength of the French element. 
     <lb/>
     The cause of the diminution in the increase 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada, of which I have just spoken, 
     <lb/>
     may be found in the important fact that the 
     <lb/>
     best disposable lands are nearly exhausted—I 
     <lb/>
     do not mean to say that they have lost their 
     <lb/>
     fertility, but that they arc nearly all occupied. 
     <lb/>
     We require no better proof of my assertion 
     <lb/>
     than the report of the Honorable Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Crown Lands for 1862, from which 
     <lb/>
     I ask permission to cite the following para<lb break="no"/>graph :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     It will be observed that the whole quantity of 
     <lb/>
     land sold during the past year is less by 252,471 
     <lb/>
     acres than in 1861. The falling off is equal to 
     <lb/>
     about 38.5 per cent. The fact is significant, and 
     <lb/>
     suggests enquiry as to the cause. It may, I think, 
     <lb/>
     be attributed to the commercial and monetary de<lb break="no"/>rangements resulting from the civil war in the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring country; to the retarding influence 
     <lb/>
     of that war upon immigration, and to the dimin<lb break="no"/>ished means of purchasers within the country by 
     <lb/>
     reason of the generally deficient harvest of 1862. 
     <lb/>
     Another cause may be mentioned, which, in an 
     <lb/>
     official view, is more important than either of 
     <lb/>
     these, because its influence is not accidental or 
     <lb/>
     temporary. It is the fact that the best lands of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown in both sections of the province have 
     <lb/>
     already been sold. The quantity of really good 
     <lb/>
     land now open for sale is, notwithstanding recent 
     <lb/>
     surveys, much less than formerly, and is rapidly 
     <lb/>
     diminishing. The new surveys in Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     have added, during the last five years, no less 
     <lb/>
     than 2,808,172 acres to the land roll of the de<lb break="no"/>partment. The addition during the same period, 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada, was 1,968,168 acres. Yet it 
     <lb/>
     may be doubted if there are to-day as many acres 
     <lb/>
     of wild land of the first quality at the disposal of 
     <lb/>
     the department as there were in 1857. The cler<lb break="no"/>gy, school and Crown lands of the western penin<lb break="no"/>sula, the most desirable, both as to quality and 
     <lb/>
     situation, of all the public lands of the province, 
     <lb/>
     are mostly sold; the few lots that remain are gen<lb break="no"/>erally of inferior quality. The new townships 
     <lb/>
     between the Ottawa and Lake Huron contain 
     <lb/>
     much good land, but they are separated from the 
     <lb/>
     settled townships on the St. Lawrence and north 
     <lb/>
     shore of Lake Ontario by a rocky, barren tract, 
     <lb/>
     which varies in width from ten to twenty miles, 
     <lb/>
     and presents a serious obstruction to the influx of 
     <lb/>
     settlers. Moreover, the good land in these new 
     <lb/>
     townships is composed of small tracts, here and 
     <lb/>
     there, separated from each other by rocky ridges, 
     <lb/>
     swamps and lakes, which render difficult the con<lb break="no"/>struction of roads, and interrupt the continuity 
     <lb/>
     of settlement. These unfavorable circumstances 
     <lb/>
     have induced the better class of settlers in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada to seek, at the hands of private owners, 
     <lb/>
     for lands of a better quality and more desirable 
     <lb/>

     location, though the price and terms of sale are 
     <lb/>
     more onerous than for the lands of the Crown.

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I think that this official report contains a 
     <lb/>
     statement of great importancc to Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, and which it is desirable should be 
     <lb/>
     clearly demonstrated before we decide whether 
     <lb/>
     we ought to change the present Constitution. 
     <lb/>
     As the population of Upper  Canada is no 
     <lb/>
     longer sensibly increased by immigration, and 
     <lb/>
     as the natural increase of the population of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada is more rapid than that of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada ; as the emigration of our 
     <lb/>
     countrymen to the United States is ceasing, 
     <lb/>
     and as the best lands in Upper Canada are 
     <lb/>
     occupied, whilst the territory of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada is only just beginning to be opened up 
     <lb/>
     for settlement, I see no reason why we should 
     <lb/>
     make such haste to give up the struggle we 
     <lb/>
     have so successfully  maintained up to the 
     <lb/>
     present time, and, without any just reason, 
     <lb/>
     grant representation by population. This is 
     <lb/>
     what is said in the same report by the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Hon. Provincial Secretary, and his words 
     <lb/>
     agree exactly with my statements :—

            </p>
   
           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> <p>
         In Lower Canada the sales in 1862 reached a 
     <lb/>
     little more than double the quantity sold in Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada. The discovery of copper and other 
     <lb/>
     minerals in the Eastern Townships and the open<lb break="no"/>ing of better means of communication have 
     <lb/>
     caused a considerable influx of population into

     increase in the demand for unsold public lands. 
     <lb/>
     The new surveys on the southern slope of the

            <p>
     And what is the consequence of this fact point<lb break="no"/>ed out by the Hon. Commissioner of Crown  
     <lb/>
     Lands ? It is that if the public lands are sold 
     <lb/>
     only to settlers, so soon as it is established that 
     <lb/>
     the quantity of lands sold in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     is double that sold in Upper Canada, I am 
     <lb/>
     justified in concluding that the extent cleared 
     <lb/>
     is also double, and as a necessary consequence, 
     <lb/>
     that the population must be increasing in the 
     <lb/>
     same preportion. Thence I conclude that the 
     <lb/>
    question of representation based upon popula<lb break="no"/>tion tends every day to its own solution. 
     <lb/>Thus we have a man, who certainly cannot be 
     <lb/>accused of partiality to Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>whose extensive knowledge no one will deny, 
     <lb/>declaring officially that we are increasing in a 
     <lb/>much greater proportion than Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>And it is at the very moment that we are on 
     <lb/>the point of turning the scale of victory, that 
     <lb/>we are about to give way and cease from fur<lb break="no"/>ther effort. Our rising generations were emi<lb break="no"/>
      
    
            <cb/>
         
     grating to the United States a few years ago, 
     <lb/>
    because we had no colonization roads to give  
     <lb/>them access to the forests of Lower Canada, as 
     <lb/>we have now ; and why had we them not ? 
     <lb/>Because until quite recently, the Hon. Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Department of the Crown Lands, as 
     <lb/>well as the Hon. Minister of the Department 
     <lb/>of Agriculture and Emigration, were always 
     <lb/>Upper Canadians. Upper Canada always un<lb break="no"/>derstood the importance of those departments 
     <lb/>as regards the material development of that 
     <lb/>section of the province. Accordingly, all the 
     <lb/>measures of improvement  were in favor of the 
     <lb/>western section, and all the immigration was 
     <lb/>carefully directed thither. Now that we 
     <lb/>have found out the results of that cleverly de<lb break="no"/>vised policy, the Lower Canadian party are 
     <lb/>more attentive to the colonization of our wild 
     <lb/>lands, and we find the clergy and all our politi<lb break="no"/>cal and influential men seconding their efforts.  
     <lb/>We have colonization societies in every quarter, 
     <lb/>and the result of their labors is the settlement 
     <lb/>and occupation of our public lands as soon as 
     <lb/>they are surveyed. Frequently we even see the 
     <lb/>settlers getting ahead of the parties employed in 
     <lb/>opening the roads through the forests. These 
     <lb/>facts are important enough to deserve our 
     <lb/>serious consideration, more especially as the 
     <lb/>report of the Hon. Provincial Secretary con<lb break="no"/>firms my statements in every particular. The 
     <lb/>Canadian families now in the United States 
     <lb/>are glad to return among us to aid in develop<lb break="no"/>ing the resources of our country, and if the 
     <lb/>Government, instead of making  changes in 
     <lb/>the Constitution, were to establish a vast 
     <lb/>system of colonization, to draw hither our 
     <lb/>fellow-countrymen from the United States, and 
     <lb/>an immigration from Europe of those who 
     <lb/>own a common origin with ourselves, we 
     <lb/>should have no need to trouble ourselves 
     <lb/>about the political changes now proposed to 
     <lb/>us, of which the object is evidently to destroy 
     <lb/>our influence in America. (Hear, hear. ) 
     <lb/>The intention of the Confederation scheme, 
     <lb/>we are told by the Ministry, is the formation 
     <lb/>of a vast Empire, bounded by the Pacific Ocean 
     <lb/>on one side, on the other by the Atlantic 
     <lb/>Ocean, and on the south by the American 
     <lb/>Union, while on the north it would extend to 
     <lb/>the Pole, leaving Russian America on the 
     <lb/>west. No doubt the scheme is a grand one, 
     <lb/>magnificent in conception, and likely to take 
     <lb/>with the ambitious minds of the most aspiring 
     <lb/>men in British North America. The oppo<lb break="no"/>sition perfectly understands the noble object 
     <lb/>of the promoters of the Confederation, which 
     <lb/>it is proposed to establish on a monarchical 
     <lb/>basis, in opposition to the American Union, 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="597" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0597.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">597</fw>
         
     based on the democratic and republican prin<lb break="no"/>ciple; but the Opposition is also aware that 
     <lb/>
     this creation of an Empire presents difficulties 
     <lb/>
     of an important character, not only because it 
     <lb/>
     is starting into existence in opposition to the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring powerful republic, which is essenti<lb break="no"/>ally opossed to monarchical institutions, but also 
     <lb/>
     because the differences of nationality, religion 
     <lb/>
     and sectional interests are so many stumbling 
     <lb/>
     blocks with which the principal provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation will come in contact. 
     <lb/>
     It must not be believed that the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     only oppose the scheme because they do not 
     <lb/>
     understand its import. On the contrary 
     <lb/>
     they do understand it, and see in it nothing 
     <lb/>
     but provisions of a nature hostile to them. 
     <lb/>
     At the present day, with sectional equality, 
     <lb/>
     Canada constitutes but a single people, who 
     <lb/>
     have tendencies and aspirations in common; 
     <lb/>
     but under Confederation such will no longer 
     <lb/>
     be the case; we shall have a minority op<lb break="no"/>posed to a majority, the aggressive tendencies 
     <lb/>
     of which have always manifested themselves 
     <lb/>
     whenever the power of numbers was in their 
     <lb/>
     favor. If the populations of all the provin<lb break="no"/>ces were homogeneous; if their interests, their 
     <lb/>
     ideas, their belief and their nationality were 
     <lb/>
     identical, we might perhaps be more disposed 
     <lb/>
     to accept the by no means judicious provisions 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme which is submitted to us. But 
     <lb/>
     as none of these are identical, we consider 
     <lb/>
     that we should be in danger if we did accept 
     <lb/>
     them. Formerly France possessed all this 
     <lb/>
     part of the continent; the settlers of that 
     <lb/>
     period, the farmers, fishermen, hunters and 
     <lb/>
     trappers travelled over the whole extent 
     <lb/>
     of those immense possessions which were 
     <lb/>
     known by the name of New France. At 
     <lb/>
     this moment what remains to her of a 
     <lb/>
     territory that was equal in extent to Europe 
     <lb/>
     itself? A wretched little island at the en<lb break="no"/>trance of the Gulf, a foothold for her fisheries, 
     <lb/>
     and a few acres of beach on the coast of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. When we consider that fact, 
     <lb/>
     when we see French power completely des<lb break="no"/>troyed on this continent, are we not justified 
     <lb/>
     in looking closely into the project of Consti<lb break="no"/>tution now submitted to us, which has for its 
     <lb/>
     object, I repeat, simply to complete the des<lb break="no"/>truction of the influence of the French race 
     <lb/>
     on this continent ? Has not the past taught 
     <lb/>
     us to dread the future? Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     the policy of England has ever been aggressive, 
     <lb/>
     and its object has always been to annihilate 
     <lb/>
     us as a people. And this scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation is but the continued application of that 
     <lb/>
     policy on this continent; its real object is 
     <lb/>
     nothing but the annihilation of French influ<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     ence in Canada. If we examine history in 
     <lb/>
     order to ascertain whether a precedent is to 
     <lb/>
     be found for the course of action adopted 
     <lb/>
     to-day, we shall derive a valuable lesson from 
     <lb/>
     the experience of the past. There was a 
     <lb/>
     period, after the conquest of England by the 
     <lb/>
     Normans, when the French language was the 
     <lb/>
     general and official language of that country, 
     <lb/>
     but subsequently the conquerors were com<lb break="no"/>pelled to adopt the language of the vanquished. 
     <lb/>
     The history of the Parliament of England 
     <lb/>
     shows that up to 1425, every bill introduced 
     <lb/>
     in the Legislature, without a single exception, 
     <lb/>
     was in the French language. But at that 
     <lb/>
     date the first English bill was presented to Par<lb break="no"/>liament; and twenty-five years later, in 1450, 
     <lb/>
     the last French bill was presented in the 
     <lb/>
     English Parliament. After that date we no 
     <lb/>
     longer find a trace of the French language in 
     <lb/>
     Parliament; twenty-five years had sufficed to 
     <lb/>
     do away with it completely.. There is an<lb break="no"/>other historical fact connected with thc politi<lb break="no"/>cal existence of a people, which it is right to 
     <lb/>
     recall. We know how long Scotland and 
     <lb/>
     Ireland resisted the encroachments of England 
     <lb/>
     The struggle was protracted and obstinate- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     But these two nations were compelled to suc<lb break="no"/>cumb to political encroachment, under the 
     <lb/>
     pressure of the powerful assimilating tenden<lb break="no"/>cies of the English nation. But let us see what 
     <lb/>
     means England used to attain her ends. Im<lb break="no"/>partial history tells us, as it will tell of the 
     <lb/>
     means employed to-day to annihilate our race 
     <lb/>
     on this continent. History records, in letters 
     <lb/>
     of gold, the names of those who have bravely 
     <lb/>
     struggled for the lives and liberties of nations, 
     <lb/>
     but it also holds up to execration the memory 
     <lb/>
     of those who barter those liberties and those 
     <lb/>
     rights for titles, honor, power, or gold. We 
     <lb/>
     now enjoy responsible government, dearly 
     <lb/>
     earned by a century of heroic struggles, and 
     <lb/>
     before yielding an inch of the ground we 
     <lb/>
     have conquered, we should see what we are 
     <lb/>
     likely to gain by the proposed constitutional 
     <lb/>
     changes. Let us profit by the experience of 
     <lb/>
     the countries we now see lamenting the loss of 
     <lb/>
     their political rights resulting from constitu<lb break="no"/>tional changes similar to those now proposed 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada. I find the following with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the union of Scotland with Eng<lb break="no"/>land in 1706 :—

     the two races produced many obstacles to the 
     <lb/>
     English project, and, in order to remove these 
     <lb/>
     obstacles, England had recourse to means 
     <lb/>
     precisely similar to those adopted here we

     <lb/>
     appointment of a conference of commission<lb break="no"/>ers charged with the preparation of the Act

     of Union.  Says M. EMILE DE BONNECIIOSE: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     These commissioners agreed on the general

     <lb/>
     manner in which the English proposed to consti<lb break="no"/>tute the new Parliament of the United Kingdom,

     particularly at the outset, from a treaty of union

     Thus we have nearly the whole people

     uniting to oppose the union it was sought to

     impose upon them, and yet in face of the all 
     <lb/>
     but unanimous opposition of the people of

     There, Mr. SPEAKER, is an instance of the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which the policy of England can 
     <lb/>
     overcome even the most justifiable resistance, 
     <lb/>
     supported by the unanimous wishes of a 
     <lb/>
     people. Scotland lookcd upon a union with 
     <lb/>
     England as an act of suicide, and yet the 
     <lb/>
     union was carried by a majority in the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament of Edinburgh. I need not dwell 
     <lb/>
     at length upon these facts ; they speak 
     <lb/>
     eloquently for themselves. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     There is another fact in the parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     history of England, of which it is well to 
     <lb/>
     remind the House—I mean the abolition of 
     <lb/>
     the Irish Parliament. The Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Agriculture (Hon. Mr. MCGEE) 
     <lb/>
     has told us, in that flowery language which 
     <lb/>
     characterises the children of his native soil, 
     <lb/>
     that he himself, when scarce twenty years 
     <lb/>
     of age, struggled to emancipate his country 
     <lb/>
     from the tyranny of England, and not suc<lb break="no"/>ceeding in his noble undertaking, preferred 
     <lb/>
     to exile himself to American soil rather than 
     <lb/>
     remain to be a daily spectator of the misfor<lb break="no"/>tunes and sufferings of his native land. And 
     <lb/>
    yet, what is he now doing? He is trying, with 
     <lb/>the help of a hostile majority, to thrust upon 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, his adopted country, a union 
     <lb/>which is repugnant to her, and to revive here 
     <lb/>the system of oppression over which he wept 
     <lb/>in Ireland. (Hear, hear.) Let us see what 
     <lb/>the means were which were employed to 
     <lb/>impose upon Ireland that union which was 
     <lb/>destined to entail the wholesale exodus of 
     <lb/>her population :—

     In the case of Ireland; the contest was a longer 
     <lb/>
     one, but England was ultimately triumphant. 
     <lb/>
     After the crisis of 1798, (says M. GUSTAVE 
     <lb/>
     DE BEAUMONT,) England, holding down rebellions 
     <lb/>
     and vanquished Ireland, chastise her unrelenting<lb break="no"/>ly and pitilessly. Twenty years previously Ire<lb break="no"/>land again came into possession of her political 
     <lb/>
     liberties; England preserved a bitter recollec<lb break="no"/>tion of this success of Ireland, and took advantage 
     <lb/>
     of the depression ofthe latter to replace her un<lb break="no"/>der an absolute yoke. The Irish Parliament. after 
     <lb/>recovering its independence, became troublesome

     to England; it was necessary, in order to master 
     <lb/>
     it, to take great pains in corruption, in spite of 
     <lb/>
     which great resistance on the part of the Irish 
     <lb/>
     Parliament was met with; the opportunity was 
     <lb/>
     favorable to suppress it, and in consequence the 
     <lb/>
     English Government abolished it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the reception of this news, poor Ireland 
     <lb/>
     was in an instant in agitation, just as a body 
     <lb/>
     which has just been deprived of life stirs again 
     <lb/>
     under the steel which mutilates and rends it. Of 
     <lb/>
     thirty-two counties, twenty-one loudly exclaimed 
     <lb/>
     aginst the destruction of the Irish Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     That Parliament, from whom an act of suicide 
     <lb/>
     had necessarily to be asked, refused to consum<lb break="no"/>mate it, and by its vote maintained its constitu<lb break="no"/>tional existence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Indignant at the servility which it was dared to 
     <lb/>
     ask for from the body of which he formed part, 
     <lb/>
     GRATTAN vehemently opposed the Ministerial 
     <lb/>
     scheme. But all this resistance was in vain. The 
     <lb/>
     only resistance which definitively opposed a 
     <lb/>
     serious obstacle to the views of England, was 
     <lb/>
     that of the Irish Parliament, which would not 
     <lb/>
     vote its own abolition. Hitherto its acts had 
     <lb/>
     been bought, and now its death was in like man<lb break="no"/>ner purchased. Corruption was at once made 
     <lb/>
     use of on an enormous scale; places, pensions 
     <lb/>
     and favors of all kinds were lavished in every 
     <lb/>
     direction, and the same men who, in 1799, rejected 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of union, adopted it on the 26th May, 
     <lb/>
     1800, by a majority of a hundred and eighteen 
     <lb/>
     votes against seventy-three, and that majority 
     <lb/>
     consisted of either state pensioners or public 
     <lb/>
     functionaries. And so, through violence, aided 
     <lb/>
     by corruption, was accomplished the destructive 
     <lb/>
     act of the Irish Parliament, not without stirring 
     <lb/>
     up in Ireland all that remained of national pas<lb break="no"/>sion and feelings of patriotism.

     should, at least, have an opportunity of

     carefully studying all the details of the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     enemy which may come forward to attack 
     <lb/>
     our territory. But I am bound to declare 
     <lb/>
     that if that Constitution is changed despite 
     <lb/>
     the will of the peeple, we shall no longer 
     <lb/>
     find among the Lower Canadians that impulse 
     <lb/>
     for which they have always been distin<lb break="no"/>guished in days gone by, and which enabled 
     <lb/>
     them to vanquish a hostile force of double 
     <lb/>
     their number. (Hear, hear.) There would 
     <lb/>
     appear to have been no reason why the 
     <lb/>
     antagonism between the English and French 
     <lb/>
     races, to which I alluded as existing in 
     <lb/>
     Europe, should have been carried into 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     America; and yet the strife was continued 
     <lb/>
     in the New World, after it had arisen in the 
     <lb/>
     old hemisphere. At the present day that 
     <lb/>
     strife continues, and despite the protestations 
     <lb/>
     of sincere friendship interchanged between 
     <lb/>
     Paris and London, we see France and 
     <lb/>
     England continually facing each other, 
     <lb/>
     sword in hand, feeling for each other that 
     <lb/>
     respect which mutual fear alone can inspire. 
     <lb/>
     And could it be expected that those feelings 
     <lb/>
     of rivalry and antagonism which have always 
     <lb/>
     existed, and which still exist at the present 
     <lb/>
     day, between the two races, would be effaced 
     <lb/>
     from among their Canadian descendants, that 
     <lb/>
     we may be fused into one nation? It is an 
     <lb/>
     impossibility! Do what you may, the same 
     <lb/>
     feelings will always exist. They are blame<lb break="no"/>able, perhaps, but the fact remains—they 
     <lb/>
     exist, and form part of the very nature of 
     <lb/>
     the two races. The language, the religion, 
     <lb/>
     the institutions and the customs of a people 
     <lb/>
     are so many obstacles to its union with 
     <lb/>
     another people, whose language, religion, 
     <lb/>
     institutions and customs are different from 
     <lb/>
     theirs. And is it supposed that these feel<lb break="no"/>ings of rivalry and these causes of estrange<lb break="no"/>ment will be removed on the adoption of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation which is proposed 
     <lb/>
     to us? For my part, I would wish in 
     <lb/>
     Canada to see the two nationalities rival 
     <lb/>
     each other in progress in the useful 
     <lb/>
     works of peace. This rivalry, not of strife 
     <lb/>
     hand to hand, but a rivalry in the laudable 
     <lb/>
     ambition which has for its object the realiz<lb break="no"/>ing of the greatest prosperity known, the 
     <lb/>
     attaining of the highest excellence in the 
     <lb/>
     sciences, and of the most profound secrets 
     <lb/>
     of art, would confer upon our country a 
     <lb/>
     degree of power equal to what has resulted 
     <lb/>
     from the combined strength of England and 
     <lb/>
     France, which has, up to the present, been 
     <lb/>
     employed to impel the world towards the 
     <lb/>
     prodigies which have been realized in the 
     <lb/>
     nineteenth century. With equality of 
     <lb/>
     numbers, and of sectional representation, 
     <lb/>
     the two nationalities cannot fall foul of each 
     <lb/>
     other; but with Confederation, as we shall 
     <lb/>
     be in a great minority in the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, which has all the important powers 
     <lb/>
     in relation to legislation, we shall have to 
     <lb/>
     carry on a constant contest for the defence 
     <lb/>
     and preservation of our political rights and 
     <lb/>
     of our liberty. Under the union the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians are divided in this House into  
     <lb/>
     two camps, opposed the one to the other, 
     <lb/>
     because they have nothing to fear in regard 
     <lb/>
     to their national interests; but under Con<lb break="no"/>federation, as we shall have but forty-eight

     forty-six in the Federal Legislature, those 
     <lb/>
     members will have to go together like one 
     <lb/>
     man to maintain their influence, and the 
     <lb/>
     simple fact of that union of the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians into a solid phalanx will cause 
     <lb/>
     the English element to unite on its side to 
     <lb/>
     crush and vanquish it. It is because I fear 
     <lb/>
     such a strife that I cannot approve of a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution which does not secure our 
     <lb/>
     political rights, and the working of which 
     <lb/>
     will necessarily entail disastrous consequences 
     <lb/>
     to our race. (Hear, hear.) The strife 
     <lb/>
     of nationalities which has been too long 
     <lb/>
     maintained in Europe appeared to have no 
     <lb/>
     cause of existence in America. It appeared 
     <lb/>
     that there was on this continent room enough 
     <lb/>
     and prospects enough to allow everybody, 
     <lb/>
     of all principles and of all nationalities, to 
     <lb/>
     live in peace upon it, without jostling and 
     <lb/>
     falling foul of each other. It appeared that 
     <lb/>
     those who had emigrated from the old world 
     <lb/>
     should have at heart the formation of power<lb break="no"/>ful nations on this continent, without intro<lb break="no"/>ducing the religious and national hatred 
     <lb/>
     which had for so long a time divided Europe, 
     <lb/>
     and deluged her in blood. And yet what 
     <lb/>
     do we see here? We have seen France, 
     <lb/>
     who first of all despatched the apostles of 
     <lb/>
     Christianity into the vast solitudes of North 
     <lb/>
     America—France, who first planted her 
     <lb/>
     noble flag on the Island of Montreal and the 
     <lb/>
     heights of Quebec—we have seen France 
     <lb/>
     deprived of the last inch of the soil which she 
     <lb/>
     had conquered on this continent, bequeath<lb break="no"/>ing to her children, abandoned in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but a future of struggles and contests against 
     <lb/>
     the encroaching spirit of her powerful rival. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) From the commencement of 
     <lb/>
     the French domination in America, we have 
     <lb/>
     seen reproduced here the strifes which 
     <lb/>
     divided the European continent. Towns 
     <lb/>
     and villages were destroyed as though there 
     <lb/>
     was not room enough in this new world for 
     <lb/>
     the few handsfuls of men who came to in<lb break="no"/>habit it. The first scene of this inexcusable 
     <lb/>
    description occurred in Acadia, in 1613. 
     <lb/>GARNEAU makes the following remarks on 
     <lb/>this subject:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     In 1612 LA SAUSSAYE began, on the left bank 
     <lb/>
     of the Penobscot river, a settlement which he 
     <lb/>
     called St. Sauveur. All went well at first, and 
     <lb/>
     flattering hopes were entertained at once of suc<lb break="no"/>cess beyond all expectation, when an unlooked for 
     <lb/>
     storm burst over the colony and stifled it in its 
     <lb/>
     cradle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     England claimed the country as far as the 45th 
     <lb/>
     degree of north latitude—that is to say, all the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     continent to the northward as far as the heart of 
     <lb/>
     Acadia. France, on the other hand, maintained 
     <lb/>
     that her boundary ran southward as far as the 
     <lb/>
     40th degree. From this dispute it resulted that, 
     <lb/>
     while LA SAUSSAYE thought himself within the 
     <lb/>
     boundary of New France at St. Sauveur, the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish declared that he was deep in their territory. 
     <lb/>
     To maintain the claim, Captain ARGALL of Virgi<lb break="no"/>nia resolved to go and dislodge him, incited by the 
     <lb/>
     hope of obtaining a rich booty, and by his preju<lb break="no"/>dices against Catholics, who had been the cause of 
     <lb/>
     the ruin of POUTRINCOURT.

     Thus in 1612, in other words only two or 
     <lb/>
     three years after the founding of Quebec, we 
     <lb/>
     already find religious and national strife 
     <lb/>
     beginning their work of exclusiveness on our 
     <lb/>
     continent, and that strife we shall again have 
     <lb/>
     to engage in, disagreeable as it may be. I

     He appeared suddenly before St. Sauveur with 
     <lb/>
     a vessel mounting 14 guns, and spread dismay 
     <lb/>
     among the defenceless inhabitants, who took him 
     <lb/>
     at first for a pirate. Father GILBERT DU THET 
     <lb/>
     vainly endeavored to offer a slight resistance; he 
     <lb/>
     was killed, and the settlement given up to pillage. 
     <lb/>
     Everything was carried off or sacked, ARGALL 
     <lb/>
     himself setting the example. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To legalize this act of piracy (for such it was), 
     <lb/>
     he stole LA SAUSSAYE'S commission, and pretended 
     <lb/>
     to look upon him and his people as unaccredited 
     <lb/>
     adventurers. Gradually, however, he seemed to 
     <lb/>
     soften, and proposed to those who had trades to 
     <lb/>
     follow him to Jamestown, from whence, after 
     <lb/>
     having worked for one year, they should be sent 
     <lb/>
     back to their native land. The offer was accepted 
     <lb/>
     by a dozen of them. The remainder, with LA 
     <lb/>
     SAUSSAYE and Father MASSE, preferred to risk 
     <lb/>
     themselves in a frail vessel with the object of 
     <lb/>
     reaching La Hève, where they found a vessel of 
     <lb/>
     St. Malo, which conveyed them to France. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Those who trusted to ARGALL'S word were 
     <lb/>
     greatly surprised, on their arrival at Jamestown, 
     <lb/>
     to find that they were thrown into prison and 
     <lb/>
     treated as pirates. In vain they claimed the ful<lb break="no"/>filment of the treaty which they had made with 
     <lb/>
     him; they were condemned to death. ARGALL, 
     <lb/>
     who had not supposed that the abstraction of LA 
     <lb/>
     SAUSSAYE'S commission would have such serious 
     <lb/>
     results, did not think that he ought to carry dis<lb break="no"/>simulation any further, and gave up the commission 
     <lb/>
     to the Governor, Sir THOMAS DALE, and confessed 
     <lb/>
     all. That document, and information which was 
     <lb/>
     obtained in the course of the enquiry into the 
     <lb/>
     matter, caused the government of Virginia to 
     <lb/>
     resolve to drive the French from all the places 
     <lb/>
     occupied by them to the south of the line 45. A 
     <lb/>
     squadron of three vessels was placed under the 
     <lb/>
     command of the same man, ARGALL, in order to 
     <lb/>
     put that resolution in execution.

     The fleet began by destroying all that remained 
     <lb/>
     of the old habitation of Ste. Croix—a useless ven<lb break="no"/>geance, as it had been abandoned for several

     Well, Mr. SPEAKER, this scene of <choice><sic>devasta-</sic><corr>devastation</corr></choice> 
     <lb/>
     and vandalism on our continent, which at 
     <lb/>
     that period contained hardly a thousand 
     <lb/>
     white inhabitants, gives the clue to all the 
     <lb/>
     events which followed from that date up to 
     <lb/>
     the conquest of Canada by the English. 
     <lb/>
     This fact is a corroboration of the principle 
     <lb/>
     that provides that the stronger nation shall 
     <lb/>
     oppress the weaker. unless by special circum<lb break="no"/>stances the one is protected against the other. 
     <lb/>
     This is the proof that the sectional equality 
     <lb/>
     secured by the system of government which 
     <lb/>
     we now possess has alone been effective in 
     <lb/>
     Canada to enable different nationalities to 
     <lb/>
     live together on terms of equality, and to 
     <lb/>
     labor successfully for the advancement of 
     <lb/>
     the common prosperity. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     the strife which began in 1613, between 
     <lb/>
     France and England, became more deadly 
     <lb/>
     after a century and a half of occupation ; it 
     <lb/>
     spread along the whole frontier of New 
     <lb/>
     France. At the instigation of the rival race, 
     <lb/>
     Indian tribes fell upon all the French settle<lb break="no"/>ments in the country, and an incessant and 
     <lb/>
     vindictive war was kept up with the sole 
     <lb/>
     object of driving the French off the conti<lb break="no"/>nent. We know at the present day what 
     <lb/>
     the result of that contest was. We are told 
     <lb/>
     that we have no reason to complain of the 
     <lb/>
     system of government which we now have. 
     <lb/>
     That is true. But if we have that government 
     <lb/>
     it is because, ever since the conquest, the 
     <lb/>
     remnant of the French nation which re<lb break="no"/>mained in the land have striven bravely to 
     <lb/>
     obtain it. Had it not been for the American 
     <lb/>
     revolution, we too would have had our large 
     <lb/>
     share of suffering and humiliation, similar 
     <lb/>
     to that which the Acadians were made to 
     <lb/>
     undergo. The treatment to which they were 
     <lb/>
     subjected by England is an example of what 
     <lb/>
     might have happened to us, but for our 
     <lb/>
     number, and, subsequently, but for the vici<lb break="no"/>nity to us of the American Republic. There 
     <lb/>
     was in Acadia a nucleus of French people, 
     <lb/>
     who lived peaceably and happily, and who 
     <lb/>
     had submitted to English domination with<lb break="no"/>out a murmur ; and yet, because they were 
     <lb/>
     weak and had no longer the arm of France 
     <lb/>
     to protect them, they were transported, like 
     <lb/>
     negroes on the coast of Africa, by philan<lb break="no"/>thropic England. This is an important 
     <lb/>
     historical fact which must not be forgotten, 
     <lb/>
     and the details of which it is well to set before 
     <lb/>
     the eyes of our population, at a time when the 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
           
     English element is pursuing, with a persistence 
     <lb/>
     worthy of a better cause, the aggressive and 
     <lb/>
     encroaching policy concealed under the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation which is submitted 
     <lb/>
     to us. The hon. member for South Lanark 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. MORRIS) told us the other day that we 
     <lb/>
     ought to thank England, and be most grate<lb break="no"/>ful to her for the system of government 
     <lb/>
     which we received from her. But to whom 
     <lb/>
     do we owe that system? Do we owe it to 
     <lb/>
     the liberality of England? Did we not 
     <lb/>
     obtain our political rights only at the time 
     <lb/>
     when she could no longer refuse them to us 
     <lb/>
     with safety ? No, Mr. SPEAKER, our grati<lb break="no"/>tude and our thanks are only due to those 
     <lb/>
     fellow-countrymen of ours who at all times 
     <lb/>
     bravely strove to obtain them. When we 
     <lb/>
     see French colonies which still groan under 
     <lb/>
     the English colonial system, and which 
     <lb/>
     complain to Europe of the treatment to 
     <lb/>
     which they are subjected, the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     must be come to that we owe nothing to 
     <lb/>
     England, but that on the contrary we owe 
     <lb/>
     all to those who, after an age of strife, 
     <lb/>
     obtained for us that governmental reform 
     <lb/>
     which we enjoy. In order that our people 
     <lb/>
     may form a correct opinion of that liberality 
     <lb/>
     which is so highly vaunted to us, allow me 
     <lb/>
     here, Mr. SPEAKER, to quote a few pages of 
     <lb/>
     the history of the Acadian people :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The war of 1774 began their misfortunes; that 
     <lb/>
     of the seven years completed its total ruin. For 
     <lb/>
     some time the English agents acted with the 
     <lb/>
     greatest severity; the courts, by the most flagrant 
     <lb/>
     violation of the law, by systematic denial of 
     <lb/>
     justice, had become to the poor inhabitants an 
     <lb/>
     object at once of terror and of hatred. The most 
     <lb/>
     subordinate official insisted on obedience to his 
     <lb/>
     will. "If you do not suppy wood to my troops," 
     <lb/>
     said a certain Captain MURRAY, "I will tear 
     <lb/>
     down your houses and use them for fuel." "If 
     <lb/>
     you will not take the oath of fidelity," added 
     <lb/>
     Governor HOPSON, "I will turn my cannon 
     <lb/>
     against your villages." Nothing could induce 
     <lb/>
     these honorable men to do an act against which 
     <lb/>
     their consciences exclaimed, and which, in 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of many people, England had no 
     <lb/>
     right to demand from them. "The Acadians," 
     <lb/>
     observes Mr. HALIBURTON, "were not British 
     <lb/>
     subjects, as they had not taken the oath 
     <lb/>
     of allegiance, and they could not, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     be considered rebels; nor were they to be 
     <lb/>
     looked upon as prisoners of war, nor to be 
     <lb/>
     sent to France, as for nearly half a century they 
     <lb/>
     had been allowed to retain their possessions, on 
     <lb/>
     the simple condition of remaining neutral." But 
     <lb/>
     many schemers and adventurers looked at their 
     <lb/>
     fine farms with an envious eye. What fine inherit<lb break="no"/>ances, and, consequently, what a bait! It was 
     <lb/>
    not difficult for them to find political reasons to 
     <lb/>justify the expulsion of the Acadians. By far the 
     <lb/>
            <pb n="602" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0602.jpg"/>

     greater number had committed no act whatever 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent with neutrality; but, in the great 
     <lb/>
     catastrophe which was impending, the innocent 
     <lb/>
     were to be placed in the same category with the 
     <lb/>
     guilty. Not one inhabitant had been deserving of 
     <lb/>
     mercy. Their fate was decided in Governor 
     <lb/>
     LAWRENCE'S Council, at which were present Ad<lb break="no"/>mirals BOSCAWEN and MOSTYN, whose fleets were 
     <lb/>
     cruising on the coast. It was resolved to dis<lb break="no"/>perse through the English colonies the remnant 
     <lb/>
     of this unfortunate people; and in order that 
     <lb/>
     none might escape, the most profound secrecy 
     <lb/>
     was enjoined up to the moment fixed for the re<lb break="no"/>moval, which was to take place on the same day 
     <lb/>
     and at the same hour in all parts of Acadia at 
     <lb/>
     once. It was decided also, in order to make the 
     <lb/>
     success more complete, to bring together the in<lb break="no"/>habitants of the principal places. Proclamations, 
     <lb/>
     prepared with perfidious skill, invited them to 
     <lb/>
     meet in certain places under the most severe 
     <lb/>
     penalties. Four hundred and eighteen heads of 
     <lb/>
     families, relying on the British faith, so assembled 
     <lb/>
     on the 5th of September in the Church of Grand- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Pré. Colonel WINSLOW went thither with a large 
     <lb/>
     attendance. There he showed them the commis<lb break="no"/>sion which he held from the Governor, and in<lb break="no"/>formed them that they had been called together 
     <lb/>
     to hear the final decision of the King with respect 
     <lb/>
     to them. He declared to them that, although the 
     <lb/>
     duty which he had to perform was a most painful 
     <lb/>
     one to him, he was compelled, in obedience to 
     <lb/>
     his orders, to inform them "that their lands and 
     <lb/>
     their cattle, of all kinds, were confiscated to the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, together with all their other property, ex<lb break="no"/>cept their money and their clothing, and that they 
     <lb/>
     themselves were to be deported from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince." No motive was assigned for this decision, 
     <lb/>
     and none could be assigned. In full civilization 
     <lb/>
     and in a time of political and religious quiet, such 
     <lb/>
     an act of spoliation was inexcusable, and, like 
     <lb/>
     the usurer, had to conceal its criminality by 
     <lb/>
     silence. A body of troops which had been kept 
     <lb/>
     concealed up to that point, emerged from their 
     <lb/>
     ambush and surrounded the church. The in<lb break="no"/>habitants, taken by surprise and unarmed, offered 
     <lb/>
     no resistance. The soldiers collected the women 
     <lb/>
     and children; 1,023 men, women and children 
     <lb/>
     were collected at Grand-Pré alone. Their cattle 
     <lb/>
     consisted of 1,269 oxen, 1,557 cows, 5,007 calves, 
     <lb/>
     493 horses, 3,690 sheep, and 4,197 swine. A few 
     <lb/>
     Acadians having escaped into the woods, the 
     <lb/>
     country was devastated to prevent their obtaining 
     <lb/>
     subsistence. At Les Mines, 276 barns, 155 other 
     <lb/>
     small buildings, 12 mills and one church were 
     <lb/>
     burned. Those who had rendered the greatest 
     <lb/>
     services to the Government, such as the old no<lb break="no"/>tary LE BLANC, who died at Philadelphia of grief 
     <lb/>
     and misery, while seeking his sons scattered 
     <lb/>
     through the English provinces, were no better 
     <lb/>
     treated than those who had favored the French. 
     <lb/>
     No distinction was made. The men included in 
     <lb/>
     both classes were allowed, and it was the only 
     <lb/>
     consolation allowed them, before their embarka<lb break="no"/>tion to visit, in parties of ten, their families, and 
     <lb/>
     to gaze for the last time on that country which 
     <lb/>
     was once so calm and happy, in which they were 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     born, and which they were never to see again. The 
     <lb/>
     10th was the day fixed for their embarkation. A 
     <lb/>
     calm resignation had succeeded to their first des<lb break="no"/>pair. But when the time came for them to bid a last 
     <lb/>
     adieu to their country, to go and live dispersed in 
     <lb/>
     the midst of a people foreign in language, in cus<lb break="no"/>toms, in manners and in religion, the courage of 
     <lb/>
     these unfortunate people gave way, and they gave 
     <lb/>
     themselves up to the most profound grief. ln 
     <lb/>
     violation of the promise which had been made 
     <lb/>
     them, and by an unexampled refinement of bar<lb break="no"/>barity, families were separated and dispersed 
     <lb/>
     throughout different vessels. In order to put 
     <lb/>
     them on board, the prisoners were arranged in 
     <lb/>
     sixes, with the young people in front. These 
     <lb/>
     having refused to march, and having claimed the 
     <lb/>
     fulfilment of the promise made them, that they 
     <lb/>
     should be put on board with their relatives, they 
     <lb/>
     were replied to by the advance of soldiers with 
     <lb/>
     their bayonets crossed. The road from the Grand- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Pré chapel to the river Gaspereaux was a mile in 
     <lb/>
     length; it was lined on both sides by women and 
     <lb/>
     children, who, on their knees and bathed in tears, 
     <lb/>
     encouraged them by calling down blessings on 
     <lb/>
     their heads. The sad procession moved slowly 
     <lb/>
     along, praying, and singing hymns. The heads 
     <lb/>
     of families walked after the youth; at last 
     <lb/>
     the procession reached the shore, the men were 
     <lb/>
     put into some vessels and the women and children 
     <lb/>
     into others, pell-mell, without any regard what<lb break="no"/>ever for their comfort. Governments have com<lb break="no"/>mitted acts of cruelty under the impulse of 
     <lb/>
     unreflecting anger. but they had been provoked 
     <lb/>
     and irritated by aggression and repeated attacks. 
     <lb/>
     There is no example in modern days of chastise<lb break="no"/>ment inflicted on a peacable and inoffensive people 
     <lb/>
     with so much premeditation, barbarity and cool<lb break="no"/>ness as that to which allusion is now being made. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>On the same day and at the same hour, all the 
     <lb/>other Acadian settlements presented the same 
     <lb/>spectacle of desolation. The vessels, laden with 
     <lb/>the numerous victims, sailed for the different 
     <lb/>provinces where they were to be dispersed. They 
     <lb/>were thrust ashore on the coast between Boston 
     <lb/>and Carolina, without bread and without protec<lb break="no"/>tion, and were left to the charity of the inhabitants 
     <lb/>of the country in which they might happen to be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>For many days after their departure, their 
     <lb/>cattle might be seen collecting around the ruins 
     <lb/>of their dwellings, and their dogs passed the nights 
     <lb/>in pitiful howlings at the absence of their masters. 
     <lb/>Happy even in their grief, they did not know to 
     <lb/>what extremes avarice and ambition can impel 
     <lb/>mankind.

            <p>
     Well, Mr. SPEAKER, these are facts which 
     <lb/>
     it is important to remember. Here is a 
     <lb/>
     French colony, situated a few hundred 
     <lb/>
     leagues from Canada, deported in a body, 
     <lb/>
     and the remnant of which long after return<lb break="no"/>ed to the same territory. Still more, it is 
     <lb/>
     with the descendents of a small part of these 
     <lb/>
     exiles that it is now proposed to unite us. 
     <lb/>
     But a few months ago, I went among those 
     <lb/>
     people, and when I saw the magnificent 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="603" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0603.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">603</fw>
          
     properties of which they had been so brutal<lb break="no"/>ly despoiled, in order that they might be 
     <lb/>
     conferred upon their executioners, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of myself, I remembered their moving his<lb break="no"/>tory, and that sight, I must say, did not 
     <lb/>
     tend to induce me to accept the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation without carefully considering 
     <lb/>
     all its details. I repeat, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     these are facts which must not be forgotten. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter, and whispering on the right.) 
     <lb/>
     To see the manner, Mr. SPEAKER, in which 
     <lb/>
     certain members of this House receive the 
     <lb/>
     account contained in one of the saddest 
     <lb/>
     pages of the history of New France, one 
     <lb/>
     would really believe that the facts which I 
     <lb/>
     have cited never occurred, and do not con<lb break="no"/>vey any instruction for the future. However, 
     <lb/>
     I am not surprised at such conduct on their 
     <lb/>
     part, when they can approve of a plan of a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution which contains a cause by 
     <lb/>
     which the Imperial Government is enabled 
     <lb/>
     even to change our name of Canadians to give 
     <lb/>
     us any one they may think proper. The 
     <lb/>
     recollection of our struggles cannot be very 
     <lb/>
     vivid in their memory, and the love of their 
     <lb/>
     nationality must be very weakly rooted in 
     <lb/>
     their hearts, to allow of their consenting to 
     <lb/>
     lose, with the name of Canadians, the 
     <lb/>
     memory of an heroic past. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Under Confederation, Canada will be no longer 
     <lb/>
     a country possessing a distinct individuality, 
     <lb/>
     and her own history and customs, but she 
     <lb/>
     will be a state in the Confederacy, the gen<lb break="no"/>eral name of which will cause the special 
     <lb/>
     name of each province of which it is com<lb break="no"/>posed to disappear. Look at the states of 
     <lb/>
     the American Union; the name of the 
     <lb/>
     _United States does away with that of the 
     <lb/>
     individual states. So with Canada; the 
     <lb/>
     name of the Confederacy will be that by 
     <lb/>
     which we shall be known in foreign lands. 
     <lb/>
     For my part, I am proud of our history and 
     <lb/>
     of my designation of Canadian, and I wish 
     <lb/>
     to keep it. I am not one of those who can 
     <lb/>
     listen without interest to the recital of the 
     <lb/>
     heroic struggles of the French race in 
     <lb/>
     America, as the hon. member for Rouville 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. POULIN) can do; for I am of opinion 
     <lb/>
     that considerations of nationality, of family, 
     <lb/>
     of language, and of origin ought to be most 
     <lb/>
     dear to a people, although they would appear 
     <lb/>
     to possess no importance or interest whatever 
     <lb/>
     in the eyes of the hon. member. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.)

     [It being six o'clock, the House rose, to 
     <lb/>
     resume at half-past seven, P.M. At that hour 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>, at the time when I broke 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
       
     off in my observations in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     adjournment at six o'clock, I was engaged in 
     <lb/>
     shewing what was the spirit of antagonism 
     <lb/>
     and strife which prevailed on the American 
     <lb/>
     continent up to 1755. We saw Acadia 
     <lb/>
     made a prey to the attacks of New England, 
     <lb/>
     and lastly, we saw her population dispersed 
     <lb/>
     over the inhospitable shores of this continent 
     <lb/>
     which border on the Atlantic ocean. New 
     <lb/>
     France had thus lost the greater part of her 
     <lb/>
     territory in America. The seven years' 
     <lb/>
     war advanced with the strides of a giant, 
     <lb/>
     and every day saw the French element con<lb break="no"/>fined within narrower boundaries. After a 
     <lb/>
     prolonged contest, during which handfuls of 
     <lb/>
     men struggled with armies of ten times their 
     <lb/>
     number, when they were without bread, with<lb break="no"/>out munitions of war and almost without hope, 
     <lb/>
     the battle of the Plains of Abraham struck the 
     <lb/>
     last blow to the French power in America. 
     <lb/>
     In the following year the battle of Ste. Foye, 
     <lb/>
     which took place on the 28th April, 1760, 
     <lb/>
     soon compelled the Canadians to capitulate, 
     <lb/>
     although they were the victors in that battle, 
     <lb/>
     and the English were compelled to take 
     <lb/>
     shelter behind the walls of Quebec. In the 
     <lb/>
     treaty of capitulation, England guaranteed to 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadians the free exercise of 
     <lb/>
     their form of worship, the preservation of 
     <lb/>
     their institutions, the use of their language 
     <lb/>
     and the maintenance of their laws. After 
     <lb/>
     this struggle on the field of honor, which 
     <lb/>
     called down upon the French-Canadians a 
     <lb/>
     most magnificent tribute of praise from their 
     <lb/>
     Governor, we shall find them engaged in a 
     <lb/>
     new struggle, a political struggle, yet more 
     <lb/>
     glorious than that which had preceded the 
     <lb/>
     cession of Canada to England. But permit 
     <lb/>
     me here, Mr. SPEAKER, to quote the eulo<lb break="no"/>gium pronounced on the Canadians by Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor VAUDREUIL in a letter which he wrote 
     <lb/>
     to the ministers of LOUIS XIV. :—" With 
     <lb/>
     this beautiful and extensive country France 
     <lb/>
     loses 70,000 souls, who are of a nature so sel<lb break="no"/>dom found, that never yet were people so docile, 
     <lb/>
     so brave, and so attached to their prince." 
     <lb/>
     These qualities, for which the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians were distinguished at that period, still 
     <lb/>
     exist in the hearts of the population at the 
     <lb/>
     present day. At the present day still they 
     <lb/>
     are loyal, brave and attached to monarchical 
     <lb/>
     institutions; they love firmly-established 
     <lb/>
     institutions, and the guarantees of peace 
     <lb/>
     accorded by a great power, and the struggles 
     <lb/>
     through which they have had to pass under 
     <lb/>
     English domination have been the best proofs 
     <lb/>
     of their loyalty. If we study the history of 
     <lb/>
     our struggles since the cession of Canada, we 
     <lb/>
               
            <pb n="604" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0604.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">604</fw>
   
     shall find that our public men were always 
     <lb/>
     attached to the Crown of England up to the 
     <lb/>
     time when they were compelled by the arbi<lb break="no"/>trary and unjust conduct of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government to have recourse to arms to ob<lb break="no"/>tain respect for our political rights and our 
     <lb/>
     liberties; and it was thus in 1837 that we 
     <lb/>
     gained responsible government. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) But in order to hold up to view the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of aggression and encroachment which 
     <lb/>
     has always characterised the English popu<lb break="no"/>lation in America, I shall give an historical 
     <lb/>
     sketch of the struggles through which we 
     <lb/>
     had to pass, in the course of a century, to 
     <lb/>
     attain at last our present Constitution, which 
     <lb/>
    it is my wish to preserve, but which our 
     <lb/>Ministers wish to destroy in order to 
     <lb/>substitute for it the scheme of Confederation. 
     <lb/>This historical sketch will demonstrate to us 
     <lb/>that we owe no gratitude to England for 
     <lb/>those political reforms which were obtained 
     <lb/>for us only through the unyielding patriot<lb break="no"/>ism of our great men, who, with intelligence, 
     <lb/>energy and perseverance, valiantly strove 
     <lb/>for the constant defence of our rights. We 
     <lb/>shall also see that, if they obtained the 
     <lb/>system of government and the political 
     <lb/>liberty for which they struggled, it was be<lb break="no"/>cause we had for our neighbors the states of 
     <lb/>the American Union, and that side by side 
     <lb/>with the evil was its remedy. We shall see 
     <lb/>that whenever England stood in need of us 
     <lb/>to defend her power, she made concessions 
     <lb/>to us; but that when the danger was once 
     <lb/>over, colonial fanaticism always attempted to 
     <lb/>withdraw those concessions and to destroy 
     <lb/>the influence and the liberties of the French 
     <lb/>race. Each page of the parliamentary his<lb break="no"/>tory of our country offers a fresh proof of 
     <lb/>this. But we then had men who knew how 
     <lb/>to struggle for a noble cause, and who did 
     <lb/>not shrink from the danger which that 
     <lb/>struggle entailed. I hope, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
     <lb/>we have still some of those men without 
     <lb/>fear and without reproach in Lower Canada; 
     <lb/>I hope the present Ministry are sincere at 
     <lb/>the moment when they are giving up the 
     <lb/>guarantees of the existing Constitution. If 
     <lb/>they can arrive at a happy conclusion with 
     <lb/>their scheme of Confederation, I shall be 
     <lb/>the first to congratulate them, and posterity 
     <lb/>will thank them for having had the hardi<lb break="no"/>hood to propose so vast a scheme. But I 
     <lb/>must say that there are men as intelligent 
     <lb/>and as devoted to the dearest interests of 
     <lb/>our country as the hon. gentlemen who are 
     <lb/>sitting on the Ministerial benches, who are 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     convinced that this scheme, far from being 
     <lb/>
     a remedy for existing difficulties, is but a 
     <lb/>
     new engine prepared by our natural adver<lb break="no"/>saries more easily to destroy the influence 
     <lb/>
     of the French race in America, an influence 
     <lb/>
     for the preservation of which we have had 
     <lb/>
     to fight step by step ever since the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of English domination in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The first political struggle 
     <lb/>
     between the French and the English ele<lb break="no"/>ments in the country occurred only a few 
     <lb/>
     years after the treaty of capitulation had 
     <lb/>
     been signed. The general then command<lb break="no"/>ing in Canada established a system of mili<lb break="no"/>tary government. There may have been 
     <lb/>
     ground for such a system after so long and 
     <lb/>
     bloody a war as that which was just over, 
     <lb/>
     and which had left behind it so much 
     <lb/>
     legitimate animosity in the hearts of the 
     <lb/>
     conqueror and the conquered. However, 
     <lb/>
     the treaty of capitulation declared that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians should be " subjects of the king," 
     <lb/>
     and as such they were entitled to represen<lb break="no"/>tative government. The faith of treaty was 
     <lb/>
     therefore violated from the commencement 
     <lb/>
     of the English domination in Canada, and as 
     <lb/>
     I shall have the honor of shewing, this was 
     <lb/>
     but the first link in the long chain of arbi<lb break="no"/>trary acts to which we have been subjected 
     <lb/>
     since that period. The following, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, is the first aggressive act that I 
     <lb/>
     shall cite in support of my statement :—

     Protestants, as the English understood the procla<lb break="no"/>mation of the month of October, 1873, to pro<lb break="no"/>vide, was asked for. 2nd—An Assembly com<lb break="no"/>posed of equal numbers of Catholics and Protest<lb break="no"/>ants. 3rd —An Assembly composed almost

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Petitions were prepared and signed, in the month

     <lb/>
     this colony and to introduce civil government 
     <lb/>

     began to be aware of the inconveniences resulting 
     <lb/>
     from the British laws, which up to that time had 
     <lb/>

     indeed, allowed the right of being jurors, but at 
     <lb/>
     the same time we were shewn that there were 
     <lb/>
     obstacles to our holding office. The introduction 
     <lb/>
     of the laws of England was talked of—laws which 
     <lb/>
     are infinitely wise and useful for the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, but which could not be made to coincide 
     <lb/>
     with our customs without overturning our fortunes 
     <lb/>
     and entirely destroying our possessions.    
     <lb/>
     Deign, illustrious and gracious Sovereign, to 
     <lb/>
     remove these fears by granting us our ancient 
     <lb/>
     laws, privileges and customs, with the limits of 
     <lb/>
     Canada such as they used to be.

     drawn into the neighboring republic, the

     future greatness of which was not at the

     <lb/>
     losing what possessions remained to her in

     <lb/>
     was a step towards the obtaining of greater 
     <lb/>
     liberties. The other day, the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General for Lower Canada read us several 
     <lb/>
     passages from our history, to prove to us 
     <lb/>
     that French-Canadian hands had alone pre<lb break="no"/>vented the annihilation of English domin<lb break="no"/>ation on this continent. But he did not 
     <lb/>
     draw all the conclusions which he might 
     <lb/>
     have derived from the premises which he 
     <lb/>
     adduced, and the facts which he cited. He 
     <lb/>
     ought to have told us whether, in the face 
     <lb/>
     of those services valiantly rendered, it is 
     <lb/>
     just that the English element, supported by 
     <lb/>
     its number, should to-day impose upon us 
     <lb/>
     representation based on population; ought 
     <lb/>
     the English element, by this aggressive 
     <lb/>
     measure to shake our loyalty to England 
     <lb/>
     by creating a system of government which 
     <lb/>
     is repugnant to us, and in which the French 
     <lb/>
               
            <cb/>
            
     element will lose its just share of influence 
     <lb/>
     in the administration of the affairs of our 
     <lb/>
     country? At this period it was that an 
     <lb/>
     address was sent to the Canadians by the 
     <lb/>
     American Congress, calling upon them to 
     <lb/>
     unite with them in the insurrection against 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country:—"Seize," said the 
     <lb/>
     Congress, " seize the opportunity which 
     <lb/>
     Providence itself affords you; if you act 
     <lb/>
     in such way as to preserve your liberty, 
     <lb/>
     you will be effectually free." Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     everyone knows the reply made by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians to this appeal. Armies invaded 
     <lb/>
     our territory, and took possession of a 
     <lb/>
     part of the country. Quebec alone held 
     <lb/>
     out, thanks to a garrison composed in part 
     <lb/>
     of French-Canadians. And if we are now 
     <lb/>
     sheltered beneath the folds of the British 
     <lb/>
     flag, it is to French-Canadians that we owe 
     <lb/>
     it, and it is them that England ought to thank. 
     <lb/>
     But if it is proposed now to thrust upon us a 
     <lb/>
     political system, the sole object of which is 
     <lb/>
     to submerge us in a hostile majority, we have 
     <lb/>
     to thank the English for it—the English for 
     <lb/>
     whom our fathers saved the country in 1775. 
     <lb/>
     After the defeat of the Americans before 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, Congress did not lose courage. A 
     <lb/>
     second manifesto was despatched to Canada, 
     <lb/>
     promising fresh reinforcements; eminent 
     <lb/>
     men even came into the country; FRANKLIN, 
     <lb/>
     CHASE and CARROLL in vain solicited the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians to unite with them. Dr. CARROLL, 
     <lb/>
     who died in 1815 Bishop of Baltimore, was 
     <lb/>
     sent among the Canadian clergy with no bet<lb break="no"/>ter success, and all hope of obtaining posses<lb break="no"/>sion of this important colony had at last to 
     <lb/>
     be relinquished. These facts necessarily 
     <lb/>
     tended to enlighten public opinion, and Eng<lb break="no"/>land perceived that it would be better for her 
     <lb/>
     to comply with the just demands of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people, in order that reliance 
     <lb/>
     might be placed upon them in the day of 
     <lb/>
     danger, and that they might be used as a 
     <lb/>
     rampart against the United States. Then it 
     <lb/>
     was that a more liberal Constitution was 
     <lb/>
     granted to us, that of 1791 :—

     the votes of individuals of our nationality. 
     <lb/>
     In this House, some days since, we heard 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canadian members, praising our

     liberality, and acknowledging that never had 
     <lb/>
     national or religious fanaticism been display<lb break="no"/>ed by us. That is true ; we are essentially

     liberal and tolerant, and a sufficient proof of

     the number of members of this House who,

     although of religion and origin differing from

     the very first Parliament of Lower Canada,

     Parliament opened on the 17th December, in 
     <lb/>
     the Episcopal Palace, which had been occupied 
     <lb/>
     by the Government since the conquest. A Speaker 
     <lb/>
     had to be chosen, and Mr. J. PANET was proposed. 
     <lb/>
     Then it was that the English members were 
     <lb/>
     found to renew their attempts to obtain the supre<lb break="no"/>macy and to slight the interests of those by whom 
     <lb/>
     they had been elected. Without the least delicacy 
     <lb/>
     and in  spite of their being in a minority, they 
     <lb/>
     proposed in opposition to Mr. PANET, Messrs. 
     <lb/>
     GRANT, McGILL and JORDAN.  Mr. PANET'S elec<lb break="no"/>tion was carried by a majority of 28 to 18, two 
     <lb/>
     Canadians having voted against him. The hatred 
     <lb/>
     which the English party bore to the name of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian manifested itself again when a proposi<lb break="no"/>tion was made that the minutes of the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     of the House should be prepared in both lan<lb break="no"/>guages. A lively and animated debate arose 
     <lb/>
     between the two opposite parties, and this very 
     <lb/>
     reasonable demand was treated as a species of 
     <lb/>
     rebellion against the Mother Country. The 
     <lb/>
     French members were accused of insubordination; 
     <lb/>
     the motives which induced the act seemed to be 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood, and attempts were even made to 
     <lb/>
     intimidate them; but it was in vain. The un<lb break="no"/>assailable arguments upon which the Canadians 
     <lb/>
     rested their claim, and their words, like their elo<lb break="no"/>quence, bearing the stamp of dignity, finally 
     <lb/>
     triumphed over the attacks of their fanatical op<lb break="no"/>ponents.

     Thus the French element demanded the 
     <lb/>
     preparation of the proceedings of the House 
     <lb/>
     in its own language, but we find that the 
     <lb/>
     English element opposed it with all the 
     <lb/>
     power at its command. This was regarded 
     <lb/>
     as rebellion against the Mother Country! It 
     <lb/>
     can hardly be believed. Here was a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive body almost entirely French in its com<lb break="no"/>

           position, and at the very first sitting the few 
     <lb/>
     English members which it contained, after 
     <lb/>
     having attempted to force on the very great 
     <lb/>
     majority a Speaker of their own origin, sub<lb break="no"/>sequently refused to nine-tenths of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the country the imprescriptible 
     <lb/>
     right to their language as the official lan<lb break="no"/>guage. But they were counting without 
     <lb/>
     taking into consideration the resolute firm<lb break="no"/>ness of which the Canadians of old so often 
     <lb/>
     gave proof in the defence of their rights; 
     <lb/>
     and I can convey to the honorable members 
     <lb/>
     of this House no higher opinion of the lofty 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of these great patriots of the 
     <lb/>
     olden time, than by quoting the re<lb break="no"/>marks made by one of the members, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     DELOTBINIÈRE, during the debate in ques<lb break="no"/>tion:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> <p>
     The second reason, which is to assimilate and 
     <lb/>
     attach more promptly the Canadian race to the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, ought to set aside every other 
     <lb/>
     consideration, if we were not certain of the fidelity 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this province; but let us do jus<lb break="no"/>tice to their conduct at all times, and especially 
     <lb/>
     let us remember the year 1775. These Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     who spoke nothing but French, showed their at<lb break="no"/>tachment to their sovereign in a manner which 
     <lb/>
     admitted of no doubt being cast upon it. They 
     <lb/>
     assisted in the defence of the province. This 
     <lb/>
     city, these walls, this very House in which I have 
     <lb/>
     the honor to raise my voice, were, in part, saved 
     <lb/>
     by their zeal and their courage. We saw them 
     <lb/>
     unite with the faithful subjects of His Majesty 
     <lb/>
     and repulse the attacks made by people who 
     <lb/>
     spoke very good English, upon this town. It is 
     <lb/>
     not uniformity of language, therefore, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that makes people more faithful or more 
     <lb/>
     united among themselves. To convince ourselves 
     <lb/>
     of this, let us glance at France at this moment 
     <lb/>
     and at all the kingdoms of Europe. No, I re<lb break="no"/>peat, it is not uniformity of language that main<lb break="no"/>tains and ensures the fidelity of a people; it is 
     <lb/>
     the certainty of its present good fortune, and of 
     <lb/>
     this our people are at present perfectly convinced. 
     <lb/>
     They know that they have a good king— the 
     <lb/>
     best of kings. They know that they are under a 
     <lb/>
     just and liberal government; and, lastly, they 
     <lb/>
    know that a change or a revolution would entail 
     <lb/>certain loss upon them, and they will ever be 
     <lb/>prepared to oppose any such proceeding with 
     <lb/>vigor and courage.

     <persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName>(Montcalm) — Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I hope the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Richelieu will excuse my interrupting him 
     <lb/>
     for a moment. I wish to ask a simple ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Will the hon. member inform me 
     <lb/>
     what difference there is between a member 
     <lb/>
     who reads his speech and another who reads 
     <lb/>
     the history of Canada to the House? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PERR2">MR. PERRAULT</persName>—I reply to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Montcalm, that the speech read 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     to us by the hon. member for Montmorency, 
     <lb/>
     the other evening, was written out from the 
     <lb/>
     first line to the last. Not only did he read 
     <lb/>
     to us the passages which he took from history 
     <lb/>
     or the quotations which he made from the 
     <lb/>
     speeches of other members of this House, 
     <lb/>
     but also his own remarks on those ex<lb break="no"/>tracts. I only read here quotations from 
     <lb/>
     authors, which serve as vouchers upon which 
     <lb/>
     to base my arguments. If I did not read 
     <lb/>
     them, it might be supposed that I only 
     <lb/>
     expressed my own private opinions, whereas 
     <lb/>
     they are those of a friend of the present 
     <lb/>
     Government. Although I coincide in the 
     <lb/>
     ideas and opinions which I quote, yet I do 
     <lb/>
     not choose to appropriate them as my own, 
     <lb/>
     but wish to leave all the merit and the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of them to the author of them.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName> (Montcalm) —The 
     <lb/>
     only difference I can discover between the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Montmorency and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Richelieu, is that the former 
     <lb/>
     read his own work, and that the latter 
     <lb/>
     is rendering himself guilty of plagiarism. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PERR2">MR. PERRAULT</persName>— Everyone knows, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Montcalm has no reason to fear a similar 
     <lb/>
     accusation, for the excellent reason that his 
     <lb/>
     writings and his speeches are nowhere to be 
     <lb/>
     found. At the time when the member for 
     <lb/>
     Montcalm interrupted me so very inoffensively, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, I was quoting a passage from 
     <lb/>
     M. DE LOTBINIÈRE's speech on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of the opposition offered to the publica<lb break="no"/>tion of the proceedings of the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly in 1791 in French, in order to demon<lb break="no"/>strate the spirit of exclusiveness which animat<lb break="no"/>ed the English element from the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of our parliamentary system, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the insignificant minority in which 
     <lb/>
     they were at the time. But that barefaced 
     <lb/>
     attempt was unsuccessful, and the amendment 
     <lb/>
     proposed, having for its object the pros<lb break="no"/>cription of the French language, was refused 
     <lb/>
     by two-thirds of the House. It was finally 
     <lb/>
     resolved that the minutes of the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     of the House should be in both languages, and 
     <lb/>
     that the English or the French version should 
     <lb/>
     be the text of the Legislative acts according 
     <lb/>
     as they related to the English or the French 
     <lb/>
     laws. Thus opposition to the French element 
     <lb/>
     manifested itself from the commencement of 
     <lb/>
     our parliamentary system in this country, by 
     <lb/>
     the refusal to adopt the French as the official 
     <lb/>
     language. But, thanks to our sturdy resist<lb break="no"/>ance, the use of that language has always been 
     <lb/>
     one of our privileges, a privilege which has 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="609" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0609.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">609</fw>
         
     always been preserved in all its integrity until 
     <lb/>
     its introduction into the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation which is proposed to us. Had it not 
     <lb/>
     been for the courage and energy displayed by 
     <lb/>
     the men of those days, the French element 
     <lb/>
     would have lost ground, and its importance 
     <lb/>
     would have diminished, so that at last it would 
     <lb/>
     have been assimilated by the English element. 
     <lb/>
     At that time, our public men already wished 
     <lb/>
     for responsible government, and we shall see 
     <lb/>
     that the struggle which they carried on for 
     <lb/>
     half a century in order to obtain it, was pro<lb break="no"/>ductive of no important result, until they had 
     <lb/>
     recourse to rebellion; and it is since that 
     <lb/>
     gloomy period of our history that we have 
     <lb/>
     our present Constitution and responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Now that we have obtained our 
     <lb/>
     most sacred political rights after passing 
     <lb/>
     through a century of persecution and through 
     <lb/>
     rivers of blood, shed on honorable fields of 
     <lb/>
     battle and on the scaffold, are we going to re<lb break="no"/>linquish them in order to accept a new Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, the evident object of which is to do 
     <lb/>
     away with our influence as a race in this 
     <lb/>
     country? Has not the French majority, for 
     <lb/>
     fifteen years, always carried its point in the 
     <lb/>
     Executive and in the Legislature, thanks to 
     <lb/>
     sectional equality in the representation ? 
     <lb/>
     Why should we then relinquish the advan<lb break="no"/>tages conferred upon us by our present Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, for a scheme of Confederation in 
     <lb/>
     which we shall be in a minority, and which is 
     <lb/>
     fraught with danger to us and to our institu<lb break="no"/>tions? The responsibility assumed by the 
     <lb/>
     French section of the Ministry in uniting the 
     <lb/>
     whole of Upper Canada with the English 
     <lb/>
     minority of Lower Canada is enormous. And 
     <lb/>
     now, at this very time, should that section 
     <lb/>
     wish to withdraw from the struggle, perceiv<lb break="no"/>ing the danger for the future, it could not do 
     <lb/>
     so; it would be carried away by the torrent 
     <lb/>
     of the English element. It is to shew the 
     <lb/>
     danger that exists for the future, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, that I am now presenting a sketch of the 
     <lb/>
     struggles of the past. The circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which gave rise to them still exist, and will 
     <lb/>
     entail the same attempts at aggression ; I must 
     <lb/>
     say this to stay my countrymen, while there 
     <lb/>
     is yet time, on the verge of the abyss towards 
     <lb/>
     which they are allowing themselves to be 
     <lb/>
     drawn. From 1809 <hi rendition="simple:italic">Le Canadien</hi> discussed, 
     <lb/>
     in an animated manner, the question of re<lb break="no"/>sponsible government, and took to heart the 
     <lb/>
     interests of its fellow-countrymen. A cry of 
     <lb/>
     violence and treason was raised. But, says 
     <lb/>
     GARNEAU the historian :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>

     <lb/>

            <p>
     The important question of the voting of the 
     <lb/>
     supplies was also the subject of the most 
     <lb/>
     violent debates. Mr. BÉDARD insisted on this 
     <lb/>
     imprescriptible right of every legislative body 
     <lb/>
     under the Crown of England. But it was 
     <lb/>
     constantly refused by the English minority in 
     <lb/>
     the House and by the Mother Country. Led 
     <lb/>
     with greater strength by Mr. BÉDARD, the 
     <lb/>
     House by a large majority declared itself in 
     <lb/>
     favor of the voting of the supplies by the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the people. In the divi<lb break="no"/>sion which was taken, we find the English 
     <lb/>
     element on one side, and the French element 
     <lb/>
     on the other. I ask you, Mr. SPEAKER, what 
     <lb/>
     rights are left to the British subject if that of 
     <lb/>
     voting the supplies is taken from him; if he 
     <lb/>
     has not the control of the funds levied from 
     <lb/>
     the people for the administration of the affairs 
     <lb/>
     of state,— if he is thus deprived of the 
     <lb/>
     most important of the privileges which are 
     <lb/>
     secured by constitutional government? Is 
     <lb/>
     this great injustice to be consummated? 
     <lb/>
     Shall the most precious of their rights be 
     <lb/>
     refused to the representatives of the people? 
     <lb/>
     Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, there will be no shrinking 
     <lb/>
     from this infamous proceeding. Our most 
     <lb/>
     eminent patriots, those whose eloquent voice 
     <lb/>
     on every occasion demanded our threatened 
     <lb/>
     liberties, were the first to be accused of treason 
     <lb/>
     for having made such a demand, and then 
     <lb/>
     confined for fourteen months in the gloomy 
     <lb/>
     cells of a prison, regardless of the articles of 
     <lb/>
     the capitulation of Montreal, which guaran<lb break="no"/>teed to us the rights and liberties of British 
     <lb/>
     subjects. That proposal to vote our public 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, which now appears to us so 
     <lb/>
     simple, then raised throughout the country a 
     <lb/>
     violent tempest, which was never entirely al<lb break="no"/>layed until the annihilation of the existing 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. In spite of the rage and cal<lb break="no"/>umny which was displayed, Mr. BÉDARD's 
     <lb/>
     proposition was carried, and the following 
     <lb/>
     is the division upon it:—

     appears among the French-Canadian phalanx, 
     <lb/>
     but in compensation we find a French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dian name in the list of those who voted for 
     <lb/>
     that inexcusable denial of a right which we 
     <lb/>
     were to purchase so dearly. It is not my 
     <lb/>
     desire, Mr. SPEAKER, to make any comments 
     <lb/>
     on this division, but I cannot refrain from 
     <lb/>
     observing that it demonstrates that on every 
     <lb/>
     occasion we have had to struggle against the 
     <lb/>
     encroachments and antagonism of the English 
     <lb/>
     element in Canada. Yet there was no cessa<lb break="no"/>tion in the demand for the voting of the sup<lb break="no"/>plies so long as it was not obtained, and it is 
     <lb/>
     a remarkable fact that during the whole time 
     <lb/>
     that the French-Canadians were in a majority 
     <lb/>
     in our country. England systematically re<lb break="no"/>fused us our most just demands and the 
     <lb/>
     control of the general administration. Still 
     <lb/>
     more, the most arbitrary acts were thrust upon 
     <lb/>
     us by the Mother Country, aided in every way, 
     <lb/>
     moreover, by colonial English fanaticism, 
     <lb/>
     which lost no opportunity of turning its well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     known exclusiveness to our disadvantage. But 
     <lb/>
     so soon as their countrymen exceeded us in 
     <lb/>
     number, so soon as the English element ob<lb break="no"/>tained a preponderance in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly by means of the union of 1840, the 
     <lb/>
     English authorities granted us all the political 
     <lb/>
     rights for which we had asked in vain for a 
     <lb/>
     century. They perfectly well knew that those 
     <lb/>
     rights would be controlled, and in case of 
     <lb/>
     need utilised against us by an essentially hos<lb break="no"/>tile representative majority. But, thanks to 
     <lb/>
     the patriotism of our men of that day, we 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in baffling the schemes of the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Government. Up to the union those men 
     <lb/>
     had had to keep up a constant struggle, 
     <lb/>
     marked by a degree of heroism worthy of the 
     <lb/>
     cause which they served, against the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish autocracy, which was banded together 
     <lb/>
     against our countrymen. We, their descend<lb break="no"/>ants, are ready to recommence the same strug<lb break="no"/>gle with the same energy, to maintain our 
     <lb/>
     rights so dearly purchased, and to preserve 
     <lb/>
     the inheritance which we have received and 
     <lb/>
     which it is our wish to transmit intact to the 
     <lb/>
     children of the soil. (Hear, hear.) Let us 
     <lb/>
     now see what was the condition of the liberty 
     <lb/>
     of the press and of the liberty of the subject 
     <lb/>
     at this gloomy period of our parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     history. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi> having dared to ask 
     <lb/>
     for responsible government, and Mr. BÉDARD 
     <lb/>
     having obtained in the House a majority of 
     <lb/>
     twenty-one'against nine in favor of the voting 
     <lb/>
     of the supplies, the Executive Council re<lb break="no"/>solved at any cost to injure the influence of 
     <lb/>
      the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi>, and to paralyze the efforts 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     of the Canadian leaders. It kept a watch on 
     <lb/>
      the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi> to find grounds of accusa<lb break="no"/>tion, and on the deposition of two in<lb break="no"/>dividuals, caused the printing office to be 
     <lb/>
     seized by a squad of soldiers, its contents 
     <lb/>
     to be conveyed to the vaults of the 
     <lb/>
     court, and Mr. BÉDARD to be imprisoned on 
     <lb/>
     a charge of treasonable practices. And this 
     <lb/>
     act of tyranny was grounded on the fact that 
     <lb/>
     these political martyrs had had the courage 
     <lb/>
     to demand for Canada the right of voting the 
     <lb/>
     supplies! The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi> gave an account of 
     <lb/>
     this atrocious imprisonment in the following 
     <lb/>
     paragraph :—

     The infamous conduct of the Council did not 
     <lb/>
     end here. The latter, with the view of striking 
     <lb/>
     terror into the great national party, caused Messrs. 
     <lb/>
     LAFORCE, PAPINEAU (of Chambly), CORBEIL, TAS<lb break="no"/>CHEREAU and BLANCHET to be imprisoned.

     Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, at this period a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the people was cast into prison 
     <lb/>
     for having asked for the granting of a right 
     <lb/>
     which was unjustly withheld, and to crown 
     <lb/>
     the act of tyranny, he was left to rot in his 
     <lb/>
     cell for fourteen months, and was refused a 
     <lb/>
     trial before the courts in which he could 
     <lb/>
     have easily justified himself, and proved that 
     <lb/>
     he had acted in a constitutional manner. I

     The leaders, however, who had been basely im<lb break="no"/>risoned, did not stoop before the storm. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BÉDARD, from the depths of his cell, braved the 
     <lb/>
    fury of the enemies of his country; his great soul 
     <lb/>remained calm and undisturbed, and he did not 
     <lb/>give way to despair. Proud of his rights and 
     <lb/>confident of the justice of his cause, he in vain 
     <lb/>demanded from his persecutors a justification of 
     <lb/>their conduct The ears of his jailer: were deaf 
     <lb/>to his demand, and refusing the liberty which they 
     <lb/>wished to grant him, he even insisted on being 
     <lb/>brought to trial. The new elections caused no 
     <lb/>change in the national representation. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor, in his speech, made no allusion to the se<lb break="no"/>vere measures which he had taken with respect 
     <lb/>to Mr. BÉDARD and his companions, and the ses<lb break="no"/>sion passed over without the noble prisoner hav<lb break="no"/>ing been liberated. It was not until after a cap<lb break="no"/>tivity of thirteen months, and after having con<lb break="no"/>tracted a mortal disease, that this great man left 
     <lb/>the prison to go and rejoin a beloved family, who

     Notwithstanding these crying injustices, Mr.

     BÉDARD did not complain ; he considered

    that it was not too high a price to pay for the

     the great liberties for which he struggled and 
     <lb/>
     suffered. Listen to the noble utterances of 
     <lb/>
     that great patriot, in presence of his electors, 
     <lb/>
     after regaining his liberty :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The past must not discourage us, or diminish 
     <lb/>
     our veneration for our Constitution. Any other 
     <lb/>
     form of government would be subject to the same 
     <lb/>
     drawback, and in fact to drawbacks far greater ; 
     <lb/>
     the peculiarity of our present system is, that it 
     <lb/>
     furnishes the means of remedying its own defects. 
     <lb/>
     [And he added]: We must, moreover, be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to make some sacrifices for the securing of these 
     <lb/>
     great advantages."

            </p></quote>
              
            <p>Such was the language of that great patriot ; 
     <lb/>not a word of bitterness, complaint, or re<lb break="no"/>crimination, but dignity of expression and a 
     <lb/>sincere conviction of the advantages of the 
     <lb/>Constitution. What a contrast, alas! between 
     <lb/>those days of devotedness and civic courage, 
     <lb/>and the egotism and frigid indifference of our 
     <lb/>own, in which self-interest overrides every<lb break="no"/>thing, and patriotism has ceased to exist. The 
     <lb/>page of our history I have just read, is 
     <lb/>one which certainly should not remain un<lb break="no"/>noticed; it is a page which our legislators 
     <lb/>would do well to consult. They would there 
     <lb/>find an example of patriotism well deserving 
     <lb/>of imitation. It is well to contemplate and 
     <lb/>study the great struggles of our forefathers, 
     <lb/>to see how victory crowned the efforts of those 
     <lb/>noble patriots—a victory dearly purchased, 
     <lb/>and of which we have up to our own day 
     <lb/>preserved the precious fruits. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>But the war of 1812 broke out, and England 
     <lb/>—who has never granted us any liberties or 
     <lb/>privileges except when she needed us for her 
     <lb/>own defence on this continent—changed her 
     <lb/>tactics. She trembled for her supremacy in 
     <lb/>these British provinces, and immediately she 
     <lb/>deemed it prudent to secure our good-will, and 
     <lb/>coöperation in the struggle then about to 
     <lb/>commence—in the first place, by calling Mr. 
     <lb/>BÉDARD to a seat on the judicial bench. She 
     <lb/>understood clearly that she could do nothing 
     <lb/>against the United States without the assist<lb break="no"/>ance of the French-Canadian element. And 
     <lb/>the Imperial Government also hoped to recover 
     <lb/>the control of the influence and the services of 
     <lb/>the race it had treated so tyrannically. 
     <lb/>Thus it was that the man who had been cast 
     <lb/>into prison, and whom the Government had 
     <lb/>accused of treason, became the judge of the 
     <lb/>highest court in the country. The adoption 
     <lb/>of every base means of gaining adherents con<lb break="no"/>stituted the tactics of the Government at that 
     <lb/>period. They hoped that by thus giving a 
     <lb/>place to the man who had been the most 
     <lb/>valiant defender of our rights and of our 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
      
     nationality, they would secure the adherence 
     <lb/>
     of the children of the soil, and they were not 
     <lb/>
     mistaken. In adopting that means, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, the Imperial Government showed 
     <lb/>
     that they understood the character of the 
     <lb/>
     nation they thus sought to gain over to their 
     <lb/>
     cause. For it must be admitted—and it is 
     <lb/>
     perhaps our misfortune—that it is the peculiar 
     <lb/>
     characteristic of the French element, that they 
     <lb/>
     very often too soon forget the persecutions of 
     <lb/>
     which they have been the victims, and which 
     <lb/>
     ought to inspire them with an honest indigna<lb break="no"/>tion when they reflect on the past. Over-con<lb break="no"/>fident of the sincere good will of our adver<lb break="no"/>saries, we are always taken unawares at each 
     <lb/>
     new attempt at aggression. And even now, 
     <lb/>
     a few years of prosperity has been enough to 
     <lb/>
     dazzle us and make us anticipate a brilliant 
     <lb/>
     prospect in a measure which involves nothing 
     <lb/>
     short of the annihilation of our influence as a 
     <lb/>
     race, which is in fact decreed in the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation now sought to be forced upon 
     <lb/>
     the people. (Hear, hear.) But the American 
     <lb/>
     army threatened the frontier, and it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary to think of defence. With a view 
     <lb/>
     of being prepared for an attack, the Governor 
     <lb/>
     assembled Parliament twice in 1812, and 
     <lb/>
     measures were taken for arming the militia and 
     <lb/>
     voting the sums required for the organization 
     <lb/>
     and defence of the province. Sir GEORGE 
     <lb/>
     PREVOST, at the opening of Parliament in 
     <lb/>
     1813, complimented the people for their 
     <lb/>
     courage and energy, and the proceedings were 
     <lb/>
     less stormy than usual; fresh supplies were 
     <lb/>
     voted for the war, and a good under<lb break="no"/>standing subsisted between the Government 
     <lb/>
     and the two Houses during the session. 
     <lb/>
     At that heroic period of our history, we 
     <lb/>
     find our French-Canadian fellow—country<lb break="no"/>men, to whom fresh concessions had been 
     <lb/>
     made, obedient to the voice of their chiefs, 
     <lb/>
     rushing to the frontier and driving back the 
     <lb/>
     invader. But in 1812, as in 1775, the de<lb break="no"/>votedness and patriotism of our people were 
     <lb/>
     destined soon to be forgotten. The moment 
     <lb/>
     of danger had scarcely passed away when 
     <lb/>
     those who had saved the power of England in 
     <lb/>
     America, at the price of their blood, were 
     <lb/>
     once more made the object of incessant at<lb break="no"/>tacks on the part of the English oligarchy, as 
     <lb/>
     I shall shortly shew. GARNEAU gives the 
     <lb/>
     following graphic sketch of the conduct of his 
     <lb/>
     countrymen at that critical period of our 
     <lb/>
     history:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     A second time was Canada preserved for Eng<lb break="no"/>land by the very people whom it was sought to 
     <lb/>
     annihilate; by their bravery the colony was pre<lb break="no"/>

     served from the inevitable woes of a frightful 
     <lb/>
     war. For a moment the hatred entertained to<lb break="no"/>wards the Canadian name was stifled ; the Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Office, sensible of the difficulties of the moment, 
     <lb/>
     silenced the fanatical yells of its trans-atlantic 
     <lb/>
     minions; but once the danger over and Canada 
     <lb/>
     safe, the old antipathies were soon again to burst 
     <lb/>
     forth, the war upon our language, our institutions 
     <lb/>
     and our laws to recommence, and ingratitude to 
     <lb/>
     take the place of gratitude in the hearts of the 
     <lb/>
     children of Albion. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Forbearance, it was evident, had been thus 
     <lb/>
     used solely because circumstances rendered it 
     <lb/>
     impossible to give grounds of discontent to so 
     <lb/>
     important a portion of the population, by 
     <lb/>
     whom alone the country could be saved. 
     <lb/>
     England has never been liberal except in 
     <lb/>
     presence of danger. At this moment she is 
     <lb/>
     endeavoring to attain the same end by at<lb break="no"/>tempting to destroy our nationality by means 
     <lb/>
     of the Federation scheme submitted to us. 
     <lb/>
     But she finds at her back now an element of 
     <lb/>
     strength which she did not then possess, to 
     <lb/>
     aid her in the task—the support of a French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian majority. (Hear, hear.) In the 
     <lb/>
     following year occurred the glorious battle of 
     <lb/>
     Chateauguay. On that memorable day a 
     <lb/>
     handful of brave men, commanded by DESA<lb break="no"/>LABERRY, confronted an enemy thirty times 
     <lb/>
     superior in number to themselves, arrested the 
     <lb/>
     advance of the invader, and by their devoted<lb break="no"/>ness and bravery saved this rich province for 
     <lb/>
     the Crown of England. Now, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     what the French-Canadians did in the war of 
     <lb/>
     1812, that they are once more prepared to do 
     <lb/>
     under the Constitution as it is at this moment. 
     <lb/>
     It was because they felt at that time that they 
     <lb/>
     had something more precious to defend than 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation which can afford no better 
     <lb/>
     protection to their material interests than to 
     <lb/>
     their institutions, their language, their laws, 
     <lb/>
     and their nationality, that they took no ac<lb break="no"/>count of the numbers of the enemy, but fought 
     <lb/>
     valiantly when they were outnumbered in the 
     <lb/>
     proportion of ten to one. And now again, 
     <lb/>
     in defending the Constitution as it is, with the 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges it guarantees to us, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians will not hesitate a moment to sacri<lb break="no"/>fice themselves for the safety of the precious 
     <lb/>
     deposit entrusted to their keeping. Surely, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, it is not necessary to go far 
     <lb/>
     back into our history for an instance of this. 
     <lb/>
     In 1862, at the time of the affair of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trent</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     when a rupture with our neighbors seemed 
     <lb/>
     imminent, the French-Canadians rushed to 
     <lb/>
     arms with the eagerness and irresistible im<lb break="no"/>pulse of the heroes of New France. It is not, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, that the French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     desires war, but he loves to nerve his arm by 
     <lb/>
     calling to mind the battle-fields of former 
     <lb/>
     days; and if the present generation were called 
     <lb/>
     upon to meet the enemy, they would show the 
     <lb/>
     whole world that their blood has not degener<lb break="no"/>ated, and that they are worthy in every respect 
     <lb/>
     of their heroic ancestors. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     After the war of 1812, which had so greatly 
     <lb/>
     imperilled the possessions of England on this 
     <lb/>
     continent, the same attempts at aggression 
     <lb/>
     were renewed without delay; so true is it 
     <lb/>
     that danger alone could interrupt them. The 
     <lb/>
     troops having gone into winter quarters, the 
     <lb/>
     Governor, Sir G. PREVOST, went down to 
     <lb/>
     Quebec to open Parliament, and the dis<lb break="no"/>agreements between the popular branch and 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council soon broke forth 
     <lb/>
     again little by little. STUART again brought 
     <lb/>
     up the question of the rules of practice, and 
     <lb/>
     made the most serious accusations against 
     <lb/>
     Judge SEWELL—charging him, for instance, 
     <lb/>
     with having attempted to enforce his rules of 
     <lb/>
     practice without the authority of Parliament; 
     <lb/>
     with having dismissed the Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     from his place in order to instal therein his 
     <lb/>
     own brother, E. SEWELL; with having vio<lb break="no"/>lated the liberty of the press, by causing the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi> to be seized without any plausible 
     <lb/>
     grounds; and the liberty of Parliament, by 
     <lb/>
     imprisoning several of its members. These 
     <lb/>
     accusations, some of which were true, were 
     <lb/>
     transmitted to England, but STUART having 
     <lb/>
     been unable to cross the sea in order to follow 
     <lb/>
     them up, SEWELL got rid of the charges. 
     <lb/>
     The same occurred as regards Judge MONK, 
     <lb/>
     who was accused at the same time of sundry 
     <lb/>
     malversations; and, as Mr. F. X. GARNEAU 
     <lb/>
     remarks, Judge SEWELL determined that the 
     <lb/>
     best revenge he could take for the accusations 
     <lb/>
     brought against him was to suggest to the 
     <lb/>
     Prince Regent the union of all the British 
     <lb/>
     provinces, with a view to compass the destruc<lb break="no"/>tion of French-Canadian nationality. Such, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, were the circumstances under 
     <lb/>
     which the scheme of Confederation was first pro<lb break="no"/>posed. And it must be admitted that, bearing 
     <lb/>
     in mind the recommendation of Mr. SEWELL, 
     <lb/>
     it ought to excite many fears on the part of 
     <lb/>
     every true French-Canadian. Who was the 
     <lb/>
     first man to pronounce the word "Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation" ? A man who violated the liberty of 
     <lb/>
     the press and the liberty of Parliament! A 
     <lb/>
     man who had for years longed for the destruc<lb break="no"/>tion of the French-Canadian race! At a 
     <lb/>
     subsequent period, after the revolution of 
     <lb/>
     1837, Lord DURHAM proposed Confederation 
     <lb/>
     as the political organization best adapted for 
     <lb/>
     our annihilation. And at this moment our 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">613</fw>
           
     fellow-countrymen in office submit, nay, pro<lb break="no"/>pose, to the people this scheme of annihilation, 
     <lb/>
     specially prepared for our destruction, and 
     <lb/>
     which must destroy us, Mr. SPEAKER, if the 
     <lb/>
     people outside this House do not protest in 
     <lb/>
     every constitutional way against the political 
     <lb/>
     suicide of the French race in Canada. At 
     <lb/>
     the prorogation of Parliament in 1814, the 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, L. J. PAPINEAU, addressed the 
     <lb/>
     Governor, Sir GEORGE PREVOST, in the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing words :—

            </p>

    
   
           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> <p>
     When the war broke out—continued Mr. PA<lb break="no"/>PINEAU—this country had neither troops nor mon<lb break="no"/>ey, and Your Excellency commanded a people in 
     <lb/>
     whom, it was said, the habits acquired during 
     <lb/>
     more than half a century of peace had destroyed 
     <lb/>
     all military spirit. Despite these predictions, you 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in deriving from the devotedness of a 
     <lb/>
     brave and faithful, though calumniated people, 
     <lb/>
     sufficient resources to defeat the plans of con<lb break="no"/>quest of an enemy great in numbers and full of 
     <lb/>
     confidence in his own strength. The blood of

     the children of Canada was shed, mingled with 
     <lb/>
     that of the brave men sent here to assist in our 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     protection of England and of the inviolable fidel<lb break="no"/>ity of her colonies, constitute for the latter fresh

     The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, 
     <lb/>
     then twenty-six years of age, who struggled 
     <lb/>
     so heroically to secure our political rights 
     <lb/>
     and liberties, is the same whose name, during 
     <lb/>
     a recent sitting of this House, was ignomin<lb break="no"/>iously dragged forward by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Montmorency and the Honorable Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER). His 
     <lb/>
     name, venerated by the entire country as that 
     <lb/>
     of its liberator, has been cast as an insult in 
     <lb/>
     the teeth of honorable members of this House, 
     <lb/>
     who deem it an honor to own his leadership, 
     <lb/>
     and who still continue to carry on his work— 
     <lb/>
     the protection of our political rights against 
     <lb/>
     the underhand plots of a hostile majority. 
     <lb/>
     But, Mr. SPEAKER, that venerable old man, 
     <lb/>
     who has grown grey in the service of his coun<lb break="no"/>try, is sheltered from base insinuations, which 
     <lb/>
     can as little penetrate his peaceful retirement 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     as they can the hearts of the sincere friends 
     <lb/>
     of our country. In that quiet retreat the 
     <lb/>
     great patriot of our evil days, after having 
     <lb/>
     nobly fulfilled his task, enjoys in peace and 
     <lb/>
     with pride the esteem of those he successfully 
     <lb/>
     defended with his powerful voice in the dark<lb break="no"/>est hour of our political history. Gross in<lb break="no"/>sults, shameless calumnies, when uttered 
     <lb/>
     against such a man, redound with double 
     <lb/>
     weight upon those who thus basely vilify a 
     <lb/>
     citizen justly admitted to be an honor to 
     <lb/>
     our country. The name of the Hon. L. J. 
     <lb/>
     PAPINEAU is surrounded with a luminous 
     <lb/>
     halo which malignant calumny can never suc<lb break="no"/>ceed in tarnishing. His memory is safe from 
     <lb/>
     these envious assaults, for it is under the 
     <lb/>
     protection of the people whom he rescued 
     <lb/>
     from the systematic colonial oppression which 
     <lb/>
     I am attempting to describe. Really, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, the cause of the Honorable Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General East must be in very great straits 
     <lb/>
     when he is compelled to resort to such means 
     <lb/>
     in order to save it. The Honorable Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General East must have very little confidence 
     <lb/>
     in thc success of that cause, when he endeavors 
     <lb/>
     to excite the prejudices of his supporters by 
     <lb/>
     heaping insults on one of the greatest names 
     <lb/>
     in our history. Such language on the part 
     <lb/>
     of the Honorable Attorney General East is 
     <lb/>
     the more culpable in that he himself was one 
     <lb/>
     of the rebels of 1837-'8, and one of the 
     <lb/>
     most zealous partisans of that great pat<lb break="no"/>riot whom he now insults. Did he not 
     <lb/>
     himself vote in favor of the ninety-two reso<lb break="no"/>lutions—that imperishable monument of Can<lb break="no"/>adian rights ? Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, the man 
     <lb/>
     upon whose head a price was set, the man 
     <lb/>
     who was compelled to fly from his country 
     <lb/>
     and to seek from a neighboring country that 
     <lb/>
     right of asylum, which he refuses to-day to 
     <lb/>
     the Southern refugee, has the audacity, now 
     <lb/>
     that he is Attorney General, to call that great 
     <lb/>
     statesman "Old Mr. PAPINEAU," and the op<lb break="no"/>position in this House, " 01d Mr. PAPINEAU'S 
     <lb/>
     tail." I do not hesitate to assert, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, that such expressions are unworthy of this 
     <lb/>
     House, and unworthy of the position occupied 
     <lb/>
     by the Honorable Attorney General East, who 
     <lb/>
     has had the questionable courage to pronounce 
     <lb/>
     them. (Hear, hear.) Such expressions, if 
     <lb/>
     they are to be tolerated anywhere, find their 
     <lb/>
     proper place in the common streets, and 
     <lb/>
     the standard of this House must have fal<lb break="no"/>len very low, when such language is per<lb break="no"/>mitted here. All sense of dignity must be 
     <lb/>
     lost, when the Hon. Attorney General is per<lb break="no"/>mitted to insult, on the floor of this House, the 
     <lb/>
      name of a man whom every true French-<lb break="yes"/> 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">614</fw>
           
     Canadian holds in veneration. Let the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman not deceive himself—opinions 
     <lb/>
     and ideas tending to promote the happiness of 
     <lb/>
     the people, and the men who sustain and 
     <lb/>
     struggle for their interests, will ever be vic<lb break="no"/>torious over the assault of calumny and envy. 
     <lb/>
     And what has been the aim of the Hon. At<lb break="no"/>torney General and the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency, in their attack upon the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. PAPINEAU ? Their object, in the first 
     <lb/>
     place, was to injure the Opposition, who re<lb break="no"/>present him ; and next, to elevate themselves, 
     <lb/>
     by dragging down to their own level one of 
     <lb/>
     the great men of our history, beside whom 
     <lb/>
     they are but pigmies. For there are two 
     <lb/>
     ways of being great : the first is by rendering 
     <lb/>
     to one's country eminent services, and by ex<lb break="no"/>hibiting undeniable superiority ; but inasmuch 
     <lb/>
     as the Hon. Attorney General and the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Montmorency possess neither 
     <lb/>
     the material nor the superiority that go to 
     <lb/>
     make great men, they adopt the second mode 
     <lb/>
     of attaining greatness. It consists in depre<lb break="no"/>ciating and crushing all those who are supe<lb break="no"/>rior to one's self. Thus they hope to rise 
     <lb/>
     over the ruined reputation of those they en<lb break="no"/>viously calumniate and unceasingly attack. 
     <lb/>
     They recklessly carry on their work of demoli<lb break="no"/>tion ; they are not arrested in their course 
     <lb/>
     even by the names that personify a whole 
     <lb/>
     epoch in our history, and when one of the 
     <lb/>
     great figures of the past confronts them in all 
     <lb/>
     its dignity, like a statue of glory, their sacri<lb break="no"/>legious hands are eagerly raised to mutilate it ; 
     <lb/>
     then, standing alone upon its scattered frag<lb break="no"/>ments, they contemplate with pride the pros<lb break="no"/>trate victim of their vandal labors ! Such, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, are the motives which explain 
     <lb/>
     the efforts made by those who thus attempt 
     <lb/>
     to injure one of the greatest men of our race. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and cheers.) But we have not 
     <lb/>
     yet reached the termination of our struggles. 
     <lb/>
     At the opening of Parliament in 1816, a mes<lb break="no"/>sage was communicated to the House stating 
     <lb/>that the charges brought against Judges 
     <lb/>SEWELL and MONK had been dismissed. The 
     <lb/>bitter words in which the message was couched 
     <lb/>greatly incensed the House, and a proper 
     <lb/>answer was just about to be adopted, when a 
     <lb/>dissolution was resorted to in order to pre<lb break="no"/>vent a manifestation of the feelings of the 
     <lb/>House. And what was the position taken 
     <lb/>by the Imperial Government with reference 
     <lb/>to those difficulties ? We find it stated in 
     <lb/>the letter written by Lord BATHURST to Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor SHERBROOKE, who pointed out to them 
     <lb/>the false step taken by the Colonial Office in 
     <lb/>thus oppressing our race :—

            <cb/>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Hitherto the Government has found, on all or<lb break="no"/>dinary occasions, an abiding resource in the firm<lb break="no"/>ness and disposition of the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>
     and there is no reason to doubt that the Council 
     <lb/>
     will continue to counteract the most injudicious 
     <lb/>
     and violent measures of the Legislative Assembly.

            <p>
     In truth, the measures of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Assembly of that day were very injudicious, 
     <lb/>
     very violent ! They demanded that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple should have a voice in the disposal of the 
     <lb/>
     moneys contributed by themselves! And 
     <lb/>
     hence it was that the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     counteracted all the measures demanded by 
     <lb/>
     the people. I continue the quotation :—

     It is therefore in every way desirable that you 
     <lb/>
     should avail yourself of its assistance to counteract 
     <lb/>
     any measures of the Assembly you may deem objec<lb break="no"/>tionable, instead of placing your own authority or 
     <lb/>
     that of the Government in direct opposition to that 
     <lb/>
     of the House, and thus affording them a pretext for 
     <lb/>
     refusing the supplies necessary for the service of 
     <lb/>
     the colony.

            <p>
     Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, the nominative Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council was always the stumbling-block 
     <lb/>
     in the way of the French-Canadians when<lb break="no"/>ever they endeavored to carry any measure of 
     <lb/>
     reform. The elective House invariably met, 
     <lb/>
     on the part of that body, a systematic oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to every measure desired by the people— 
     <lb/>
     an opposition it was impossible to overcome. 
     <lb/>
     It was in 1856 that we succeeded, after a 
     <lb/>
     constant struggle of fifty years, in introduc<lb break="no"/>ing the elective principle into the Upper 
     <lb/>
     House. At this moment, despite lessons 
     <lb/>
     of the past, recorded unfortunately in letters of 
     <lb/>
     blood, an attempt is made to return to the 
     <lb/>
     old system ; we are about basely to abandon 
     <lb/>
     a privilege, a political right, which was the 
     <lb/>
     reward of so many struggles and so many 
     <lb/>
     woes. Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, such is the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of the present Government ; they intend that 
     <lb/>
     in the Confederation the members of the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council shall be appointed by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, as in the darkest period of our his<lb break="no"/>tory. Happily, the people thoroughly under<lb break="no"/>stand the value and bearing of life nomina<lb break="no"/>tions. They know that the great majority of 
     <lb/>
     the men so appointed by a General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, numerically hostile to our race, would 
     <lb/>
     ever be ready to reject measures the most 
     <lb/>
     favorable to our interests as a nation. The 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council under Confederation will 
     <lb/>
     be what it was in the days of oppression, 
     <lb/>
     when Lord BATHURST, in pursuance of the 
     <lb/>
    instructions of the Imperial Government, 
     <lb/>said to Governor SHERBROOKE—" Be care<lb break="no"/>ful to make use of the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>to counteract the measures of the elective 
     <lb/>
         

    
            <pb n="615" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0615.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">615</fw>
       
     body." That is just it—they shield them<lb break="no"/>selves behind a Legislative Council com<lb break="no"/>posed of their own creatures brought back 
     <lb/>
     to life, and then while lauding to the 
     <lb/>
     skies the colonial liberality of England, 
     <lb/>
     they pull the strings and make their puppets 
     <lb/>
     play the part of oppressors. It is precisely 
     <lb/>
     the same political organization that is pro<lb break="no"/>posed in the scheme of Confederation. In a 
     <lb/>
    Legislative Council composed of life-members, 
     <lb/>we shall have men prepared invariably to re<lb break="no"/>fuse the people the measures they require, if 
     <lb/>such measures in any way affect the privi<lb break="no"/>leges of the aristocratic classes. However 
     <lb/>eager may be the efforts of the members of 
     <lb/>the elective body, it will be constitutionally 
     <lb/>impossible for us to obtain such measures. 
     <lb/>Moreover, these councillors, of whom the 
     <lb/>majority will be hostile to us, will do every<lb break="no"/>thing in their power to gratify the Imperial 
     <lb/>Government, by whom they are to be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed—a Government which has ever liber<lb break="no"/>ally subsidised its creatures. Such, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, are the dangers in our path if we 
     <lb/>return to the old system of life-appointments 
     <lb/>proposed by the Government in the Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme. (Hear, hear.) But the 
     <lb/>first instructions given by Lord BATHURST to 
     <lb/>Governor SHERBROOKE were not sufficiently 
     <lb/>explicit, apparently ; for shortly afterwards he 
     <lb/>transmitted the following—" I strongly recom<lb break="no"/>mend you to see that the Legislative Assembly 
     <lb/>does not dispose of public moneys without the 
     <lb/>consent of the Legislative Council,"—thus 
     <lb/>unscrupulously violating the very essence of 
     <lb/>the Constitution, evidently under the impulse 
     <lb/>of rabid national feelings. It is a principle 
     <lb/>of the Constitution of England that the 
     <lb/>popular House, which represents the opinions 
     <lb/>of the people, has alone the right of voting 
     <lb/>supplies for the administration of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that moneys levied for that pur<lb break="no"/>pose from the people can be expended only 
     <lb/>with the consent of that House and not 
     <lb/>otherwise. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, what do we 
     <lb/>find in this instance ? We find the Imperial 
     <lb/>Government expressly instructing Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's representative in Canada not to allow 
     <lb/>the supplies to be voted without the consent of 
     <lb/>the Legislative Council, appointed for life 
     <lb/>by the Crown, and whose constant efforts 
     <lb/>were directed to resisting the just demands 
     <lb/>of the French-Canadians. This question 
     <lb/>of the supplies, the chief cause of all 
     <lb/>the difficulties by which we have been 
     <lb/>beset, both previous to and since that period, 
     <lb/>was not to be thus disposed of. We 
     <lb/>then had men who were not to be baffled by 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     difficulties or rebuffs. And thus it is that we 
     <lb/>
     find those noble champions of our rights and 
     <lb/>
     liberties coming forward, year after year, with 
     <lb/>
     the same demands ; never disheartened by de<lb break="no"/>feat, and struggling on until at last their 
     <lb/>
     legitimate claims were acceded to. In Janu<lb break="no"/>ary, 1819, the Houses were opened, and the 
     <lb/>
     first question which brought on an animated 
     <lb/>
     debate was, once more, the question of the 
     <lb/>
     finances. A discussion arose as to whether 
     <lb/>
     the Lower House, after having obtained the 
     <lb/>
     annual vote of supply, could moreover obtain 
     <lb/>
     a detailed civil list and vote on each item 
     <lb/>
     separately. The majority desired this in 
     <lb/>
     order to assure themselves of the integrity of 
     <lb/>
     the public officials, and to hold in check the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Executive Council, over whom 
     <lb/>
     they had no control. Others opposed it 
     <lb/>
     strongly, as a new principle and violating the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the Crown. A committee, appointed 
     <lb/>
     to examine into the question, reported in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a reduction of the expenditure— 
     <lb/>
     which they declared to be far too great in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to the revenue—and the abolition of 
     <lb/>
     pensions, which tended to grave abuses. 
     <lb/>
     Adopting a middle course between the two 
     <lb/>
     extremes, some wished to vote the supplies 
     <lb/>
     under certain heads, giving a gross sum for 
     <lb/>
     each department. But the supporters of a 
     <lb/>
     detailed vote carried the day. The bill was 
     <lb/>
     passed, sent up to the Council, and, as was 
     <lb/>
     anticipated, rejected by that body in the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing terms :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     That the mode adopted for the granting of the 
     <lb/>
     civil list was unconstitutional, unprecedented, and 
     <lb/>
     involved a direct violation of the rights and pre<lb break="no"/>rogatives of the Crown ; that if the bill became 
     <lb/>
     law, it would not only give the Commons the 
     <lb/>
     privilege of voting supplies, but also of prescrib<lb break="no"/>ing to the Crown the number and character of 
     <lb/>
     its servants, by regulating and rewarding their ser<lb break="no"/>vices as they thought proper, which would render 
     <lb/>them independent of their electors, and might 
     <lb/>lead to their rejecting the authority of the Crown, 
     <lb/>which their oath of allegiance bound them to 
     <lb/>sustain. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, the Council nominated 
     <lb/>
     for life rejected that eminently just measure 
     <lb/>
     —the voting, item by item, of the supplies 
     <lb/>
     by the Lower House ; that is to say, the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of the moneys levied from the peo<lb break="no"/>ple—and even went the length of declaring 
     <lb/>
     the measure unconstitutional. Is it possible 
     <lb/>
     at this time to understand how servility could 
     <lb/>
     be carried to such an excess ? At that period 
     <lb/>
     the population of Upper Canada had in<lb break="no"/>creased to a proportionately considerable 
     <lb/>
     extent, and the British population of Lower 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">616</fw>
           
     Canada was sufficiently numerous to suggest 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of uniting the two Canadas under 
     <lb/>
     one government, and in 1823 the proposal 
     <lb/>
    was made in England. It was, therefore, at 
     <lb/>that period of trouble and agitation, and rivalry 
     <lb/>between the Houses, that a plot was entered 
     <lb/>into in England to annihilate at one blow 
     <lb/>French-Canadian nationality. The war only 
     <lb/>postponed the scheme for the union of the 
     <lb/>two provinces ; for the assistance of the 
     <lb/>French-Canadian people was needed. Peace 
     <lb/>having been established, it was resolved to 
     <lb/>carry out the measure, and a bill for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose was presented to the Imperial Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, unknown to the parties whose fate was 
     <lb/>being decided, and without their being consult<lb break="no"/>ed, for it was known that they were opposed to 
     <lb/>that act of oppression. Yes, without consult<lb break="no"/>ing the people of Lower Canada, it was sought 
     <lb/>to force upon them a Constitution under which 
     <lb/>they were to have a smaller representation 
     <lb/>than Upper Canada ; moreover, Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada was to be charged with the debt of the 
     <lb/>other province, which was a considerable debt, 
     <lb/>and the language of Lower Canada was to be 
     <lb/>banished from the Legislature. Happily, the 
     <lb/>scheme found opponents in the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament, and, despite all the intrigues and 
     <lb/>efforts of our enemies, the bill was thrown out 
     <lb/>at the second reading. Then, as at the present 
     <lb/>day, those who aimed at our destruction were 
     <lb/>loud in favor of passing the bill, at any price, 
     <lb/>before the peeple had an opportunity of pro<lb break="no"/>testing. At the present moment, those who 
     <lb/>desire to force us into Confederation, in the 
     <lb/>face of the petitions against the scheme, tell 
     <lb/>us that we must accept the new Constitution 
     <lb/>before the people are made aware of its mon<lb break="no"/>strous details. " I beg of you to pass this 
     <lb/>bill at once," said Mr. WILMOTT ; " if you 
     <lb/>wait until next year you will receive so many 
     <lb/>petitions protesting against the measure, that 
     <lb/>it will be very difficult to adopt it, however 
     <lb/>useful it may be to those who oppose it through 
     <lb/>ignorance or through prejudice ; moreover, 
     <lb/>it is essential to the removal of the difficulties 
     <lb/>existing between the Executive and the As<lb break="no"/>sembly." When the news of those unjust, 
     <lb/>but happily abortive, attempts reached Can<lb break="no"/>ada, the greatest agitation was produced, and 
     <lb/>the whole Canadian people felt indignant at 
     <lb/>such proceedings. Several meetings were held 
     <lb/>at Montreal and Quebec to protest against the 
     <lb/>bill, and petitions to the English Government 
     <lb/>were signed by 60,000 persons. At that 
     <lb/>period, as in this instance, the union was to 
     <lb/>be carried without consulting the people, 
     <lb/>and the Imperial Parliament submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     
    
            <cb/>
            
     Legislature a measure against which 60,000 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians protested. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I have no hesitation in asserting it, the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation which it is now 
     <lb/>
     attempted to force upon the people is destined 
     <lb/>
     to be rejected, not by 60,000 French-Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian signatures merely, but by 100,000. 
     <lb/>
     Yes, our people are waking up, and in this 
     <lb/>
     united and general protest we shall not lag 
     <lb/>
     behind those who showed us the example of 
     <lb/>
     an effective protest whenever it was sought to 
     <lb/>
     inflict injustice upon them. We will send to 
     <lb/>
     England thousands of signatures to protest 
     <lb/>
     against the Constitution we do not desire, 
     <lb/>
     and if justice is then refused, well "<hi rendition="simple:italic">fiat 
     <lb/>
     justitia ruat cœlum</hi>," we shall have employed 
     <lb/>
     every constitutional means, and the 'responsi<lb break="no"/>bility for the consequences of that refusal of 
     <lb/>
     justice will fall on the heads of those who 
     <lb/>
     labor to bring about such a state of things. 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. DENIS BENJAMIN VIGER, one of 
     <lb/>
     the boldest champions of our rights, said of 
     <lb/>
     the bringing forward of the scheme of union 
     <lb/>
     in the Imperial Parliament, without consult<lb break="no"/>ing the people :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     After fifty years of peace and prosperity, when 
     <lb/>
     the generation that witnessed the conquest has 
     <lb/>
     passed away ; when there remains hardly a living 
     <lb/>
     witness of that event among the present gener<lb break="no"/>ation ; when the memory and the impression of it 
     <lb/>
     has died out in the breast of French-Canadians ; 
     <lb/>
     when, in fine, there no longer remains in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince any but British born subjects, enjoying all

     their rights in that capacity alone—now it is that 
     <lb/>
     a scheme is concocted, under which we are to be 
     <lb/>
     treated—I will not say as a conquered people, for 
     <lb/>
     the public laws of civilized nations no longer per<lb break="no"/>mit the vanquished to be robbed of their institu<lb break="no"/>tions and laws, any more than of their property— 
     <lb/>
     but like a barbarous race to whom the enlighten<lb break="no"/>ment and the arts, the principles and the duties

     And in truth, Mr. SPEAKER, those words were 
     <lb/>
     not too strong to qualify justly the conduct of 
     <lb/>
     the lmperial Government at that period. 
     <lb/>
     Blood had to be shed at St. Denis and St. 
     <lb/>
     Charles, and heads to fall by the axe of the 
     <lb/>
     executioner, before justice could be obtained. 
     <lb/>
     It was only then, when it was found that the 
     <lb/>
     people did not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of 
     <lb/>
     their noblest children, in order to secure their 
     <lb/>
     political rights and liberties, that we re<lb break="no"/>ceived responsible government as we now 
     <lb/>
     enjoy it and as we desire to preserve it. At 
     <lb/>
     the opening of the ensuing Session it was ex<lb break="no"/>pected that the debate on the finances would 
     <lb/>
     be resumed ; but the Governor having separ<lb break="no"/>ated, in the estimates, the civil list from the 
     <lb/>
     other expenses, the supplies were voted. 
     <lb/>

     Thus it was that whenever the struggle for 
     <lb/>
     rights was persevered in, the result was suc<lb break="no"/>cess; and why is it, I ask, that our states<lb break="no"/>men who have struggled since the union to 
     <lb/>
     preserve the Constitution as it is, with such 
     <lb/>
     signall success, now give way to the demands of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada ? Let us, then, maintain 
     <lb/>
     our presentation, the most fruitful in advantages 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     to French-Canadians. The question 
     <lb/>
     of finance had been for some time looked 
     <lb/>
     upon as disposed of, but on DALHOUSIE's re<lb break="no"/>turn the question arose again in a more 
     <lb/>
     threatening form than ever, and the supplies 
     <lb/>
     were refused (1827). The Governor on the 
     <lb/>
     following day prorogued Parliament, insulting 
     <lb/>
     the dignity of the Commons and eulogizing 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council. This act of tyranny 
     <lb/>
     caused great excitement amongst the people. 
     <lb/>
     The press attacked the Government, and in 
     <lb/>
     order to show   the exasperation of men's 
     <lb/>
     minds at the time, I quote an extract from 
     <lb/>
     one of the newspapers of that period :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Canadians, chains are being forged to bind

     The elections resulted favorably for the popu<lb break="no"/>lar party. At the meeting of Parliment, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     PAPINEAU was elected Speaker, but the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor refused to sanction the choice, and told 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Assembly to elect another. 
     <lb/>
     What was the proper course for the House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly to pursue in the face of such con<lb break="no"/>duct? To give way ? No, Mr. SPEAKER; 
     <lb/>
     there were at that time men in our House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly, men who did not shrink from their 
     <lb/>
     duty, nor from the responsibility of their just 
     <lb/>
     opposition On motion of Mr. CUVILLIER 
     <lb/>
     it was resolved that the election of the 
     <lb/>
     Speaker must be made freely and indepen<lb break="no"/>dently of the Governor; that Mr. PAPINEAU 
     <lb/>
     had been so elected; that under the law, no 
     <lb/>
     confirmation was needed, the latter being, 
     <lb/>
     like the presentation, a simple matter of form 
     <lb/>
     and usage. Mr. PAPINEAU having been re<lb break="no"/>instated in the chair, the Governor refused 
     <lb/>
     to approve the selection made, and the same 
     <lb/>
     evening Parliament was dissolved. Thus, 
     <lb/>
     MR SPEAKER, Parliament existed but one 
     <lb/>
     day because the Speaker was a man who 
     <lb/>
     valued his independence too highly to sub<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     mit to the dictates of an ill-advised govern<lb break="no"/>ment. In truth, if these are the 1iberties 
     <lb/>
     we owe to the colonial system, I need not 
     <lb/>
     stop to prove their utter hollowness. The 
     <lb/>
     people understood the position in which it 
     <lb/>
     was sought to place them, and took steps 
     <lb/>
     to repel these fresh attempts at aggres<lb break="no"/>sion. The question created increased agita<lb break="no"/>tion ; public meetings were held in city, town 
     <lb/>
     and country; the speeches made betokened 
     <lb/>
     the disturbed state of the public mind; pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings were taken against the press, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
      WALLER, editor of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Spectateur</hi> of Mont<lb break="no"/>real, was arrested for the second time. Ad<lb break="no"/>dresses, bearing over 80,000 signatures, were 
     <lb/>
     forwarded to England in the hands of Messrs. 
     <lb/>
     NELSON, CUVILLIER and D. B. VIGER. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     GALE took the petition of the partisans of the 
     <lb/>
     oligarchy. A great meeting of the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of the counties of Vercheres, Chambly, Rou<lb break="no"/>ville and St. Hyacinthe was held at St. 
     <lb/>
     Charles ; the people protested energetically 
     <lb/>
     against the existing state of things, and in 
     <lb/>
     fact it was broadly declared that the natural 
     <lb/>
     consequences must be expected to follow upon 
     <lb/>
     so flagrant a violation of the most sacred 
     <lb/>
     rights of the French-Canadians. Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, the Canadian people in the person of 
     <lb/>
     their leaders, at that period traversed the 
     <lb/>
     ocean in order to obtain justice from the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Government, and laid at the foot of the 
     <lb/>
     Throne the protest of 80,000 of our fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen, a people who, in the trying days 
     <lb/>
     of our history, had not hesitated to sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     their lives to maintain British power on this 
     <lb/>
     continent; and once more, in this instance, 
     <lb/>
     when an attempt is made to force upon us a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution we have never asked for and 
     <lb/>
     which the people of Lower Canada energetic<lb break="no"/>ally condemn, the same means of protesting 
     <lb/>
     is open to us, and the Government may rely 
     <lb/>
     upon it that we shall be as firm in defence of 
     <lb/>
     our political rights and liberties as were the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the ople in former days. 
     <lb/>
     Our protest will be, if anything, still more 
     <lb/>
     energetic against the proposed scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation which it is sought to impose on us:

     item, a part only of the supplies. The restric<lb break="no"/>tion was not consented to by those who repre<lb break="no"/>sented the people in the Legislative Assembly. 
     <lb/>
     Such a state of things could not continue with<lb break="no"/>out leading to a collision; and the events of 
     <lb/>
     1837 justified the apprehension of those who 
     <lb/>
     had all along warned the Government that it 
     <lb/>
     was impossible for the people any longer to 
     <lb/>
     endure so flagrant a violation of their rights, 
     <lb/>
     and that there was imminent danger of ex<lb break="no"/>hausting their patience. Events followed 
     <lb/>
     each other rapidly, and the clergy then, as 
     <lb/>
     at this time, were opposed to any energetic 
     <lb/>
     demonstrations. Monseigneur LARTIGUE, 
     <lb/>
     Bishop of Montreal, published a pastoral let<lb break="no"/>ter, in which he said : " Who will dare assert 
     <lb/>
     that the whole people of this country desire 
     <lb/>
     the destruction of the Government?" Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, no one desired it; but the minor<lb break="no"/>ity at that period, like the minority at pres<lb break="no"/>ent, complained of the injustice they suffered, 
     <lb/>
     and the clergy were opposed to them. The 
     <lb/>
     minority of that day struggled for the politi<lb break="no"/>cal rights of the people as they are struggling 
     <lb/>
     now, and they found arrayed against them 
     <lb/>
     every powerful influence and all established 
     <lb/>
     authorities. This contrast points to a fact 
     <lb/>
     deserving of notice. To-day the Government 
     <lb/>
     constantly insult us by crying out: " You 
     <lb/>
     represent nothing in this House; public 
     <lb/>
     opinion is against you! " Well, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, I ask the Hon. Attorney General for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada whether he himself and his 
     <lb/>
     honorable colleague the Prime Minister, had 
     <lb/>
     the majority of the Lower Canada people 
     <lb/>
     and clergy with them when, in 1837, they 
     <lb/>
     protested energetically against the injustice 
     <lb/>
     done to their fellow-countrymen? No, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, at that time they formed part of 
     <lb/>
     the little phalanx who went so far as to raise 
     <lb/>
     the standard of rebellion on the plains of 
     <lb/>
     St. Denis and St. Charles! How times are 
     <lb/>
     changed! At the present moment the same 
     <lb/>
     men, the revolutionists of former days, strain 
     <lb/>
     every nerve to deprive the people of the right 
     <lb/>
     of pronouncing for or against the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional changes sought to be forced upon them. 
     <lb/>
     So complete a forgetfulness of their own past is 
     <lb/>
     extremely deplorable. Mr. SPEAKER, for 
     <lb/>
     weighty reasons, I do not desire to dwell 
     <lb/>
     on the events of 1837. In 1838 there 
     <lb/>
     remained to be brought on the trials of 
     <lb/>
     those who had been implicated in the 
     <lb/>
     troubles. Lord DURHAM found himself 
     <lb/>
     placed in an embarrassing position, for it is 
     <lb/>
     alwa s difficult for a government to carry on 
     <lb/>
    political prosecutions; by such a course it 
     <lb/>frequently loses its strength and its popularity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <cb/>
            <p>
     To escape from the difficulties of the moment, 
     <lb/>
     the Governor resolved to adopt a great measure. 
     <lb/>
      On the day of the coronation of Queen 
     <lb/>
     VICTORIA he proclaimed a general amnesty, 
     <lb/>
     and granted pardon to all the Canadians, ex<lb break="no"/>cept twenty-four of the most earnest of the 
     <lb/>
     revolutionary party. It is important, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, to know who were the twenty-four 
     <lb/>
     daring revolutionists against whom the British 
     <lb/>
     Government displayed so much severity, mid 
     <lb/>
     against whom the clergy had pronounced so 
     <lb/>
     strongly. These men were Messrs. WOLFRED 
     <lb/>
     NELSON, R. S. M. BOUCHETTE, BONAVEN<lb break="no"/>TURE VIGER, SIMEON MMARCHESSAULT, H. 
     <lb/>
     A. GAUVIN, T. H. GODIN, ROD. DESRI<lb break="no"/>VIERES, L. H. MASSON, LOUIS J.PAPINEAU, 
     <lb/>
     C. H. COTE, JULIEN GAGNON, ROBERT NEL<lb break="no"/>SON, E. B. O'CALLAGHAN, ED. ET. RODIER,

     CHARTIER, Ptre., G. ET. CARTIER, J. RYAN, 
     <lb/>
     Jr., Ls. PERRAULT, P. L. DEMARY, J. F. 
     <lb/>
     DAVIGNON, and Ls. GAUTHEIR. Thus, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, among those sanguinary men I 
     <lb/>
     find the Honorable Attorney General for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER). (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Far be from me the thought of re<lb break="no"/>proaching him with his conduct at that period. 
     <lb/>
     I have always looked upon it as that of a 
     <lb/>
     patriot and of a true friend of his country. 
     <lb/>
     Besides, that honorable member has declared 
     <lb/>
     to us on many occasions that he did not regret 
     <lb/>
     the struggles which he had formerly main<lb break="no"/>tained in order to claim the political liberties 
     <lb/>
     of his country, and I can perfectly understand 
     <lb/>
     that he does not waver in those sentiments, 
     <lb/>
     for it is now an historical fact that all those 
     <lb/>
     who took part in those struggles nobly staked 
     <lb/>
     their lives for their convictions, and the min<lb break="no"/>ority then, like the present minority, could 
     <lb/>
     expect nothing but misinterpretation of their 
     <lb/>
     opposition to power. It is not for me to 
     <lb/>
     decide how far this insurrectionary movement 
     <lb/>
     was excited by the deplorable circumstances 
     <lb/>
     of the time, but I am perfectly satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     those who were at the head of it were impelled 
     <lb/>
     by sentiments of patriotism, by the generous 
     <lb/>
     desire of obtaining for their fellow-country<lb break="no"/>men the political liberties which were refused 
     <lb/>
     them. They have therefore laid their coun<lb break="no"/>try under a great debt of gratitude for the 
     <lb/>
     sacrifices which they made. Now see, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER; the men who, twenty years ago, 
     <lb/>
     constituted a revolutionary minority, braved 
     <lb/>
     the clergy and raised the standard of revolt 
     <lb/>
     against Great Britain, are to-day in a ma<lb break="no"/>jority and supported by the powerful influence 
     <lb/>
     of England and of the clergy, whose entire 
     <lb/>
     confidence they possess. They have their 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="619" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0619.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">619</fw>
           
     little entries to Windsor, they fill the highest 
     <lb/>
     and most lucrative oflices in our country, and 
     <lb/>
     are even decorated with the titles with which 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty is used to reward Her most 
     <lb/>
     loyal subjects. To-day, as in 1837, the min<lb break="no"/>ority do not wish to have recourse to the 
     <lb/>
     means furnished by revolutions, after having 
     <lb/>
     exhausted those which the Constitution af<lb break="no"/>fords, but they have an inward conviction 
     <lb/>
     that in twenty years, when the people have 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in appreciating what that minority 
     <lb/>
     is doing for them to-day, they will feel for the 
     <lb/>
     opposition to which it is devoting itself, a sen<lb break="no"/>timent of gratitude, the result of which will 
     <lb/>
     be, that on it they will confer their entire 
     <lb/>
     confidence, after having refused it in the day 
     <lb/>
     of trial. Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, as the minority 
     <lb/>
     of 1837 constitutes the majority of to-day, so 
     <lb/>
     will the present minority constitute the major<lb break="no"/>ity at some day which is more or less near. 
     <lb/>
     I will not, Mr. SPEAKER, follow the victims 
     <lb/>
     of that melancholy period of our history to 
     <lb/>
     the seafold. With their lives they paid the 
     <lb/>
     price of their devotion to the cause of their 
     <lb/>
     country, and if, to make a people deserving of 
     <lb/>
     the rights of existence, life's blood and devo<lb break="no"/>tion are necessary, we have theirs to show 
     <lb/>
     that French Canada freely and nobly sacri<lb break="no"/>ficed her noblest descendants to the genius of 
     <lb/>
     Liberty. (Hear, hear.) But before con<lb break="no"/>cluding this sketch of our struggles, from the 
     <lb/>
     conquest to the melancholy occurrences of 
     <lb/>
     1837-38, it is important to show that it is to 
     <lb/>
     our heroic resistance in the Parliament and to 
     <lb/>
     force of arms that we owe the political liber<lb break="no"/>ties which are secured to us by the present 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. I am unwilling to leave. this 
     <lb/>
     review of the colonial system of England in 
     <lb/>
     Canada without destroying the false impres<lb break="no"/>sion which exists, that that colonial system 
     <lb/>
     was sensibly improved by the liberality of the 
     <lb/>
     news of the statesmen of Great Britain, that 
     <lb/>
     the struggles through which we passed were 
     <lb/>
     owing to the ideas of other days, and that 
     <lb/>
     now all the liberties which we enjoy extend 
     <lb/>
     to all the English colonies, to which the colo<lb break="no"/>nial system of our day secures the advantages 
     <lb/>
     and the benefits of responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     I believe, Mr. SPEAKER, that I shall be able 
     <lb/>
     easily to controvert these erroneous arguments, 
     <lb/>
     and to do so I have only to consider the colo<lb break="no"/>nial system of England at the Mauritius. That 
     <lb/>
     French colony, which is not of such old standing 
     <lb/>
     as ours, and which became a conquest of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, fell under the yoke of Great Britain in 
     <lb/>
     1810. It was then the Isle of France; since 
     <lb/>
     the conquest its name has been changed to 
     <lb/>
     the Island of Mauritius. It contains a pop<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
     
     ulation which is almost entirely French, but 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately for their political rights it has 
     <lb/>
     not, as we have, the advantage of living in 
     <lb/>
     the immediate vicinity of a great republic, 
     <lb/>
     like the United States, serving, so to say, as a 
     <lb/>
     guarantee for the protection of its liberties. 
     <lb/>
     The Isle of France, in consequence of its iso<lb break="no"/>lated position, is precisely in circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which allow of our forming an opinion of what 
     <lb/>
     the pretended liberties of the colonial system 
     <lb/>
     are worth when there is nothing to fear from 
     <lb/>
     the weakness of the colonists or the interven<lb break="no"/>tion of a neighboring power in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     oppressed. Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, we have a 
     <lb/>
     splendid opportunity of judging whether the 
     <lb/>
     colonial system, applied under such circum<lb break="no"/>stances, possesses that liberal character which 
     <lb/>
     is attributed to it. Well, I say it with regret, 
     <lb/>
     we see there, as we saw in Canada, the same 
     <lb/>
     aggressive and tyrannical policy against which 
     <lb/>
     we had to strive for a whole century. The 
     <lb/>
     colonial system gave rise here to deep dissa<lb break="no"/>tisfaction. I shall enumerate the grievances 
     <lb/>
     which are complained of, grievances for which 
     <lb/>
     there is but too great foundation. When the 
     <lb/>
     Isle of France was ceded to England, it was 
     <lb/>
     stipulated, as in the case of Canada, that the 
     <lb/>
     French population should retain the use of 
     <lb/>
     their language and their religious institutions, 
     <lb/>
     together with the laws under which they had 
     <lb/>
     up to that time been governed—three liber<lb break="no"/>ties of great value to the descendants of old 
     <lb/>
     France. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, we shall now 
     <lb/>
     see whether England respected these three 
     <lb/>
     articles of the treaty. I hold in my hand a 
     <lb/>
     correspondence of no older date than the 6th 
     <lb/>
     May, 1862. It is written by a French col<lb break="no"/>onist in the Mauritius, and contains an ac<lb break="no"/>count of the colonial system under which his 
     <lb/>
     countrymen are governed. Before reading 
     <lb/>
     this correspondence, I must premise that the 
     <lb/>
     population of the island consists of two hun<lb break="no"/>dred thousand souls; that population is gov<lb break="no"/>erned by an Executive Council and a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council appointed for life, consisting of 
     <lb/>
     eighteen members, eight of whom are public 
     <lb/>
     officers appointed and paid by the Government 
     <lb/>
     of the colony. The other ten are nearly all of 
     <lb/>
     English origin. Thus the French element in 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council of the Mauritius is in 
     <lb/>
     the proportion of about one to five, although 
     <lb/>
     the population is nearly entirely French :—

     before impartial judges, the acts of a government 
     <lb/>
     which, since 1810, has exercised the most absolute 
     <lb/>
     despotism over us, concealed under the great 
     <lb/>
     name of liberty. We have indeed the liberty of 
     <lb/>
     the press, but it is not listened to. Vain are all 
     <lb/>
     cries; the Government "stop their ears and let 
     <lb/>
     us cry." Then they tell us that we shall never 
     <lb/>
     have a more wise, a more paternal, a more liberal 
     <lb/>
     government. "What would you have more than 
     <lb/>
     the liberty of thinking and writing?" they ask. 
     <lb/>
     What we would have is that the liberty of the 
     <lb/>
     press should be of some use to us; that the 
     <lb/>
     Government should listen to the mouth-pieces of 
     <lb/>
     public opinion; that they should not waste our 
     <lb/>
     funds in spite of the protestations of the press;<ref target="#fn_01">*</ref> 
     <lb/>that they should cause the laws, as they were 
     <lb/>made, to be observed, and by all alike; that 
     <lb/>among other laws, that of quarantine should 
     <lb/>be faithfully observed, and that no exception 
     <lb/>should be made in favor of H. B. M.'s ships 
     <lb/>of war and transports with troops; that more 
     <lb/>attention should be paid to the subject of com<lb break="no"/>munication with the ships arriving from India ; 
     <lb/>that we should be more effectually protected from 
     <lb/>the epidemics which decimate our population; 
     <lb/>that the cholera should be prevented from becom<lb break="no"/>ing endemic in the country, so that the French 
     <lb/>and Creole population of the Mauritius may be 
     <lb/>preserved ; that enquiry should be made as to the 
     <lb/>causes which may have brought the cholera upon 
     <lb/>us; that insufficient laws may be revised; that 
     <lb/>our reserves should be kept at home instead of 
     <lb/>being lent to the Mother Country or to other 
     <lb/>colonies; that our treaty of capitulation should 
     <lb/>be respected; that no attempt should be made to 
     <lb/>introduce here English laws, when it is agreed 
     <lb/>that by the French codes only are we to be 
     <lb/>governed; that the use of the French language, 
     <lb/>of which we have been deprived in defiance of  
     <lb/>sworn faith, should be restored to us; that no 
     <lb/>flagrant injustice should be committed in favor of 
     <lb/>the English and to the detriment of the Creoles; 
     <lb/>that the latter may be appointed to the different 
     <lb/>offices, and that these should not be conferred on 
     <lb/>incapable favorites ; we would have the Legislative 
     <lb/>Council and self-government, &amp;c., &amp;c. This is 
     <lb/>what we would have. You see that we wish for 
     <lb/>a great many things. But are they not all just 
     <lb/>and reasonable? Let us now proceed to the 
     <lb/>enumeration of some of them, and, in chronologi<lb break="no"/>cal order let us begin with the French language. 
     <lb/>The deed of capitulation, signed in 1810 by the 
     <lb/>representatives of France and England, contained 
     <lb/>the following articles, which we, the conquered 
     <lb/>people, imposed on our conquerors:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>
     1st. Respect for our religion.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2nd. The maintenance of our laws. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3rd. The guarantee that we should be allowed 
     <lb/>
     to speak French. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, of these three principal articles (inscribed 
     <lb/>
            
           
            <cb/>
           
     in large characters in our deed of capitulation, 
     <lb/>
     accepted and promised under the faith of an oath, 
     <lb/>
     signed and approved by England), one has been 
     <lb/>
     already violated, and the work of undermining 
     <lb/>
     another is going on! Setting at naught all 
     <lb/>
     scruples, the English Government first robbed us 
     <lb/>
     of the use of the French language before the high 
     <lb/>
     courts of justice. We have expressed our claim, 
     <lb/>
     but a deaf ear has been turned to them. This 
     <lb/>
     first step taken, what bounds will be set to this 
     <lb/>
    great work of destruction of all that we hold from 
     <lb/>France? On the application of a few English, the 
     <lb/>revisal of our code is already being considered; 
     <lb/>and when the whole population apply to the 
     <lb/>Mother Country for the revocation of an order 
     <lb/>which renders the transaction of business impos<lb break="no"/>sible, without the very costly intervention of legal 
     <lb/>men and translators, and which, moreover, inflicts 
     <lb/>a deep wound on the Creole heart, they are told 
     <lb/>to hold their tongues! When they loudly call for 
     <lb/>the revision of insufficient laws which facilitate 
     <lb/>the propagation of mephitic miasmata they are 
     <lb/>not listened to! When they demand an enquiry 
     <lb/>into the circumstances which have caused the 
     <lb/>introduction into their midst of the cruel epidemic, 
     <lb/>which for more than four months has carried 
     <lb/>death into their ranks, they are told that they are 
     <lb/>indulging in idle fancies! At the same time, and 
     <lb/>as though to turn the public mind from this fixed 
     <lb/>idea, there is a semblance of bringing up a ques<lb break="no"/>tion already decided upon and voted—that relat<lb break="no"/>ing to railways! Another grievance. Whilst 
     <lb/>the epidemic is raging among us, and whilst our 
     <lb/>municipality stands in need of money for the 
     <lb/>relief of the poor classes, the Government has 
     <lb/>none to lend, because the financial reserves of the 
     <lb/>colony are lent to the Cape, to India, to Ceylon, 
     <lb/>and to the Mother Country itself. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, the Mauritius, which, 
     <lb/>
     by the terms of her treaty of capitulation, 
     <lb/>
     was to have preserved to her the use of her 
     <lb/>
     language, her peculiar institutions and her 
     <lb/>
     laws, has soon found herself deprived of the 
     <lb/>
     use of her language; her laws have been 
     <lb/>
     changed, and her institutions have been sub<lb break="no"/>jected to oppression. This, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     is the sort of liberty which a French colony 
     <lb/>
     may enjoy under the colonial system of 
     <lb/>
     England, when the colony is weak and is not 
     <lb/>
     situated, as Canada is, in the vicinity of a 
     <lb/>
     powerful republic such as the United States. 
     <lb/>
     I think, Mr. SPEAKER, that I have now 
     <lb/>
     shewn what has ever been the spirit of an<lb break="no"/>tagonism between the two races of English 
     <lb/>
     and French origin, on the two continents, 
     <lb/>
     and what has been the spirit of aggression 
     <lb/>
     of the English element against our popula<lb break="no"/>tion, from the founding of the colony up to 
     <lb/>
     our own time; we have seen colonial fanati<lb break="no"/>cism attacking our institutions, our language 
     <lb/>
     and our laws, and we have seen that our 
     <lb/>
     annihilation as a race has been the evident 
     <lb/>
               <note xml:id="fn_01">   * This demand is in fact perfectly just, as of the 
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
                  French; but the single English journal on the 
                  <lb/>
                  island was always right, in opposition to the four 
                  <lb/>

     object of those constant efforts. Can we 
     <lb/>
     to-day believe that the case is otherwise; 
     <lb/>
     and ought not the unanimity of the English 
     <lb/>
     element in favor of Confederation to fill us 
     <lb/>
     with terror? Is not our loss concealed under 
     <lb/>
     this outward. semblance of conciliation? 
     <lb/>
     Yes, let us consult the history of our country 
     <lb/>
     before effecting so radical a change in our 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. Let us remember with terror 
     <lb/>
     the strife and antagonism which prevailed in 
     <lb/>
     days gone by, and let us endeavor to judge 
     <lb/>
     with certainty what will be the necessary 
     <lb/>
     consequences of a constitutional change of 
     <lb/>
     such serious importance as that which is 
     <lb/>
     proposed to us. Let us now consider, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, the disastrous consequences of the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. The members of the Government 
     <lb/>
     have told us that Confederation would 
     <lb/>
     constitute us a military power of the 
     <lb/>
     first class, and would enable us to resist 
     <lb/>
     the aggressions of the American Union. 
     <lb/>
     The defence of our frontier is certainly a 
     <lb/>
     question of the highest importance, for no 
     <lb/>
     one is unaware that our relations with our 
     <lb/>
     neighbors are in a position of extreme ten<lb break="no"/>sion. They have established a passport 
     <lb/>
     system, the sole object of which is to hamper 
     <lb/>
     our trade. A resolution has been adopted 
     <lb/>
     by Congress, almost unanimously, for the 
     <lb/>
     repeal of the treaty of reciprocity which 
     <lb/>
     exists between the two countries. In a few 
     <lb/>
     months the waters of our lakes will be 
     <lb/>
     ploughed by vessels of war, the armaments 
     <lb/>
     of which can only be directed against Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Such, Mr. SPEAKER, is the position of the 
     <lb/>
     United States with respect to us, and to meet 
     <lb/>
     this danger the Government proposes to form 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation which will, they tell us, 
     <lb/>
     constitute a first class power, able to 
     <lb/>
     maintain on this continent the supremacy of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain. But will the object proposed 
     <lb/>
     be attained? Shall we be stronger under 
     <lb/>
     Confederation than we are now? Cannot 
     <lb/>
     the Governor General of the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America raise troops through<lb break="no"/>out the whole extent of the provinces placed 
     <lb/>
     under his jurisdiction? Is not the militia 
     <lb/>
     of all those provinces under his immediate 
     <lb/>
     command? We are told, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation will give us a more uni<lb break="no"/>form military organization than that which 
     <lb/>
     we now possess But there is nothing to 
     <lb/>
     prevent the formation of that organization 
     <lb/>
     under the present Constitution, and I have 
     <lb/>
     no hesitation in saying that under that Con<lb break="no"/>stitution the several provinces will defend 
     <lb/>
     themselves to better advantage than under 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     Confederation. Is it not precisely by creating 
     <lb/>
     here a military power, hostile to the adjoining 
     <lb/>
     powerlul republic, that we shall bring on war 
     <lb/>
     and its attendant calamities? The moment 
     <lb/>
     the United States perceive in this Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation an organization, the object of which is 
     <lb/>
     the establishing of the balance of power in 
     <lb/>
     America, they will not wait until our forti<lb break="no"/>fications are constructed, or until the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial railway is built, but they will attack 
     <lb/>
     us at once. On another hand, we offer 
     <lb/>
     defiance to the American republic by creating 
     <lb/>
     here a political organization which is contrary 
     <lb/>
     to the principles of the democratic govern<lb break="no"/>ment which prevails there, and contrary to 
     <lb/>
     the famous Monroe doctrine, which, as is 
     <lb/>
     well known, is opposed to the establishment 
     <lb/>
     of monarchical governments on this continent. 
     <lb/>
     The plan of the present Government is, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, to establish here a political system 
     <lb/>
     which is essentially hostile to the United 
     <lb/>
     States, as it will be essentially monarchical, 
     <lb/>
     and instead of proving to us a means of 
     <lb/>
     defence, it can entail nothing but war and 
     <lb/>
     the disastrous consequences attendant upon 
     <lb/>
     it. To promote the security and prosperity 
     <lb/>
     of our country, the Government, instead of 
     <lb/>
     bleeding the people as they propose to do, to 
     <lb/>
     erect here and there ruinously expensive, 
     <lb/>
     and after all insufficient fortifications, ought 
     <lb/>
     to apply the revenues of the treasury to the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of new industries, the improve<lb break="no"/>ment of our public highways, and the 
     <lb/>
     colonization of our wild lands. These inex<lb break="no"/>haustible sources of wealth, if wisely managed, 
     <lb/>
     would double our numbers, our revenue and 
     <lb/>
     our power, and would in that way confer upon 
     <lb/>
     us means of defence much more effective 
     <lb/>
     than those which we should receive from 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, which would crush the people 
     <lb/>
     under taxes imposed to meet the expense 
     <lb/>
     of imperfectly defending our frontier. And 
     <lb/>
     is it supposed for a moment that when we 
     <lb/>
     have in so urgent a manner decreed the 
     <lb/>
     fortification of our frontier, the arming of 
     <lb/>
     our militiamen, and the establishment of a 
     <lb/>
     fleet on our inland seas, that the United 
     <lb/>
     States will do the same and that they will 
     <lb/>
     follow the example set them of such ruinous 
     <lb/>
     folly? Is it supposed that the American 
     <lb/>
     statesmen will not immediately perceive, as 
     <lb/>
     we are desirous of raising ourselves up as an 
     <lb/>
     enemy on their frontier, and of entailing upon 
     <lb/>
     them an enormous outlay in order to hold us 
     <lb/>
     in check, that it will be for them a mere 
     <lb/>
     question of economy to attack us now and to 
     <lb/>
     take possession of the country, before it is in 
     <lb/>
     our power to oblige them to keep up that 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="622" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0622.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">622</fw>
         
     ruinously expensive war footing? And what 
     <lb/>
     could we do against an invading army of two 
     <lb/>
     or three hundred thousand men, with our 
     <lb/>
     treasury exhausted by the fortifications, and 
     <lb/>
     with hardly any assistance from England, 
     <lb/>
     whose policy at this moment is anti-colonial? 
     <lb/>
     I cannot understand how, in face of the danger 
     <lb/>
     which is impending over us, and for which 
     <lb/>
     we are so little prepared, the Government 
     <lb/>
     can thus cast defiance in the teeth of 
     <lb/>
     the powerful nation who are adjacent to 
     <lb/>
     us, and whose armies now in the field 
     <lb/>
     could set at naught any resistance to 
     <lb/>
     immediate invasion. I assert it positively, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, the United States have not 
     <lb/>
     the least intention of attacking us, so long as 
     <lb/>
     we remain peaceable spectators of their fra<lb break="no"/>tricidal struggle, and so long as we continue 
     <lb/>
     to confine ourselves to peaceful occupations. 
     <lb/>
     But if, on the contrary, we create here a 
     <lb/>
     hostile military power, if we establish here 
     <lb/>
     the throne of a viceroy or of a foreign mon<lb break="no"/>arch, in defiance of the principles which form 
     <lb/>
     the groundwork upon which rests the politi<lb break="no"/>cal system of the United States, we may then 
     <lb/>
     rest assured that the neighbouring republic 
     <lb/>
     will sweep away that monarchical organiza<lb break="no"/>tion, established in rivalry to its own demo<lb break="no"/>cratic system. (Hear, hear.) Such, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, is the question in its most serious 
     <lb/>
     aspect. I shall not enlarge upon the details 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme of Confederation, which have 
     <lb/>
     been so ably criticised by the hon. members 
     <lb/>
     who have preceded me; and besides I shall 
     <lb/>
     have an opportunity of discussing them 
     <lb/>
     when the amendments to the scheme are 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the House. But I may now 
     <lb/>
     say that those details cannot be accepted by 
     <lb/>
     the people. We have already received nu<lb break="no"/>merous petitions praying for the rejection of 
     <lb/>
     the measure, and those petitions continue to 
     <lb/>
     reach us every day. Now, I ask you. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, what the sentiments of the people 
     <lb/>
     will be if that scheme is adopted, and if in 
     <lb/>
     the course of two months it is returned to 
     <lb/>
     us from England, after having received the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of the Imperial Parliament, without 
     <lb/>
     its having been possible for us to alter the 
     <lb/>
     most trifling of its details? Is it supposed, 
     <lb/>
     after a Constitution shall have been forced 
     <lb/>
     on the French-Canadians, which they have 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the utmost, that they will be 
     <lb/>
     very enthusiastic in the defence of that Con<lb break="no"/>stitution which shall have deprived them of 
     <lb/>
     a part of the political rights which they en<lb break="no"/>joyed? And, it cannot be denied, by adopt<lb break="no"/>ing the proposed Confederation, we yield up 
     <lb/>some of the privileges which we now enjoy; 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     have not our Ministers themselves told us 
     <lb/>
    that under the pressure of the demands of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada it was necessaryto make con<lb break="no"/>cessions at the Quebec Conference, in order 
     <lb/>to ensure the adoption of the present scheme? 
     <lb/>The hostile majority of Upper Canada have 
     <lb/>obtained representation based on population, 
     <lb/>against which Lower Canada has so 
     <lb/>energetically struggled for fifteen years, 
     <lb/>because she saw in that concession the 
     <lb/>annihilation of our influence as a race. 
     <lb/>Under these circumstances, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>is it supposed that reliance is to be placed 
     <lb/>on the assistance of the French—Canadians, 
     <lb/>who were formerly so terrible in the attack, 
     <lb/>and who fought, without hesitation, one 
     <lb/>against ten, a proportion in which we shall 
     <lb/>again find ourselves opposed to the Americans 
     <lb/>in the probable event of a war? To hope 
     <lb/>that they will fight with the same impulse 
     <lb/>now, when they are being deprived of the 
     <lb/>surest guarantees of their natural existence 
     <lb/>and of their most sacred political rights, is 
     <lb/>greatly to deceive ourselves, and to betray 
     <lb/>ignorance of what has always been the cause 
     <lb/>of their heroism in the conflict. Under the 
     <lb/>Constitution as it is, they would again fight 
     <lb/>with similar courage, regardless of numbers, 
     <lb/>because they love that Constitution which 
     <lb/>secures to them all that they hold most dear, 
     <lb/>and because they wish to preserve it. Under 
     <lb/>Confederation, on the contrary, we have 
     <lb/>nothing left to defend; our influence as a 
     <lb/>race is gone, and sooner than be absorbed in 
     <lb/>a Confederation, the existence of which will 
     <lb/>prove a source of constant strife without 
     <lb/>bringing with it compensating advantages, 
     <lb/>the people dissatisfied will seek other and 
     <lb/>more advantageous political and commercial 
     <lb/>alliances, and for this reason it is that I 
     <lb/>consider that the scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>will lead us directly to annexation to the 
     <lb/>United States. When the commissioners 
     <lb/>from the North and the South recently had 
     <lb/>an interview in order to decide the possible 
     <lb/>conditions of an honorable peace, one of the 
     <lb/>three propositions submitted by the North 
     <lb/>was to the effect that the two armies should 
     <lb/>not be disbanded after the cessation of 
     <lb/>hostilities, but should be united for the 
     <lb/>purpose of carrying on a foreign war. Now, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, what does the expression, 
     <lb/>"foreign war," when used by the United 
     <lb/>States, mean, except war upon Canada? 
     <lb/>And what could the fifty battalions which 
     <lb/>England could send us do against the com<lb break="no"/>bined armies of the North and the South, 
     <lb/>the strength of which amounts to a million of 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="623" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0623.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">623</fw>
          
     men ? Situated at a distance of a thousand 
     <lb/>
     leagues from us, Great Britain, with all her 
     <lb/>
     material of war and our militia, could not 
     <lb/>
     defend Canada against so powerful an enemy, 
     <lb/>
     except at the cost of the greatest sacrifices. 
     <lb/>
     It is not, therefore, at a time when we are 
     <lb/>
     placed in such great straits, that we should 
     <lb/>
     exclaim loudly that we do not fear the struggle, 
     <lb/>
     and that we are ready to measure our strength 
     <lb/>
     against that of the States of the American 
     <lb/>
     Union. It is equally absurd to give umbrage 
     <lb/>
     to their institutions by creating beside them 
     <lb/>
     a political organisation to which they are 
     <lb/>
     fundamentally opposed. Is it believed that 
     <lb/>
     our monarchical pretensions and our threats 
     <lb/>
     are of a nature to intimidate the American 
     <lb/>
     statesmen? In their eyes we are but pig<lb break="no"/>mies hurling threats at giants. Let the 
     <lb/>
     war come with the Constitution as it is, and 
     <lb/>
     we shall find a hundred thousand volunteers 
     <lb/>
     ready to defend our frontier. But if the 
     <lb/>
     Government impose on the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians the scheme of Confederation, from 
     <lb/>
     which they have so much fear, and which 
     <lb/>
     may prove to be productive of the most 
     <lb/>
     disastrous consequences to their institutions, 
     <lb/>
     their language and their laws, then, I am 
     <lb/>
     bound to say, there will be hesitation in our 
     <lb/>
     ranks at the time when every man will be 
     <lb/>
     marching towards almost certain death for 
     <lb/>
     the defence of a flag which will no longer 
     <lb/>
     confer upon our race the guarantees of protec<lb break="no"/>tion which it to-day secures to us. I say, then, 
     <lb/>
     that the time is ill-chosen to make such 
     <lb/>
     serious changes, and to lay the foundation 
     <lb/>
     of an Empire the existence of which, threat<lb break="no"/>ened both from the interior and from the 
     <lb/>
     exterior, will be of but a few days' duration. 
     <lb/>
     For with dissatisfaction among the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians, deprived of their rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges, it is impossible for England 
     <lb/>
     to maintain her power here against three 
     <lb/>
     hundred thousand men invading our terri<lb break="no"/>tory at ten different points along our fron<lb break="no"/>tier. The wisest policy which we can 
     <lb/>
     pursue, at this critical moment, is therefore 
     <lb/>
     remain peaceable spectators of the strug<lb break="no"/>gle between our neighbors, to open our 
     <lb/>forests to colonisation, to turn to account 
     <lb/>our mines and water-powers, to clear our 
     <lb/>wild lands, and to labor without ceasing to 
     <lb/>to recall our unfortunate countrymen who 
     <lb/>are now scattered over American soil. Let 
     <lb/>us construct railways, let us double our 
     <lb/>manufacturing industry, let us enlarge our 
     <lb/>canals, let us extend our network of rail<lb break="no"/>ways to the Maritime Provinces; and when 
     <lb/>we have attained great proportions as a peo<lb break="no"/>
          

    
            <cb/>
          
     ple, when our prosperity shall have increased 
     <lb/>
    fivefold, and, above all, when the terrible 
     <lb/>hurricane which threatens to destroy every<lb break="no"/>thing in North America shall have termi<lb break="no"/>nated its work of ruin, and finally when 
     <lb/>we shall be strong enough to protect 
     <lb/>ourselves from external attacks, and the 
     <lb/>French-Canadians especially shall have ob<lb break="no"/>tained sufficient power to have nearly 
     <lb/>equality of representation in the General 
     <lb/>Parliament, it will be time enough to lay 
     <lb/>the foundation of a great Confederation of 
     <lb/>the British North American Provinces, 
     <lb/>based on the protective principle of the 
     <lb/>sovereignty of the states. Under these 
     <lb/>circumstances Confederation will produce 
     <lb/>abundant fruits, and will be welcomed by 
     <lb/>the people of this country, and especially by 
     <lb/>the French-Canadians, who, having doubled 
     <lb/>in number in .the interval, will be in a 
     <lb/>position to demand infinitely more advan<lb break="no"/>tageous conditions than those which are 
     <lb/>forced upon them to-day. We shall not then 
     <lb/>have our present political rights, which were 
     <lb/>so dearly obtained by the struggles of a 
     <lb/>century, replaced by local governments, 
     <lb/>which will be nothing more than municipal 
     <lb/>councils, vested with small and absurd 
     <lb/>powers, unworthy of a free people, which 
     <lb/>allow us at most the control of our roads, 
     <lb/>our schools and our lands ; but we shall 
     <lb/>then obtain local governments based on the 
     <lb/>sovereignty of states, as is the case under the 
     <lb/>Constitution of the United States. The 
     <lb/>fact is not to be denied: the American 
     <lb/>Constitution was created by great men in 
     <lb/>face of a crowd of considerable and op<lb break="no"/>posite local interests, and it cost them 
     <lb/>several years of deep study to reconcile 
     <lb/>these various interests, and finally to build 
     <lb/>up that admirable Constitution which, as the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Brome has so well said, 
     <lb/>defies the most severe criticism in relation to 
     <lb/>its most important bases. With a Consti<lb break="no"/>tution like that of the United States, based 
     <lb/>upon state sovereignty, Lower Canada 
     <lb/>would elect her own governor and her 
     <lb/>representatives in the Federal Parliament 
     <lb/>and Legislative Council, and also all the 
     <lb/>Executive Ministers.

     pointed by the people, but by the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive branch of the local government, in 
     <lb/>
     precisely the same way as in Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     that they are in every respect as upright 
     <lb/>
     and as distinguished as our own judges. 
     <lb/>
     If our French-Canadian Ministers had not 
     <lb/>
     been in so powerless a minority in the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference (four to thirty-two), they 
     <lb/>
     would certainly not have accepted a scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation so fraught with danger to the 
     <lb/>
     French race as that which has been submitted 
     <lb/>
     to us. They would have obtained more 
     <lb/>
     favorable conditions than those which are 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon us, among which is the 
     <lb/>
     appointment  for life of the legislative 
     <lb/>
     councillors, by the Executive branch of the 
     <lb/>
     General Legislature. For my part, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I am not in favor of the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment for life of men taken from the crowd 
     <lb/>
     to be converted into the instruments of 
     <lb/>
     oppression, and ten often to serve to cast 
     <lb/>
     impediments in the way of the most import<lb break="no"/>ant liberties and rights of the peeple. The 
     <lb/>
     appointment for life of the legislative 
     <lb/>
     councillors by a majority which is hostile 
     <lb/>
     to our race is as dangerous to-day as it was 
     <lb/>
     in the most evil days of our history, and to 
     <lb/>
     accept it is to place our most precious liber<lb break="no"/>ties at the mercy of the enemies of our race. 
     <lb/>
     With such provisions in the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     which it is proposed to force upon us, it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible that the French element should 
     <lb/>
     be protected in the Legislative Council. It 
     <lb/>
     is equally impossible that the aggressive 
     <lb/>
     tendencies, of which I gave an historical 
     <lb/>
     sketch in the first part of my remarks, will 
     <lb/>
     not produce their effect in the Federal Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive, when the question of the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of those members is being settled. 
     <lb/>
     We have been told, " The French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     section will resign if the Federal Executive 
     <lb/>
     attempt to practice injustice to the detriment 
     <lb/>
     of their fellow countrymen." Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I would willingly believe that 
     <lb/>
     they would resign, and that no successors 
     <lb/>
     could be found for them, which is still more 
     <lb/>
     improbable, and I should like to know to 
     <lb/>
     what such a resignation would lead, and 
     <lb/>
     what sort of a remedy it would provide for 
     <lb/>
     our humiliating position. We shall have 
     <lb/>
     forty-eight members in the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment against one hundred and forty of 
     <lb/>
     English origin ; in other words, we shall be 
     <lb/>
     in the proportion of one to four. What 
     <lb/>
     could so weak a minority do to obtain justice? 
     <lb/>
     Evidently the resignation of the French 
     <lb/>
     section would make it still more powerless, 
     <lb/>
    and it would have to accept the tyrannical  
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
        
     dictates of its opponents. The French 
     <lb/>
     members of the present Government them<lb break="no"/>selves give as the ground of the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     the proposed changes, the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     existing Constitution does not afford us suf<lb break="no"/>ficient guarantees. But then, what sort of 
     <lb/>
     guarantees shall we have under the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation which it is proposed to force upon us and 
     <lb/>
     under which we shall be in a minority twice 
     <lb/>
     as great? Let us suppose the very probable 
     <lb/>
     contingency of a collision between our Local 
     <lb/>
     Legislature and the Federal Government, in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of the rejection of a measure 
     <lb/>
     passed by the Province of Lower Canada and 
     <lb/>
     thrown out by the General Parliament ; in 
     <lb/>
     what position shall we be? Let us remember 
     <lb/>
     that the Federal Executive appoints the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, presides over the crim<lb break="no"/>inal legislation of the country, and appoints 
     <lb/>
     the judges who administer it ; in a word, that 
     <lb/>
     in the Federal Government are vested all 
     <lb/>
     sovereign powers, to the exclusion of the 
     <lb/>
     local governments. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     say without hesitation that in the case of a 
     <lb/>
     collision, we shall find ourselves completely 
     <lb/>
     at the mercy of the hostile Federal majority, 
     <lb/>
     and that it may oppress us, assimilate our 
     <lb/>
     laws, suspend our judges, arm the militia 
     <lb/>
     against us, and send us to the scaffold or into 
     <lb/>
     exile in any way they may think proper, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding our protestations and those of 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadian minority in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. Such has already been found 
     <lb/>
     to occur; the past is there to prove the fact, 
     <lb/>
     and everything leads us to believe that the 
     <lb/>
     same attempts at fanatical aggression will be 
     <lb/>
     renewed in our day, if the scheme of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration is adopted. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brome, whose loyalty will cer<lb break="no"/>tainly not be called in question, himself 
     <lb/>
     declared in this House that this scheme 
     <lb/>
     would give rise to difficulties and entail 
     <lb/>
     deplorable collisions. Supposing, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, that those collisions and difficulties arise, 
     <lb/>
     what shall we do ? Will not all power be in 
     <lb/>
    the hands of the Federal Government and of 
     <lb/>a hostile majority? Is it not because the 
     <lb/>people understand it that they reject this 
     <lb/>measure with threats on their lips and in 
     <lb/>their eyes ; that every day they send us 
     <lb/>numerous petitions in which they prophesy 
     <lb/>the most serious dissatisfaction? How long 
     <lb/>will the eyes and the ears of the members of 
     <lb/>this House remain closed, that they may not 
     <lb/>be cognisant of this protest of their alarmed 
     <lb/>fellow-countrymen? The Hon. Atty. Gen. 
     <lb/>East himself refuses to communicate to us a 
     <lb/>single one of the details of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="625" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0625.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">625</fw>
         
     Confederation, and he would have us give up 
     <lb/>
     all the rights which the existing Constitution 
     <lb/>
     confers upon us, by voting in favor of a Local 
     <lb/>
     Legislature of which the powers will be 
     <lb/>
     naught, and of a General Parliament in which 
     <lb/>
     we shall be in the proportion of one to four. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, it is not surprising that the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian population of Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada is unanimous in rejecting a Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion which presents to us so gloomy a future— 
     <lb/>
     (hear, hear)—and I do not fear to declare 
     <lb/>
     that our Ministers are committing an act of 
     <lb/>
     very great imprudence in forcing upon the 
     <lb/>
     people constitutional changes of so serious a 
     <lb/>
     character, and so loudly denounced as an 
     <lb/>
     attack on their rights and their privileges. 
     <lb/>
     Never, at any period of our history, have 
     <lb/>
     there been seen such changes of constitu<lb break="no"/>tion under such extraordinary circumstances. 
     <lb/>
     And exactly at the moment when we are 
     <lb/>
     preparing to resist the invading army of a 
     <lb/>
    powerful neighbor, we are deprived of the 
     <lb/>liberties which we enjoy after having secured 
     <lb/>them by a century of struggles. But it 
     <lb/>seems to me that new guarantees of security 
     <lb/>ought rather to be given us, in order to in<lb break="no"/>duce us to fight with warlike antagonists 
     <lb/>ten times more numerous than ourselves, and 
     <lb/>whose political organization is perhaps less 
     <lb/>hostile to our race than the proposed Con<lb break="no"/>federation. Have not the present Ministry 
     <lb/>taught us to look upon the semblance of 
     <lb/>local government, which they propose to us, 
     <lb/>as a sufficient protection for all that we hold 
     <lb/>most dear, and to accept the position of a 
     <lb/>powerless minority in the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, because commercial interests only 
     <lb/>will be brought in question there? If this 
     <lb/>proposition is a just one, the Constitution of 
     <lb/>the United States, with the recognized sove<lb break="no"/>reignty of Lower Canada, affords much 
     <lb/>greater security for our institutions, our lan<lb break="no"/>guage and our laws. For the sovereignty of 
     <lb/>the state implies their preservation in the 
     <lb/>state, which yields up nothing to the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government except a very restricted 
     <lb/>number of powers. Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, in 
     <lb/>proposing a change of Constitution the Min<lb break="no"/>istry have committed a serious fault, and 
     <lb/>they have no right to endeavor to prevent 
     <lb/>the people of this province from examining 
     <lb/>the question of possible changes in all its 
     <lb/>bearings. Scarcely six months ago the 
     <lb/>French-Canadians lived happily, relying 
     <lb/>upon the security given them by the exist<lb break="no"/>ing Constitution. Now such can hardly be 
     <lb/>the case, when the proposed changes threaten 
     <lb/>their existence as a race. Impose these 
     <lb/>
          
    
            <cb/>
            
     changes upon them, and then let danger 
     <lb/>
     come, and England will find out, but too 
     <lb/>
     late, that her most loyal subjects are lost to 
     <lb/>
     her. Our people will have learned that 
     <lb/>
     of two evils they must choose the least, 
     <lb/>
     and that on a comparison between Con<lb break="no"/>federation and annexation, the least evil 
     <lb/>
     will not, unfortunately, he found to be Con<lb break="no"/>federation. Before marching on to certain 
     <lb/>
     slaughter, the soldier will ask himself for 
     <lb/>
     what he is going to fight, and whether the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution which he is going to defend is 
     <lb/>
     worth the sacrifice of his life's blood. The 
     <lb/>
     day upon which the French-Canadian soldier 
     <lb/>
     puts this question to himself, will be the last 
     <lb/>
     day of the English power in America. I hope 
     <lb/>
     I may be mistaken, Mr. SPEAKER, and I 
     <lb/>
     would wish to believe that the views of the 
     <lb/>
     Government are sounder than mine, at a 
     <lb/>
     time when they propose a measure so full of 
     <lb/>
     danger as that which is submitted to us. I 
     <lb/>
     would wish to believe, above all, that they 
     <lb/>
     have no intention of skilfully leading us into 
     <lb/>
     a collision with our neighbors, which would 
     <lb/>
     tend to carry us directly into annexation, and 
     <lb/>
     would strike a mortal blow at English 
     <lb/>
     domination on this continent. I shall con<lb break="no"/>clude, Mr. SPEAKER, by summing up my 
     <lb/>
     remarks. The union of the two Canadas 
     <lb/>
     has not yet done all its work. There is  
     <lb/>
     still room for progress under it, and it must 
     <lb/>
     be continued. The Hon. Attorney General for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) main<lb break="no"/>tains on the contrary that it has no longer 
     <lb/>
     any grounds of existence, and that we must 
     <lb/>
     have a new political organization. Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I venture to hold an opinion differ<lb break="no"/>ent from that of the hon. member for Mon<lb break="no"/>treal East, and I have no hesitation in say<lb break="no"/>ing that under the union we can yet double 
     <lb/>
     our prosperity and our numbers, if we intro<lb break="no"/>duce into the administration of affairs a little 
     <lb/>
     less party spirit and a little more patriotism. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I say, further, that the demand 
     <lb/>
     for representation based on population has 
     <lb/>
     no cause of existence, that it was repudiated 
     <lb/>
     by Upper Canada, at first by the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive party, and afterwards by the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party under the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration. When we have seen the most 
     <lb/>
     energetic and most since partisans of 
     <lb/>
     representation based on population abandon 
     <lb/>
     that principal basis of their politics, and 
     <lb/>
     make of it, in their government, a question 
     <lb/>
     against which they engaged to vote, I say 
     <lb/>
     that it is very wrong to use it as one of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons to compel us to accept the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation. That cry, raised by fan<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="626" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0626.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">626</fw> 
    
     aticism in the west, will naturally be stifled 
     <lb/>
     by the more rapid increase of the population 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada and the annual diminution 
     <lb/>
     of immigration. With the assistance .of 
     <lb/>
     these two causes our population will, in 
     <lb/>
     ten years, equal that of Upper Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     say, Mr. SPEAKER, that the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation is not expedient. But even if 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of Confederation was expedient, 
     <lb/>
     I maintain that the object of it is hostile. 
     <lb/>
     I gave an historical sketch of the encroach<lb break="no"/>ing spirit of the English race on the two 
     <lb/>
     continents. I pointed out the incessant 
     <lb/>
     antagonism existing between it and the 
     <lb/>
     French race. Our past recalled to us the 
     <lb/>
     constant struggle which we had to keep up 
     <lb/>
     in order to resist the aggression and the 
     <lb/>
     exclusiveness of the English element in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It was only through heroic resist<lb break="no"/>ance and a happy combination of circum<lb break="no"/>stances that we succeeded in obtaining the 
     <lb/>
     political rights which are secured to us by 
     <lb/>
     the present Constitution. The scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation has no other object than to 
     <lb/>
     deprive us of the most precious of those 
     <lb/>
     rights, by substituting for them a political 
     <lb/>
     organization which is eminently hostile to 
     <lb/>
     us. The hostility of the scheme of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration being admitted, I maintain that its 
     <lb/>
     adoption will entail the most disastrous 
     <lb/>
     consequences. To impose upon the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians this new Constitution, which they 
     <lb/>
     do not want, is to tempt their anger and to 
     <lb/>
     expose ourselves to deplorable collisions. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It must necessarily be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to them before it is adopted : if they 
     <lb/>
     accept it, then will be the time to send it to 
     <lb/>
     England to be sanctioned. But the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and especially the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral East, cannot ignore the petitions which 
     <lb/>
     are presented to us against the scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     especially so imposing a petition as that from 
     <lb/>
     the city of Montreal, which contains 6,000 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian signatures, and which is the 
     <lb/>
     most numerously signed petition which has 
     <lb/>
     ever been presented to our legislature by a 
     <lb/>
     city. I say, further, that those who vote for 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of Confederation take the shortest 
     <lb/>
     way to lead us into annexation to the United 
     <lb/>
     States. I am not the first to express this opi<lb break="no"/>nion; several hon. members from Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada have expressed it before me within the 
     <lb/>
     precincts of this House, and it is because 
     <lb/>
     those members from Upper Canada desire 
     <lb/>
     annexation to the United States that they 
     <lb/>
     vote in favor of the scheme of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. members from the west, whose 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
           
     words are so loyal, will be the first to pass 
     <lb/>
     over to the enemy with arms and baggage, 
     <lb/>
     should an invading army ever appear on 
     <lb/>
     the frontier. Such, Mr. SPEAKER, is the 
     <lb/>
     position as it is. If His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor General thinks he ought to follow 
     <lb/>
     the advice of those who look to Washington, 
     <lb/>
     let him even do so; but I think it is high 
     <lb/>
     time to speak plainly here, and to warn him 
     <lb/>
     of the danger. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I am not an old man with one foot already 
     <lb/>
     in the grave, and on the verge of eternity, 
     <lb/>
     and I adopt my course in view of the future. 
     <lb/>
     Our Ministers, who, in the course of a long 
     <lb/>
     career, have exhausted the supply of honor 
     <lb/>
     and of dignity in our country, are perhaps 
     <lb/>
     tempted to risk the future of their country 
     <lb/>
     for titles, honors and larger salaries under 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, perhaps for the sake of being 
     <lb/>
     governor of one of the Federated Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     We know that England nobly and royally 
     <lb/>
     rewards those who serve her without scruple. 
     <lb/>
     Besides, the prospect of founding a vast 
     <lb/>
     empire is well worth the sacrifice of some 
     <lb/>
     months of a worn out career, at the risk of 
     <lb/>
     not succeeding entirely in so gigantic a pro<lb break="no"/>ject. (Hear, hear.) But for my part, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I who belong to the coming 
     <lb/>
     generation, and who have twenty years of 
     <lb/>
     future before me, cannot approve, by my 
     <lb/>
     vote, of a scheme of Constitution which pre<lb break="no"/>sents itself to us in such a gloomy perspective 
     <lb/>
     as regards our nationality, and all that we 
     <lb/>
     hold most dear as Frenchmen. If I am thus 
     <lb/>
     severe in my remarks, Mr. SPEAKER, I hope 
     <lb/>
     it will be understood that they proceed from 
     <lb/>
     profound conviction; and it is well known 
     <lb/>
     that those who have honey on their lips are 
     <lb/>
     not always the most sincere at heart. I 
     <lb/>
     know also that sometimes those who state 
     <lb/>
     boldly what they think pay very dearly for 
     <lb/>
     their boldness and independence, but no 
     <lb/>
     dread of this, Mr. SPEAKER, shall ever 
     <lb/>
     cause me to shrink from expressing my con<lb break="no"/>victions, when I consider that my doing so 
     <lb/>
     may be of any use to my country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and prolonged Opposition cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Cries of "Adjourn, adjourn! " from the

     Opposition.

     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. MR. CARTIER</persName> — No, no! Call 
     <lb/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. A. A. DORION</persName> said he had moved 
     <lb/>
     the adjournment of the debate last evening, 
     <lb/>
     to have an opportunity of replying to the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Montmorency (Hon. Mr.

     CAUCHON). But as that honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man was not in his place in the afternoon, he 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="627" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0627.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">627</fw>
           
     had yielded the floor to the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Richelieu Mr. PERRAULT). The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montmorency, he ob<lb break="no"/>served, was still out of the House, and he 
     <lb/>
     should like to defer his remarks till the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman should be in his seat. (Cries

     of "Adjourn," and "Go on.")

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName> then rose to address 
     <lb/>
     the House. He said— If the House will 
     <lb/>
     permit me, I shall relieve the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION). It 
     <lb/>
     is not surprising to me, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
     <lb/>
     there should be this hanging back on the part 
     <lb/>
     of honorable members with regard to express<lb break="no"/>ing their views on this subject, as so much 
     <lb/>
     has been said about it, that it is now, I won't 
     <lb/>
     say thoroughly, but very nearly worn out. 
     <lb/>
     And for my own part, in common, I suppose, 
     <lb/>
     with all who will have to speak at this stage 
     <lb/>
     of the debate, I feel reluctant to trespass on 
     <lb/>
     the time of the House. At the same time, 
     <lb/>
     I cannot properly call it a trespass, but 
     <lb/>
     must rather consider it a duty. On a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of this very great importance, involving 
     <lb/>
     the interests of so large a portion of this con<lb break="no"/>tinent, I think it behoves most of us to ex<lb break="no"/>press our opinions with the best ability that 
     <lb/>
     we can bring to the subject. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We have had this question discussed from so 
     <lb/>
     many points of view, and, I presume, by the 
     <lb/>
     ablest men who occupy public positions in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, that a humble individual like myself 
     <lb/>
     must feel great diffidence in saying another 
     <lb/>
     word on the subject. But it is no small en<lb break="no"/>couragement to know—at any rate I feel it to 
     <lb/>
     be an encouragement in speaking in advocacy 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme—that I am in such good com<lb break="no"/>pany, that the leading men in this province, 
     <lb/>
     the leading men in the British Provinces gen<lb break="no"/>erally, and I may even say the leading men in 
     <lb/>
     the British Empire, are all agreed as to the 
     <lb/>
     desirableness of what is now proposed, and as 
     <lb/>
     to the wisdom which has been displayed in 
     <lb/>
     the framing of the scheme now submitted for 
     <lb/>
     our adoption. 1 do not expect to say anything 
     <lb/>
     new, and the fear of repeating what has already 
     <lb/>
     been said makes me reluctant to say anything 
     <lb/>
     at all; and were I to consult my own feelings, 
     <lb/>
     I have no doubt I should be silent, and would 
     <lb/>
     rise only when you call on us, Mr. SPEAKER, to 
     <lb/>
     give our votes either for or against the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions in your hand. I think every honor<lb break="no"/>able member who has spoken in this debate 
     <lb/>
     has expressed his sense of the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     resting upon him, when addressing the House 
     <lb/>
     and the country on a matter of such vast im<lb break="no"/>portance to us all. I feel equally with others 
     <lb/>how great is this responsibility, and have en<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
            deavoured to bring the best powers of my 
     <lb/>
     mind to the consideration of the question. 
     <lb/>
     The more we consider it, the more we look 
     <lb/>
     into the future in connection with our present 
     <lb/>
     movement, the larger the importance, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     it must assume in our minds. It not only 
     <lb/>
     affects the interests of Canada, but of all the 
     <lb/>
     British Provinces of this continent. Its pro<lb break="no"/>bable results will materially affect the future, 
     <lb/>
     both of the British Empire and of the neigh<lb break="no"/>bouring republic, and, therefore, more or less 
     <lb/>
     the future of the world at large. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that I am using language at all exagger<lb break="no"/>ated. From the best consideration I have 
     <lb/>
     been able to give to this subject, I believe 
     <lb/>
     there are under-lying the question now before 
     <lb/>
     us principles of the greatest importance to 
     <lb/>
     the world. I believe there are principles in<lb break="no"/>volved in our present action that must very 
     <lb/>
     much determine the character of the institu<lb break="no"/>tions that will generally prevail. The im<lb break="no"/>pression upon my own mind is, that if suc<lb break="no"/>cessful, we shall give greater stability and a 
     <lb/>
     more permanent foothold to the principles that 
     <lb/>
     obtain in the British Constitution; but that 
     <lb/>
     failing in our present object, we shall see the 
     <lb/>
     decadence of these principles on this contin<lb break="no"/>ent, and the advance of those principles which 
     <lb/>
     obtain in the neighbouring republic. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The more I consider it, the stronger 
     <lb/>
     am I of the opinion, that at the present time 
     <lb/>
     the principles of democracy and of monarch<lb break="no"/>ism—if I may so express it—are at stake; 
     <lb/>
     and, considering it in this view, I look upon 
     <lb/>
     the scheme before us as calling for the most 
     <lb/>
     cordial and earnest support of every man who 
     <lb/>
     has learned to value the stability, the mo<lb break="no"/>deration, and the justice which have cha<lb break="no"/>racterized the British nation as compared 
     <lb/>
     with any other nation that exists on the 
     <lb/>
     face of the globe. The great question 
     <lb/>
     before us is that of union—a practicable 
     <lb/>
     and attainable union—a union of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces owning allegiance to the same Crown, 
     <lb/>
     possessing, generally, similar institutions, 
     <lb/>
     similar systems of government, the same lan<lb break="no"/>guage, the same laws, the same dangers, the 
     <lb/>
     same enemies. Our institutions are generally 
     <lb/>
     similar, although, no doubt, from having been 
     <lb/>
     isolated for so great a length of time, and 
     <lb/>
     having had no intercourse one with the other 
     <lb/>
     to speak of, there is an idiosyncracy attached 
     <lb/>
     to each of the provinces as they now exist, 
     <lb/>
     and the longer we remain separate the greater 
     <lb/>
     the divergence must be, and the more difficult 
     <lb/>
     union between us will be of accomplishment. 
     <lb/>
     The advocates of this scheme propose the 
     <lb/>
     union of all these provinces. It is a trite 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="628" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0628.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">628</fw>
           
     proverb that " union is strength, and division 
     <lb/>
     is weakness." So universally accepted is this 
     <lb/>
     statement, that no man can venture to deny 
     <lb/>
     its correctness. And I feel, as an advocate 
     <lb/>
     of union, that our position is one which is 
     <lb/>
     unassailable, and the arguments must indeed 
     <lb/>
     be strong which would convince me that we 
     <lb/>
     are not going in the right direction when 
     <lb/>
     moving towards union and consolidation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Apart from the intrinsic force 
     <lb/>
     and power of union, which would be in itself 
     <lb/>
     sufficient to call us in that direction, Canada 
     <lb/>
     has special reasons for desiring that the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish provinces should draw together more 
     <lb/>
     closely than they have yet done. By such a 
     <lb/>
     step we may remove one great cause of our 
     <lb/>
     own political difficulties. I do not think that 
     <lb/>
     this is at all a necessary part of the argument 
     <lb/>
     for our uniting together. But it so happens 
     <lb/>
     that by our union we hope to remove these 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, and that is an additional argument 
     <lb/>
     for union, although not at all necessary to 
     <lb/>
     induce the adoption of the scheme. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that if we had no difficulties whatever in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, if we were perfectly satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     our political position, union would still be 
     <lb/>
     desirable on the broad ground of the advan<lb break="no"/>tages we would derive from it. But, in addi<lb break="no"/>tion to those advantages, and the force and 
     <lb/>
     strength which union will give us, it will assist 
     <lb/>
     us in surmounting and removing those great 
     <lb/>
     difficulties under which we labor; and it is a 
     <lb/>
     most happy circumstance that, while we are 
     <lb/>
     carrying out a principle so excellent in itself, 
     <lb/>
     we are at the same time enabled to remove 
     <lb/>
     difficulties which might prove most disastrous 
     <lb/>
     to our prospects. And, in addition to these 
     <lb/>
     reasons, we have evidently the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country for the success of this scheme. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) No one can with reason ques<lb break="no"/>tion the reception which the scheme has met 
     <lb/>
     with from the press and from men of all shades 
     <lb/>
     of political opinion in the Mother Country. 
     <lb/>
     It has met with universal approbation there. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There has been no jealousy 
     <lb/>
     of it that I know of. There has not pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded from any quarter one word of disap<lb break="no"/>probation or of doubt as to the prudence and 
     <lb/>
     the wisdom which have dictated our advances 
     <lb/>
     towards union. The good wishes of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain are thoroughly with us. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) An additional reason, I may say 
     <lb/>
     necessity, for union exists in the hostility of 
     <lb/>
     the United States so palpably manifested 
     <lb/>
     during the past few months. In fact, sir, 
     <lb/>
     looking at all our interests—our interests 
     <lb/>
     socially and commercially—our interests of 
     <lb/>
     defence—our internal harmony—our very 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     existence as an independent people—all 
     <lb/>
     bid us go forward in the direction of 
     <lb/>
     union. I shall allude but briefly to the poli<lb break="no"/>tical difficulties of Canada, as this part of 
     <lb/>
     the subject has been most ably handled by 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen who have preceeded me. 
     <lb/>
     Our difficulties, I had fancied, were palpable 
     <lb/>
    to all, and yet we have heard honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who are opposed to the scheme-almost 
     <lb/>ignoring their existence, or treating them as 
     <lb/>though they did not weigh in the scale of the 
     <lb/>arguments on this question at all. I am sorry 
     <lb/>my hon. friend from Brome (Mr. DUNKIN) 
     <lb/>is not here, as I will have to refer to some of 
     <lb/>his remarks. That honorable gentleman, as 
     <lb/>well as others, intimated to the House that 
     <lb/>our difficulties had disappeared; that since 
     <lb/>1862 Upper Canada had been satisfied with her 
     <lb/>position ; that agitation had been laid aside; 
     <lb/>that there was no more mention of any sense of 
     <lb/>injustice on the part of Upper Canada. This 
     <lb/>line of remark only shews me how ignorant 
     <lb/>those honorable gentlemen were of the subject 
     <lb/>on which they were speaking; how entirely 
     <lb/>they had remained in the dark as to the feelings 
     <lb/>which existed in the minds of the people of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada; manifesting a degree of 
     <lb/>ignorance on one very important feature of our 
     <lb/>position, that rendered them to a great degree 
     <lb/>incompetent to deal with this question. From 
     <lb/>much that I have heard relative to the cause 
     <lb/>of the dissatisfaction known to prevail in 
     <lb/>Upper Canada, I think it well not to be alto<lb break="no"/>gether silent about it. We must look deeper 
     <lb/>than the displeasure felt and manifested at the 
     <lb/>passing of certain measures obnoxious to the 
     <lb/>majority of that section, or at the unjust 
     <lb/>principle of an equal distribution of the public 
     <lb/>revenues between the two sections. It is true 
     <lb/>that these tended to draw attention to, and 
     <lb/>make more prominent the real cause of 
     <lb/>discontent. It lay deep in the chafing of the 
     <lb/>minds of men whose national characteristic is 
     <lb/>impatience of intolerance and injustice. It 
     <lb/>dwelt in the abiding sense of the unfair posi<lb break="no"/>tion that the terms of the union of 1840 now 
     <lb/>imposed upon them, and obeying their national 
     <lb/>instincts, they could never cease to insist upon 
     <lb/>a representative reform. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>suppose there are no people on the earth who 
     <lb/>feel more strongly or who will resist more 
     <lb/>determinedly the perpetration and continu<lb break="no"/>ance of any injustice. It was that sense of 
     <lb/>injustice, weighing heavily on the minds of 
     <lb/>the people of Upper Canada, that rendered 
     <lb/>our position one of difficulty and of danger so 
     <lb/>long as relief was denied them. I have been 
     <lb/>surprised, therefore, to hear the statement 
     <lb/>


    
            <pb n="629" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0629.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">629</fw>
     
     which has been made by some hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in this House, that the feelings of dissatisfac<lb break="no"/>tion which existed in Upper Canada have 
     <lb/>
     disappeared. The formation of the MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD-SICOTTE Government has been men<lb break="no"/>tioned as a proof that we have become indif<lb break="no"/>ferent to the question of representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, which had been so repeatedly and 
     <lb/>
     so strongly urged, and that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada were quite willing, for the sake 
     <lb/>
     of some small material advantages, to cast 
     <lb/>
     aside that for which they had been agitating 
     <lb/>
     for so many years. In opposition to this, I 
     <lb/>
     must state that there was the strongest dis<lb break="no"/>approbation felt and expressed throughout 
     <lb/>
    Upper Canada at the formation of that Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The only excuse made for it was, 
     <lb/>that it was simply a provisional government, 
     <lb/>and that its formation was nothing more than 
     <lb/>a temporary measure. I would not hesitate 
     <lb/>or fear to appeal to any constituency in Upper 
     <lb/>Canada, where the question of representation 
     <lb/>by population had been agitated, and ask them 
     <lb/>to say whether they did not cherish the 
     <lb/>strongest feelings of disapprobation that that 
     <lb/>question should have been ignored at the time 
     <lb/>of the formation of that Government.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—In alluding to this 
     <lb/>
     matter, I would wish to guard myself against 
     <lb/>
     rousing anything like party questions or party 
     <lb/>
     feelings. (Hear, hear.) I desire, in dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the important subject now under debate, 
     <lb/>
     to remember that the question before us now 
     <lb/>
     is not who was right or who was wrong in 
     <lb/>
     1862 or 1863. The question is, are we right 
     <lb/>
     in advancing towards union, or are we making 
     <lb/>
     a great mistake; but where it is necessary for 
     <lb/>
     me to allude to the course pursued by either 
     <lb/>
     party, it is for the purpose of argument alone, 
     <lb/>
     and not in any way to raise the question who 
     <lb/>
     was right or who to blame. I stated, sir, that 
     <lb/>
     there was the strongest disapprobation—I 
     <lb/>
     might more correctly say disappointment— 
     <lb/>
     felt in Upper Canada that the question of 
     <lb/>
     representation by population should have 
     <lb/>
     been laid aside by the MACDONALD—SICOTTE 
     <lb/>
     Government. I felt as strongly as any 
     <lb/>
     man could have done the unfortunate posi<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
         
     tion in which we were then placed; but 
     <lb/>
     giving it the best consideration I could, and 
     <lb/>
     believing that a change of government was 
     <lb/>
     desirable under almost any circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     I most unwillingly consented. I believed 
     <lb/>
     nothing else could have been done at the 
     <lb/>
     time. It was the opinion of most, though 
     <lb/>
     not of all, with whom I then acted—we might 
     <lb/>
     have been wrong, that is not the question. 
     <lb/>
     Believing, therefore, that we could not then 
     <lb/>
     secure the success of the measure for which 
     <lb/>
     we had been agitating and which we had been 
     <lb/>
     seeking, we thought it necessary to form and 
     <lb/>
     acknowledge and support a provisional gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, for I do say that the Government 
     <lb/>
     then formed was in my estimation, and in the 
     <lb/>
     estimation of Upper Canada generally, a pro<lb break="no"/>visional government—nothing more; a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment which was simply tolerated, and 
     <lb/>
     which could not possibly exist for any length 
     <lb/>
     of time. It was a government formed for a 
     <lb/>
     certain purpose, and Upper Canada sanctioned 
     <lb/>
     it only because of that purpose, which was 
     <lb/>
     regarded at the time as of primary import<lb break="no"/>ance. He knows little of the mind of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada who sees in it any indifference to the 
     <lb/>
     question of parliamentary reform. It was a 
     <lb/>
     position that neither party has anything to 
     <lb/>
     boast of ; the apparent inconsistency of the 
     <lb/>
     one resulted from the felt misgovernment of 
     <lb/>
     the other. It is no small pleasure to be able 
     <lb/>
     cordially and consistently to act with honora<lb break="no"/>ble gentlemen whom I strongly opposed be<lb break="no"/>fore, and I so acted because I thought it my 
     <lb/>
     duty under the circumstances so to do.— 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Well, sir, how long did this 
     <lb/>
     provisional government last ? Within one 
     <lb/>
     year it was defeated, and before it could shew 
     <lb/>
     itself to Upper Canada, there was an entire 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction of the Cabinet—and why? Be<lb break="no"/>cause the principal measure which Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada had demanded was lost sight of. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Hear! hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—There can be no 
     <lb/>
     stronger evidence of this fact, than that it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary to bring into the Cabinet men who 
     <lb/>
     truly represented the views and wishes of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, and men also in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada who were thought to be more friendly to 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada demands. Had that govern<lb break="no"/>ment, without reconstruction, gone to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, where would they have been? Had 
     <lb/>
     they gone to Upper Canada as they were, and 
     <lb/>
     without admitting other elements into the 
     <lb/>
     Cabinet, they would have met with a very 
     <lb/>
     general hostility. The Premier himself was 
     <lb/>
     made fully aware of this, and he wisely bowed 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="630" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0630.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">630</fw>
     
     to the wishes of Upper Canada. There can<lb break="no"/>not, therefore, be a stronger evidence than 
     <lb/>
     this of the fact that the question of reform in 
     <lb/>
     the representation was not laid aside, neither 
     <lb/>
     had it lost one iota of its importance in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of the great majority of the western 
     <lb/>
     section. The Government that had ventured 
     <lb/>
     to lay it aside was virtually swept away, and 
     <lb/>
     another formed who made it an open question. 
     <lb/>
     This, sir, lies at the very foundation of our 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. It has been the source of our 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, and no doubt would have continued 
     <lb/>
     to be, had no remedy been provided. I have 
     <lb/>
     said before on another occasion, and I repeat 
     <lb/>
     it, that the minds of men in Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     were filled with foreboding as to the future. 
     <lb/>
     They feared that Lower Canada would resist 
     <lb/>
     their demands; they feared that Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada would continue to deny to them what 
     <lb/>
     appeared to them to be palpably just and 
     <lb/>
     right, and what the end of it all would be 
     <lb/>
     they did not know. I confess that I shared 
     <lb/>
     this feeling in common with others; and it 
     <lb/>
     was a matter of common conversation that 
     <lb/>
     things could not continue as they were; that 
     <lb/>
     it was impossible for Upper Canada, with her 
     <lb/>
     superiority in numbers and in wealth, to 
     <lb/>
     consent to remain in the united Legislature 
     <lb/>
     in the inferior position she then occupied. If 
     <lb/>
     the attempt had been persisted in to deny to 
     <lb/>
     that section what was so reasonable and just, no 
     <lb/>
     man could have foretold the serious difficulties 
     <lb/>
     which might have followed. Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men from Lower Canada, who have expressed 
     <lb/>
     an opinion that this question had ceased to 
     <lb/>
     be considered as of importance in the west, 
     <lb/>
     manifest a very great ignorance of the char<lb break="no"/>acter, the feelings and the intentions of the 
     <lb/>
     men they had to deal with. My hon friend 
     <lb/>
     from Brome was one of those who wished to 
     <lb/>
     make light of our present difficulties. He 
     <lb/>
     said, towards the close of his speech, that it 
     <lb/>
     only needed a little patience, that very little 
     <lb/>
     was wanted to make everything quite smooth. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, even he was obliged to admit that 
     <lb/>
     a slight measure of parliamentary reform 
     <lb/>
     was necessary in order to remove the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties by which we were surrounded, and 
     <lb/>
     he evidently intimated his willingness to 
     <lb/>
     concede it. And there have been hints 
     <lb/>
     thrown out by certain Liberal members from 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada that it would not be such an 
     <lb/>
     impossible thing, if we would give up this 
     <lb/>
     scheme of union, for Upper Canada to ob<lb break="no"/>tain her right position, and what she has so 
     <lb/>
     justly claimed. But if this be their feeling, 
     <lb/>
     I ask them why they did not come boldly 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
           
     out before and avow it? I would ask my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Brome—and I regret ex<lb break="no"/>tremely that he is not in his place—why did 
     <lb/>
     he not, in 1862, speak of concessions to 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, instead of, by vote and by 
     <lb/>
     argument, do his best to convince us that 
     <lb/>
     we could expect no relief from him 
     <lb/>
     and from those acting with him, from 
     <lb/>
     the same section. Very different language 
     <lb/>
     is now used by Lower Canada members of 
     <lb/>
     all shades of opinion, to that we have been 
     <lb/>
     accustomed to hear. Those who now admit 
     <lb/>
     the justice of the demands of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and yet in time past have resisted them, 
     <lb/>
     ought to be the last to oppose this scheme, 
     <lb/>
     which settles the difficulty on a basis accepted 
     <lb/>
     by all. The honorable member for Brome 
     <lb/>
     and the British members from Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     who resisted the reform asked for, ought to 
     <lb/>
     be foremost in supporting the scheme before 
     <lb/>
     us; and I am sorry to find that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend appears to me to occupy a very 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent position. Had he always 
     <lb/>
     advocated parliamentary reform, he might 
     <lb/>
     with consistency have opposed the proposed 
     <lb/>
     union. In some such position, and even in 
     <lb/>
     a stronger point of view, do the French 
     <lb/>
     Liberal members appear to be. They were 
     <lb/>
     the professed allies of the Reform party in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, and were, of course, aware 
     <lb/>
     that no reform government could stand that 
     <lb/>
     did not deal with the representation question. 
     <lb/>
     Now, it appears to me, sir, that the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     French party have been singularly untrue 
     <lb/>
     to their Upper Canada allies—— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> (ironically)—Hear!

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—I repeat, sir, that the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal French members have pursued a 
     <lb/>
     course that if continued in, could only have 
     <lb/>
     terminated as it has done. I speak of what 
     <lb/>
     has come under my own observation since 
     <lb/>
     1862. A new Parliament had been convened. 
     <lb/>
     The question of representative reform had 
     <lb/>
     attained great prominence. The Reform 
     <lb/>
     party had spoken distinctly on that question. 
     <lb/>
     Had their Lower Canada allies contemplated 
     <lb/>
     a continuance of the alliance, we might 
     <lb/>
     suppose that they would have forborne 
     <lb/>
     raising unnecessary difficulties. But, sir, 
     <lb/>
     what was the course pursued? It will be 
     <lb/>
     remembered that an amendment to the ad<lb break="no"/>dress was moved, asserting that the principle 
     <lb/>
     of equal representation was essential to the 
     <lb/>
     union. This was a gratuitous though most 
     <lb/>
     significant expression of the divergence that 
     <lb/>
     was inevitable. This was made more palpa<lb break="no"/>
          
            <pb n="631" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0631.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">631</fw>
          
     ble still, when, at the formation of the 
     <lb/>
     MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government, the Re<lb break="no"/>form party were obliged to pay, as a price 
     <lb/>
     for their alliance, the surrender of the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple most prominent in their political creed. 
     <lb/>
     An alliance based upon such terms could not 
     <lb/>
     possibly last. And what must we think 
     <lb/>
     when we hear hon. gentlemen intimating 
     <lb/>
    that this principle might now be conceded? 
     <lb/>Had the same principles been then enunciat<lb break="no"/>ed, had a bold, straightforward course been 
     <lb/>adopted by the Liberal members of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, they might now be occupying the po<lb break="no"/>sition of settling our very serious difficulties. 
     <lb/>I have alluded, sir, to the wishes of the 
     <lb/>Mother Country relative to the movement 
     <lb/>upon which we have entered, and I assert 
     <lb/>that the feeling there is one of universal 
     <lb/>approbation. Still, so much has been said 
     <lb/>relative to the opinions existing in the 
     <lb/>Mother Country as to the connection with 
     <lb/>her colonial dependencies, and especially 
     <lb/>with those in British America, that I think 
     <lb/>it right to remark on this branch of the sub<lb break="no"/>ject rather more fully than I should other<lb break="no"/>wise have done, for I feel the great impor<lb break="no"/>tance ot it. I know of nothing that would 
     <lb/>so much tend to discourage the people of 
     <lb/>this country as that an impression should go 
     <lb/>abroad that the Mother Country was intend<lb break="no"/>ing to cast us adrift—to sever the connection. 
     <lb/>I have no doubt myself, sir, that did such an 
     <lb/>opinion really exist in the Mother Country, 
     <lb/>and were it to be carried into effect at the 
     <lb/>present time, or within any short period of 
     <lb/>time, the only alternative—I fear, the only 
     <lb/>alternative—would be our annexation to the 
     <lb/>United States. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, 
     <lb/>I feel it to be of great importance that no 
     <lb/>doubt should exist in the minds of the people 
     <lb/>of this country relative to the feelings enter<lb break="no"/>tained towards us at home. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>the member for Brome dwelt at considerable 
     <lb/>length on the subject. He expressed, and I 
     <lb/>am quite sure he entertains the strongest 
     <lb/>desire for the perpetuation of this connec<lb break="no"/>tion; yet it did seem to me that he dwelt 
     <lb/>with peculiar satisfaction upon every word 
     <lb/>he could extract from speeches and pam<lb break="no"/>phlets, which appeared to him to point to a 
     <lb/>desire to sever that connection, and I cannot 
     <lb/>but remember that he was frequently cheered 
     <lb/>with " Hear, hears " corresponding with the 
     <lb/>sentiments he expressed. The remarks made 
     <lb/>by the hon. member from Brome were, to my 
     <lb/>mind, most extraordinary. The deductions 
     <lb/>he drew from the speeches of certain noble<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
           
           men and gentlemen in the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, were so directly opposite to what 
     <lb/>
     appeared to me the design and tendency of 
     <lb/>
     those speeches, that I cannot account for it 
     <lb/>
     in any other way, than by presuming that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend was not in his usual health, 
     <lb/>
     and that his mind did not possess that degree 
     <lb/>
     of clearness which he generally brings to 
     <lb/>
     bear on every subject he investigates. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It seemed to me that 
     <lb/>
     he looked at everything relating to 
     <lb/>
     this question through a distorted medium. 
     <lb/>
     I listened with the greatest pleasure to the 
     <lb/>
     dissection the hon. gentleman made of these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, and to the microscopic analysis 
     <lb/>
     to which he subjected the smallest part of 
     <lb/>
     their provisions. It shewed the great acute<lb break="no"/>ness of his observation, as well as the large 
     <lb/>
     and extended information of his mind. But 
     <lb/>
     I could not help feeling that he was looking 
     <lb/>
     at this subject through the discoloured lens 
     <lb/>
     of a powerfully microscopic mind. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) I have no doubt whatever that this 
     <lb/>
     also was the impression made by his speech 
     <lb/>
     on other hon. gentlemen. His talents 
     <lb/>
     and his ability I fully recognize, and 
     <lb/>
     I have no doubt that every hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     listened, equally with myself, with pleasure 
     <lb/>
     to what I may call the excruciating dissec<lb break="no"/>tion to which he submitted these important 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     But I must at the same time say that the 
     <lb/>
     result of all his analysis, and the summing 
     <lb/>
     up of all his observations, only proved to me 
     <lb/>
     that the ground on which the advocates of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme stand is well nigh immovable 
     <lb/>
     and unassailable, and convinced me of the 
     <lb/>
     smallness of the objections which have yet 
     <lb/>
     been urged against it. Of course my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Brome, considering the tempera<lb break="no"/>ment of his mind, dwelt at length and with 
     <lb/>
     much force upon the article which lately 
     <lb/>
     appeared in the<hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. I must 
     <lb/>
     acknowledge that in that article there are 
     <lb/>
     passages of extreme offensiveness, such as I 
     <lb/>
     regret to see in any British publication, and 
     <lb/>
     which were uncalled for and imprudent. 
     <lb/>
     If I thought that the article reflected 
     <lb/>
     the views of either of the parties now divid<lb break="no"/>ing the political world in Great Britain, I 
     <lb/>
     should indeed say that our connection with 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country was precarious, and that 
     <lb/>
     it behoved us to ask with pertinacity what 
     <lb/>
     really was the intention of the statesmen 
     <lb/>
     and the people at home with regard to us. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, we have happily the most conclu<lb break="no"/>sive evidence that could be afforded, that 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="632" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0632.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">632</fw>

     that article does not represent the views of 
     <lb/>
     either of the great parties in the British 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. It may be the mind of a few 
     <lb/>
     isolated individuals; it may represent what 
     <lb/>
     is called the Manchester School ; and I am 
     <lb/>
     not surprised at all that they should utter 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of that character. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the Manchester School, being in a measure 
     <lb/>
     republican in their political tendencies, 
     <lb/>
     would not be sorry to see us joining the 
     <lb/>
     great republic to the south, and that it 
     <lb/>
     would not be a matter for much sorrow to 
     <lb/>
     them to see us forsaking our allegiance to the 
     <lb/>
     British Crown, and joining our fortunes 
     <lb/>
     with those of our neighbors. It behoves us 
     <lb/>
     to see if there are not some grounds of 
     <lb/>
     complaint—if there is not some reason 
     <lb/>
     why the Manchester School should wish to 
     <lb/>
     get rid of us. It has been well observed that 
     <lb/>
     the remarks made upon us by our enemies 
     <lb/>
     are generally more valuable than those 
     <lb/>
     emanating from our friends. We cannot 
     <lb/>
     very well afford to despise the opinions 
     <lb/>
     of our enemies, and we would do well to 
     <lb/>
     consider, if we desire to perpetuate the 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Mother Country, whether 
     <lb/>
     we cannot consistently with our interest 
     <lb/>
     and honor conciliate every party in Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. Believing as I do that our in<lb break="no"/>dependence and prosperity depend upon 
     <lb/>
     preserving the connection with the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, I would be willing to remove 
     <lb/>
     every just cause of complaint which may 
     <lb/>
     be found to exist. I believe, further, that 
     <lb/>
     no man should take part in the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of these provinces who is not alive to 
     <lb/>
     the importance of this question. And what 
     <lb/>
     is the ground of complaint made by those 
     <lb/>
     who hold loosely the connection of the 
     <lb/>
     colonies with the Crown? The complaint 
     <lb/>
     is that they are taxed with our defence, 
     <lb/>
     while we tax the industry of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, and go directly in opposition to 
     <lb/>
     the policy adopted by that country ; and 
     <lb/>
     surely there is some force and truth in this 
     <lb/>
     complaint. There is no doubt that, as we 
     <lb/>
     are growing in wealth and numbers, these 
     <lb/>
     men feel it as an oppression that they should 
     <lb/>
     continue to be taxed as heavily in order to 
     <lb/>
     provide means for our defence, and especi<lb break="no"/>ally as, in times past, we have done so little 
     <lb/>
     ourselves in that direction. As from year 
     <lb/>
     to year, or decade to decade, we grow in 
     <lb/>
     numbers and wealth, we ought to consider, 
     <lb/>
     if we value the connection, in what manner 
     <lb/>
     we can relieve the Mother Country of the 
     <lb/>
     expenses entailed upon her for our defence. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     I also hold that, in so far as our financial 
     <lb/>
     position admits of it, we should seek to 
     <lb/>
     adapt and assimilate our financial policy to 
     <lb/>
     that of Great Britain. If we would continue 
     <lb/>
     an integral part of that country, we ought 
     <lb/>
     not to have high tariffs intervening as so 
     <lb/>
     many barriers to that commercial intercourse 
     <lb/>
     which should exist between the two coun<lb break="no"/>tries, for these must be provocative of 
     <lb/>
     soreness and dissatisfaction. I am, however, 
     <lb/>
     well aware that there are circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which, at the present time, do not admit of 
     <lb/>
     such a commercial policy with the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country. I merely say we ought constantly 
     <lb/>
     to keep the matter in view, and that those 
     <lb/>
     who desire to maintain the connection 
     <lb/>
     should consider it their duty to decrease the 
     <lb/>
     tariff as much as it can be done with justice 
     <lb/>
     to our own position, and thus remove the 
     <lb/>
     great cause of complaint on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     people at home. (Hear, hear.) I have 
     <lb/>
     alluded, sir, to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> and 
     <lb/>
     to the extreme offensiveness of some of its 
     <lb/>
     passages referring to the colonies. But at 
     <lb/>
     the same time, there are sentiments en<lb break="no"/>unciated in the very same article, which 
     <lb/>
     seem to me to contradict the drift of the 
     <lb/>
     article itself. As we have heard so much 
     <lb/>
     of this article, and as it has been made the 
     <lb/>
     ground on which to base the supposition 
     <lb/>
     that there is a growing desire in England to 
     <lb/>
     bring to an end her connection with the 
     <lb/>
     colonies, I beg to call the attention of hon. 
     <lb/>
    gentlemen to this suggestive paragraph, as 
     <lb/>I find it in the same article :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The people of England have no desire to snap 
     <lb/>
     asunder abruptly the slender links which still 
     <lb/>
     unite them with their transatlantic fellow-sub<lb break="no"/>jects, or to shorten by a single hour the duration 
     <lb/>
     of their common citizenship. On the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     by strenghtening the ties which still remain, they 
     <lb/>
     would convert into a dignified alliance an un<lb break="no"/>dignified, because unreal, subserviency. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     This is a remarkable passage to find in such 
     <lb/>
     an article, because, as I said before, the 
     <lb/>
     whole drift of the article seems to imply a 
     <lb/>
     desire on the part of the writer to see the 
     <lb/>
     connection severed ; and yet, while express<lb break="no"/>ing this sentiment, he says there is no 
     <lb/>
     desire to shorten by a single hour the dur<lb break="no"/>ation of our common citizenship! Why, 
     <lb/>
     this article which has been made so much of, 
     <lb/>
     which has been dwelt upon so forcibly, and 
     <lb/>
     which has been sent forth to the country as 
     <lb/>
     indicative of the future policy of England— 
     <lb/>
     I say this very article has strong language

     <lb/>
     as I have stated it to be. I do not mean to 
     <lb/>
     say that there are not apparently contradic<lb break="no"/>tory sentiments therein expressed—senti<lb break="no"/>ments which are absolutely and altogether 
     <lb/>
     contradictory. To resume my argument, it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that if we evinced a desire to 
     <lb/>
     remove the existing causes of complaint, 
     <lb/>
     even the Manchester School, even such men 
     <lb/>
     as GOLDWIN SMITH, would not be unwilling 
     <lb/>
     to see the connection between these provinces 
     <lb/>
     and the Mother Country continue. My 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend the member for Brome, 
     <lb/>
     not only alluded to this article in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh Review</hi>, but he thought there were 
     <lb/>
     speeches uttered by certain noblemen and 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen in their places in the British 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, from which, looking at them 
     <lb/>
     through his discolored lens, he could extract 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of a similar character. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman would admit nothing whatever in 
     <lb/>
     favor of this scheme, and seemed determined 
     <lb/>
     that England, whether she liked it or not, 
     <lb/>
     should cut the connection. He said the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country eulogised the scheme, but— 
     <lb/>
     that Lord GRANVILLE approved, but—that 
     <lb/>
    Lord DERBY spoke in favor of the connec<lb break="no"/>tion, but—All the virtue to his mind was 
     <lb/>in the " buts. " Nothing would satisfy him, 
     <lb/>and nothing would satisfy England whatever 
     <lb/>was done, and the sooner she got rid of us 
     <lb/>as a bad bargain, the better she would be 
     <lb/>pleased. ( Laughter.) But what was really 
     <lb/>the tone of the speeches from which the 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman quoted? Lord HOUGHTON, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     in seconding the motion for the Address in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Lords, on the 7th of February, 
     <lb/>
     said, " He hoped and believed that these 
     <lb/>
     colonies would still recognize the value of 
     <lb/>
     the British connection, and that their amal<lb break="no"/>gamation would render them more safe, 
     <lb/>
     without in any way weakening their fealty. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.)" What language, I ask, could 
     <lb/>
     more clearly express the feelings of the person 
     <lb/>
     speaking than this, and, as the seconder of 
     <lb/>
     the Address, the desire also of the party 
     <lb/>
     connected with him, that "our fealty to 
     <lb/>
     the British Crown should in no manner 
     <lb/>
     be weakened." And yet my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from Brome thought, with that 
     <lb/>
     discolored view he took of it, that he 
     <lb/>
     detected some uncertainty—some " but." 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) Lord DERBY was even more 
     <lb/>
     strong and emphatic in his language :—

     If I saw in this Confederation a desire to sepa<lb break="no"/>rate from this country, I should consider that a

     matter of so much more doubtful policy; but I see

     it with satisfaction—perhaps, however, it is too 
     <lb/>
     soon to discuss resolutions which have not yet 
     <lb/>
     been finally adopted—but I hope I see, in the

     terms of this proposed Confederation, an earnest 
     <lb/>
     desire to retain the blessings of the connection 
     <lb/>
     with this country—an earnest feeling of loyalty, 
     <lb/>
     and a determined and deliberate preference for a 
     <lb/>
     monarchical form of government over republican 
     <lb/>
     institutions, and a desire to maintain, as long as 
     <lb/>
     it can be maintained peaceably—and no human

     I notice that on both occasions when Lord 
     <lb/>
     DERBY and Lord HOUGHTON expressed these 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of attachment to the colonies, 
     <lb/>
     cheers were given in the House of Lords ; 
     <lb/>
     and yet the hon. member for Brome, laboring 
     <lb/>
     under some extraordinary mental hallucina<lb break="no"/>tion—(laughter)—thought he could detect 
     <lb/>
     evidences of a desire to abandon us to our 
     <lb/>
     fate—a willingness on the part of the two 
     <lb/>
     great parties represented in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Lords by Earl GRANVILLE and Earl 
     <lb/>
     DERBY, that this connection should cease ! 
     <lb/>
     When we consider the position Lord DERBY 
     <lb/>
     occupies; when we consider that he spoke 
     <lb/>
     from his seat in Parliament—and we all know 
     <lb/>
     the significance attached to the utterances 
     <lb/>
     of even the men of least note, when they 
     <lb/>
     speak from their places in the Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     how their words will be noted down and 
     <lb/>
     become a matter of record to be referred to 
     <lb/>
     five or ten years hence perhaps, as I dare 
     <lb/>
     say has more than once been found to be the

     occupying seats on the floor of this House—

     when Lord DERBY, I say, the leader of the

     greatest political party in Great Britain— 
     <lb/>
     and I do not hesitate to assert that it stands 
     <lb/>
     to-day the most numerous party—gives 
     <lb/>
     utterance in the strongest terms to his desire 
     <lb/>
     to see perpetuated the connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, I hope we see in that an

     evidence, that so long as we discharge the 
     <lb/>
     duties properly devolving upon us, England 
     <lb/>
     will never fail us in our hour of need. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) Lord GRANVILLE said :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     It was gratifying to see the good feeling which 
     <lb/>
     existed between this country and the North Am<lb break="no"/>erican colonies, which, while they strove to carry 
     <lb/>
     out their own wishes, desired to continue the 
     <lb/>
     connection with England.

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Why, air, if my hon. friend from Brome 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. DUNKIN) was right, Earl GRAN<lb break="no"/>VILLE, so far from saying that he desired to 
     <lb/>
     see this connection perpetuated, should have 
     <lb/>
     expressed his regret that we were desiring 
     <lb/>
     to maintain this connection. Notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing the strength of the language I have 
     <lb/>
     quoted, my hon friend from Brome was 
     <lb/>
    determined to see in it some desire in the 
     <lb/>minds of these noble lords that the connec<lb break="no"/>tion should cease—some desire on the part 
     <lb/>of the people of England that they should 
     <lb/>no longer hold, as appendages of the British 
     <lb/>Crown, these valuable Provinces of British 
     <lb/>America. He said even, with reference to 
     <lb/>the language of Lord DERBY, that his lord<lb break="no"/>ship " hoped" and " trusted" that so and so 
     <lb/>would be the case—and that the very fact of 
     <lb/>Lord DERBY's expressing a hope that we 
     <lb/>were not going to sever the connection, was 
     <lb/>in his mind tantamount to saying that a 
     <lb/>separation was inevitable. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>What would happen, sir, if my hon. friend 
     <lb/>were to carry out these extraordinary views 
     <lb/>in the common intercourse of life? It struck 
     <lb/>me, while he was speaking, that in his state 
     <lb/>of mind, there might be danger in the inter<lb break="no"/>change of the casual civilities of social 
     <lb/>intercourse. He is unfortunately laboring 
     <lb/>under a severe cold. Suppose I were to meet 
     <lb/>him to-morrow morning, and in the exercise 
     <lb/>of that friendly regard that I cordially feel 
     <lb/>for my hon. friend, I were to express a hope 
     <lb/>that his malady was decreasing. If he were 
     <lb/>to interpret my " hope " in the same strange 
     <lb/>manner in which he as taken the " hope" 
     <lb/>of Lord DERBY and others, he would very 
     <lb/>likely tell me that he was not so near his 
     <lb/>dissolution as I imagined, and that he had 
     <lb/>no intention yet of ordering his grave to be 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     dug. For it must be evident, that acting 
     <lb/>
     under the mental delusion that has charac<lb break="no"/>terized his remarks on this subject, he would 
     <lb/>
     interpret my " hope" that he was better, to 
     <lb/>
     a persuasion on my part that he had but a 
     <lb/>
     precarious tenure of his life. (Hear, hear, 
     <lb/>
     and laughter.) And to illustrate farther 
     <lb/>
     how incapable his mind had become of deal<lb break="no"/>ing impartially and correctly with the im<lb break="no"/>portant subject before us, I would call 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that when Lord DERBY expressed " a 
     <lb/>
     hope," he was not speaking at all of the 
     <lb/>
     feeling in England, but he was speaking of 
     <lb/>
     the feeling in this country. He said he 
     <lb/>
     hoped we should continue the connection. 
     <lb/>
     But when he spoke of the feeling in the old 
     <lb/>
     country, he did not even use the word 
     <lb/>
     " hope," but spoke positively and with assu<lb break="no"/>rance, saying: " I am sure " that the aid of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain will never fail them when they 
     <lb/>
     require it. (Hear, hear.) We have had 
     <lb/>
     his remarks quoted to us before, but I make 
     <lb/>
     no apology at all for extending the discussion 
     <lb/>
     upon it, for I feel strongly how important it 
     <lb/>
     is that this country should understand what 
     <lb/>
     the feeling in England is with regard to us. 
     <lb/>
     We have also had quoted to us the words 
     <lb/>
     used in Her Majesty's Speech, at the time 
     <lb/>
     that Columbia was formed into a British 
     <lb/>
     province. I will read it again :—

     (Hear, hear.) These utterances from high 
     <lb/>
     official quarters, which are generally very 
     <lb/>
     reticent, are remarkable for their force, and 
     <lb/>
     for the unmistakable language in which they 
     <lb/>
     are couched But, if there was any doubt 
     <lb/>
     as to the feeling which existed among the 
     <lb/>
     leading men of the political parties of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire, ought not that doubt to be removed by 
     <lb/>
     the visit of His Royal Highness the PRINCE 
     <lb/>
     OF WALES to this country? Was that a mere 
     <lb/>
     sham, an make-believe, on the part of England 
     <lb/>
     and the English Government, that Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty desired to retain, and Her Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the people of England desired to 
     <lb/>
     retain, the allegiance and the homage of Her 
     <lb/>
     people in the west? I do not believe it for a 
     <lb/>
     single instant. I have had recalled to my mind 
     <lb/>
     the language used by the PRINCE OF WALES, 
     <lb/>
    which I remember struck me very forcibly

     at the time. It occurred in his address to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian regiment in the year 1858, or the 
     <lb/>
     beginning of 1859. After its arrival in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, colors were presented to that regiment 
     <lb/>
     by H.R. Highness. It was his first public act, 
     <lb/>
     after he had been appointed to a commission 
     <lb/>
     in the British army. I will read the words 
     <lb/>
     which fell from the lips of His Royal High<lb break="no"/>ness on that occasion, and which made amost 
     <lb/>
     gratifying impression on my mind, having 
     <lb/>
     spent, as a British officer, previous to that 
     <lb/>
     time, many years of my life in these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. His Royal Highness, in presenting 
     <lb/>
     the colors to the regiment, used these words :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The ceremonial on which we are now engaged 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     because in confiding to you for the first time this 
     <lb/>
     emblem of military fidelity and valor, I not only 
     <lb/>
     recognize emphatically your enrollment into our 
     <lb/>
     national force, but celebrate an act which pro<lb break="no"/>claims and strengthens the unity of the various 
     <lb/>
     parts of this vast empire under the sway of our 
     <lb/>
     common Sovereign. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     While on this subject, I may refer to one or 
     <lb/>
     two of the answers which His Royal High<lb break="no"/>ness made to the various addresses presented 
     <lb/>
     to him in passing through this country. One 
     <lb/>
     of the most gratifying to my own mind, and 
     <lb/>
     to the mind of every man who desires to see 
     <lb/>
     our connection with the Mother Country per<lb break="no"/>petuated, is his answer to the Address from the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, in which he said—" Most 
     <lb/>
     heartily do I respond to your desire that the 
     <lb/>
     ties which bind together the Sovereign and 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian people may be strong and en<lb break="no"/>during." (Hear, hear.) But it is not neces<lb break="no"/>sary for me to quote further from the answers 
     <lb/>
     made by His Royal Highness. The whole 
     <lb/>
     aspect of his visit to this country—the utter<lb break="no"/>ances of the leaders of the two great parties 
     <lb/>
     in the British Empire—the well-known wishes 
     <lb/>
     of our Sovereign and of the Heir-Apparent to 
     <lb/>
     the Throne—all these intimate, so far as acts 
     <lb/>
     and language can intimate anything, that there 
     <lb/>
     is still an unanimous desire on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the British people for the continuance of 
     <lb/>
     the connection of these provinces with the 
     <lb/>
     British Empire. And I believe it rests 
     <lb/>
     with us—altogether rests with us—whether 
     <lb/>
     that connection shall be perpetuated. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I have no doubt that this prevailing 
     <lb/>
     desire for the perpetuation of the connection 
     <lb/>
     is one main ground of the satisfaction with 
     <lb/>
     which the people of England view our move<lb break="no"/>ment towards union. They are well aware 
     <lb/>
     —not looking at it from the view of our sec<lb break="no"/>tional jealousies and party conflicts, but look<lb break="no"/>ing at it from a broader point of view—that 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     our union must tend to the consolidation of 
     <lb/>
     our power and our strength, and to the de<lb break="no"/>velopment of our resources. I see no abso<lb break="no"/>lute necessity why, as we grow in strength, 
     <lb/>
     we should think, for many long years to come, 
     <lb/>
     of severing the connection; but as we in<lb break="no"/>crease in wealth and in numbers, we ought 
     <lb/>
     gradually, in the time of peace, to relieve the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country of the expense to which we 
     <lb/>
     now put her for our defence. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Another reason why we should earnestly de<lb break="no"/>sire a union of the British provinces, in 
     <lb/>
     order to develope our nationality, in order 
     <lb/>
     that we should become better acquainted, in 
     <lb/>
     order that new channels of commerce should 
     <lb/>
     be opened up, is because of the hostility of 
     <lb/>
     the United States, evidently manifested to 
     <lb/>
     this country during the past few months. 
     <lb/>
     What has been the policy of the United 
     <lb/>
     States towards Canada during that time? 
     <lb/>
     We have seen adopted the passport system— 
     <lb/>
     a remnant of despotism which even the de<lb break="no"/>spotic governments of the old world have 
     <lb/>
     abolished. We have seen that democratic 
     <lb/>
     people embarrassing and restricting the inter<lb break="no"/>course between us; they have given notice 
     <lb/>
     of the termination of the convention limiting 
     <lb/>
     the lake naval force; they have, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     given notice of the abrogation of the Reci<lb break="no"/>procity treaty; we have seen the committee 
     <lb/>
     of ways and means reporting a bill for put<lb break="no"/>ting the frontier defences in order, and re<lb break="no"/>commending the expenditure of upwards of 
     <lb/>
     a million of dollars on those defences. 
     <lb/>
     They have given notice, or propose to give 
     <lb/>
     notice, of the abrogation of the Extradition 
     <lb/>
     treaty. They have proposed the construction 
     <lb/>
     of a ship canal around the Niagara Falls for 
     <lb/>
     gunboats and vessels of war. This is the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the United States towards Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And it makes us consider 
     <lb/>
     what steps they will take next. It must 
     <lb/>
     make every man consider the position of this 
     <lb/>
     country, should she be cut off from a commu<lb break="no"/>nication with the ocean through the United 
     <lb/>
     States by the bonding system being suddenly 
     <lb/>
     terminated. It makes us feel the humiliating 
     <lb/>
    position we occupy, that our very national 
     <lb/>existence at the present time is in a great 
     <lb/>measure dependent—most humiliatingly de<lb break="no"/>pendent—upon a foreign and an unfriendly 
     <lb/>power. (Hear, hear.) The people of the 
     <lb/>United States have recently manifested no 
     <lb/>good-will towards us, and the steps that have 
     <lb/>been taken to exhibit their ill-will are perhaps 
     <lb/>only a foretaste of what we may expect before 
     <lb/>long. But whether they take extreme meas<lb break="no"/>ures or not at the present time, does our 
     <lb/>

     present position offer any guarantee for inde<lb break="no"/>pendence, or for the continuance of our con<lb break="no"/>nection with England? Rather, do not the 
     <lb/>
     condition of this continent and the earnest 
     <lb/>
     advice of British statesmen call aloud upon us 
     <lb/>
     to be prepared, unless we intend to form part 
     <lb/>
     and parcel of the great republic ? I can 
     <lb/>
     readily understand how men with annexation 
     <lb/>
     tendencies, and who are inclined towards 
     <lb/>
     republican institutions, would rejoice at our 
     <lb/>
     present position. I can understand how men 
     <lb/>
     who wish to see the whole continent converted 
     <lb/>
     into one great republic, are pleased at difficul<lb break="no"/>ties being created between the Empire and the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. But those who entertain different 
     <lb/>
     views see plainly that some steps must be 
     <lb/>
     taken, that we must go to work earnestly to 
     <lb/>
     build up a nationality independent of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, though not in hostility to it, 
     <lb/>
     to counteract the tendency so evident on every 
     <lb/>
     hand to drive us into their arms. We know 
     <lb/>
     very well what must be the result of the steps 
     <lb/>
     which they are now taking—unless we ourselves 
     <lb/>
     take measures in another direction—unless we 
     <lb/>
     find another outlet to the ocean— unless we 
     <lb/>
     find some other channels for our trade and 
     <lb/>
     commerce, they knew that we must inevitably 
     <lb/>
     fall into their arms. That is another reason 
     <lb/>
     why I wish to see no delay in the union and 
     <lb/>
     in the amalgamation of the British provinces, 
     <lb/>
     in order that we may at once consolidate our<lb break="no"/>selves into one people, and at once endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     abolish those barriers which now exist between 
     <lb/>
     us, and develope the feeling that we have com<lb break="no"/>mon interests, and that we are dependent the 
     <lb/>
     one upon the other, which can never be the 
     <lb/>
     case so long as division walls exist. It seems 
     <lb/>
     really astonishing to my mind that any man 
     <lb/>
     who really desires to see built up on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent a nationality independent of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, should offer any opposition to the pro<lb break="no"/>posal now before us. (Hear, hear.) So 
     <lb/>
     much has been said with regard to our 
     <lb/>
     financial and commercial position and pros<lb break="no"/>pects, that I think it is quite unnecessary 
     <lb/>
     for me to say anything further on the 
     <lb/>
     subject. I am quite sure that I could not place 
     <lb/>
     the matter before you as well as it has been 
     <lb/>
     submitted by those who have preceded me. 
     <lb/>
     But it is natural that each speaker should 
     <lb/>
     dwell upon that which most impresses his own 
     <lb/>
     mind. I am persuaded that in every point of 
     <lb/>
     view—in view of our dependence upon, and 
     <lb/>
     precarious relations with the United States, 
     <lb/>
     in view of a desired union with the British 
     <lb/>
     provinces ; in view of our connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Empire—we should be culpably lacking in our 
     <lb/>
    duty, did we any longer delay to seek and to  
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
        
     create new channels for our trade and com<lb break="no"/>merce. It is well known that at the present 
     <lb/>
     time our productions are actually passing 
     <lb/>
     through the hands of the New York mer<lb break="no"/>chants before they reach the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. These merchants are deriving all the 
     <lb/>
     benefits of that trade, which, with all our dis<lb break="no"/>advantages, does exist to a considerable ex<lb break="no"/>tent, and is evidently capable of an enormous 
     <lb/>
     extension. It is only necessary to refer to 
     <lb/>
     the position and characteristics of the different 
     <lb/>
     provinces, to see at once how exactly they 
     <lb/>
     supply the wants and deficiencies of each 
     <lb/>
     other. Suffice it to say that we are agricul<lb break="no"/>tural and manufacturing, whilst they are, and 
     <lb/>
     must remain, principally a maritime popula<lb break="no"/>tion, requiring for consumption that with 
     <lb/>
     which we can supply them. I know it is said 
     <lb/>
     that these channels of commercial intercourse 
     <lb/>
     may be opened up without union. But we 
     <lb/>
     need to feel ourselves to be one people, with 
     <lb/>
     identical interests, dependent upon each other; 
     <lb/>
     and what can do this as well as a political 
     <lb/>
     union, bringing us together into one legisla<lb break="no"/>ture and under one government? Perhaps it 
     <lb/>
     is not too much to say that our commercial 
     <lb/>
     interests would be furthered more in ten years 
     <lb/>
     under a political union, than it would be in 
     <lb/>
     thirty years without it. (Hear, hear.) In 
     <lb/>
     connection with this subject, I am naturally 
     <lb/>
     reminded of the Intercolonial Railway. Now, 
     <lb/>
     sir, it appears to me, although the Interco<lb break="no"/>lonial Railway has been dragged into this ques<lb break="no"/>tion—although the expense of that undertak<lb break="no"/>ing has been dwelt upon by the opponents of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme as if it were part of the scheme and 
     <lb/>
     of this scheme alone—I believe that whatever 
     <lb/>
     the event, whether there be a Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces or not, the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way is an indispensable necessity. The ex<lb break="no"/>pense of that railway is, therefore, a question 
     <lb/>
     altogether apart from this scheme, and can<lb break="no"/>not be allowed to enter into the arguments 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">pro</hi> or <hi rendition="simple:italic">con</hi>. I do not look upon the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, at the present time, in the 
     <lb/>
     light of a profitable commercial undertaking, 
     <lb/>
     neither, to any great extent, as a valuable 
     <lb/>
     military undertaking. (Opposition cries of 
     <lb/>
     "Hear, hear.") There is not the least doubt that 
     <lb/>
     when we are not actually engaged in hostil<lb break="no"/>ities, it would be of the greatest advantage in 
     <lb/>
     furnishing us with an outlet at all seasons 
     <lb/>
     of the year. Before actual hostilities, as in 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trent</hi> affair, we need it to secure our inde<lb break="no"/>pendence of the United States in bringing 
     <lb/>
     rapidly troops and munitions of war into the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. When actually at war, we are 
     <lb/>
    aware that railways are easily destroyed, and 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="637" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0637.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">637</fw>
            
     rendered of little use, unless we have the 
     <lb/>
     means of protecting them. But as a great 
     <lb/>
     social and political engine, it seems to me ab<lb break="no"/>solutely necessary, if ever we are to have a 
     <lb/>
     union ; and if a union does not come to-day, 
     <lb/>
     but is looked forward to ten years hence, I 
     <lb/>
     still hold that we ought at the present time, 
     <lb/>
     and without unnecessary delay, to commence its 
     <lb/>
     construction. Union, sir, is desirable, because 
     <lb/>
     undoubted it will add to our means of 
     <lb/>
     defence. It is true we shall not have any 
     <lb/>
     territory added to us which will increase our 
     <lb/>
     strength ; neither shall we add to the number 
     <lb/>
    of battalions in the provinces generally. But 
     <lb/>it does not, I apprehend, require a military 
     <lb/>man, or a man with military experience or 
     <lb/>military education, to be aware that there is 
     <lb/>no combination which so much needs one head 
     <lb/>and one guiding mind as the management of 
     <lb/>military organizations, and the guidance of 
     <lb/>military operations. What, I ask, would be 
     <lb/>our position in the event of war, should there 
     <lb/>be no union? We have at present five dis<lb break="no"/>tinct provinces, with as many independent 
     <lb/>governments. The people are but little known 
     <lb/>the one to the other, and consequently have 
     <lb/>but the slightest possible interest in each 
     <lb/>other. In the event of war, circumstances 
     <lb/>might frequently occur where concerted action 
     <lb/>on the part of two or more of the provinces 
     <lb/>might be required. Immediate cooperation 
     <lb/>might be essential to the success of the pro<lb break="no"/>posed project. Should we not have the most 
     <lb/>serious difficulties thrown in the way of the 
     <lb/>undertaking, simply from the fact that so 
     <lb/>many independent governments must be con<lb break="no"/>sulted, each jealous of its own rights, and con<lb break="no"/>cerned only about its own safety. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Such a state of things demands a 
     <lb/>change, were there no other argument in 
     <lb/>favor of it. If we are to remain independent 
     <lb/>of the United States, we must unite, in the 
     <lb/>most effective manner possible, our available 
     <lb/>means of defence. We must become ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with one another, and do all we can 
     <lb/>to call into existence a feeling of oneness, and 
     <lb/>of interest not only in one section or province, 
     <lb/>but in British America generally. Canadians 
     <lb/>should cease to think that they are interested 
     <lb/>alone in the defence of Canada, and Nova 
     <lb/>Sootians must learn to look beyond the limits 
     <lb/>of Nova Scotia. If we are to offer anything 
     <lb/>like a united resistance, we must have a com<lb break="no"/>mon interest in the whole country. And how 
     <lb/>can we so surely effect this, how effect it at 
     <lb/>all, without union? But let us carry out 
     <lb/>the scheme that is proposed for our adop<lb break="no"/>tion, and in course of time we shall 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     all learn to feel interested in the in<lb break="no"/>tegrity of every part of the Confederation. If 
     <lb/>
     we are united we shall find the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces admirably suited for the 
     <lb/>
     work required to be done on the lakes—the 
     <lb/>
     key to the defence of Upper Canada. If, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, we can be united as one people, if 
     <lb/>
     we are brought under one head and one mind, 
     <lb/>
     we shall have Nova Scotians assisting in our 
     <lb/>
     defence, and very likely we shall assist in the 
     <lb/>
     defence of Nova Scotia. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     cannot too strongly impress on the minds of 
     <lb/>
     those who hear me the strong convictions of 
     <lb/>
     my own mind with reference to the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of immediate and thorough union. Our 
     <lb/>
     own interests demand it, the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire require it, that we may be able to hold 
     <lb/>
     our own against the strong and energetic 
     <lb/>
     power to the south of us. For these import<lb break="no"/>ant objects we must learn to throw aside all 
     <lb/>
     our sectional disputes, and to place ourselves 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of men who would have to guide 
     <lb/>
     us when the time of difficulty may arrive. No 
     <lb/>
     one more earnestly desires the continuance of 
     <lb/>
     the blessings of peace; but should the reverse 
     <lb/>
     come, we must all learn to obey orders with 
     <lb/>
     zeal and promptitude, to stand in readiness 
     <lb/>
     for service in any part of British America 
     <lb/>
     where our presence may be required. This 
     <lb/>
     can never be done so long as Nova Scotia is 
     <lb/>
     building up a nationality for herself, and New  
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island are each remaining in a state of 
     <lb/>
     isolation, and Upper and Lower Canada are 
     <lb/>
     far removed in sentiment and feeling from 
     <lb/>
     either. So long as this is the case, we are 
     <lb/>
     diffusing our strength and are weakening our<lb break="no"/>selves. From no point of view can union be 
     <lb/>
     more strongly urged as a necessity than in 
     <lb/>
     the case of our defence. The defence of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, although we have such an extended fron<lb break="no"/>tier, is not so difficult as might at first sight 
     <lb/>
     appear. There a few prominent points which 
     <lb/>
     must be defended, and which we must make 
     <lb/>
     up our minds to hold. It is true we have an 
     <lb/>
     extensive frontier, but the frontier of the 
     <lb/>
     United States is not the less so. It is true 
     <lb/>
     also that we have many towns on the frontier, 
     <lb/>
     but they are not to be compared to the wealth 
     <lb/>
     and importance of those of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore we are not placed at so great a 
     <lb/>
     disadvantage in that respect. There are cer<lb break="no"/>tain points which are the key or the gates to 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and which, if properly defended, we 
     <lb/>
     may reasonably hope to hold the country, 
     <lb/>
     without fear of any number that may be 
     <lb/>
     brought against us, and it is of the first im<lb break="no"/>portance that the people of Canada should 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="638" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0638.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">638</fw>
            
     awake to the necessity of having these posts 
     <lb/>
     defended. If we are to remain independent, 
     <lb/>
     if we really desire a nationality apart from 
     <lb/>
     that of the United States, it is necessary that 
     <lb/>
     we should think of these things, and look them 
     <lb/>
     fully in the face—to consider it well, and to 
     <lb/>
     see the absolute necessity of coming to some 
     <lb/>
     arrangement with the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     as to the proportion we are mutually to bear. 
     <lb/>
     If we are really in earnest in our professed 
     <lb/>
     desire to maintain our independence, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve we shall be willing to tax ourselves and 
     <lb/>
     submit to the necessary sacrifices. The very 
     <lb/>
     fact that there is an uncertainty existing in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of many whether Canada will con<lb break="no"/>sent to be taxed for her defence, is one of 
     <lb/>
     the strongest grounds, to my mind, why we 
     <lb/>
     should lose no time in completing the union 
     <lb/>
     of the British American Provinces. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that so long as Canada is separated from the 
     <lb/>
     rest of British America, so long will she be 
     <lb/>
     without any feeling of nationality. She can<lb break="no"/>not exist here alone. We need to feel that 
     <lb/>
     there is a nationality on this continent to 
     <lb/>
     which we are attached; and I know of noth<lb break="no"/>ing more likely to extend our ideas and views, 
     <lb/>
     so as to embrace the whole of British Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca, than the present project. We are likely 
     <lb/>
     to view a country such as the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     would include, as something worth struggling 
     <lb/>
     for and defending. All other countries of 
     <lb/>
     the world are satisfied to tax themselves for 
     <lb/>
     their defence, and we find countries not so 
     <lb/>
     numerous in population, and with revenues 
     <lb/>
     and commerce inferior to ourselves, maintain<lb break="no"/>ing comparatively large standing armies. And 
     <lb/>
     yet when we talk of our defences—when we 
     <lb/>
     speak of the taxation which will be necessary 
     <lb/>
     in order to erect and defend these works 
     <lb/>
     and to instruct the militia, we hear doubts ex<lb break="no"/>pressed, uncertainties floating about, whether 
     <lb/>
     Canada will really consent to bear her 
     <lb/>
     share of it. It shows to me that there is 
     <lb/>
     among some a want of a deep-seated feeling 
     <lb/>
     of nationality, and that that necessary senti<lb break="no"/>ment has yet to be called out and developed. 
     <lb/>
     Where this does exist the people do not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate to make any sacrifice necessary for the 
     <lb/>
     maintenance of their independence. Other 
     <lb/>
     countries have manifested their attachment 
     <lb/>
     to their nationality and their flag by the 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice of almost everything they possessed. 
     <lb/>
     Sometimes, however, it is urged that when 
     <lb/>
     the time arrives Canada will show to the world 
     <lb/>
     that she is willing to spend her last drop of 
     <lb/>
     blood in defence of the soil. This is a very 
     <lb/>
     proper sentiment, and sounds exceedingly 
     <lb/>
     well, but I cannot help thinking that if those 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     who give expression to it wish to shew that 
     <lb/>
     it can stand the test of trial, they would now 
     <lb/>
     urge the expenditure necessary to give effect 
     <lb/>
     to it. They would then be doing some real 
     <lb/>
     practical good, and not be so liable to be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as mere sentimentalists. The 
     <lb/>
     question is an eminently practical one, and 
     <lb/>
     the sentiment that has no practical issue 
     <lb/>
     may be regarded as spurious and useless. 
     <lb/>
     We may be sure of this, that if we are not 
     <lb/>
     willing to spend the money that is necessary 
     <lb/>
     for our defence, when the time comes there 
     <lb/>
     will be a great unwillingness to spend the 
     <lb/>
     blood. (Hear, hear.) We ought to consider 
     <lb/>
     that it is not sufficient that we should be 
     <lb/>
     willing to spend our lives, for these alone 
     <lb/>
     cannot defend us. If we make no prepar<lb break="no"/>ation, what will the destruction of life avail 
     <lb/>
     us? It is unreasonable and foolish to say 
     <lb/>
     that we will leave everything undone—the 
     <lb/>
     training of our men, and the strengthening 
     <lb/>
     of our positions—until the very time when 
     <lb/>
     our only chance must depend upon our 
     <lb/>
     having trained men and fortified positions 
     <lb/>
     ready to our hand. It would be as reasonable 
     <lb/>
     for a man to say, "I will learn to swim when 
     <lb/>
     I am drowning." Every reasonable man 
     <lb/>
     exposed to drowning would certainly take 
     <lb/>
     every means to learn to swim beforehand, so 
     <lb/>
     that when exposed to the danger he would 
     <lb/>
     be able to extricate himself. It seems to 
     <lb/>
     me quite as reasonable for us to say that 
     <lb/>
     when the time comes we will spend our 
     <lb/>
     lives in defence of the country, and neglect 
     <lb/>
     all precautionary measures beforehand. I 
     <lb/>
     have no sympathy with such a sentiment, and 
     <lb/>
     very little confidence in it. I should like 
     <lb/>
     rather to see a little practical sense manifested 
     <lb/>
     in a question of such vital importance. I 
     <lb/>
     have read with attention the report of Col. 
     <lb/>
     JERVOIS, who was sent out by the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government, and, I presume, most other 
     <lb/>
     hon. members of this House have also seen 
     <lb/>
     it. That officer points out certain places 
     <lb/>
     which must be defended, and he closes his 
     <lb/>
     report with this remark: "That unless these 
     <lb/>
     works are constructed, it is worse than useless 
     <lb/>
     to continue any British force in Canada"

     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     says " Hear! hear!" Of course, sir, I can<lb break="no"/>not pronounce absolutely what may be pass<lb break="no"/>ing in his mind, but I have noticed this— 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman will know whether it 
     <lb/>
     justly applies to himself or no—that when 
     <lb/>
     the expenses of our defence were mentioned 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend the member from North 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="639" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0639.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">639</fw>
            
     Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON), in a manner 
     <lb/>
     deprecating the expenditure, there was a 
     <lb/>
     very significant " Hear! hear !" intimating 
     <lb/>
     a hearty concurrence in such sentiments. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, when my hon. friend in his usual 
     <lb/>
     forcible manner, expressed his willingness, 
     <lb/>
     when the time arrived, to spend the last 
     <lb/>
     drop of his blood in the defence of this land, 
     <lb/>
     we heard no more of the responding and 
     <lb/>
     concurring "Hear! hear!" I alluded to. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) My hon. friend, if I under<lb break="no"/>stood him rightly, deprecated the idea that 
     <lb/>
     any expense should be entailed upon us for 
     <lb/>
     defensive works. But, sir, he spoke like 
     <lb/>
     a true Briton, and I am quite sure that he 
     <lb/>
     was in earnest, and did not utter a mere 
     <lb/>
     barren sentiment, when he said that he 
     <lb/>
     would spend his last drop of blood in the 
     <lb/>
     defence of his country. And I am sure he 
     <lb/>
     would do so. But I would put it to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend if it is more reasonable that he should 
     <lb/>
     spend this blood, or spend a few pounds? 
     <lb/>
     Who can tell the thousands, ay, the hund<lb break="no"/>reds of thousands of human lives that may 
     <lb/>
     be spared by the judicious and timely ex<lb break="no"/>penditure now of a few hundreds of thousands 
     <lb/>
     of pounds? I wish to impress upon my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend what is the clear conviction of my 
     <lb/>
     own mind, that in every point of view it is 
     <lb/>
     economy—economy of treasure, and economy 
     <lb/>
     of useful lives, to spend some money now to 
     <lb/>
     place our country in a state of defence. I 
     <lb/>
     think a great change has taken place within 
     <lb/>
     the last few years in reference to this subject. 
     <lb/>
     The ventilation of the subject has drawn 
     <lb/>
     men's minds towards it, and we are beginning 
     <lb/>
     to feel that here we are a people consid<lb break="no"/>erable in numbers and considerable in wealth, 
     <lb/>
     and it is incumbent upon us to do more than 
     <lb/>
     we have been doing in times past. I would 
     <lb/>
     call attention to a very important work which 
     <lb/>
     can scarcely be overestimated. I allude to 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa canal. I regret that the state of 
     <lb/>
     our finances will not permit us to think of 
     <lb/>
     its construction at the present time, but I 
     <lb/>
     refer to it that we may think of it; that 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the people may 
     <lb/>
     think of it; that the statesmen of the 
     <lb/>
     country may think of it. In order to 
     <lb/>
     secure the future defence of the country, 
     <lb/>
     and especially the western section of it, 
     <lb/>
     and to maintain its independence, the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa canal must be built. The Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     canal would be worth 50,000 men to us. 
     <lb/>
     With that canal, and the aid of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, which we are assured will never be 
     <lb/>
     wanting when we require it, we will be able 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     to maintain and hold our own on the 
     <lb/>
     lakes, and thus make our own territory 
     <lb/>
     secure, and threaten our opponents at many 
     <lb/>
     important points. At the present time we 
     <lb/>
     are in a sad condition as regards our canal 
     <lb/>
     communication, looked at from a defensible 
     <lb/>
     point of view. Our St. Lawrence canals are 
     <lb/>
     almost entirely useless. I am glad to see 
     <lb/>
     that the American Government have given 
     <lb/>
     notice of their intention to terminate the 
     <lb/>
     convention for not keeping armed vessels on 
     <lb/>
     the lakes. I am glad to see that this is to 
     <lb/>
     be put an end to, for it was decidedly preju<lb break="no"/>dicial to our interests, and I have no doubt we 
     <lb/>
     shall have gunboats on our lakes before the 
     <lb/>
     end of the present year. Had it continued 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, we might have been very much 
     <lb/>
     at the mercy of the United States. There is 
     <lb/>
     no question that, should they determine upon 
     <lb/>
     going to war with us before the opening of 
     <lb/>
     navigation, we might not be able to get a 
     <lb/>
     British gun-boat on our waters by the St. 
     <lb/>
     Lawrence canals, as they are so easily 
     <lb/>
     accessible to our opponents, and, without 
     <lb/>
     much difficulty, could be rendered useless for 
     <lb/>
     navigation. As regards the Rideau canal, 
     <lb/>
     how are we to get gun-boats through it? 
     <lb/>
     There is a certain class of gun-boats that 
     <lb/>
     might pass through it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     R. H. MACKENZIE was understood to 
     <lb/>
     express doubt on this point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—Yes; the locks of 
     <lb/>
     the Rideau canal are, I believe, 130 feet 
     <lb/>
     long, and would admit a certain class of gun<lb break="no"/>boats. But, as my hon. friend seems to 
     <lb/>
     remark, the Rideau canal would, neverthe<lb break="no"/>less, be useless, because the only way by 
     <lb/>
     which we can reach it is through the Gren<lb break="no"/>ville canal, and the locks of the Grenville 
     <lb/>
     canal are only 70 feet long. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     we should be entirely at the mercy 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. because, unless 
     <lb/>
     we held Lake Ontario, the Upper Pro<lb break="no"/>vince would be inevitably gone. Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, it appears to me that all our inter<lb break="no"/>ests—commercial, political and defensive— 
     <lb/>
     and the peculiar circumstances in which we 
     <lb/>
     are placed, urgently call for the union of 
     <lb/>
     the British Provinces. The reasons are of 
     <lb/>
     that force and the interests of that magni<lb break="no"/>tude, that it is surprising to me that any 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, who really desires that 
     <lb/>
     these provinces should be independent of 
     <lb/>
     the United States, should hesitate for a 
     <lb/>
     single moment about adopting the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     not that it is perfect, but because it is the 
     <lb/>
     only one within our reach. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">640</fw>
            <p>
     I have now to make a few remarks on the 
     <lb/>
     character of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition. 
     <lb/>
     The composition of that Opposition strikes 
     <lb/>
     me as somewhat remarkable. It is certainly 
     <lb/>
     heterogeneous. The great difference be<lb break="no"/>tween the Opposition and the Government 
     <lb/>
     seems to me to be this, that while the 
     <lb/>
     Government are anxious to build up, to 
     <lb/>
     consolidate, to strengthen, the only object of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition, the only object which keeps 
     <lb/>
     them together, appears to be to pull down, 
     <lb/>
     to weaken, to divide. (Hear, hear.) Many 
     <lb/>
     of the remarks which which have fallen 
     <lb/>
     from the various members of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>
     they might have made with equal force 
     <lb/>
     against each other as against the Government. 
     <lb/>
     To use a military phrase, they seem to have 
     <lb/>
     been firing at one another, but as it is only 
     <lb/>
     awar of words and arguments, they may still 
     <lb/>
     fire away, although logically <hi rendition="simple:italic">hors de combat</hi>. 
     <lb/>
     One says it is necessary we should have a 
     <lb/>
     change. Another says he desires no change, 
     <lb/>
     but wishes us to remain as we are. A third is 
     <lb/>
    against Confederation, because he thinks 
     <lb/>the Federal principle is one which in all 
     <lb/>time past has been proved to be weak and 
     <lb/>powerless. Another member of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition bases his hopes of the world's future 
     <lb/>on the principles of Federalism. Another 
     <lb/>says he will have nothing but a legislative 
     <lb/>union ; while, I believe, there are not a 
     <lb/>few of those with whom he acts who would 
     <lb/>threaten fire and sword if a legislative 
     <lb/>union were attempted to be carried. We 
     <lb/>have surely here an extraordinary display 
     <lb/>of anything but unanimity. As I said 
     <lb/>before, they present the spectacle of a most 
     <lb/>heterogeneous company, with power only to 
     <lb/>destroy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WALL5">MR. T. C. WALLBRIDGE</persName>—What sort 
     <lb/>
     of a spectacle do the Government present in 
     <lb/>
     that respect? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—The members of the 
     <lb/>
     Government have a common object. They have 
     <lb/>
     come together, not to assail one another with 
     <lb/>
     their opposite principles and views and opin<lb break="no"/>ions, but they have come together to combine 
     <lb/>
     —they have come together, like reasonable 
     <lb/>
     men, for the accomplishment of a great com<lb break="no"/>mon object—and they have considered how 
     <lb/>
     best they can meet one another's views by 
     <lb/>
     mutual concession, which is the law that 
     <lb/>
     binds society together, without which society 
     <lb/>
     would be at an end. They have united in 
     <lb/>
     this way and in this spirit to strengthen the 
     <lb/>
     position of these provinces, and the position 
     <lb/>
     of the Empire to which they belong. But I 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     do not hear one word of this, with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. members forming the Opposition. 
     <lb/>
     I do not hear that they have met together, 
     <lb/>
     and are prepared to propose to the country 
     <lb/>
     some scheme that will be better than the one 
     <lb/>
     that is now offered for our adoption. I do 
     <lb/>
     not hear a word of anything of the kind, and 
     <lb/>
     this I do most seriously complain of. I 
     <lb/>
     maintain that the importance of this matter 
     <lb/>
     is such, that it is their duty not to avail 
     <lb/>
     themselves of what is ordinarily called 
     <lb/>
     the latitude of parliamentary opposition.— 
     <lb/>
     The circumstances of this country are 
     <lb/>
     too grave for us to trifle with such a 
     <lb/>
     question. If we present to the House 
     <lb/>
     and to the country something to meet the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties of our position, then I say that 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen who oppose that scheme 
     <lb/>
     are wanting in their duty to their country, 
     <lb/>
     and are wanting in the appreciation they 
     <lb/>
     ought to have of those difficulties, if they do 
     <lb/>
     not on their part present something to us, 
     <lb/>
     and ask us to accept from them what they 
     <lb/>
     suppose better than is offered to them by us. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot but express my regret at the course 
     <lb/>
     they have pursued. (Hear.) I will now 
     <lb/>
     allude, sir, to an opposition to this scheme, 
     <lb/>
     which has been very decidedly expressed 
     <lb/>
     by a certain section of the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minority of Lower Canada. I am aware, 
     <lb/>
     from personal intercourse with many gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen belonging to that section of the 
     <lb/>
     community, that they do feel a very 
     <lb/>
     strong aversion to this scheme, because, as 
     <lb/>
     they say, it will place them at the mercy of 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadians. On this point I 
     <lb/>
     desire to assure my honorable friends from 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, that whilst I consider that 
     <lb/>
     our present circumstances require us all to 
     <lb/>
     speak openly and honestly one to the other, 
     <lb/>
     it is and shall be my earnest desire to speak 
     <lb/>
     with all kindliness of feeling towards them. 
     <lb/>
     I feel compelled to say that there is no part 
     <lb/>
     of this scheme that I feel more doubt about, 
     <lb/>
     than the effect it will have upon the educa<lb break="no"/>tion and political interests of the Protestants 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada. It has been said that 
     <lb/>
     there is and always has been a spirit of 
     <lb/>
     toleration and generosity on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians towards their Protestant 
     <lb/>
     fellow-countrymen. I have heard it said that 
     <lb/>
     they have on every occasion furthered to 
     <lb/>
     the utmost of their ability, and in the fairest 
     <lb/>
     and most just manner, the educational 
     <lb/>
     interests of the Protestant minority. But 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, gentlemen who have paid 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of attention to the subject, have 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="641" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0641.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">641</fw>
            
     also said that, in time past, although there 
     <lb/>
     has not been an open hostility to the educa<lb break="no"/>tion of the Protestant minority, there has 
     <lb/>
     been a very decided under-hand obstructive<lb break="no"/>ness. This is stated by gentlemen who have 
     <lb/>
     taken a particular interest in the matter, and 
     <lb/>
     who, I am confident, would not make such 
     <lb/>
     a statement if they did not think it to 
     <lb/>
     be the case. And I must say, for my 
     <lb/>
     own part, that I do think the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minority have some grounds for this fear. 
     <lb/>
     And this is my reason: the religious faith 
     <lb/>
     of the majority in Lower Canada is, as we 
     <lb/>
     know, Roman Catholic, and they receive 
     <lb/>
     from the head of the Romish Church their 
     <lb/>
     inspiration ; they are guided by the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples that are laid down, and that are from 
     <lb/>
     time to time publicly promulgated by the 
     <lb/>
     head of that Church. Now, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that my Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen 
     <lb/>
     can be surprised—and I would ask their 
     <lb/>
     attention to what I am saying, I desire to 
     <lb/>
     speak honestly, but, of course, courteously— 
     <lb/>
     I do not think they can be surprised at these 
     <lb/>
     suspicions and fears of their Protestant 
     <lb/>
     brethren. And why? Because they must 
     <lb/>
     themselves be aware what are the principles 
     <lb/>
     of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ALLE1">HON. MR. ALLEYN</persName>—What are they?

     "that emigrants to Catholic countries

     should have freedom of worship." (Hear,

     religious animosity. But when we are

     discussing a scheme of the greatest import<lb break="no"/>ance, involving the interests of various sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the community, I do think it behoves 
     <lb/>
     every man to speak honestly. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I have said that the Protestant minority in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada fear lest they should not have 
     <lb/>
     full justice done to them. They know the 
     <lb/>
     great power of the Romish hierarchy in 
     <lb/>
    Lower Canada. They know how much 
     <lb/>everything is shaped according to the wishes 
     <lb/>of that body. They know that that hier<lb break="no"/>archy receives its inspiration from Rome, 
     <lb/>and within the last few weeks we find what 
     <lb/>is the character of that inspiration. (Re<lb break="no"/>newed murmurs of disapprobation.) Now I 
     <lb/>ask my Roman Catholic friends to consider 
     <lb/>this candidly. When there comes from the 
     <lb/>Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>Church, a letter clothed with all the autho<lb break="no"/>rity that we know the French Canadians 
     <lb/>attribute to that source, and when we have 
     <lb/>it declared here that it is an error to 
     <lb/>say that in some countries called Catho<lb break="no"/>lic, emigrants should enjoy the free 
     <lb/>exercise of their own worship—(Hear! 
     <lb/>hear !)—I hear some of my honorable 
     <lb/>friends say " Hear, hear," in rather a jeering 
     <lb/>tone. But I ask you to think honestly 
     <lb/>about it. Suppose it were possible for the 
     <lb/>Protestants of Canada to speak in a manner 
     <lb/>similar to that in which the head of the 
     <lb/>Romish Church has spoken, and that we 
     <lb/>were to declare it to be a principle that 
     <lb/>should guide us, that we ought not give to 
     <lb/>those who differed from us the freedom of 
     <lb/>religious worship, would not the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholics in Upper Canada have good reason 
     <lb/>to be alarmed ? Now, I ask you to do me 
     <lb/>the justice, my hon. friends, to think of it 
     <lb/>in a just light, and not in the light of an 
     <lb/>attack upon your religion. I ask you to 
     <lb/>think of it fairly, especially at such a time 
     <lb/>as this, when the Protestants of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada are called to put themselves into the 
     <lb/>power of the Roman Catholic hierarchy; for 
     <lb/>I believe it is simply tantamount to that. I 
     <lb/>ask you to think what must be their feelings 
     <lb/>when they read, as emanating from the head 
     <lb/>and ruler of the Romish hierarchy, such a 
     <lb/>

     sentiment as that contained in the passage I 
     <lb/>
     have quoted.

     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Will the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman allow me to say a word ? The 
     <lb/>
     Protestant minority of Lower Canada have 
     <lb/>
     always lived in harmony, not only with the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, but with the Catholic clergy of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. And I may say also, on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of the Protestants of Lower Canada— 
     <lb/>
     the majority of them at all events—that they 
     <lb/>
     are so convinced that there is true liberality 
     <lb/>
     in the hierarchy, in the Catholic clergy of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, as well as in the great 
     <lb/>
     majority of the Roman Catholics of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, that they have no such fears as the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman entertains. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—Of course, it must 
     <lb/>
     be perfectly obvious, that in a matter of this

     kind, what emanates from my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General East will have 
     <lb/>
     very little weight, in comparison with what 
     <lb/>
     emanates from the head of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic Church. Now, I do not accuse my 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian fellow-subjects of anything 
     <lb/>
     like intolerance. But what I say is 
     <lb/>
     this, that there is round for suspicion 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the Protestants of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, knowing what is the position in 
     <lb/>
     which they will be placed, with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic hierarchy, when they 
     <lb/>
     find emanating from the head, the very in<lb break="no"/>spiration and fount of that hierarchy, the 
     <lb/>
     intolerant sentiments I have alluded to. 
     <lb/>
     Why do I mention this? Is it with the 
     <lb/>
     view of raising any difficulty about the 
     <lb/>
     scheme now before us? Quite the reverse. 
     <lb/>
     I speak in time—I speak to assure my co<lb break="no"/>religionists in Lower Canada—to elicit the 
     <lb/>
     declaration of tolerant and generous senti<lb break="no"/>ments on the part of Roman Catholic mem<lb break="no"/>bers ; I speak in earnest warning now, that 
     <lb/>
     there may be no necessity for it hereafter. 
     <lb/>
     I need scarcely declare what are my own 
     <lb/>
     sentiments—those of every British Protest<lb break="no"/>ant; we grant cheerfully to our Roman

     Catholic fellow-countrymen that which we

     when I say there is a feeling of distrust on

     the part of a great many of the Protestants

     of Lower Canada. And I speak what I

     know, when I say that what I have quoted 
     <lb/>
     as emanating from the head of the Roman

     <lb/>
     distrust. It must be evident, that if we are

     in the future to progress amicably and well, 
     <lb/>
     it is better we should speak honestly before 
     <lb/>
     we enter into this compact, and that we

     should all strive to guard against any system 
     <lb/>
     being carried out, or any course pursued,

     matters not in the least to me. I have 
     <lb/>
     simply discharged what I conceived a duty 
     <lb/>
     to my fellow-religionists in Lower Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     bring to the knowledge of honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men of the Roman Catholic persuasion what 
     <lb/>
     many of them seem to have been ignorant of. 
     <lb/>
     And it is all nonsense to endeavor to ignore 
     <lb/>
     the fact that I have brought before them. 
     <lb/>
     We know that in some Roman Catholic coun<lb break="no"/>tries absolute intolerance prevails. In Spain, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, not a Protestant church is al<lb break="no"/>lowed to be erected throughout the whole 
     <lb/>
     length and breadth of that country. It is of 
     <lb/>
     no use, therefore, for honorable gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     jeer at what I say ; and when an edict of in<lb break="no"/>tolerance is again promulgated aud sent out 
     <lb/>
     to the world, emanating from the very head 
     <lb/>
     of the Romish Church, is it surprising, when 
     <lb/>
     the Protestants of Lower Canada are in a 
     <lb/>
     small minority, and know that they will be at 
     <lb/>
     the mercy of the hierarchy entertaining those 
     <lb/>
     views, that they should feel some reluctance 
     <lb/>
     to be left in that position. I know this very 
     <lb/>
     well, that the generality of Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     in this country would avow, as they have 
     <lb/>
     done, their opposition to the sentiment I have 
     <lb/>
     quoted. I call upon them practically to dis<lb break="no"/>avow it, and I have confidence that they will 
     <lb/>
     do so. Whether they like the dilemma in 
     <lb/>
     which they are placed, or not, is another mat<lb break="no"/>ter. (Hear, hear.) Composed, as our society 
     <lb/>
     is, of those different elements, when we have 
     <lb/>
     to discuss matters similar to that before us, 
     <lb/>
     when we have to adopt a scheme involving 
     <lb/>
     the interests of minorities and sections, it is 
     <lb/>
     right that we should do so frankly and hon<lb break="no"/>estly one to the other, and face to face. I 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:DENI2">MR. DENIS</persName>—Will the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     allow me to put to him a question ? Since the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member has referred to this letter 
     <lb/>
     from the head of the Church, does he enter<lb break="no"/>tain the opinion that any honorable member 
     <lb/>
     has a right to come here and criticise in a 
     <lb/>
     similar way the mode of procedure of Protest<lb break="no"/>ant clergymen? If so, how are we to get 
     <lb/>
     along at all? The honorable member may 
     <lb/>
     have his own opinions in regard to this letter, 
     <lb/>
     but he ought not to state them on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     the House, for if he does so any other honor<lb break="no"/>able member has the right to come here and 
     <lb/>
     critise the conduct of respectable clergymen 
     <lb/>
     of the Free Church, of the Episcopal Church, 
     <lb/>
     or of any other Protestant Church, and make 
     <lb/>
     such comments as he thinks fit. This ought 
     <lb/>
     not to be. Then, the honorable member said 
     <lb/>
     the letter ought to be looked upon with sus<lb break="no"/>picion. Well, all I can say is, that if we go 
     <lb/>
     into a chapter on suspicions, every man ought 
     <lb/>
     to be suspicious. We might bring suspicions 
     <lb/>
     to bear upon everything, however respectable 
     <lb/>
     it may be, and in this way it would be impos<lb break="no"/>sible with frankness to deal with anything. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend uses the word "hierarchy." 
     <lb/>
     Well, a word even does damage sometimes. 
     <lb/>
     My honorable friend may have his opinion 
     <lb/>
     upon these things, and that opinion ought to 
     <lb/>
     be respected, because I believe it to be an 
     <lb/>
     honest opinion ; but if he has a right to speak 
     <lb/>
     of " Romish" and all that sort of thing in 
     <lb/>
     connection with our Church, we will have a 
     <lb/>
     right to speak in a disrespectful manner of 
     <lb/>
     ministers of the Free Church, of the High 
     <lb/>
     Church, of the Low Church, and of all the 
     <lb/>
     other kinds of churches, and bad feeling will 
     <lb/>
     be created to no purpose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, when<lb break="no"/>ever any one who has the right or authority 
     <lb/>
     to speak for Protestants enunciates such a 
     <lb/>
     doctrine as that which has emanated from the 
     <lb/>
     Pope of Rome, I am quite willing it should 
     <lb/>
     be thrown in my teeth on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House. I will tell my honorable friend who has 
     <lb/>
     just addressed me, what he ought to have been 
     <lb/>
     aware of, that there is no analogy whatever— 
     <lb/>
     no similarity whatever—between the Pope of 
     <lb/>
     the Church of Rome and any minister of any 
     <lb/>
     other body of Christians. I would dismiss 
     <lb/>
     this subject, sir, by simply stating that I have 
     <lb/>
     used terms ordinarily employed and have 
     <lb/>
     been anxious to do so in no offensive manner. 
     <lb/>
     Some of the reasons given for the opposition 
     <lb/>
     which has been offered to the scheme now 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     before the House are, that it is not perfect, 
     <lb/>
     and that it embraces principles which would 
     <lb/>
     endanger the working of the projected Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. Now, of course, sir, the scheme in 
     <lb/>
     one sense is not perfect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—Any Constitution 
     <lb/>
     drawn up to meet the circumstances under 
     <lb/>
     which the five, I may say the six, provinces 
     <lb/>
     were situated must necessarily present appa 
     <lb/>
     rent inconsistencies. Concessions and mutual 
     <lb/>
     compromise must inevitably be consented to 
     <lb/>
     if we are to have union at all. It does not 
     <lb/>
     manifest any extraordinary degree of acute<lb break="no"/>ness in order to be able to discover the possi<lb break="no"/>ble difficulties that may arise from it. Hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen who have spoken against it 
     <lb/>
     have magnified the dangers of collision, and 
     <lb/>
     especially has the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Brome done so. I am of opinion, sir, that if 
     <lb/>
     the same rigid and hostile analysis were made 
     <lb/>
     of any form of government, or of any consti<lb break="no"/>tution, monarchical or republican, originated 
     <lb/>
     for uniting separate and distinct peoples to<lb break="no"/>gether, it would not be difficult to foresee 
     <lb/>
     dangers of collision as likely to flow therefrom. 
     <lb/>
     Were the British Constitution itself subjected 
     <lb/>
     to the same kind of dissection, flaws and com<lb break="no"/>promises might be detected, and possible dan<lb break="no"/>gers be foretold. In the Constitution pro<lb break="no"/>posed for our adoption, as with all others, the 
     <lb/>
     successful working of it must mainly depend 
     <lb/>
     upon the characters and principles of the men 
     <lb/>
     who have to work it. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Brome certainly attempted to make the 
     <lb/>
     worst of these resolutions, and endeavored to 
     <lb/>
     point out, in almost every feature, defects 
     <lb/>
     which he thought might endanger the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the people. He dwelt particularly upon 
     <lb/>
     the apparent facilities for the development of 
     <lb/>
     what is called in this country "log-rolling." 
     <lb/>
     He said we might find the Maritime Provinces 
     <lb/>
     working with each other, and with Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada against Upper Canada, and vice versa. 
     <lb/>
     Well, it must be obvious, sir, that the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman's objections in this respect 
     <lb/>
     applied with as much force to a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union as to a Federal union, and yet my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend is himself in favor of a legisla— 
     <lb/>
     tive union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I must set my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend right. My honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Brome—who is now absent—said he was op<lb break="no"/>posed to any other union than that at present 
     <lb/>
     existing between the provinces ; and his whole 
     <lb/>
     argument went to show that he was opposed to 
     <lb/>
     any other tie than that now existing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. McGEE</persName>—If the honorable

            <pb n="645" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0645.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">645</fw>
           
     gentleman will permit me, I may say that I 
     <lb/>
     followed the honorable member for Brome 
     <lb/>
     very closely, and that according to my under<lb break="no"/>standing he expressed himself in favor of Fed<lb break="no"/>eration, but without a union such as that now 
     <lb/>
     proposed. His argument was  that we should 
     <lb/>
     federate with the imperial Government, and 
     <lb/>
     that there should be a Council in London. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
          HON. MR. HOLTON—That was another 
     <lb/>
     point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. McGEE—No, it was this point : 
     <lb/>
     His proposal was—and he is the only member 
     <lb/>
     on the other side who has ventured to put 
     <lb/>
     forth a counter-proposition to that now before 
     <lb/>
     the House—that we should have a Council 
     <lb/>
     similar to that for the East Indies. I intend 
     <lb/>
     to reply to this proposition when the proper 
     <lb/>
     time comes. But my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Peterborough is quite right in what he has 
     <lb/>
     stated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         COL. HAULTAIN—I am of opinion that 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Brome, if he did 
     <lb/>
     not desire it at the present time, at any rate 
     <lb/>
     expressed himself in favor of union at some 
     <lb/>
     future time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. HOLTON—A legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     if a union at all. But he really did not want 
     <lb/>
     any other than that now existing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         COL. HAULTAIN—That is precisely 
     <lb/>
     what I said, and I maintain that the very 
     <lb/>
     same arguments which I have alluded to as 
     <lb/>
     used against a Federal union, might likewise 
     <lb/>
     be urged against a Legislative union—that 
     <lb/>
     there would be the same amount of " log<lb break="no"/>rolling " in the latter as in the former. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. BROWN—And a great deal 
     <lb/>
     more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         COL. HAULTAIN—Certainly as much. 
     <lb/>
     I think my honorable friend from North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON) used the 
     <lb/>
     same argument, and yet I believe he is in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
        <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I am. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         COL. HAULTAIN—But my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend must see that this argument against 
     <lb/>
     the Federal union might be  urged with equal 
     <lb/>
    cogency against any union at all.      
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>      MR. M. C. CAMERON—I may, perhaps, 
     <lb/>be allowed to say that my position is just this, 
     <lb/>that a legislative union would be preferable, 
     <lb/>because the people would enter into it with 
     <lb/>the design of working for the harmony and 
     <lb/>advantage of the people ; whereas, if a Fed<lb break="no"/>eral union were entered into, the local interests 
     <lb/>of each province would predominate over the 
     <lb/>interests of the whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
         COL. HAULTAIN—I think in this point 
     <lb/>
     of view the argument is rather in favor of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the Federal principle, which does remove 
     <lb/>
     some of the causes of the difficulty, in so far 
     <lb/>
     as local matters are removed from the juris<lb break="no"/>diction of the General Government, and are 
     <lb/>
     left to that of the local governments. But 
     <lb/>
     looking at it in every point of view ; consider<lb break="no"/>ing the greater expense, the danger of colli<lb break="no"/>sion between the governments, and the compa<lb break="no"/>rative division of sovereignty under the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral system, I am decidedly in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     closer and more simple form of government  
     <lb/>
     secured by a legislative union. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But I would remark to those who oppose the 
     <lb/>
     former because of their professed desire to see 
     <lb/>
     the adoption of the latter, that in attacking 
     <lb/>
     the Federal scheme in the manner alluded to, 
     <lb/>
     they are only putting arguments into the 
     <lb/>
     mouths of those who are opposed to any union 
     <lb/>
     at all. They should also take into considera<lb break="no"/>tion, that it is admitted on all sides that a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union is unattainable, and there<lb break="no"/>fore, practically, we need not now discuss 
     <lb/>
     their comparative merits. It appears to me 
     <lb/>
     but a useless waste of time to advocate a cer<lb break="no"/>tain system of union with others, and to make 
     <lb/>
     such advocacy the ground for opposing a prac<lb break="no"/>ticable union, when those with whom we are 
     <lb/>
     to unite, and who are free to make their own 
     <lb/>
     choice, pronounce against it. (Hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     have to consult the wishes of six independent 
     <lb/>
     provinces ; and if five of them oppose a legis<lb break="no"/>lative union, what sense or justice is there in 
     <lb/>making our preference for it an argument 
     <lb/>against the only union that all will consent to, 
     <lb/>unless indeed it is urged that no union is 
     <lb/>better than a Federal one. In again referring 
     <lb/>to the remarks of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>Brome, I feel bound to say that I listened 
     <lb/>with great pleasure to the microscopic 
     <lb/>analysis to which he subjected the proposed 
     <lb/>scheme. He was, however, only satisfied with 
     <lb/>picturing all the possible dangers to which we 
     <lb/>might be exposed in the working of it. He 
     <lb/>dwelt with a certain kind of satisfaction on 
     <lb/>the succession of knaves and fools to whom 
     <lb/>might be  committed our future destiny under 
     <lb/>it ; the possibility that its very adoption 
     <lb/>would call into existence a race of public men 
     <lb/>devoid of all moral worth and ordinary in<lb break="no"/>telligence. But, sir, I wish to take a prac<lb break="no"/>tical, common sense view of this question, 
     <lb/>and I think the country will be inclined to do 
     <lb/>the same. Were a similar dissection made of 
     <lb/>the provisions or institutions regulating human 
     <lb/>society in any of its diversified combinations, 
     <lb/>dangers and difficulties might be magnified, 
     <lb/>and all patriotism, virtue and justice consigned 
     <lb/>to the grave of the past ; this would apply 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="646" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0646.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">646</fw>
            
     equally to all associations, whether of a com<lb break="no"/>mercial, political or national character. Ap<lb break="no"/>ply it to our own position at this moment. 
     <lb/>
    We meet here to conduct the affairs of the 
     <lb/>country ; the forms and rules laid down for 
     <lb/>our guidance are the result of the wisdom 
     <lb/>and experience of centuries, and yet half a 
     <lb/>dozen unprincipled men, if so determined, 
     <lb/>might obstruct all business and prevent the 
     <lb/>working of our system of government. The 
     <lb/>only practical conclusion I can draw from  
     <lb/>such an analysis would be to abolish all gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and abandon all association. My 
     <lb/>honorable friend went too far ; he strengthened 
     <lb/>the position of those it was his avowed ob<lb break="no"/>ject to assail. It was obvious to my own 
     <lb/>mind that every day experience, under approx<lb break="no"/>imately similar circumstances, swept away the 
     <lb/>array of dangers and disasters he conjured up, 
     <lb/>and happily gave us hope that men might 
     <lb/>arise equal to the occasion that in the future 
     <lb/>might arise. Our own political difficulties 
     <lb/>may be pointed to as the opposite to this 
     <lb/>experience. The essential difference lies in 
     <lb/>this. Felt injustice creates our present diffi<lb break="no"/>culties, whereas, with all the supposed defects 
     <lb/>of the scheme before us, palpable injustice to 
     <lb/>any section cannot be charged against it ; and 
     <lb/>in our dilemma have we not had the men 
     <lb/>equal to the occasion ? If we have men at the 
     <lb/>head of our affairs, desirous of acting justly 
     <lb/>and uprightly, there is nothing that I have 
     <lb/>heard from the honorable member for Brome, 
     <lb/>the chief opponent of the measure, to create ap<lb break="no"/>prehension for the future. It certainly is incum<lb break="no"/>bent upon the Opposition, if they are dissatis<lb break="no"/>fied with this scheme, considering all the 
     <lb/>circumstances of our position, to lay before the 
     <lb/>House and country some proposition in lieu 
     <lb/>of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
         HON. Mr. HOLTON — What do you say 
     <lb/>
    to the maintenance of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi>?  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         COL. HAULTAIN—I need hardly remind 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend, who is now one of the 
     <lb/>
     leaders of the Opposition, of his own admis<lb break="no"/>sions that it is neither just nor possible to 
     <lb/>
     remain in <hi rendition="simple:italic"><choice><sic>statu quo</sic></choice><corr>status quo</corr></hi>.   He has before said that 
     <lb/>
     the union, as at present constituted between 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada, could not continue. 
     <lb/>
     And he is quite right. We cannot remain as 
     <lb/>
     we are. So said also my honorable friend the 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga (Hon. A. A.  DORIAN), 
     <lb/>
     the present leader of the Opposition. He 
     <lb/>
     has expressly stated that some change was 
     <lb/>
     necessary. So far we are agreed. A new 
     <lb/>
     political combination has been accordingly 
     <lb/>
     devised, and the advocates of it say to the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     Opposition that if they do not like the scheme, 
     <lb/>then they are bound on their own admission,<lb/>as patriotic men, to submit something else.<lb/>Then only will they have a sufficient excuse<lb/>for rejecting what is proposed as a solution of<lb/>our difficulties. (Hear, hear.) The only <lb/>honorable gentleman who has offered any<lb break="no"/>thing in substitution for Federal union is the<lb/>honorable member for Brome. I confess, sir,<lb/>that it was with surprise and something akin<lb/>to disappointment, that I heard the conclu<lb break="no"/>sion, the summing up, of my honorable<lb/>friend's very able speech. No one can deny<lb/>to him acuteness of intellect and great analy<lb break="no"/>tic powers of mind, and it was without doubt<lb/>an intellectual repast to which he for some<lb/>hours treated us. But, sir, what a waste of<lb/>mental energy, how fruitless his intellectual<lb/>toil ! What has his country profited by his<lb/>exertions ? Has he proposed something<lb/>worthy the elaborate dissection we had listened<lb/>to ? Did he address himself to the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties in which his country is placed, and pro<lb break="no"/>pound a Constitution harmonious and faultless ?<lb/>What did he, sir, propose for drawing together<lb/>these isolated fragments of the British Em<lb break="no"/>pire, consolidating them into one, and thereby<lb/>adding to their future strength and prosperity ?<lb/>
    To meet all those urgent wants and diversified 
     <lb/>interests, he proposes to appoint " a Colonial 
     <lb/>Council in London, something like the Indian 
     <lb/>Council, to which our Ministers from the 
     <lb/>various colonies might be sent to consult with 
     <lb/>Her Majesty on  affairs concerning those prov<lb break="no"/>inces." (Hear, hear.) And what is this 
     <lb/>Indian Council that my honorable friend 
     <lb/>would prefer to the broad union we propose 
     <lb/>in order to bring those provinces together, 
     <lb/>which have been too long separated ? What 
     <lb/>is the position of India, and what the object and 
     <lb/>composition of the Council of India ? That 
     <lb/>vast country is a conquered appanage of the 
     <lb/>British Crown. It is governed by a Governor 
     <lb/>in Council, who acts under the orders of the 
     <lb/>Secretary of State, the president of the 
     <lb/>Indian Council in London. The revenue 
     <lb/>and expenditure of the Indian Empire 
     <lb/>are subjected to the control of the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary in Council, and no grant of such 
     <lb/>revenue can be made without the con<lb break="no"/>currence of a majority of the Council. Such, 
     <lb/>sir, is the Council that my honorable friend 
     <lb/>proposed for our consideration, and in the 
     <lb/>adoption of which " we would be taking the 
     <lb/>best means of developing our relations in a 
     <lb/>proper connection with the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try." He further says that " in the present 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="647" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-03_Page_0647.jpg"/>
          
     scheme there was no step of the kind con<lb break="no"/>templated." And who, sir, in his sober 
     <lb/>
     senses would venture to propose such a step ? 
     <lb/>
     It is diflicultto conceive that my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend was serious when recommending it for 
     <lb/>
     our adoption. A more crude and ill-digested 
     <lb/>
     scheme (using his own words) could scarcely 
     <lb/>
     have emanated from his mind. What had 
     <lb/>
     become of all the acuteness and microscopic 
     <lb/>
     power he brought to bear upon the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     of the Quebec Conference ? " A Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Council in London, something like the Indian 
     <lb/>
     Council !" Does he mean that we ought to 
     <lb/>
     have a Council in London which is to direct us 
     <lb/>
     as to our proceedings; which is to send out 
     <lb/>
     governors general to this province from time 
     <lb/>
     to time to dictate the course of ourlegislation, 
     <lb/>
     and instruct us in regard to the expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of our money ?—because the Indian Council, 
     <lb/>
     under the presidency of a Secretary of State, 
     <lb/>
     has control of the whole expenditure of the 
     <lb/>
     means of the East India Company, and the 
     <lb/>
     Governor General of India acts under their 
     <lb/>
     direct supervision and command. I mention 
     <lb/>
     this to shew what position the opponents of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions now before us are in, what 
     <lb/>
     they are reduced to in order to provide some<lb break="no"/>thing as a substitute for what is proposed for 
     <lb/>
     their acceptance.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Surely my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend does not wish to misrepresent the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Brome—to say that he 
     <lb/>
     purposed to substitute for our present govern<lb break="no"/>mental machinery a council similar to the 
     <lb/>
     Indian Council. My honorable friend surely 
     <lb/>
     does not want to impute to the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Brome, in his absence, such an 
     <lb/>
     idea as that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>.—I find it difficult to 
     <lb/>
     impute anything at all. (Laughter.) I have 
     <lb/>
     given his own words and their legitimate 
     <lb/>
     meaning. I could not understand what was 
     <lb/>
     passing in my honorable friend's mind, which 
     <lb/>
     certainly appears to have been in a most ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary state. (Renewed laughter.) From 
     <lb/>
     beginning to end my honorable friend seemed 
     <lb/>
     to be labouring under some hallucination. 
     <lb/>
     (Laugher.) And I cannot help thinking that 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend from Chateauguay (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. HOLTON) is also labouring under the 
     <lb/>
     same hallucination. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I confess I cannot 
     <lb/>
     see the point of the joke. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAUL1">COL. HAULTAIN</persName>—In making these re<lb break="no"/>marks I do not seriously wish to impute to 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Brome a desire that 
     <lb/>
     we should put ourselves into the hands of a 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State and a council at home. I 
     <lb/>
            
            do not suppose that his mind had quite de<lb break="no"/>serted him. But applying something of the 
     <lb/>same kind of analysis to the remarks of that 
     <lb/>honorable member, which he applied to the 
     <lb/>scheme now before the House, it would be 
     <lb/>quite legitimate and fair to conclude that 
     <lb/>such was his meaning. I do not think my 
     <lb/>honorable friend from Brome or the Opposition 
     <lb/>have any reason to pride themselves on the 
     <lb/>scheme he has suggested for our guidance. 
     <lb/>And it is most extraordinary that a man of 
     <lb/>his acuteuess of mind, and of his extended 
     <lb/>information, should so far forget himself as 
     <lb/>seriously to propose for our acceptance, in his 
     <lb/>place in Parliament, after a labored, length<lb break="no"/>ened and able analysis of these resolutions, 
     <lb/>this animalcule which he announced as the 
     <lb/>result of his protracted incubation of eight 
     <lb/>hours' duration. (Laughter.) I am sorry 
     <lb/>my honorable friend is not here to listen to 
     <lb/>what I have thought proper to reply. I need 
     <lb/>not sa that I have made these remarks in the 
     <lb/>most riendly spirit, befitting the friendliness 
     <lb/>and respect that I cordially entertain towards 
     <lb/>him. When, Mr. SPEAKER, I think of the 
     <lb/>smallness of the objections and of the greatness 
     <lb/>of the subjects involved, I cannot help seeing 
     <lb/>that it is much to the interest of the British 
     <lb/>Empire, as certainly it is altogether to our 
     <lb/>interest, that the scheme now before us should 
     <lb/>go forward to fruition. I should have liked, had 
     <lb/>time permitted, to have said a few words as to 
     <lb/>the remarkable concurrence of circumstances 
     <lb/>which has taken place in connection with the 
     <lb/>present movement, and to the no less remarka<lb break="no"/>ble unanimity which on the whole prevailed at 
     <lb/>the Conference. At the time of the assembling 
     <lb/>of that body, we heard from all quarters of 
     <lb/>the extreme difficulty—the almost impossi<lb break="no"/>bility of getting so many men of widely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent opinions, and representing so many 
     <lb/>diverse interests, to come to a mutual under<lb break="no"/>standing. It could only have been accom<lb break="no"/>plished by the unanimous desire that seemed 
     <lb/>to prevail to accomplish the object that 
     <lb/>brought them together. And now that we 
     <lb/>have secured a scheme, to which the leading 
     <lb/>men of all the provinces have assented, are 
     <lb/>we to throw it on one side, and adopt 
     <lb/>some such miserable thing in its stead as 
     <lb/>that proposed by my honorable friend the 
     <lb/>member for Brome? We have yet to learn 
     <lb/>what other members of the Opposition may be 
     <lb/>able to produce; but I hope,  for their own 
     <lb/>credit's sake, they will submit something more 
     <lb/>suited to the gravity of our position. As 
     <lb/>between the two schemes yet suggested, I can 
     <lb/>have no difficulty in making my selection. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Much has been said, and I believe felt also, 
     <lb/>
     about the uncertainty of our future. We are 
     <lb/>
     forcibly reminded that the future is not in our 
     <lb/>
     own hands; neither by any prudence or wisdom 
     <lb/>
     of our own, can we determine it. We are 
     <lb/>
     from day to day debating upon our present 
     <lb/>
     position, devising new arrangements for the 
     <lb/>
     future, and discussing the probabilities of their 
     <lb/>
     success or failure. It proclaims our own im<lb break="no"/>potence and our absolute dependence upon a 
     <lb/>
     higher Power. I feel deeply, sir—and I make 
     <lb/>
     no apology for expressing it—that we ought 
     <lb/>
     to look above for Divine guidance; and I 
     <lb/>
     regret that our religious differences should so 
     <lb/>
     operate as to prevent our performing together 
     <lb/>
     a public act of invoking God's blessing on our 
     <lb/>
     proceedings, without which all our deliberations 
     <lb/>
     will fail of success. (Cheers.)

  <!-- PG, 2017-10-24, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day --> 
            <p>
     MONDAY, March 6, 1865. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>— 
     <lb/>Before the debate on the resolutions in your 
     <lb/>hands, Mr. SPEAKER, is continued, I wish 
     <lb/>to say a few words. The Government is 
     <lb/>well aware that the House must naturally feel 
     <lb/>anxious and desirous of information—and 
     <lb/>that no doubt questions will be asked—as 
     <lb/>to the course which the Government will 
     <lb/>pursue in consequence of the news that has 
     <lb/>been received from the Province of New 
     <lb/>Brunswick, with reference to the result of 
     <lb/>the elections in that province. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The Government are quite prepared to state 
     <lb/>their policy on the question before the 
     <lb/>House, in view of that information. Although 
     <lb/>we have no official information as to the 
     <lb/>result of those elections, and would not be 
     <lb/>justified, constitutionally, in making up our 
     <lb/>minds as to that result, until the Legislature 
     <lb/>of New Brunswick has declared itself either 
     <lb/>for or against the Confederation scheme; 
     <lb/>yet we know, as a matter of fact—and we 
     <lb/>cannot shut our eyes to the fact—that the 
     <lb/>Premier and several of his colleagues 
     <lb/>in the Government of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     have been defeated, and that so far 
     <lb/>
     there has been a declaration against 
     <lb/>
     the policy of Federation. Of course, 
     <lb/>
    in a general election, it is not to be supposed 
     <lb/>that the question of Confederation is the 
     <lb/>only one discussed at the polls. Being a 
     <lb/>general election, there was the usual fight 
     <lb/>between the ins and the outs, the Minister<lb break="no"/>ialists and the Opposition; and, of course, a 
     <lb/>lot of other influences were at work, such as 
     <lb/>questions between the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>on the one hand, and lines of railway to 
     <lb/>connect with the United States on the other. 
     <lb/>Still, we should not be treating the House 
     <lb/>with candor if we did not state that we must 
     <lb/>consider the result of those elections as a 
     <lb/>check upon the Confederation project. The 
     <lb/>Canadian Government however, I may say 
     <lb/>at once, do not consider that the result of 
     <lb/>these elections should in any way alter their 
     <lb/>policy or their course upon this question. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) They wish it to be most de<lb break="no"/>cidedly understood, that instead of thinking 
     <lb/>ita reason for altering their course, they 
     <lb/>regard it as an additional reason for prompt 
     <lb/>and vigorous action. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>do not consider that in these events to which 
     <lb/>I have alluded, there is any cause whatever 
     <lb/>for the abandonment of the project, or for 
     <lb/>its postponement. In fact, the only reason 
     <lb/>why we should consider them to be a matter 
     <lb/>of grave import is, that they form the first 
     <lb/>check that the project has received since 
     <lb/>the question was submitted to the people of 
     <lb/>these provinces, at the time of the formation 
     <lb/>of the present Government of Canada. If 
     <lb/>we only look back to June last, and then 
     <lb/>regard the present condition of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, we cannot but feel surprise at the 
     <lb/>advance which has been made. In June 
     <lb/>last we would have been satisfied if we could 
     <lb/>have contemplated that so soon as this the 
     <lb/>question would even have been favorably 
     <lb/>entertained by the governments of the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent provinces. But, within the short 
     <lb/>period which has since elapsed, a conference 
     <lb/>has been held, and the measure framed by 
     <lb/>that conference has received the sanction of 
     <lb/>the governments of all the provinces, and 
     <lb/>each of the governments of the five colonies 
     <lb/>is pledged to submit, not only the question 
     <lb/>of Confederation, but the scheme as pre<lb break="no"/>pared by the Conference, to the legislature 
     <lb/>of each of those provinces. And we have 
     <lb/>gained more than this. Not only has every 
     <lb/>government of every colony been pledged 
     <lb/>to the scheme, and pledged also to use all 
     <lb/>its legitimate influence as a Government to 
     <lb/>
