               <br />
               in such a way; they would not venture to do

               my really diﬁcult matter of this kind for a 
               <br />
               long time. This House had rejected the 
               <br />
               Squatters’ Bill, as it was called, seven or eight 
               <br />

               <br />
               derstanding between them. Indœd the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> 
               <br />
               had been of the best. The hon. life-member 
               <br />
               from Cobourg [Hon. Mr. BOULTON , whom 
               <br />
               he did not see in his place, had, by t e force 
               <br />
               of reasoning, convinced the House that the 
               <br />
               bill was destructive of the rights of property, 
               <br />
               and the consequence was that, year by year, 
               <br />
               the measure had been pruned of its most of- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fensive</span> features, until now, as he was informed, 
               <br />
               it was hardly open to objection. He could not 
               <br />
               recall mother instance of persistent diﬂ'erence 
               <br />
               of opinion between the Chambers. The real 
               <br />
               danger of collision would be where one Cham- 
               <br />
               ber invaded the prerogatives of the other, and 
               <br />
               that danger, if it existed at all, would be great- 
               <br />
               ly increased were the Legislative Council made 
               <br />
               elective. (Hear, hear.) If the members were 
               <br />
               elected they might say, “We come from the 
               <br />
               peuple just as directly as the members of the 
               <br />
               Assembly do, and our authority is, therefore, as 
               <br />
               full and complete as theirs. N ay,more,for where 
               <br />
               weeach represent 1000 electors, they only each 
               <br />
               represent 300, and we have, therefore, as much 
               <br />
               right to initiate money bills and impost bills as 
               <br />
               they have." Make the Council purely elective, 
               <br />
               and he would not promise that an agitation 
               <br />
               of this kind would not spring up. It had 
               <br />
               not been a theme as yet on the ﬂoor of the 
               <br />

               course of time to urge it on to do so, and im-

               mediately the spirit of the Assembly would 
               <br />
               be aroused to resistance. This would be the 
               <br />
               way to provoke collisions, and with an elective 
               <br />

               bowed to every breeze and instantly yielded

               <br />
               bound to resist, and public opinion which 
               <br />
               generally came out right in the end, would 
               <br />
               sustain it in such an attitude. But there was 
               <br />
               very much less danger in countries like this 
               <br />
               that difference of opinion would even be as 
               <br />
               frequent between the Legislative Chambers as 
               <br />
               between the Lords and Commons in En land. 
               <br />
               and the reason was clear: our ' ativo 
               <br />
               Councillors would not come from so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iﬂemnt</span> 
               <br />
               a class of society to the general population, as 
               <br />
               the peers of the British nation, compared 
               <br />
               with the people of that nation. The lords 
               <br />
               had ideas of caste and privileges which none of- 
               <br />
               our people were imbrued with, and the common 
               <br />
               sympathy existing between all classes here 
               <br />
               would be felt equally by the Legislative 
               <br />
               Councillors and the Members bf the Assembly. 
               <br />
               Both would be equally subjected to ular 
               <br />
               inﬂuences and be more or less control by 
               <br />
               them. The interests of the Legislative Coun- 
               <br />
               cillor, though a nominee of the Crown, would 
               <br />
               be the same as those of the mass, and the 
               <br />
               legislation which would be good for them 
               <br />
               would, as a general thing, be good for him 
               <br />
               too. He would have no ancestral estates, 
               <br />
               privileges, immunities and titles 'to protect, 
               <br />
               like the peers of England. He would be 
               <br />
               affected by the social <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changes</span> which aﬂ'ectod 
               <br />
               others, and would be move by the same aims 
               <br />
               and aspirations as his friends around him. 
               <br />
               This being the case, it was not very probable 
               <br />
               that his Opinions would even be set in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">caesi-</span>
