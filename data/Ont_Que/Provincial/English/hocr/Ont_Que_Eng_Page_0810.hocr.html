               <br />
               is the very reason that makes it desirable to 
               <br />
               the English speaking population of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. We are in favor of a legislative 
               <br />
               union. We desire that Canada should be a 
               <br />
               united people, ignoring seetionalism, and has- 
               <br />

               of Canadian nationality, which shall blend all

               Our French-Canadian fellow-subjects will not

               consent to this. If they will not hear our 
               <br />
               arguments, let them listen to their own. If 
               <br />
               Federalism is necessary for the protection of 
               <br />
               their rights, it is necessary in a tenfold degree 
               <br />
               for the protection of the rights of the English

               them by right. It would be unworthy of us 
               <br />
               to submit to such humiliation. In these 
               <br />
               remarks which are forced from me, and which 
               <br />
               I am compelled to make in defence of the

               rights and liberties of those who sent me here, 
               <br />
               I mean no disrespect to those of another origin

               fellow-subjects in peace. Idesire to maintain 
               <br />
               those amicable relations which have always 
               <br />
               subsisted between the English-speaking and 
               <br />
               the French-Canadian populations of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. As I said before, I sympathise with 
               <br />
               my French-Canadian fellow-subjects in many 
               <br />
               respects. I respect their character, I admire 
               <br />
               their laws. But this antagonism is not courted 
               <br />
               by me. It is forced upon me. Let me call 
               <br />
               the attention of honorable gentlemen, more
