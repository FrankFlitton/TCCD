               an honorable destiny. (Hear, hear.) I am 
               <br />
               well satisﬁed that the more this question is 
               <br />
               discussed—notwithstanding the remarks of 
               <br />
               some hon. gentlemen to the contrary—the 
               <br />
               more the question is discussed and ventilat- 
               <br />
               ed, the greater will be the dissatisfaction of 
               <br />
               the peOple with it. I have received but one 
               <br />
               letter from my constituents on the point, and 
               <br />
               the simple reference of that writer is this: 
               <br />
               “ Do not on vote for the Intercolonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rail-</span> 
               <br />
               way.” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fie</span> says, “ Ishould like Federation ; 
               <br />
               but do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vote</span> for the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way.” But, hon. gentlemen, whether I had 
               <br />
               received such an admonition or not, I could 
               <br />
               not see my way clear to vote for the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions as they now stand. I have paid all 
               <br />
               possible attention to the speeches which have 
               <br />
               been delivered in this chamber. I have list 
               <br />
               ened with every degree of re— <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pectful</span> attention 
               <br />
               to the hon. and gallant Knight who leads the 
               <br />
               Government, and also to his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon;</span> colleague 
               <br />
               the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and I 
               <br />
               should be happy if it were in my power to 
               <br />
               go with them in the vote which is about to 
               <br />
               be cast. ; but I do not see how that is possible, 
               <br />
               it'I am at the same time to discharge my duty 
               <br />
               to my constituents, to myself, and to my coun- 
               <br />
               try. I can never consent to vote aWay the 
               <br />
               rights which belong to the people, without ﬁrst 
               <br />
               asking the people for their consent. If the 
               <br />
               time is given them necessary to make up 
               <br />
               their minds on this subject, and they then 
               <br />
               say to this House: “ We are willing to try 
               <br />
               this scheme—we are willing to take it with 
               <br />
               all its defects, in the hope that it will be 
               <br />
               found to work well,” I will give my vote for 
               <br />
               it as it now stands. But, in the absence of 
               <br />
               this opportunity being aﬂ'orded, I must say 
               <br />
               that if I an. in the House when the vote is

               HON. Mn. DE BEAUJEU said—Honor- 
               <br />
               able gentlemen, I think it an act of patriotism 
               <br />
               to support the resolutions submitted to us, 
               <br />
               having for their object the Confederation of 
               <br />
               several provinces, so as to bring them into a 
               <br />
               group, with the view of forming a nationality. 
               <br />
               This project will not surprise any one, when 
               <br />
               he recollects that this immense territory is 
               <br />
               occupied by the descendants of the two ﬁrst. 
               <br />
               powers of the world, and that the greatest 
               <br />
               portion of them are of Norman and Breton 
               <br />
               blood. They will also remember that the 
               <br />
               Normans were the most adventurous pioneers, 
               <br />
               ﬁt for all hazardous colonizatious, and daring 
               <br />
               navigators. After having established their 
               <br />
               dominion over the British Islands, and over 
               <br />
               a part of France, Naples, Sicily, even in 
               <br />
               Jerusalem, Antioch, and near Constantinople, 
               <br />
               they crossed the ocean and established them- 
               <br />
               selves on the Canary Islands, and afterwards 
               <br />
               came close on the borders of the Saint Law- 
               <br />
               rence and the Mississippi—a voyage that 
               <br />
               their ancestors had commenced in the environs 
               <br />
               of Novgorod, and where a nucleus of their 
               <br />
               race is yet to be found. The French Cana-

               dian countrymen of this Honorable House 
               <br />

               <br />
               scheme, and it oughtto brin to their memory 
               <br />
               that France had once this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ogject</span> in view, but

               even on a larger scale (having then a territory

               of 1,800 leagues), and of making on this con-
