               being etermined upon, he thought it would 
               <br />
               be necessary to go in upon some principle, but 
               <br />
               that was a most diﬂicult operation. What 
               <br />
               principle could be found applicable to the 
               <br />
               case ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughton)</span> Some inventive genius 
               <br />
               suggested that he might go in on the homeco- 
               <br />
               pathic ’nciple. Well, he ﬁnally went in on 
               <br />
               that principle, and took with him an inﬁni- 
               <br />

               <br />
               laughter.) And the result of his goi in 
               <br />
               on that principle is that we have now a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>

               man, to whom I have alluded, went to the 
               <br />
               country and got returned to his seat in the

               <br />
               ation. Well, when we look at the individual 
               <br />
               and consider that he has been ibr years the 
               <br />
               leading spirit and guidinu genius of a large 
               <br />

               into consideration, it is not at all surprising 
               <br />
               that he. should be returned by acelamation. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) He came back from the coun- 
               <br />
               try and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hm</span> since taken part in the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment; and here I wish to make a few 
               <br />
               observations with reference to the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment as it stands to-day. You must re- 
               <br />
               collect, honorable gentlemen, that we are on- 
               <br />
               joying, or at least have enjoyed, a system of 
               <br />
               government in this count which has a great 
               <br />
               man admirers, and which some honorable 
               <br />
               gent emen admire a great deal more than the 
               <br />
               quality of the people. The system is known 
               <br />
               by the name of Res nsible Government. If 
               <br />
               I understand the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sugeet</span> properly, that system 
               <br />
               of government is deﬁned in this way—that 
               <br />
               the Government of the country must be car- 
               <br />
               ried on according to the well-understood wishes 
               <br />
               of the people, as expressed through their ro- 
               <br />
               presontatives on the ﬂoor of the House of As- 
               <br />
               sembly. (Hear, hear.) Well now, I take 
               <br />
               exception to the formation of the present 
               <br />
               Government, on the ground that it was not 
               <br />
               established on that principle, because they are 
               <br />
               not a government emanating from the people. 
               <br />
               I cannot hold them in the same respect that I 
               <br />
