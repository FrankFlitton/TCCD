               awake to the necessity of having these posts 
               <br />
               defended. If we are to remain independent, 
               <br />
               if we really desire a nationality apart from 
               <br />
               that of the United States, it is necessary that 
               <br />
               we should think of these things, and look them 
               <br />
               fully in the face—to consider it well, and to 
               <br />
               see the absolute necessity of coming to some 
               <br />
               arrangement with the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               as to the prOportion we are mutually to bear. 
               <br />
               If we are really in earnest in our protessed 
               <br />
               desire to maintain our independence, I be- 
               <br />
               lieve we shall be willing to tax ourselves and 
               <br />
               submit to the necessary sacriﬁces. The very 
               <br />
               fact that there is an uncertainty existing in 
               <br />
               the minds of many whether Canada will con— 
               <br />
               sent to be taxed for her defence, is one of 
               <br />
               the strongest grounds, to my mind, why we 
               <br />
               should lose no time in completing the union 
               <br />
               of the British American Provinces. I feel 
               <br />
               that so long as Canada is separated from the 
               <br />
               rest of British America, so long will she be 
               <br />
               without any feeling of nationality. She can- 
               <br />
               not exist here alone. We need to feel that 
               <br />
               there is a nationality on this continent to 
               <br />
               which we are attached; and I know of noth- 
               <br />
               ing more likely to extend our ideas and views, 
               <br />
               so as to embrace the whole of British Ameri- 
               <br />
               ca, than the present project. We are likely 
               <br />
               to view a country such as the Confederation 
               <br />
               would include, as something worth struggling 
               <br />
               for and defending. All other countries of 
               <br />
               the world are satisﬁed to tax themselves for 
               <br />
               their defence, and we ﬁnd countries not so 
               <br />
               numerous in population, and with revenues 
               <br />
               and commerce inferior to ourselves, maintain- 
               <br />
               ing comparatively large standing armies. And 
               <br />
               yet when we talk of our del'ences—when we 
               <br />
               speak oi‘ the taxation which will be necessary 
               <br />
               in order to erect and defend these works 
               <br />
               and to instruct the militia, we hear doubts ex- 
               <br />
               pressed, uncertainties ﬂoating about, whether 
               <br />
               Canada will really consent to hear her 
               <br />
               share of it. It shows to me that there is 
               <br />
               among some a want of a deep-seated feeling 
               <br />
               of nationality, and that that necessary senti— 
               <br />
               ment has yet to be called out and developed. 
               <br />
               Where this does exist the people do not hesi- 
               <br />
               tate to make any sacriﬁce necessary for the 
               <br />
               maintenance of their independence. Other 
               <br />
               countries have manifested their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attachnnnt</span> 
               <br />
               to their nationality and their ﬂag by the

               sacriﬁce of almost everything they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">p….</span> 
               <br />
               Sometimes, however, it is urged that when 
               <br />
               the time arrives Canada will show to the world 
               <br />
               that she is willing to spend her last drop of 
               <br />
               blood in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defence</span> of the soil. This is a very 
               <br />
               proper sentiment, and sounds exceedingly 
               <br />
               well, bl t I cannot help thinking that if those

               who give expression to it wish to shew that 
               <br />
               it can stand the test of trial, they would now 
               <br />
               urge the expenditure necessary to give eﬁ'eet

               <br />
               regarded as mere sentimentalists. The

               <br />
               We may be sure of this, that if we are not

               willing to spend the money that is necessary

               will be a great unwillin uses to spend the 
               <br />
               blood. (Hear, hear.) e ought to consider 
               <br />
               that it is not suﬁicient that we should be

               willing to spend our lives, for these alone 
               <br />
               cannot defend us. If we make no repar-

               <br />
               us? It is unreasonable and foolish to say 
               <br />
               that we will leave everything undone—the 
               <br />
               training of our men, and the strengthening 
               <br />
               of our positions—until the very time when 
               <br />
               our only chance must depend upon our

               having trained men and fortiﬁed positions 
               <br />
               ready to our hand. It would be as reasonable

               have no sympathy with such a sentiment, and 
               <br />
               very little conﬁdence in it. I should like 
               <br />
               rather to see a little practical sense manifested
