               <br />
               er, the Sovereign of Great Britain. (I ear, 
               <br />
               hear.) No one can look into futurity and 
               <br />
               say what will be the destiny of this country. 
               <br />
               Changes come over nations and peoples in 
               <br />
               the course of ages. But, so far as we can 
               <br />
               legislate, we provide that, for all time to 
               <br />
               come, the Sovereign of Great Britain shall 
               <br />
               be the Sovereign of British North America. 
               <br />
               By adhering to the monarchical principle, 
               <br />
               we avoid one defect inherent in the Con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the United States. By the 
               <br />
               election of the President by a majority and 
               <br />
               for a short eriod, he never is the sovereign 
               <br />
               and chief <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the nation. He is never looked 
               <br />
               up to by the whole peo 10 as the bead and 
               <br />
               front of the nation. 0 is at best but the 
               <br />
               successful leader of a party. This defect is 
               <br />
               all the greater on account of the practice of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reelection.</span> During his ﬁrst term of oﬁce, 
               <br />
               he is em loyed in taking steps to secure his 
               <br />
               own re-e cation, and for his party a continu- 
               <br />
               ance of power. We avoid this by adhering 
               <br />
               to the monarchical principle—the Sovereign 
               <br />
               whom you respect and love. I believe that 
               <br />
               it is of the utmost importance to have that 
               <br />
               principle recognized, so that we shall have 
               <br />
               a Sovereign who is placed above the region 
               <br />
               cf party-to whom all parties look up—who 
               <br />
               is not elevated by the action of one 
               <br />
               party nor depressed by the action of an- 
               <br />
               other, who is the common head and sover- 
               <br />
               eign of all. (Hear, hear and cheers.) 
               <br />
               In the Constitution we propose to continue 
               <br />
               the system of Responsible Government,which 
               <br />
               has existed in this province since 1841’, and 
               <br />
               which has long obtained in the Mother 
               <br />
               Country. This is a feature of our Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion as we have it now, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as.</span> we shall have 
               <br />
               it in the Federation, in which, I think, we 
               <br />
               avoid one of the great defects in the Consti- 
               <br />

               with an immense amount of patronage as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head</span> of the Executive, and with the veto

               <br />

               to consult with, unless he chooses to do so.

               bringing on the resent unhappy war in the

               United States. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span> commenced, in fact, at 
               <br />
               the wrong end. They declared by their Con-

               stitution that each state was a sovereignty in 
               <br />
               itself, and that all the powers incident to a 
               <br />
               sovereignty belonged to each state, except 
               <br />
               those powers which, by the Constitution, 
               <br />
               were conferred upon the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment and Congress. Here we have adopted 
               <br />
               a different system. We have strengthened 
               <br />
               the General Government. We have given 
               <br />
               the General Legislature all the great subjects 
               <br />
               of legislation. We have conferred on them, 
               <br />
               not only speciﬁcally and in detail, all the 
               <br />
               powers which are incident to sovereignty, but 
               <br />
               we have expressly declared that all subjects of 
               <br />
               general interest not distinctly and exclusively 
               <br />

               <br />
               have thus avoided that great source of weak-

               ness which has been the cause of the disrup-

               all conﬂict of jurisdiction and authority, and

               antees for local institutions and for local aws, 
               <br />
               which are insisted upon by so many in the 
               <br />
               provinces now, I hope, to be united. I think 
               <br />
               it is well that, in framing our Constitution——

               (Hear, hear.) I believe that, while England 
               <br />
               has no desire to lose her colonies, but wishes 
               <br />
