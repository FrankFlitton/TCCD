               hat article does not represent the views of 
               <br />
               either of the great parties in the British 
               <br />
               _ Parliament. It may be the mind of a few 
               <br />
               isolated individuals; it may represent what 
               <br />
               is called the Manchester School ; and I am 
               <br />
               not surprised at all that they should utter 
               <br />
               sentiments of that character. I believe that 
               <br />
               the Manchester School, being in a measure 
               <br />
               republican in their political tendencies, 
               <br />
               would not be sorry to see us joining the 
               <br />
               great republic to the south, and that it 
               <br />
               would not be a matter for much sorrow to 
               <br />
               them to see us forsaking our allegiance to the 
               <br />
               British Crown, and joining our fortunes 
               <br />
               with those of our neighbors. It behoves us 
               <br />
               to see if there are not some grounds of 
               <br />
               complaint——if there is not some reason 
               <br />
               why the Manchester School should wish to 
               <br />
               get rid of us. It has been well observed that 
               <br />
               the remarks made upon us by our enemies 
               <br />
               are generally more valuable than those 
               <br />
               emanating from our friends. We cannot 
               <br />
               very well afford to despise the opinions 
               <br />
               of our enemies, and we would do well to 
               <br />
               consider, if we desire to perpetuate the 
               <br />
               connection with the Mother Country, whether 
               <br />
               we cannot consistently with our interest 
               <br />
               and honor conciliate every party in Great 
               <br />
               Britain. Believing as I do that our in- 
               <br />
               dependence and prosperity depend upon 
               <br />
               preserving the connection with the Mother 
               <br />
               Country, I would be willing to remove 
               <br />
               every just cause of complaint which may 
               <br />
               ' be found to exist. I believe, further, that 
               <br />
               no man should take part in the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of these provinces who is not alive to 
               <br />
               the importance of this question. And what 
               <br />
               is the ground of complaint made by those 
               <br />
               who hold loosely the connection of the 
               <br />
               colonies with the Crown? The complaint 
               <br />
               is that they are taxed with our defence, 
               <br />
               while we tax the industry of the Mother 
               <br />
               Country, and go directly in opposition to 
               <br />
               the policy adopted by that country ; and 
               <br />
               surely there is some force and truth in this 
               <br />
               complaint. There is no doubt that, as we 
               <br />
               are growing in wealth and numbers, these 
               <br />
               men feel it as an oppression that they should 
               <br />
               continue to be taxed as heavily in order to 
               <br />
               provide means for our defence, and especi- 
               <br />
               ally as, in times past, we have done so little 
               <br />
               ourselves in that direction. As from year 
               <br />
               to year, or decade to decade, we grow in 
               <br />
               numbers and wealth, we ought to consider, 
               <br />
               if we value the connection, in what manner 
               <br />
               we can relieve the Mother Country of the 
               <br />
               expenses entailed upon her for our defence. 
               <br />

               I also hold that, in so far as our ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               position admits of it, we should seek to 
               <br />
               adapt and assimilate our ﬁnancial policy to 
               <br />
               that of Great Britain. If we would continue 
               <br />
               an integral part of that country, we ought 
               <br />
               not to have high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬂ‘s</span> intervening as so 
               <br />
               many barriers to that commercial intercourse 
               <br />
               which should exist between the two coun— 
               <br />
               tries, for these must be provocative of 
               <br />
               soreness and dissatisfaction. I am, however, 
               <br />
               well aware that there are circumstances 
               <br />
               which, at the present time, do not admit of 
               <br />
               such a commercial policy with the Mother 
               <br />
               Country. I merely say we ought constantly 
               <br />
               to keep the matter in view, and that those 
               <br />
               who desire to maintain the connection 
               <br />
               should consider it their dut to decrease the 
               <br />
               tariff as much as it can be one with justice 
               <br />
               to our own position,. and thus remove the 
               <br />
               great cause of complaint on the part of the 
               <br />
               people at home. (Hear, hear.) I have 
               <br />
               alluded, sir, to the Edinburgh Review and 
               <br />
               to the extreme oﬁ'ensiveness of some of its 
               <br />
               passages referring to the colonies. But at 
               <br />
               the same time, there are sentiments en- 
               <br />
               unciated in the very same article, which 
               <br />
               seem to me to contradict the drift of the 
               <br />
               article itself. As we have heard so much 
               <br />
               of this article, and as it has been made the 
               <br />
               ground on which to base the supposition 
               <br />
               that there is a growing desire in England to 
               <br />
               bring to an end her connection with the 
               <br />
