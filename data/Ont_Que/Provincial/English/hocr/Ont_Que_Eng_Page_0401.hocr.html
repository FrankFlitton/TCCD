               <br />
               200 miles, and when once that is got over,

               an immense valley more than a thousand

               Lower Canada in the Confederation, I must 
               <br />
               call attention to the fact that the total popu- 
               <br />
               lation of all the provinces, in 1861, was 
               <br />
               3,300,000 souls, and of these the total num- 
               <br />
               ber of Catholics amounted to 1,494,000. 
               <br />
               Thus they will be numerous enough to 
               <br />
               protect their religious and other interests; 
               <br />
               and those interests will be in a position of 
               <br />
               safety in the local legislatures. We do not 
               <br />
               seek to be allowed privileges which others 
               <br />
               have not ; we only wish that our rights may 
               <br />
               be respected as we respect those of others. 
               <br />
               French-Canadians are not, have never been, 
               <br />
               and will not become persecutors either in 
               <br />

               <br />
               other religions to say whether we have ever 
               <br />
               proved unjust or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persecuzors</span> to them. That

               part of the population of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               which is of foreign origin will have nothing 
               <br />
               to fear under the Local Government, any 
               <br />
               more than we shall have anything to fear 
               <br />
               under the Federal Government. But in
