               pretended by the i norant, that the legislature 
               <br />
               exceeded its rights this enactment; or if that

               <br />
               the ancient Constitution. The law for triennial

               parliaments was of little more than twenty years’ 
               <br />
               continuance. It was an experiment which, as 
               <br />
               was argued, had proved unsuccessful; it was 
               <br />
               subject, like every other law, to be repealed 
               <br />

               serious objection. Everyone admitted that a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">par.</span>

               Crown. But if the period of its continuance

               should thus be extended from three to seven
