               from the systematic colonial oppression which 
               <br />
               I am attempting to describe. Really, Mr.

               SPEAKER, the cause of the Honorable Attor- 
               <br />
               ney General East must be in very great straits 
               <br />
               when he is compelled to resort to such means 
               <br />
               in order to save it. The Honorable Attorney 
               <br />
               General East must have very little conﬁdence 
               <br />
               in thc success of that cause, when he endeavors 
               <br />
               to excite the prejudices of his supporters by 
               <br />
               heaping insults on one of the greatest names 
               <br />
               in our history. Such language on the part 
               <br />
               of the Honorable Attorney General East is 
               <br />
               the more culpable in that he himself was one 
               <br />
               of the rebels of 1837-‘8, and one of the 
               <br />
               most zealous partisans of that great pat- 
               <br />
               riot whom he now insults. Did he not 
               <br />
               himself vote in favor of the ninety-two reso- 
               <br />
               lutions-—that imperishable monument of Can- 
               <br />

               <br />
               upon whose head a price was set, the man 
               <br />
               who was compelled to ﬂy from his country 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and‘to</span> seek from a neighboring country that 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Southern refugee, has the audacity, now 
               <br />
               that he is Attorney General, to call that great 
               <br />
               statesman “Old Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PANNEAU,”</span> and the op-

               position in this House, “ 01d Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PAPINEAU’B</span>

               <br />
               ER, that such expressions are unworthy of this 
               <br />
               House, and unworthy of the position occupied 
               <br />
               by the Honorable Attorney General East, who 
               <br />
               has had the questionable courage to pronounce 
               <br />
               them. (Hear, hear.) Such expressions, if 
               <br />
               they are to be tolerated anywhere, ﬁnd their 
               <br />
               proper place in the common streets, and 
               <br />
               the standard of this House must have fal-

               len very low, when such language is per-
