               <br />
               folly and want of atriotism had condemned 
               <br />
               us to a state of iso ation and weakness, when 
               <br />
               union with our sister rovinces would have 
               <br />
               made us strong, powe ul and prosperous? 
               <br />
               Some honorable gentlemen had such strong 
               <br />
               objections to some of the details of the meas-

               <br />
               House, for instance—that rather than bring 
               <br />
               themselves to vote for it, they were willing to 
               <br />
               run the risk of imperiling the whole scheme. 
               <br />
               For his own part, he thought-it would ill be-

               had been urged that between an Upper House

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               one rejecting an important measure which the 
               <br />
               other had passed, he did not think there was 
               <br />
               much danger of such a contingency. Indeed 
               <br />
               he would remind honorable members that the 
               <br />
               only instance of anything like a dead-lock bc- 
               <br />

               <br />
               within late years, at all events, was since the 
               <br />
               introduction of the elective principle, when the 
               <br />
               Council in 1859 refused to pass the Su ply

               sideration of the question, after bri 'ng up 
               <br />
               some life members from Lower Cana a, that 
               <br />
               the Government carried the vote b a majority 
               <br />
               of two or three. Upon the who e, however, 
               <br />
               he thought that the life members of the

               Council would admit that the elective mem- 
               <br />
               bers had so far, at all events, comported 
               <br />
               themselves in such a way as to maintain 
               <br />
               the character of the House as a conserva— 
               <br />
               tive body, free from all violent party feeling, 
               <br />
               and exercising a wholesome check against all 
               <br />
               ill-considered or hasty legislation. The real 
               <br />
               danger, he thought, was that if the House in 
               <br />
               process of time were to become a purely elec-

               tive body, and party lines became more closely 
               <br />
               drawn, the same partisan spirit which too 
               <br />
               often swayed the proceedings of the popular 
               <br />
               branch of the L ' lature, might ﬁnd its way 
               <br />
               into their cham r, larger powers, such as 
               <br />
               originating money bills, might be claimed, and 
               <br />
               a collision between the two Houses might then 
               <br />
               occur at any time. Another objection raised 
               <br />
               by some honorable gentlemen, was, that this 
               <br />
               measure was being urged upon the Parliament 
               <br />
               and people of this country with undue haste, 
               <br />
               and from the language of some honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen it was quite clear that they did not 
               <br />
               think that our situation was by any means
