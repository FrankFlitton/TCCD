               ought; in the ﬁrst place, to establish easy me-

               about Confederation at some future day, if it 
               <br />
               he practicable. I say that the Intercolonial

               <br />
               Confederation might be put off even several 
               <br />
               years after that. (Hear, hear.) Article 41 
               <br />
               of the resolutions before us says as follows :— 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               The Local Government and Legislature of each 
               <br />
               province shall be constructed in such manner as

               well; but in that case Upper Canada will 
               <br />
               give us a constitution, as we may give her 
               <br />
               one. The effect of that clause will be, that 
               <br />
               in order to the organization of its local eon- 
               <br />
               stitution, Lower Canada will stand with 47 
               <br />
               French-Canadian votes, against 83 votes of 
               <br />
               members of other origins. We shall there- 
               <br />
               fore not stand on the same footing as New 
               <br />
               Brunswick or Nova Scotia in this respect; 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> will be very great. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) We have only 47 French-Can- 
               <br />
               adian votes out of 130, and we could 
               <br />
               not count on Upper Canadian members 
               <br />
               for the safety of our interests—either local 
               <br />
               or religious-—whereas they would have the

               <br />

               <br />
               our civil laws will be maintained. Why 
               <br />
               then establish a Federal Court of Appeals, 
               <br />
               in which appeals will lie from the decisions 
               <br />

               <br />
               by the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%dinister</span> of Finance, that the 
               <br />
               resolutions did not create a Court of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Appeals,</span> 
               <br />
               but only gave the Federal Parliament the 
               <br />
               power to create it. But what difference is 
               <br />
               there between creating the court forthwith 
               <br />
               and granting a right to create it hereafter? 
               <br />
               The principle is the same. If the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment may lawfully create such a court, no one 
               <br />
               can prevent the Federal Goverhment from 
               <br />
               establishing it whenever they think ﬁt. Would 
               <br />
               this tribunal be an advantage to us French- 
               <br />
               Canadians, who are so attached to our civil 
               <br />
               code? It will be composed of_ judges from 
               <br />
               all the provinces—from New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, Upper Canada, &amp;e. ; and not. 
               <br />
               withstanding the talents and the learning 
               <br />
               of all those judges, we Lower Canadians 
               <br />
               cannot hope to ﬁnd the same justice from 
               <br />
               such a tribunal as we should receive from 
               <br />
               one consisting of judges from Lower Canada; 
               <br />
               for our laws being different from the laws of 
               <br />
               those provinces, they will not be able to 
               <br />
