               able speech which he delivered the other day, 
               <br />
               and to which all who heard him must have 
               <br />
               listened with very great pleasure, enunci-

               ated his views in his usual forcible and 
               <br />
               lucid style; and whether there is a coinci- 
               <br />
               dence of opinion with him or not, one cannot 
               <br />
               but respect the intelligence, moderation and 
               <br />
               candor with which he expresses his views. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I trust that in giving my opin- 
               <br />
               ion upon some points of his remarks I shall 
               <br />
               be guilty of no want of courtesy although 
               <br />
               diﬁ'ering from him. (Hear.) The lion. 
               <br />
               gentleman, at the outset of his remarks, said 
               <br />
               that this Constitution, in order to be strong, 
               <br />
               “must be planted deep in the hearts and 
               <br />
               aﬂections of the people,” and that “there 
               <br />
               would be no good hope of its permanency 
               <br />
               without this.” So true and correct is this 
               <br />
               position, that if I did not believe, honestly 
               <br />
               believe, that the Constitution which we are 
               <br />
               now discussing commanded the approbation of 
               <br />
               a large majority of the people—I am speak— 
               <br />
               ing now more particularly of the section of 
               <br />
               the province to which I belong—I would 
               <br />
               be one of those to advocate our delaying its 
               <br />
               passage until we ascertained beyond all doubt 
               <br />
               what the feelings of the people are ; but I 
               <br />
               think there is no reasonable ground to 
               <br />
               doubt what their views are. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               They were shown, in the ﬁrst place, as 
               <br />
               pointed out by my honorable friend the Com- 
               <br />
               missioner of Crown Lands, in the fact that 
               <br />
               nearl all the elections of members of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               That, I think, is very strong testimony of the 
               <br />
               popular approbation. (Hear, hear.) Then

               <br />
               hon. gentleman says. Why, the country 
               <br />
               has demanded the scheme for years. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) What have I been proving to the 
               <br />
               House but that the very party of which the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is a member resolved upon 
               <br />
               this in 1859. I do not think the feelings of 
               <br />
               that convention in its favor could have been 
               <br />
               more distinctly expressed. I certainly so 
               <br />
               understood it, and a large majority of the 
               <br />
               560 gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> so understood it. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It as been before the country 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada since 1856, when our 
               <br />
               friends from Lower Canada formally brought 
               <br />
               it before Parliament. Are there any peti- 
               <br />
               tions from Lower Canada now against it? 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Are there any from Upper 
               <br />
               Canada? Has there been a single ublic 
               <br />
               meeting in either section against it? ( ear, 
               <br />
               hear.) In Lower Canada, an hon. member 
               <br />
               says, there have been two or three. It has 
               <br />
               been said—I do not declare it, but make the 
               <br />
               statement on public rumor—that they were 
               <br />
               failures, small demonstrations of opposition. 
               <br />
               But in Upper Canada we have had no de- 
               <br />
               monstration whatever against it. An indi- 
               <br />
               rect attempt was made the other day at 
               <br />
               Toronto by an effort to condemn the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway in connection with Confe- 
               <br />
               deration, but it was a manifest failure. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I think, then, that we are justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in assuming—and, indeed, are bound to 
               <br />
               assume—that the people do not object to it, 
               <br />
               and that they fully understand its character; 
               <br />
               for in spite of what may be said to the contrary, 
               <br />
               it has gone through the length and breadth 
               <br />
               of the land, having been widely circulated 
               <br />
               by every newspaper in the country; and 
               <br />
               it is a ﬂimsy argument for honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen to use, that because the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions addressed to them were marked 
               <br />
               “ Private,” they could not be communicated 
               <br />
               to the public. (Hear, hear.) They have 
               <br />
               been spread all over the country; but we are 
               <br />
               told the entire press has been subsidized by 
               <br />
               the Government. To say that the press was 
               <br />
               inﬂuenced in any manner by the circular to 
               <br />
               which allusion has been made, is absolutely 
               <br />
               ridiculous. (Hear, hear.) There are a few 
               <br />
               newspapers in either section of the province 
               <br />
               —certainly there are few in Upper Canada— 
               <br />
               that have spoken against the scheme; but 
               <br />
               nine-tenths of them in both sections are in 
               <br />
               favor of it, and have discussed it in all its 
               <br />
               bearings—yet we are told that the public 
               <br />
               has not been sufﬁciently informed upon it, 
               <br />
               that in fact there is no public opinion in 
               <br />
