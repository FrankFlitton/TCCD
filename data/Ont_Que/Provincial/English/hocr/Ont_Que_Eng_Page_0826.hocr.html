               construction would be of no advantage to 
               <br />
               Canada; but the course of events has con- 
               <br />
               vinced me that the time has now arrived 
               <br />
               when we should take upon ourselves our fair 
               <br />
               share of the expense of constructing this 
               <br />
               important work. It cannot be satisfactory 
               <br />
               to any Canadian, on going to New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick or Nova Scotia, to ﬁnd that he is a 
               <br />
               stranger in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strange</span> country, and among a 
               <br />
               people who, though iving so close to Canada, 
               <br />
               have no commercial intercourse with us. 
               <br />
               Although they are neighbors of ours, in one 
               <br />
               respect, yet they are neighbors with whom 
               <br />
               we have no intercourse. It is very desirable 
               <br />
               that the barriers to our intercourse should 
               <br />
               be removed, and the construction of the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway is, in my Opinion, the 
               <br />
               only eﬁ'ectual means of removing them. Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, it has been argued by a great many 
               <br />
               of those who have taken part in debating this 
               <br />
               subject that this House is assuming for itself 
               <br />
               a power that it does not, or ought not to 
               <br />
               possess, in disposing of the question without 
               <br />
               submitting it to the popular will. It is said 
               <br />
               that before these resolutions take effect an 
               <br />
               expression of public opinion should be had 
               <br />
               through a general election.- Some of those 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen who have taken this 
               <br />
               position have stated as .a reason for advocat- 
               <br />
               ing that course that the public mind was not 
               <br />
               yet properly informed as to the eﬁ'ect of the 
               <br />
               proposed change, and that, therefore, time 
               <br />
               should be given until public opinion is pre- 
               <br />
               pared to decide upon it. But with a strange 
               <br />
               inconsistency those same gentlemen are ﬂood- 
               <br />
               ing this House with petitions from the elec- 
               <br />
               tors, not asking for delay, not asking for fur- 
               <br />
               ther time to consider the matter, but asking 
               <br />
               that the scheme be not adopted. They in 
               <br />
               effect show by their petitions that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               considered the subject—that they know all 
               <br />
               about it—that their opinions are fully form- 
               <br />
               ed—and that the measure ought not to be 
               <br />
               adopted. Either the public mind is fully 
               <br />
               ripe .for the adoption or rejection of the 
               <br />
               scheme, or else those electors are signing 
               <br />
               petitions without having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁcient</span> inform— 
               <br />
               ation on which to base the opinions they ex- 
               <br />
               press. But, sir, there is such a thing as 
               <br />
               obtaining public Opinion on almost any ques- 
               <br />

               sir, we have every reason to believe that the 
               <br />
               sentiment of Upper Canada at least is 
               <br />

               <br />
               consult my constituents before coming to 
               <br />
               this House on the present occasion. I held 
               <br />
               meetings in the various municipalities in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               best of my ability, I did submit this scheme 
               <br />

               about the importance of having the question

               MR. M. C. CAMERON—I would like 
               <br />
               to ask the gentleman whether he laid any 
               <br />
               ﬁgures before his people to shew the diﬂ'er-

               people were not in a position to express an

               MR. WALSH—I did not submit ﬁgures

               <br />
               Federal or Legislative union, for the simple 
               <br />
               reason that until the organization of the 
               <br />
               local governments is decided upon, it is 
               <br />
               not possible to give reliable ﬁgures, and I

               state to my constituents that the resolutions 
               <br />
               now under consideration place in the hands 
               <br />
               of the present Legislature the preparation of 
               <br />
               the constitutions and the organization and 
               <br />
               composition of the local governments of 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada; and that as the 
               <br />
               Federal Government is to pay an annual sub- 
               <br />
               sidy of eighty cents per head of its popula- 
               <br />
               tion to the respective provinces, for carrying 
               <br />
               on their local governments and the construc- 
               <br />
               tion of local works, any sum required over and 
               <br />
               above that subsidy must necessarily be raised 
               <br />
               by direct taxation, and in that fact we have 
               <br />
               the strongest possible guarantee that in the 
               <br />
               arrangements made by this Legislature, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               domestic aﬁ'airs by the local governments, 
               <br />
               the strictest simplicity and economy will be

               <br />
               on this question being that whilst we are

               both advocates of a legislative union, he will
