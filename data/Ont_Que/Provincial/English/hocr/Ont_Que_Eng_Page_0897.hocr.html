               MR. POULIOT said -- Mr. SPEAKER, it 
               <br />
               was my intention, before recording my vote 
               <br />
               on the resolutions which are now before the 
               <br />
               House, to make some remarks respecting 
               <br />
               them at much greater length than I shall 
               <br />
               now do; for now we ﬁnd that this new 
               <br />
               being, which was to be brought forth in 
               <br />
               order to save the country, has already per- 
               <br />
               ished while still in embryo, from the violent 
               <br />
               blow which it has received in New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick ; and if we still turn our attention tO 
               <br />
               it, our doing so is certainly only in order to 
               <br />
               relieve the womb of its mother, whom it 
               <br />
               greatly inconveniences, and who would ul- 
               <br />
               timately have been destroyed by it. There 
               <br />
               is, therefore, nothing left for us to do, Mr.

               a meeting, called by myself in my double

               capacity as warden of the county and mem-

               ber representing it, was held in my county, 
               <br />
               and that at that meeting there was some 
               <br />
               disturbance which prevented an expres- 
               <br />
               sion of opinion in relation to Confederation; 
               <br />
               but, Mr. SPEAKER, it is well to know that 
               <br />
               that meeting was held only two days before 
               <br />

               <br />
               sequence great agitation had been got up 
               <br />
               among the young men, who are not even 
               <br />
               electors, in order to divert the attention of 
               <br />
               the meeting from the subject, to discuss 
               <br />
               which it had been called together ; and it is 
               <br />
               acknowledged, Mr. SPEAKER, that it is 
               <br />
               always easy to ﬁnd a certain number of 
               <br />
               people, in any county whatever, who will 
               <br />
               be ever ready to create a disturbance if only 
               <br />
               they are provided with what is needful, and
