               are pressing it is of ill omen to the deceived 
               <br />

               sad case; there is no fear of our having to go 
               <br />

               <br />
               In a certain sense, whatever is past is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irrevo</span>

               are told by some of the honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the Treasury benches that their present 
               <br />
               harmony is not peace, but only a sort of armed 
               <br />
               truce, that old arty lines are not eﬁ'aced, nor 
               <br />

               <br />
               this scheme should be ever so well dropped, 
               <br />
               and then that some day soon after these gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen should set themselves to the job of 
               <br />

               ters them all in such warm quiet, suppose 
               <br />
               there should thus soon be every effort made 
               <br />
               to revive old cries and feuds—what then? 
               <br />
               Would it be the old game over again, or a 
               <br />
               variation of it amounting to a new one ? For 
               <br />
               a time at least, sir, a breathing time that hap-

               <br />

               of old. Even representation by population 
               <br />
               will be no such spell to conjure with—will fall 
               <br />
               on cars far less excitable. It has been adopt-

               <br />
               be found there might be a worse thing in the

               found to answer in the case of Scotland 
               <br />
               —and parliamentary reform may be found 
               <br />
               no such bug-bear to speak of after all. And

               as for the bug-bears of the personal kind, 
               <br />
               why, sir, after seeing all we have seen of the

               <br />
