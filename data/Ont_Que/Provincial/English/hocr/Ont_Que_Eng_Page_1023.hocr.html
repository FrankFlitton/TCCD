               HON. J. H. CAMERON—My hon. friend 
               <br />
               says that it is merely a matter of form to 
               <br />
               refer an Address adopted by the House to a 
               <br />

               <br />
               But I wish to point out to my hon. friend 
               <br />
               that in the Imperial Parliament, on the 7th 
               <br />
               of February last, the Address in reply to the 
               <br />
               Speech from the Throne was moved and 
               <br />
               unanimously assented to by the House ; 
               <br />
               that it was then referred to a committee of 
               <br />
               the House, which committee reported it 
               <br />
               back, and that on the Address coming up 
               <br />
               for a second reading, Mr. SCULLY moved an 
               <br />
               amendment in reference to the state of 
               <br />
               Ireland, in opposition to the Address for 
               <br />

               if Mr. SOULLY was present when the Address 
               <br />
               was ﬁrst voted, he would no doubt have voted 
               <br />
               against it. But this is the ﬁrst case I have 
               <br />
               yet heard of an honorable member voting 
               <br />
               to carry a certain motion, and then proposing 
               <br />
               an amendment to upset it ; and when he did 
               <br />
               propose it, I myself thought it was unparlia~ 
               <br />
               mentary, but the S eaker ruled it in order, 
               <br />
               and to his decision bow. Now, if the hon.

               stances of the countr or for any other cause. 
               <br />

               <br />
               Queen, he should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> said so by voting

            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               the contrary, he said that there should be an 
               <br />
               Address to the Queen, praying Her to lay a 
               <br />
               measure before the Imperial Parliament— 
               <br />
               that measure to contain a Constitution for 
               <br />

               Quebec Conference; and the very next

               like the boy who builds up and then knocks

               down a house of cards, moves an Address to 
               <br />
               the Governor General, praying him not to 
               <br />
               send that Address to the Queen, and thus 
               <br />
               defeats the very motion for which he voted. 
               <br />
               Hear, hear.) He voted ﬁrst that this 
               <br />
               ouse should address the Queen, and then 
               <br />
               by his motion says that it shall not address 
               <br />
               the Queen at all, but that this House shall 
               <br />
               be dissolved, and that there shall be an 
               <br />
               election, and then that another House shall

               voting that this House shall address the

               insult to Her Majesty to say that the House 
               <br />

               <br />
               I shall not enter into the question as to the 
               <br />
               reference of this subject to the people. The 
               <br />
               small paragraph I have read from Mr. 
               <br />
               LEATHAM’S speech contains very shortly the 
               <br />
               wisdom of ages, and I might appeal, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">further</span> 
               <br />
               testimony were required, to all the great men 
               <br />
               who have acted on the political stage of Eng- 
               <br />
               land. Mr. PITT scouted at the idea ; and it 
               <br />
               was never countenanced by any of the great 
               <br />
               public men of England. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               says that at the time of the union of 
               <br />
               England and Scotland, there was a distinct 
               <br />
               reference to the people of Scotland. It is 
               <br />
               true that proclamations were issued, calling 
               <br />
               upon the people to elect representatives from 
               <br />
               the boroughs on the question of union with 
               <br />
               England ; but the hon. gentleman knows 
               <br />
               very well that Scotland had no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tree</span> repre- 
               <br />
               sentative institutions at that time—he knows 
               <br />
               that until the passage of the Reform Bill, 
               <br />
               elective institutions were only a mockery in 
               <br />
               Scotland. The boroughs were in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hands</span> 
               <br />
               of close corporations, who elected whom they 
               <br />
               pleased, and it was quite impossible to obtain, 
               <br />
               by such means as an election aﬁ'orded, a true 
               <br />
               expression of the opinion of the people of 
               <br />
               that country.
