               to ensure to us that assistance of which we 
               <br />
               stand so much in need. The United States 
               <br />
               are, perhaps, more willing to injure their 
               <br />
               neighbors than other countries are, owing to 
               <br />
               the universal idea that they must carry out

               the Munroe doctrine of complete domination

               <br />
               own ﬂesh and blood, and have shown little

               growth, and strengthened with their strength; 
               <br />
               and I feel that they would have very little

               We are in a very diﬁeult position. The

               Americans have done a great deal to revoke

               <br />
               At this moment they want to abrogate the

               Reciprocity treaty, and talk of doing away 
               <br />

               <br />
               with us in peace and with us in war; when

               with another honorable gentleman who has

               <br />
               they live. (Hear, hear.) When I think that 
               <br />
               England is going to do much for us in other 
               <br />
               respects, I think she will be willing to open 
               <br />
               up that country; she will not be an unkind 
               <br />
               mother to us, and demand from her children 
               <br />
               that, when she has placed us in a position 
               <br />
               of diﬁiculty,.we should bear all the burdens. 
               <br />
               I believe, however, that we ought to put our 
               <br />
               shoulders to the wheel and do something for 
               <br />
               ourselves. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tha</span> is the true spirit of Britons; 
               <br />
               for if we did not, we should be open to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insult</span> 
               <br />
               —-and insult is worse than injury. Rather than 
               <br />
               have to bear with it, I am wilhng to risk the 
               <br />
               consequences of even a larger debt than we 
               <br />
               yet have—to give some of the means that I 
               <br />
               possess; and in saying and acting thus for 
               <br />
               myself, I am speah'ng and acting for my 
               <br />
               constituents too, who sent me here without 
               <br />
               any other pledge or bond than that I should 
               <br />
               do for them the best I could. I have made 
               <br />
               this the land of my adoption, and it is evident 
               <br />
               that any injury I impose on their children I 
               <br />
               impose on my own too. (Hear-.) Whatever 
               <br />
               may be the result of the scheme—and I trust 
               <br />
               it will not turn out so badly as some hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen seem to expect, and which I much 
               <br />
               dreaded myself—I trust we shall have such 
               <br />
               arrangements made with the Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, if arrangements are made with them, 
               <br />
               that we shall have a real union—not union 
               <br />
               mixed with disunion. (Hear, hear.) I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that in the course of the summer we 
               <br />
               shall see millions of British capital spent here 
               <br />
               for our defence, and I see clearly that we shall 
               <br />
               have to contract debt for this purpose our- 
               <br />
               selves. But we have another duty to per- 
               <br />
               form: we have to prepare the strong-hearted 
               <br />
               yeomen of this country to man our fortiﬁca- 
               <br />
               tions. England cannot supply us with all 
               <br />
               the men and money necessary to defend the 
               <br />
               province—that is the duty of our young men, 
               <br />
               and our middle aged men too. If we do not 
               <br />
               perform this duty, we shall not be worthy of 
               <br />
               the name of a people, not be worthy of the 
               <br />
               rights, liberties and privileges we enjoy. I 
               <br />
               will not detain the House much longer; but 
               <br />
               I must say that one remark I heard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">addremed</span>
