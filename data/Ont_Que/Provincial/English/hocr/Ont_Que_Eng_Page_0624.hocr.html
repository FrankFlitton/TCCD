               English members elected in great part by 
               <br />

               In this House, some days since, we heard

               Upper Canadian members, praising our 
               <br />
               liberality, and acknowledging that never had

               national or religious fanaticism been display-

               ed by us. That is true ; we are essentially 
               <br />
               liberal and tolerant, and a suﬁicient proof of 
               <br />
               it, is given in the most striking manner, by 
               <br />
               the number of members of this House who, 
               <br />
               although of religion and origin differing from 
               <br />
               ours, yet represent counties in great part or 
               <br />
               exclusively French and Catholic. This is a 
               <br />
               subject of pride for us. Unfortunately we 
               <br />
               have no return in kind made to us, and we 
               <br />
               do not meet with the like liberality from the 
               <br />
               English population. Whenever it is in a

               majority, it closes to us the door of honors

               reasoaable demand was treated as a species of 
               <br />
               rebellion against the Mother Country. The 
               <br />

               <br />
               the motives which induced the act seemed to be 
               <br />
               misunderstood, and attempts were even made to 
               <br />
               intimidate them; but it was in vain. The un-

               assailable arguments upon which the Canadians 
               <br />
               rested their claim, and their words, like their elo-

               quence, bearing the stamp of dignity, ﬁnally 
               <br />
               triumphed over the attacks of their fanatical op-
