               and to trench upon the domain of the local

               in the scheme is a backward policy. I want

               <br />

               folding and expanding; but instead o this 
               <br />
               our rulers are narrowing them down and re-

               stricting their free exercise. (Hear.) They 
               <br />
               are now proposing to take away the elective 
               <br />
               principle in its app ication to this Chamber, and 
               <br />
               that tec, without even having received a peti- 
               <br />
               tion or sign of any kind from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">œople</span> that

               retrogression I can hardly imagine what would 
               <br />
               be. I was not sent here to assist in doing 
               <br />
               any such thing, and am not aware that there 
               <br />
               has been any evidence of a desire in the 
               <br />
               country for a return to the old mode of ap- 
               <br />

               of one complaint, or of any dissatisfaction 
               <br />
               whatever with the present constitution of the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, and I therefore r ard it 
               <br />
               as not a little strange that a few gent emen, 
               <br />
               without mission or warrant, should have de- 
               <br />
               vised such a change. and should be trying to

               <br />
               There is a great diﬁ‘erence between making 
               <br />
               machinery work and breaking it to peices,

               late within the Constitution, not to legislate 
               <br />

               <br />
               I expected to go back to my constituents to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> them an account of the manner in which

               to take advantage of my position to provide 
               <br />
               for myself a seat for life. No, my constitu- 
               <br />
               ents never gave me this right, nor was any

               <br />

               ple in this manner, betray their man- 
               <br />
               ate. If it was desired that the people should 
               <br />
               surrender this right they should have been 
               <br />
               informed of such desire in good time, so that 
               <br />
               the might have considered the question ; but 
               <br />
               wit out warning them, or consulting them, 
               <br />
               this most highly-prized principle was bartered 
               <br />
               away to the Lower Provinces for a Confeder— 
               <br />
               ation which could not last. The Hon. Com- 
               <br />
               missioner of Crown Lands had told the House 
               <br />
               that the repartition of Lower Canada accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the present electoral divisions had been 
               <br />
               retained for the purpose of protecting the 
               <br />
               British population of Lower Canada. I think 
               <br />
               that if, with the retaining these electoral divi- 
               <br />
               sions the elective principle was also retained, the 
               <br />
               French population of Lower Canada would 
               <br />
               also ﬁnd in it their protection. For then 
               <br />
               each division would be free to choose for its 
               <br />

               unfortunately— a circumstance which I do 
               <br />
               not anticipate, but which may occur — the 
               <br />
               General Government, when formed, m' ht be 
               <br />
               surrounded by coteries inimical to war 
               <br />
               Canada interests, and be led by them to 
               <br />
               choose members for the Legislative Council 
               <br />
               hostile to the views of Lower Canada. I 
               <br />
               consider, therefore, an elective Legislative 
               <br />
               Council in the Confederation as essential to 
               <br />

               gained politically by the scheme any more
