               objection raised by my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Niagara <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hon.</span> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cumul).</span> He has found 
               <br />
               it convenient to pass them all over for the 
               <br />
               simple reason that he found them unanswer- 
               <br />
               able. My hon. friend says :—“ Was not the 
               <br />
               French language restored to Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               and was not this echange in the Constitution?” 
               <br />
               Hon. gentlemen, it was certainly restored, 
               <br />
               and by the Conservative administration of that 
               <br />
               day, and, as my hon. friend opposite (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. BOULTON) has said, unanimously. There 
               <br />
               was no op ition, for it was considered a 
               <br />
               right to w ich our French Canadian fellow— 
               <br />
               subjects were fully entitled. But is the 
               <br />
               restoration of the French language to be 
               <br />
               compared with the resolutions now proposed 
               <br />
               — with the great constitutional change 
               <br />
               which is intended to aﬁ'ect, not only our- 
               <br />
               selves, but our children and our children’s 
               <br />
               children for all time to come? Is a change 
               <br />
               like this to be compared with the restoration 
               <br />
               of the French lang e l Certainly not. It 
               <br />
               seems to me to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bemige</span> most extraordinary 
               <br />
               comparison I ever heard of. Then my 
               <br />
               hon. friend has referred to the change in 
               <br />
               the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
               <br />
               But was not that question over and over 
               <br />
               again before the people ? Did not the people 
               <br />
               at the hustings frequently pronounce an 
               <br />
               opinion upon that change ? Undoubtedly 
               <br />
               they did, and it being understood that the 
               <br />
               people were in favor of it, the change was 
               <br />
               brought about. My hou. friend says that in 
               <br />
               the Conference they were surrounded with 
               <br />
               diﬁèul ties. N o doubt they were. And why? 
               <br />
               Because they allowed for Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island and Newfoundland as many delegates 
               <br />
               as they did for Canada. N o doubt they were 
               <br />
               surrounded with difﬁculties. No doubt they 
               <br />
               were overwhelmed by the demands of these 
               <br />
               gentlemen. The hon. gentleman says that 
               <br />
               Confederation is necessary to strengthen the 
               <br />
               defences of the country. In what way? Can 
               <br />
               any hon. gentleman tell me in what way? 
               <br />
               I have not heard one word to prove, to my 
               <br />
               satisfaction, how the defences of the country 
               <br />
               are to be strengthened by Federation, unless 
               <br />
               indeed it be by placing the whole of the 
               <br />
               provinces under one head. Why, hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, did I not shew here the other day 
               <br />
               what was the feeling of the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               in regard to the delencts of the country? 
               <br />
               At a time when our Parliament were propos- 
               <br />
               ing to pass an act which would entail the 
               <br />
               expenditure of millions on the defences of 
               <br />
               the country, what was bein done in the 
               <br />
               Lower-Provinces? Why the inancial Secre-

               <br />
               a proposed grant of 620,000, and he was 
               <br />
               obliged to apologise to the House that the 
               <br />
               sum was so large ! And the present Premier 
               <br />

               tance in British North America — proposed

               to strike off 612,000, and leave the appro- 
               <br />
               priation at 88,000. This was proposed by a 
               <br />
               province next in importance to our own, and 
               <br />
               at the time of the Trent ahair, when there was 
               <br />
               an appearance of danger much greater than at 
               <br />
               present. And what did New Brunswick do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?</span> 
               <br />
               Appropriate 615,000. The people that did 
               <br />
               all this are the people to whom we are to 
               <br />
               ally ourselves that we may be strengthened 
               <br />
               in our eﬂ'orts for the defence of the country! 
               <br />
               Do hon. gentlemen believe that an alliance 
               <br />
               with provinces whose leading men hold such 
               <br />
               views as these would add to our strength ? 
               <br />
               Certainly not. My hou. friend the Com- 
               <br />
               missiouer of Crown Lands has also said that 
               <br />
               95 out of every 100 of the people of U per 
               <br />

               friend is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mistaken.</span> I once had the honor of 
               <br />
               representing a portion of his constituents, 
               <br />
               and I would inform my hon. friend that I 
               <br />
               know as much of the feeling, not simply of 
               <br />
               the people of Upper Canada, speaking of 
               <br />
               them generally, but of his constituents, as 
               <br />
               he does; and this [ would say that were my

               hon. friend to go before his constituents and 
               <br />
               tell them that, in order to get Federation, 
               <br />
               Upper Canada is to pay two-thirds of the 
               <br />
               cost of the Inter-colonial Railway, and two- 
               <br />
               thirds of the cost of maintenance ofthe road 
               <br />
               for all time to come, and that the roads of 
               <br />
