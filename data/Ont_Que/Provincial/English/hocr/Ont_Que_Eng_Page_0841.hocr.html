               <br />
               the calm and deliberate decision is almost 
               <br />
               always just—as ﬁnal in the last resoit, it

               lished, many of them, more by custom and 
               <br />
               usage than by positive law—as to make it 
               <br />
               all but impossible for any majority, how- 
               <br />
               ever strong, to perpetrate any gross act 
               <br />
               of injustice on a minority, so long as that 
               <br />
               minority could command but one or two

               resolute representatives on the ﬂoor of Par-

               liament. Sir, it is impossible not to feel 
               <br />
               that it is in a very great degree to this fact, 
               <br />
               to the instinctive sense of the inherent 
               <br />
               powers of self-defence which our customs 
               <br />
               give to the weak against the strong—to the 
               <br />
               conviction that to drive any party to despair 
               <br />
               would create an inevitable dead-lock—that 
               <br />
               England owes it that she has contrived to 
               <br />
               administer her affairs for near two hundred 
               <br />
               years without any overt acts of tyranny or 
               <br />
               one direct collision or irregular interferenee 
               <br />
               with the ordinary course of law. Sir, I 
               <br />
               rejoice to see that we will continue to adhere 
               <br />
               to a system which has borne such good fruit, 
               <br />
               as a whole, in the parent land; and I think 
               <br />
               the reﬂection how difﬁcult, if not how dan- 
               <br />
               gerous, it is to oppress a determined minority 
               <br />
               under such a system, may serve to calm the 
               <br />
               fears of those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hontzrable</span> gentlemen who 
               <br />
               dread the loss of local rights and privi- 
               <br />
               leges at the hands of the stronger race. 
               <br />
               For the rest, Mr. SPEAKER, though I will 
               <br />
               venture upon no predictions—though I know 
               <br />
               we must expect many diﬁiculties, many 
               <br />
               checks before we can hope to bring so great 
               <br />
               an enterprise to a successful issue—I trust I 
               <br />
               may be pardoned l'or expressing my con-

               here without regard to any special nation— 
               <br />
               ality—is destined to be rewarded in the 
               <br />
               way in which they would most havedesired 
               <br />
               to see it rewarded if they had lived to see 
               <br />
               this day, by the establishment of a kingdom 
               <br />
               on the banks of the St. Lawrence, which, 
               <br />
               without binding itself down to a slavish

               adherence to the customs ”of the old world, 
               <br />
