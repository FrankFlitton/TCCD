               that government was no longer possible, and

               MB. BIGGAR—As the resolutions on the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the Provinces are looked 
               <br />
               to with a very great deal of interest by the 
               <br />
               country, I think it necessary to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks in explanation of the vote which I 
               <br />
               intend to give. But before doing so,I think 
               <br />
               it necessary for me to state, as brieﬂy as 
               <br />
               possible, the position that I hold toward the 
               <br />
               present Government, as also the two govern- 
               <br />
               ments that have preceded them. 
               <br />
               canvass in 1861, I most distinctly and 
               <br />
               unhesitatingly stated to my constituents that 
               <br />
               I had no conﬁdence in the CARTIER-MAO- 
               <br />
               DONALD Government, who were then in 
               <br />
               power, as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered</span> that they had 
               <br />
               managed the ﬁnances of the country very 
               <br />
               badly, and had, by their extravagance, 
               <br />
               brought us to the eve of bankruptcy; and 
               <br />
               that if I were elected to the House as their 
               <br />
               representative, I should feel it my duty to 
               <br />
               vote want of conﬁdence in that Government, 
               <br />
               if such avote was preposed. In 1862 the 
               <br />
               Militia Bill was introduced by that Adminis- 
               <br />
               tration. Believing that some legislation was 
               <br />
               necessary in that direction, and admitting 
               <br />
               the principle of the bill, I voted with the 
               <br />
               Government on it. Some of my political 
               <br />
               friends, with whom I was then acting, found 
               <br />
               fault with me for the course I then took and 
               <br />
               the vote I then gave; but I am happy to say 
               <br />
               that they have since been induced to take the 
               <br />
               same view of the matter that I did at that 
               <br />
               time, and they would now be willing to go a 
               <br />
               little farther in the same direction than I 
               <br />
               would perhaps feel it prudent to go with our

               however, to ﬁnd that the course I tool: on

               that occasion has been approved of now by

               <br />
               that vote; and when the new Government 
               <br />
               was formed, known as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MACDONALD-</span> 
               <br />
               SIOOTTE Administration, 1 was not satisfied 
               <br />
               with their policy. I had promised my con- 
               <br />
               stituents that I would support representation 
               <br />
               by population, and vote against separate 
               <br />
               schools; and as that Government proposed 
               <br />
               to make representation by population a close 
               <br />
               question, and to bring in 3 Separate School 
               <br />
               Bill, I felt that I should have to vote against 
               <br />
               them when representation by population 
               <br />
               would be moved as an amendment to the 
               <br />
               Address. I accordingly voted for the amend- 
               <br />
               ment; and when Mr. SCOTT’S Separate 
               <br />
               School Bill was introduced, I felt it my duty 
               <br />
               to vote against it, in accordance with the 
               <br />
               pledges I had made to my constituents. That 
               <br />
               Government was defeated, and a new Gov- 
               <br />
               ernm :nt was formed, in which I advised you, 
               <br />
               Mr.’ SPEAKER, and my friend the late Hon. 
               <br />
               Postmaster General, to take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce.</span> I stated 
               <br />
               to you, Mr. SPEAKER, and to the Hon. Mr.

               MOWA'I‘, that I would not advise you, asny 
               <br />
               friends, to take oﬂice, unless I would feel it 
               <br />
               to be my duty to support you ; and that if 
               <br />
               the question of representation by population 
               <br />
               was again moved as an amendment to the 
               <br />
               Speech from the Throne, I would vote against 
               <br />
               the amendment, and that I would go before 
               <br />
               my constituents, as a general. election was 
               <br />
               approaching, and state what I had done, 
               <br />
               and if they did not sustain me is whatI 
               <br />
               had done, I was quite willing to remain 
               <br />
               at home. I believe that Government did 
               <br />
               right in resigning when they found tley 
               <br />
               could not carry on the business of the 
               <br />
               country in a satisfactory manner; and when 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Twas-MACDONALD</span> Administration was 
               <br />

               <br />
               but I was willing that they should proceed 
               <br />
               without any opposition from me, if they could 
               <br />
               control a maiorityof the House; but when the 
               <br />
               reconstruction took place, I felt that I could 
               <br />
               not be a party to a government of that kind 
               <br />
               —-that the demoralizing inﬂuence of a co- 
               <br />
               alition such as that Government contained 
               <br />
               would counteract all the good they could 
               <br />
               ever do, and that the alliance was an un- 
               <br />
               happy one. (Hear, hear.) I was not wil-
