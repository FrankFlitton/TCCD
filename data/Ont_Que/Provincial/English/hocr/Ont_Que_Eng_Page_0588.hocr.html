               HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER—It is evi-

               <br />
               laga has not read the resolutions; but I have 
               <br />
               read them. Lower Canada is in a peculiar 
               <br />
               position. We have two races of people whose 
               <br />
               interests are distinct from each other in 
               <br />
               respect to origin, language and religion. In 
               <br />
               preparing the business of the Confederation at 
               <br />
               Quebec, we had to conciliate these two inter- 
               <br />
               ests, and to give the country a Constitution 
               <br />
               which might reconcile the conservative with 
               <br />
               the democratic element; for the weak point in 
               <br />
               democratic institutions is the leaving of all 
               <br />
               power in the hands of the popular element. 
               <br />
               The history of the past proves that this is an 
               <br />
               e'vil. In order that institutions may be stable 
               <br />
               and work harmoniously, there must be a power 
               <br />
               of resistance to oppose to the democratic ele- 
               <br />
               ment. In the United States the power of 
               <br />
               resistance does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;reside</span> in the Senate, nor 
               <br />
               even in the President. The honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Hochelaga says that the objection of 
               <br />
               the honorable member for the county of 
               <br />
               Quebec is well founded, because the Federal 
               <br />
               Government may appoint all English or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'all</span> 
               <br />
               French-Canadians as legislative councillors for 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. If the honorable member had 
               <br />
               read the resolutions, he would have found that 
               <br />
               the appointments of legislative councillors are 
               <br />
               to be made so as to accord with the electoral 
               <br />
               divisions now existing in the province. Well, 
               <br />
               I ask whether it is probable that the Executive 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               18 very probable that he will recommend the

               <br />
               not that the Upper House would not be con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               is the same idea in a different form. He said
