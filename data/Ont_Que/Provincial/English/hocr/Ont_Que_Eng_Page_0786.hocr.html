               HON. Ma. DORION said—Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               I hold in my hand an amendment which will 
               <br />
               exactly suit the ruling of the Chair, as it re- 
               <br />
               lates only to the time to which the debate 
               <br />
               shall be adjourned. The very unfair and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ar-‘</span> 
               <br />
               bitrary course which the Government has un- 
               <br />
               fortunately seen ﬁt to pursue, has prevented 
               <br />
               the honorable members of this House from 
               <br />
               moving any amendments to the scheme pro- 
               <br />
               posed for its adoption; but I for one am 
               <br />
               most desirous, in accordance with the almost 
               <br />
               universal wish of the people of the district of 
               <br />
               Montreal, to have the question tested whether 
               <br />
               the Opinion of the people shall be allowed to 
               <br />
               be heard before a ﬁnal decision is come to by 
               <br />
               this House. I ﬁnd that in nineteen French- 
               <br />
               Canadian counties in that district, resolutions 
               <br />
               have been passed in favor of that course, and 
               <br />
               petitions have been signed by from ﬁfteen to 
               <br />
               twenty thousand inhabitants, asking that no 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such</span> scheme be adopted without submit- 
               <br />
               ting it to a vote of the people. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Sir, I think it would have been far 
               <br />
               more digniﬁed on thé part of the Government, 
               <br />
               and more respectful towards the country, to 
               <br />
               have allowed the scheme—which, in their 
               <br />
               opinion, will create such prosperity that 
               <br />
               everybody will be in ecstacies over it, but 
               <br />
               which, in our opinion, will bring on this 
               <br />
               country such a state of dissatisfaction as will 
               <br />
               perhaps engender some other feeling than 
               <br />
               that Of union with the Lower Provinces—to 
               <br />

               <br />
