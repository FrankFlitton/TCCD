               gentlemen say I was inconsistent in that at

               I have been trying to pull it down. Well, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, to understand how we 
               <br />
               stood in 1856 it is necessary we should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span>

               the history of the Legislative COuncil a little 
               <br />
               further back—from the time of its formation 
               <br />
               immediately after the union. We had not 
               <br />
               res onsible government at the time of the 
               <br />
               umon, but then it was that the whole system 
               <br />
               was put in practice. The ﬁrst batch of coun- 
               <br />
               cillors were appointed in -1841, and were 25 
               <br />
               in number; but two of them never attended. 
               <br />
               Out of these 25 there were 18 conservatives 
               <br />
               and ﬁve reformers. In 1842 seven new 
               <br />
               councillors were added, ﬁve conservatives and 
               <br />
               two reformers. In 1843 the Government 
               <br />
               changed, and the change made a little differ-

               In 1847 there were four conservatives. There-

               <br />
               Administration—the fact was that their parti-

               What were the Reform Government to do ? 
               <br />
               They were forced to appoint a large batch 
               <br />
               this time. They appointed no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lea</span> than 
               <br />
               twelve gentlemen. But still it left a majority 
               <br />
               to the conservative party of three. And if 
               <br />
               the conservatives had been true to themsdves

               will tell you, byand by, why—they could

               have prevented a good deal of trouble and a 
               <br />
               good deal of agitation in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eounæâe</span> Sup-

               <br />
               would the country have suﬁ'ered a great deal 
               <br />
               from it? But if the conservatives had been 
               <br />
               true to themselves they would have stopped 
               <br />
               It would have been discussed in 
               <br />
               all the public prints. The Montrealers would 
               <br />
               not have been entirely reconciled to the mea- 
               <br />
               sure, but they would have waived their opin- 
               <br />
               ions as dutiful subjects of the Queen, and we 
               <br />
               should not have witnessed the scandal we had 
               <br />
               in Montreal—~the burning of the Parliament- 
               <br />
               ary buildings and the Representative of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ed, followed b the annexation movement. 
               <br />
               But I say if e conservatives had resisted 
               <br />
               and just ed the bill for another year, 
               <br />
               all this trou le might have been avoided.

               Now, honorable gentlemen, what was the 
               <br />

               <br />

               of partisanship, and where there is partisan-

               Where there is partisanship there can be no

               stability —— you can depend upon nothing. 
               <br />
               Hear, hear.) It is only when justice is ren-
