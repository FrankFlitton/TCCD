               it have been objected to, and we were remind- 
               <br />
               ed the other evening by the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Chateauguay, that we are not a treaty- 
               <br />
               making power. Well, in reference to that 
               <br />
               objection, I believe the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment has in certain cases, such as the Reci- 
               <br />
               procity Treaty, conceded to these provinces 
               <br />
               the right of coaction ; and in this case there is 
               <br />
               the Imperial Despatch of 1862 to Lord MUL- 
               <br />
               GRAVE, Governor of N ova Scotia, distinct- 
               <br />
               ly authorizin the public men of the colonies 
               <br />
               to confer wit each other on the subject of 
               <br />
               union, and writing them to submit the re- 
               <br />
               sult of their conferences to the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government. (Hear, hear.) We assembled 
               <br />
               under authority of that despatch, and acted 
               <br />
               under the sanction it gave. Everything we 
               <br />
               did was done in form and with propriety, 
               <br />
               and the result of our proceedings is the do- 
               <br />
               cument that has been submitted to the Im- 
               <br />
               perial Government as well as to this'House, 
               <br />
               and which we speak of here as a treaty. And 
               <br />
               that there may be no doubt about our posi- 
               <br />
               tion in regard to that document we say, ques- 
               <br />
               tion it you may, reject it you may, or accept 
               <br />
               it you may, but alter it you may not. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It is beyond your power, or our 
               <br />
               power, to alter it. There is not a sentence— 
               <br />
               ay, or even a word—you can alter without 
               <br />
               desiring to throw out the document. Alter 
               <br />
               it, and we know at once what you mean—you 
               <br />
               thereby declare yourselves anti-unionists. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) On this point, I repeat after 
               <br />
               all my hon. friends who have already spoken, 
               <br />
               for one party to alter a treaty, is, of course, 
               <br />
               to destroy it. Let us be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">frank</span> with each

               clause, line by line, and letter by letter. 
               <br />
               Oh ! but this clause ought to run thus, and 
               <br />
               this other clause thus. Does any hon. mem-

               this is not an ordinary parliamentary mea-

               <br />

               <br />
               to be glad to have them pointed out. Yes, 
               <br />
               surely, it this were simply the act of the 
               <br />
               Parliament of Canada ; but itis not to be our 
               <br />
               act alone. It is an Address to the Throne, in 
               <br />
               the terms of which other colonies are to 
               <br />
               agree, and even if we were to make altera- 
               <br />
               tions in it, we cannot bind them to accept 
               <br />
               them. If we were weak and wicked enough 
               <br />
               to alter a solemn agreement with the other 
               <br />
               provinces, the moment their representatives 
               <br />
               had turned their backs and gone home, what 
               <br />
               purpose would it serve except that of defeat- 
               <br />
               in the whole measure and throwing it as 
               <br />
               wel as the country back again into chaos. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I admit, air, as we have been 
               <br />
               told, that we ought to aim at perfection, but 
               <br />
               who has ever attained it, except perhaps the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brome. (Laughter.) We, 
               <br />
               however, did strive and aim at the mark, and 
               <br />
               we think we made a tolerably good shot. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Chateauguay will not be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed—insatiate archer l—unless we hit 
               <br />
               the bull’s eye. (Laughter.) My hon. friend 
               <br />
               is well read in political literature—will he 
               <br />
               mention me one authority, from the ﬁrst to 
               <br />
               the last, who ever held that human govern- 
               <br />
               ment ever was or could be anything more 
               <br />
               than what a modern sage called “ an approxi— 
               <br />
               mation to the right,” and an ancient called 
               <br />
               “ the possible best.” Well, we believe we 
               <br />
               have here given to our countrymen of all the 
               <br />
               provinces the possible best—that we have 
               <br />
               given it to them in the most imperative mo- 
               <br />
               ment—their representatives and ours have 
               <br />
               labored at it, letter and spirit, form and sub— 
               <br />
               stance, until they found this basis of agree- 
               <br />
               ment, which we are all alike conﬁdent will 
               <br />
               not now, nor for many a day to come, be 
               <br />
               easily swept away. Before I pass to another
