               secure for us as a people. Let us begin by 
               <br />
               examining its remedial provisions. First, then, 
               <br />
               it applies a complete and satisfactory remedy

               to the injustice of the existin system of r—

               people of Upper Canada ave bitterly com- 
               <br />
               plained that though they numbered four hun- 
               <br />
               dred thousand souls mere than the pepulation 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada, and though they have con- 
               <br />
               tributed three or four pounds to the neral 
               <br />
               revenue for every pound contributed y the 
               <br />
               sister province, yet the Lower Canadians send 
               <br />
               to Parliament as many representatives as they 
               <br />
               do. Now, sir, the measure in your hands 
               <br />
               brings this injustice to an end ;-—it sweeps 
               <br />
               away the line of demarcation between the two

               To this proposed constitution of the Lower 
               <br />
               Chamber, I have heard onl two objections. 
               <br />
               It has been alleged that unt' after the census 
               <br />
               of 1871, the number of members is to re- 
               <br />
               main as at present; but this is a mistake. 
               <br />
               Upper Canada is to receive from the start 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eightytwo</span> representatives, and Lower Canada 
               <br />
               six —ﬁve; and whatever increase the census 
               <br />
               of 1871 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mayhestablish</span> will be then adjusted. 
               <br />
               It has also been objected that though the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions provide that the existing Parliament
