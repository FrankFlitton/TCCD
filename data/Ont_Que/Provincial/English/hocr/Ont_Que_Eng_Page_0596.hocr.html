               <br />
               the Government, the declaration now alluded

               The explanation then given by me exactly

               <br />
               the Quebec Conference. It is undoubted that 
               <br />
               the resolutions laid before this honorable 
               <br />

               the honorable member that the explanations I 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Imperial Act relating to it will be drawn

               that they wish to lead us towards a social re-

               decadence of the empire, made and unmade 
               <br />
               emperors; but it never occurred to them to

               make laws and administer affairs Of state. 
               <br />
               This had to be reserved to our republicans,
