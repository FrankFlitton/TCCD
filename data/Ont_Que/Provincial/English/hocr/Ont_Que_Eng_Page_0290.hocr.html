               But, leaving these lit e matters to take care 
               <br />
               of themselves, I shall now allude to the 
               <br />
               strong pressure which seems, from some 
               <br />
               source or other, to be urging the represen- 
               <br />
               tatives of the people of Canada, and the 
               <br />
               peeple themselves, to adopt this important 
               <br />
               scheme without that time for deliberate 
               <br />
               consideration which a matter of that kind 
               <br />
               is entitled to. I am satisﬁed that that 
               <br />
               pressure does not come from the people

               <br />
               which has been expressed before, that it 
               <br />
               has been a pressure from without, which 
               <br />
               has been urging us to take this ste too

               rapidly, I fear, for our country’s g It
