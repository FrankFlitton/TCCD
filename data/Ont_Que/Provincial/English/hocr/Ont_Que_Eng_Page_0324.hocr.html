               The Legislature of New Brunswick is not to

               meet for some time yet; thequestion therefore 
               <br />
               cannot be soon settled there; and if it were, 
               <br />
               it has still to go home to England, there to

               be embodied in an Imperial enactment before 
               <br />
               being acted upon. The Imperial Parliament 
               <br />
               has assembled and will probably continue in 
               <br />
               session, as it generally does, some ﬁve or six 
               <br />
               months. Surely then there will be time to 
               <br />
               take the vote here. I should like to have 
               <br />
               some reason adduced to convince me that 
               <br />
               there is danger in delay. I have heard an 
               <br />
               indistinct allusion to such dan er as being 
               <br />
               great in case war should sudden y come upon 
               <br />
               us. New, hon. gentlemen, I hold this to be 
               <br />
               aa objection which has no weight whatever. 
               <br />
               How lon will it be, if we adept the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, be are this scheme can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gotinto</span> ope- 
               <br />
               ration ? I presume it will be twelve months, 
               <br />
               and if we can wait a twelvemonth, can we 
               <br />
               not wait two years without risk ? For, what 
               <br />
               immediate strength is the measure to bring 
               <br />
               to us ? The mere uniting together of these 
               <br />
               provinces will not give us one additional 
               <br />
               soldier; it will give us no more money ; 
               <br />
               neither will it lessen the extent of frontier to be 
               <br />
               defended, nor give us any increase Of military 
               <br />
               power. As for its placing all the provinces 
               <br />
               under the direction of one mind—the only 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argumentlwhich</span> I have heard applying to 
               <br />
               this part of the question—if we were in a 
               <br />
               state of warm-da ,the forces of the whole 
               <br />
               would be undert c direction Of one mind. 
               <br />
               Do we think for one moment, that if a hostile 
               <br />
               force set foot on the shores of Canada, New 
               <br />
               Brunswick or Nova Scotia, the heart of the 
               <br />
               Empire would not thrill with indignation,and 
               <br />
               the whole force of the Empire not be brought 
               <br />
               to bear against the foe who thus insulted and 
               <br />
               deﬁed the British Crown, just as readily in 
               <br />
               our isolated as it would be in our united con- 
               <br />
               dition? I think the danger from war is one 
               <br />
               on which no argument against submitting 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> measure to the people can possibly be 
               <br />
               based. (Hear, hear.) An hon. gentleman

               source from which that opinion came, or 
               <br />
