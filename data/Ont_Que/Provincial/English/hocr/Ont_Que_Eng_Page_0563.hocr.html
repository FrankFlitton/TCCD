               After the reorganization of the constitutional

               government in 1798. commerce Speedily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grew</span> to 
               <br />
               vast proportions. The tonnage, which, in l792,was 
               <br />
               564,437 tons, had reached 1,032,;19 in 18111 ; the 
               <br />
               imports valued in 1792 at 31,500,000 dollars 
               <br />
               (157,500,000 francs), were in 1801, 111,363,511 
               <br />
               dollars (556,817,555 francs); the exports had in 
               <br />
               the same period risen from 20,753,098 dollars 
               <br />
               (1H3.765,490 francs) to 94,115,925 dollars (470, 
               <br />
               579,625 francs). In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1857</span> the tonnage was 1,268,- 
               <br />
               548; the imports 138,500,000 dollars (692,500,-

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(541,715,750</span> frame). At that period, American 
               <br />
               commerce <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span> a blow from which it did not 
               <br />
               recover for several years. The measures of the

               English Parliament, followed b NAPOLEON’S 
               <br />

               <br />
               embargo of 1807, produced a deep <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">staanation</span> in 
               <br />
               the commercial affairs of the Union, an although 
               <br />
               the amount of tonnage did not very perceptibly 
               <br />
               diminish during the ﬁfteen following years, the 
               <br />
               imports fell in 1808 to 56,990,000 dollars (284,- 
               <br />
               950,000 francs),and exports 22,430,950 dollars 
               <br />
               (112,154,000 francs). lhe war of 1812—’16 gave 
               <br />
               employment to the shipping which would other- 
               <br />
               wise have rotted in the docks, and occasioned 
               <br />
               some clipper privateers to be built; but the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade</span> of the country continued to decline, so 
               <br />
               that in 1814 the imports rose only to 12,965,000 
               <br />
               dollars (64,825,000 francs), and the exports 
               <br />
               6,927,441 dollars (34,6:.7,205 francs.) The end- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> of the war gave activity to commercial pur- 
               <br />
               suits. In 1815 the imports reached 113,041,274 
               <br />
               dollars (565,206,370 francs) and in 1816, 147, 
               <br />
               103,000 dollars (735,515,000 francs); the exports 
               <br />
               of these same years were 52,557,753 dollars

               <br />
               (409,602,250 francs). This amountof imports, 
               <br />
               which was in excess of the re uirements of the 
               <br />

               99,250,000 dollars (496,25 ,000 francs), and from

               that period to 1830, excepting the year 1818, the

               Thus we ﬁnd that the average amount of the

               behind the United States in that respect. I 
               <br />
               said a moment ago that the question of a 
               <br />
               Confederation of all the Provinces of British 
               <br />
               North America was not a new one, and in 
               <br />
               fact we ﬁnd that it was mooted at a somewhat 
               <br />
               remote period of the histor of the country. In 
               <br />
               1821, the leader of the pper Canada Radi- 
               <br />
               cals, Mr. W. L. MACKENZIE, declared thathe 
               <br />
               wished with his whole heart that there could 
               <br />
               be a Confederation of the British Provinces. 
               <br />
               Ten years later the scheme became a special 
               <br />
               question of debate, and the discussion 
               <br />
               established it as a positive fact, as it will 
               <br />
               soon be an historical one. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Others besides the members on this side of 
               <br />
               the House are in favor of a Federal union; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> incline to a Confederation of all the

               two Canadas only—all are well disposed to a 
               <br />
               Federal union of one kind or other. At the 
               <br />
               time of the crisis of 1858, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BROWN-Damas</span> 
               <br />
               Government were to settle the difﬁculties 
               <br />
               then besetting us, and if I understood the 
               <br />
               meaning of one of the members of that 
               <br />
               Government, who went to meet his constitu- 
               <br />
               ents in order that they might ratify his 
               <br />
               acceptance of a portfolio in that Adminis 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the existing evils by that Cabinet was a 
               <br />
               Federal union of the two Cauadas ; but he 
               <br />
               said also that, although the policy of the 
               <br />
               Government to which he belonged was not 
               <br />
               yet clearly deﬁned, he thought they would 
               <br />
               take up, at some future day, the question of 
               <br />
               a Confederation of all the Provinces of 
               <br />
               British North America. That hon. member 
               <br />
               was the Hon. F. LEMIEUX, and he was re- 
               <br />
               turned by the county of Lévis immediately 
               <br />
               after making these declarations. Nearly 
               <br />
               about the same time Mr. J. C. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TACHI,</span> at

               ture, wrote a work which was almost prophe-

               tic of the question of a Confederation of the 
               <br />
               British North American Provinces. It is 
               <br />
               unnecessary to remark that that gentleman 
               <br />
               had acquired much experience in his travels, 
               <br />
               and much information by hard study and 
               <br />
               présevering labor, and was therefore perfectly 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed to form a judgment on the question.

               Mr. TAOHI: has written a work of some
