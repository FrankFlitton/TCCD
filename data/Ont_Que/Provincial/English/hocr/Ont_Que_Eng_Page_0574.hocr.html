               Mr. Domox argued that when Lower Canada 
               <br />
               had the preponderance of papulation, complaints 
               <br />
               were of the ine uality of the representation of 
               <br />
               that section. ’lhe union of Belgium and Hol- 
               <br />
               land, which was somewhat similar to that at 
               <br />
               present existing between Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada was dissolved when it was found it did 
               <br />
               not work advantageously to both countries. He 
               <br />
               instanced a number of uestions on which it was 
               <br />
               impossible for Upper an Lower Canada to agree ; 
               <br />
               public feeling being quite dissimilar—subjects op- 
               <br />
               ular in one section being the reverse in the ot er. 
               <br />
               He warned Lower Canada members, that when 
               <br />
               the time came that the whole of the representa- 
               <br />
               tives from the western portion of the province 
               <br />
               would be banded together on the question, they 
               <br />
               would obtain representation by pepulation, and 
               <br />
               secure the assistance of the Eastern Township 
               <br />
               members in so doing. He regarded a Federal 
               <br />
               union of Up r and Lower Canada as a nucleus 
               <br />
               of the great ‘onfederation of the North American 
               <br />
               Provinces to which all looked forward. He con- 
               <br />
               cluded by saying he would vote for the resolution, 
               <br />
               as the only mode by which the two sections of 
               <br />
               the province could get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> of the dilﬁculties in 
               <br />
               which they now are. He thought the union ought 
               <br />
               to be dissolved, and a Federal union of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces would in due time follow.

               and censure upon others. (Hear, hear.) The

               honorable gentleman thinks that the union

               proposed to us, that is to say Confederation, 
               <br />
               is without precedent in Colonial histor . He 
               <br />
               has, therefore, not read the Federal istory,

               scarcely accomplished, of the colonies of

               federation of the six colonies is without pre-

               logic and arecollection of facts are not among

               the most prominent features of the honorable

               evident to the House and to the country
