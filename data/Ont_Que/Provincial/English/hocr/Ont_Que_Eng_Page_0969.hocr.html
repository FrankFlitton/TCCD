               <br />
               diﬂiculties in which we were involved. They 
               <br />
               had in view only the interests of the nation, 
               <br />

               even indispensable, and calculated moreover

               Ma. GAGN ON — Mr. SpnAKnn, the

               scheme of a Confederation of the provinces

               <br />
               interesting to be received in silence. It I 
               <br />
               rise to speak on this occasion, it is for the 
               <br />
               simple purpose of justifying my opinion on 
               <br />
               the subject, by stating my reasons for enter-

               taining it; and as I am not in the habit of 
               <br />
               making speeches, I crave the indulgence of 
               <br />
               the House. It is the opinion of members 
               <br />
               on the other side of the House that the 
               <br />
               country will derive great advantages from 
               <br />
               this union; but those advantages depend, as 
               <br />
               most people think, on the contingencies of 
               <br />
               an unknown future, and by others, are looked 
               <br />
               upon as the doubtful results of a hazardous 
               <br />
               and dangerous speculation, which will in- 
               <br />
               vclve the ruin of our credit. Not only, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, do we risk our capital, which will 
               <br />
               be lost in the execution of this great scheme ;
