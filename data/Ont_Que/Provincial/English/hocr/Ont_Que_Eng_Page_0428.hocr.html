               gard to the General Legislature. Well, if 
               <br />
               we look to the history of the past twenty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve years and see how we have acted towards 
               <br />
               each other, I think neither party will have 
               <br />
               any cause for apprehension. Has there been 
               <br />
               a single set of aggression on the part of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the Attorney General East on us 
               <br />

               <br />
               a gression on our art towards the race to 
               <br />
               w 'ch he belongs (Hear, hear.) Has 
               <br />
               there not been mutual respect and conﬁdence, 
               <br />
               and has there been an act on either side to 
               <br />
               destroy that feeling? (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               think the past gives assurance to us that no 
               <br />
               such difﬁculty will arise in the future, and 
               <br />
               that we shall continue to live and work har- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moniously</span> together, each holding the other 
               <br />
               in respect and esteem. (Hear, hear.) But 
               <br />
               we are told—and it is urged as an objection 
               <br />
               against the scheme—that works of improve- 
               <br />
               ment will be obstructed by the Local Govern- 
               <br />
               ment in Lower Canada. Now, I think the 
               <br />
               day has long gone by when acts which were 
               <br />
               formerly committed could possibly be repeat- 
               <br />
               ed—when, for instance, before the union, 
               <br />
               the work carried on by the Montreal Harbor 
               <br />
               Commissioners could not he proceeded with 
               <br />
               because Mr. PAPINEAU opposed it. The days 
               <br />
               of progress and advancement have come since 
               <br />
               that time. This is an age of progress, the 
               <br />
               very spirit of which is hostile in the strong- 
               <br />
               est degrce to such a state of things. It is 
               <br />
               impossible for either race to treat the other 
               <br />
               with injustice. Their interests are too much 
               <br />
               bound up together, and any injustice com- 
               <br />
               mitted by one would react quite as injuri— 
               <br />
               ously upon it elsewhere; and I believe that 
               <br />
               the mutual conﬁdence with which we are 
               <br />
               going into this union ought to and will in- 
               <br />
               duce us all to labor together harmoniously, 
               <br />
               and endeavor to work it out for the best.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hear, hear.) I do not disguise from my- 
               <br />
               self that the minority in Lower Canada has 
               <br />
               always been on the defensive. That is a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">condition</span> which is natural under the circum-

               <br />
               without being more or less on the defensive. 
               <br />
               But I think that under this scheme the

               French minority in the General Legislature
