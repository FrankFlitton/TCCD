               which was deliberately established, whereby 
               <br />
               the debate was to be resumed every evening 
               <br />
               at half-past seven, I do not deny. I frankly 
               <br />
               admit it, and claim that we were justiﬁed in 
               <br />
               so doing; at all events I am prepared to 
               <br />
               take the responsibility of having contributed 
               <br />
               my share to that result. But as to the 
               <br />
               debate on the main motion, I defy the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General to indicate one hon. gentle-

               ment of the time oftheHouse—who has spoken 
               <br />
               beside the question—and who has spoken 
               <br />
               in order to postpone the question and to 
               <br />
               protract the debate. And for proof of this 
               <br />
               assertion, I venture to say that when we get 
               <br />
               the extended reports of this debate, it will 
               <br />
               be found that the space occupied by the

               of talking against time, by holding our

               SPEAKER, the hon. gentleman found fault 
               <br />
               with what I stated just now. But what I 
               <br />
               said was quite correct ; and that is, that we 
               <br />
               wanted to give as free scope to the debate 
               <br />

               on the other side had their opportunity to 
               <br />

               remember that on two occasions they actually

               hon. member for Brome (Mr. DUNKIN) was 
               <br />
               unable to continue his speech, at ten O’clock.

               Some hon. gentlemen on this side had

               Hon. Attorney General West to run away 
               <br />
               from the question by one of those “artful 
               <br />
               dodges,” for which he is so well known in 
               <br />
               this House and the country. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The question put to him by my honorable 
               <br />
               friend the member fon Chateauguay (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. HOLTON) was, whether he did not agree 
               <br />
               to the debate being continued on certain 
               <br />
               terms, and in such a way as that full oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity should be given to hon. members to 
               <br />
               move their amendments. It is very well for 
               <br />
               the Attorney General West to say that that 
               <br />
               arrangement was made, not for the beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               the House, not for the advantage of the 
               <br />
               public, not for the convenience of honorable 
               <br />
               members, but out of mere courtesy by the 
               <br />
               Government. Sir, the proposition was his 
               <br />
               own. The hon. gentleman himself came to 
               <br />
               the House and stated the manner in which 
               <br />
               the debate should be conducted, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">actually</span> 
               <br />
               proposing that the rule which prevented 
               <br />
               honorable members speaking more than once 
               <br />
               on the same question, with the Speaker 
               <br />
               in the chair, should be suspended, in 
               <br />
               order that every member should have the 
               <br />
               same freedom of discussion as though we 
               <br />
               were in Committee of the Whole. That was 
               <br />
               the proposition ofthe Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               West himself, thinking it the most proper 
               <br />
               way to conduct the course Of the debate. 
               <br />
               He went further, and stated it as his opinion 
               <br />
               that after the debate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commenced,</span> it should 
               <br />
               go on each day after half—past seven, leaving

               the afternoon sitting for the other business 
               <br />
               of the House. This was another of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s voluntary statements. Then,
