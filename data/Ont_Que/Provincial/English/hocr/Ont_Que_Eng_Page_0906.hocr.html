               at this late stage of the debate. I will,

               - therefore, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKnR,</span> simply say that I

               <br />
               the union will vastly enlarge our ideas of the 
               <br />
               greatness and ultimate destiny of these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, and give scope for higher aspirations. 
               <br />
               It will make the young men of this country 
               <br />
               feel that they have a better inheritance than 
               <br />
               they now feel to be theirs, and an Opportunity

               of rising to higher points of distinction in this 
               <br />
               the land of their birth or adoption. The same 
               <br />
               opportunities will also be Open to the young

               men of the Lower Provinces, and in this con- 
               <br />
               nection I have no hesitation in saying, from 
               <br />
               what I know of them, that the inhabitants 
               <br />
               of the Lower Provinces, for enterprise, in- 
               <br />
               dustry and general intelligence, will compare

               favorably with any other portion of the ter-

               <br />
               It will be an advantage to us to have their

               <br />
               been led to ad pt, it is my intention to sup-

               address you with very great reluctance, but

               myself and the peeple who sent me here,

               The task is the more diﬁoult at this stage 
               <br />
               of the debate, as the arguments for and 
               <br />
               against the measure have been already so 
               <br />
               ably and leugthily elaborated by members 
               <br />
               of this honorable House. Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               we have had eventful times in Canada. 
               <br />
               The union of the Cauadas was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anﬁmport-</span> 
               <br />
               ant event in this country; and, air, although 
               <br />
               latterly it has not worked satisfactorily, 
               <br />
               I am not one of those who are prepared to 
               <br />
               say that under that union we did not prosper. 
               <br />
               From a very small pepulation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we.</span> have 
               <br />
               grown, under the union, to be a very consid- 
               <br />
               erable pe0ple, comprising a population of two 
               <br />
               millions and a-half. We have also grown 
               <br />
               in wealth, intelligence, and everything else 
               <br />
               that tends to national greatness. But diﬁi- 
               <br />
               culties between the provinces have sprung 
               <br />
               up ; Upper Canada rapidly increased in po- 
               <br />
               pulation and wealth over Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               and has for the last ten or twelve years 
               <br />
               demanded an increased representation on the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor of this House. She argued, and very 
               <br />
               properly, that her position was a degraded 
               <br />
               one—that with a pepulation in excess of 
               <br />
               that of Lower Canada by 400,000 people, 
               <br />
               and oontributing about three-fourths of the 
               <br />
               revenue of this country, she was entitled to 
               <br />
               such a constitutional arrangement as would 
               <br />
               place her on a perfect equality with the 
               <br />
               sister province, and that she would not be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed until that was conceded, as the 
               <br />
               demand was a just and honorable one. Sir, 
               <br />
               just although this was, Lower Canada, with, 
               <br />
               I have no doubt, just as much honesty and 
               <br />
               quite as much determination, resisted their 
               <br />
               demand. Hence the terriﬁc struggles which 
               <br />
               ensued between the sections for the last few 
               <br />
               years. Within the past three years we have 
               <br />
               had no fewer than three Ministerial crises. 
               <br />
               Neither the one party nor the other could 
               <br />
               govern, so evenly were parties balanced in 
               <br />
               this House and.the country. The machinery 
               <br />
               of government was almost entirely stepped, 
               <br />
               and a chronic crisis had set in. Sir, it was 
               <br />
               apparent to every discerning mind that some 
               <br />
               solution of existing diﬁculties must be 
               <br />
               sought. The present state of things could 
               <br />
               not continue. Mr. SPEAKER, I well recollect 
               <br />
               the announcement of the Honorable At- 
               <br />
               torney General West. After the defeat

               ledged the political diﬂiculty in which this 
               <br />
               countr was placed. He informed the House 
               <br />
               that is Excellency the Governor General
