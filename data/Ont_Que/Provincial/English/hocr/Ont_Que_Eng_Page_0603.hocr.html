               inexpediency of a constitutional change ; 
               <br />
               second, the hostile object of Confederation; 
               <br />
               third, the disastrous consequences of the 
               <br />
               adoption of the project of Confederation. 
               <br />
               The inexpediency of a constitutional change 
               <br />
               must be perfectly evident to any one who 
               <br />
               considers for a moment the present prosperity 
               <br />
               of Canada, and who takes the trouble to 
               <br />
               examine the progress made by United 
               <br />
               Canada since 1840. The Hon. Attorney 
               <br />
               General East says that “ the union has donc 
               <br />
               its work.” But is that quite certain? 
               <br />
               When we compare the past with the present, 
               <br />
               have we not reason to be proud of our growth 
               <br />
               since A <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">840,</span> and of the fact that within the 
               <br />

               <br />
               social and material, has kept pace with that 
               <br />
               of the ﬁrst nations in the world? During 
               <br />
               the past twenty-ﬁve years we have progressed 
               <br />
               politically in a manner unprecedented in 
               <br />
               colonial history ; and Canada has furnished 
               <br />
               a magniﬁcent instance of the good result of
