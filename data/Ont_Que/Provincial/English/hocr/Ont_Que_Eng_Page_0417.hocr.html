               ments in favor of the Confederation of the

               show in a very few words, that if we are

               <br />
               continent for all time to come, and that if 
               <br />
               we do go into this union, as I believe we will 
               <br />

               <br />
               selves snccessfully from attack. And this, 
               <br />
               sir, unfortunately, is not a contingency 
               <br />
               which we can hope will never occur. his 
               <br />
               not now a more vague possibility in a far 
               <br />
               distant future which we have to consider. 
               <br />
               80 long as the present civil war continues, 
               <br />
               it is impossible torauy man to foresee that 
               <br />
               such national complications will not arise as 
               <br />
               may at any day or hour involve us in 
               <br />
               actual hostilities. It is impossible for any 
               <br />
               prudent man to disregard that dark threat- 
               <br />
               ening cloud that has been gathering upon 
               <br />
               our borders, ready at almost any mom ent to 
               <br />
               burst upon us. It behoves us therefore to 
               <br />
               lose no time, if we believe that union oﬁ'ers 
               <br />
               a guarantee of safety against the dangers that 
               <br />
               threaten us—it becomes important that we 
               <br />
               lose no time to consummate the proposed 
               <br />
               union, in order that the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment may put us at once in a preper state of 
               <br />
               defence. The public opinion of England, 
               <br />
               as we unhappily know, does not at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time tend very much to warrant the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government in making any large 
               <br />
               expenditure for colonial purposes. There 
               <br />
               must be some reasonable prospect, that if 
               <br />
               expenditure is incurred in erecting necessary 
               <br />
               works ofdefence, those works will be actually 
               <br />
               available, when constructed, to protect the 
               <br />
               country upon whose frontier they are estab- 
               <br />
               lished. We cannot expect England to enter 
               <br />
               upon a course of expenditure for fortiﬁca- 
               <br />
               tions on our frontier, unless she has the assu— 
               <br />
               rance of our ability with her aid to hold those 
               <br />
               works against attacks from a hostile power. 
               <br />
               I believe that if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> plan of union 
               <br />
               breaks down—fails to get the assent of the

               several <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces—and</span> we 0 back to our

               <br />
               so discourage the statesmen of England in

               reference to us, that they will feel very much 
               <br />
