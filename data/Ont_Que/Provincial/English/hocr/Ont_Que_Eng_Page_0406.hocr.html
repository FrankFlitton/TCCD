               with calling up past events, has also

               desire, as the representatives of Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada at the Conference, that we should have 
               <br />

               <br />
               them if it thought expedient. But, on the 
               <br />
               other hand, the appointment of the ju of 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the Central Government, and the reason of 
               <br />
               this provision is at once simple, natural and 
               <br />
               just. In the Confederacy we shall have a 
               <br />
               Central Parliament and local legislatures.— 
               <br />
               Well, I ask any reasonable man, an man of 
               <br />
               experience, does he think that, wit the am- 
               <br />
               bition which must naturally stimulate men of 
               <br />
               mark and talent to display their powers on 
               <br />
               the theatre most worthy of their talents, 
               <br />
               these men will consent to enter the local legis- 
               <br />
               latures rather than the Federal Parliament? 
               <br />
               Is it not more likely and more reasonable to 
               <br />
               suppose that they would rather ap and 
               <br />
               shine on the largest stage, on that m which 
               <br />
               they can render the greatest service to their 
               <br />
               country, and where the rewards of their ser- 
               <br />
               vices will be the highest? Yes, these men 
               <br />
               will prefer to go to the Central Parliament, 
               <br />
               and among them there will be doubtless many 
               <br />
               of our most distin ' hed members of the 
               <br />
               legal profession. he members of this pro- 
               <br />
               fession are often accused of going into Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment for the purpose of monopolising the 
               <br />
               representation. If this be the caseat the pres- 
               <br />
               ent time, is it not to be supposed that they will 
               <br />
               do the same thing under Confederation ? 
               <br />
               Were the appointment of the judges left to 
               <br />
               the local legislatures, the local governments 
               <br />
               would be subjected to a pressure which might

               be brought to bear upon them by the ﬁrst ad-

               member who might have three or four follow-
