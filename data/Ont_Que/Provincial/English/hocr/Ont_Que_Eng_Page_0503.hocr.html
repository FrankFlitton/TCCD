               <br />
               be astonished at the attempt which has been 
               <br />
               made by some honorable gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches to represent the state of 
               <br />

               <br />

               character which [ have ascribed toit. Long

               forgotten expressions of individual opinion ; 
               <br />
               clauses said to have formed part of bills not 
               <br />
               to be found, and not known to have been 
               <br />

               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> downwards, have been pressed into ser- 
               <br />
               vice to meet the exigencies of a hard case. 
               <br />
               Well, I shall not follow out that line of 
               <br />
               argument: it is not worth while. We all 
               <br />
               know that, from the time of the union of 
               <br />
               Canada, at all events, until very lately in- 
               <br />
               deed, nothing like serious discussion of the 
               <br />
               prepriety or impropriety ofa Federal union, 
               <br />
               or of any union at all, of the aggregate of 
               <br />
               these British American Provinces, has ever 
               <br />
               so little occupied the public mind. I will 
               <br />
               here go back merely to 1858, when the 
               <br />
               sixth Parliament was elected, and from that 
               <br />
               time bring under review, as rapidly as I can, 
               <br />
               such few points of our political history as 
               <br />
               are relevant to shew that this is the fact; 
               <br />
               although, indeed, argument to establish it is 
               <br />
               scarcely necessary. At the election of 1857- 
               <br />
               ’58, what really were the issues before the 
               <br />
               country? They can be easily stated. I 
               <br />
               take the résumé, in fact, from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an.</span> 
               <br />
               nouncements of the Globc, the organ of

               the great popular party of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               at that time; mentioning not every- 
               <br />
               thing, but everything at all material. The 
               <br />
               great demand of the then Upper Canada 
               <br />
               Opposition, which gave the key—note to the 
               <br />
               whole political controversies of the time, 
               <br />
               was representation according to population, 
               <br />
               irrespectively of the dividing line between 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada. That was urged 
               <br />
               as involving everything. It was urged for 
               <br />
               the sake of all the rest, and as sure to bring 
               <br />

               <br />
               much more than of those of Upper Canada 
               <br />

               reasons, to be unworthy of holding it. But 
               <br />

               <br />
               second. (Hear, hear.) The grand object 
               <br />
               was declared to be to obtain an Upper 
               <br />
               Canadian preponderance of representation 
               <br />
               on the ﬂoor of this House, in order to put an

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span> Canadian commercial policy, and to

               secure the North-West for the aggrandize- 
               <br />
               ment of Upper Canada. In this way the 
               <br />
               question of Upper Canada against Lower 
               <br />
               Canada was unmistakably raised. What 
               <br />
               must have been, what could not fail to be, 
               <br />
               the result of an appeal of that kind? It 
               <br />
               was easy to foresee that there would be

               returned in Upper Canada a majority in

               ghost of past animosities; I am merely
