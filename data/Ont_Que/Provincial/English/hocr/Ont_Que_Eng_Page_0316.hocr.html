               views of the Government, in regard to the

               constitutions of these provinces, of expressing 
               <br />
               their opinions, and of seeking to give effect to 
               <br />
               them. The same may be said in regard to 
               <br />
               the objections taken to the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way. It is asserted that the Intercolonial 
               <br />
               Railway is something that we ought never to 
               <br />
               have agreed to. But honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               will acknowledge, as a general proposition, 
               <br />
               that union is impossible without the railway, 
               <br />
               and such as believe that union is important 
               <br />
               and necessary, must be content to take the 
               <br />
               railway as a condition which is indispensable. 
               <br />
               But, honorable gentlemen, the Government 
               <br />
               cannot of itself build the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way. There is no power either in this Gov— 
               <br />
               ernment or the Governments of the other 
               <br />
               provinces to build it. We must come down 
               <br />
               to Parliament for the sanction—not to this 
               <br />
               Parliament, but to the Confederate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliar</span> 
               <br />
               _ment, and the Confederate Parliament will 
               <br />
               have an opportunity of saying upon what 
               <br />
               terms we shall build the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way. The fullest opportunity will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afforded</span> 
               <br />
               for discussion before either the Intercoloﬁial 
               <br />
               Railway is built, or the constitutions are 
               <br />
               adopted for Upper and Lower Canada. The 
               <br />
               former will be submitted to the Confederate 
               <br />
               Parliament; the latter, should the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions now before the House pass, to the pre- 
               <br />
               sent Parliament of Canada; for that must 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessarily</span> be a matter for the disposal of the 
               <br />
               Legislature of Canada. I amnot one of those 
               <br />
               who would, as suggested, desire to take shelter 
               <br />
               behind the resolutions before the House for 
               <br />
               any unworthy urpose; but this I will say, 
               <br />
               that the amen ment now before the House 
               <br />
               ought not to receive its sanction. I am quite 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that no honorable member of this 
               <br />

               honorable friend Hon. Mr. MATHESON. In 
               <br />
               1855, my honorable friend proposed a series 
               <br />
               of resolutions in this House against the elec- 
               <br />

               My honorable friend at that time looked for- 
               <br />
               ward to that which we now see about to take 
               <br />
               place—a union of these provinces—and he 
               <br />

               <br />
               would be fraught with difﬁculty. It has been 
               <br />
               fraught with difﬁculty, and it is a diﬂiculty 
               <br />
               which we must surmount—a barrier which 
               <br />
               we must strive to overcome. The personal 
               <br />
               objections which my honorable friend from 
               <br />
               Niagara division has started, are the poorest 
               <br />
               kind of objections. It is not what my hon- 
               <br />
               orable friend near me, or my honorable friend 
               <br />
               Opposite, possibly thought or said at some re- 
               <br />
               mote period, that we have now to consider. 
               <br />
               We are all more or less exposed to this sort 
               <br />
               of attack; but fortunately the time during 
               <br />
               which I have had the honor of being in pub- 
               <br />
               lic life has been so short, and the position I 
               <br />
               have since occupied has been so obscure, that 
               <br />
               I am not so much exposed as many others to 
               <br />
               these accusations; but I am well aware that 
               <br />
               this is owing to my comparative insigniﬁcance. 
               <br />
               I must say that for my part I am disposed to 
               <br />
               put aside all these things. I am disposed to 
               <br />
               put aside all reference to what an honorable 
               <br />
