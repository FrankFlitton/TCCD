               aticism in the west, will naturally be stiﬂed 
               <br />
               by the more rapid increase of the population 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada and the annual diminution 
               <br />
               of immigration. With the assistance .of 
               <br />
               these two causes our population will, in 
               <br />
               ten years, equal that of Upper Canada. I 
               <br />
               say, Mr. SPEAKER, that the scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               federation is not expedient. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'But</span> even if 
               <br />
               the scheme of Confederation was expedient, 
               <br />
               I maintain that the object of it is hostile. 
               <br />
               I gave an historical sketch of the encroach- 
               <br />
               ing spirit of the English race on the two 
               <br />
               continents. I pointed out the incessant 
               <br />
               antagonism existing between it and the 
               <br />
               French race. Our past recalled to us the 
               <br />
               constant struggle which we had to keep up 
               <br />
               in order to resist the aggression and the 
               <br />
               exclusiveness of the English element in 
               <br />
               Canada. It was only through heroic resist- 
               <br />
               ance and a happy combination of circum- 
               <br />
               stances that we succeeded in obtaining the 
               <br />
               political rights which are secured to us by 
               <br />
               the present Constitution. The scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation has no other object than to 
               <br />
               deprive us of the most precious of those 
               <br />
               rights, by substituting for them a political 
               <br />
               organization which is eminently hostile to 
               <br />
               us. The hostility of the scheme of Confed- 
               <br />
               eration being admitted, I maintain that its 
               <br />
               adeption will entail the most disastrous 
               <br />
               consequences. To impose upon the French- 
               <br />
               Canadians this new Constitution, which they 
               <br />
               do not want, is to tempt their anger and to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eäose</span> ourselves to deplorable collisions. 
               <br />
               ( ear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heat.)</span> It must necessarily be sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to them before it is adOpted : if they 
               <br />
               accept it, then will be the time to send it to 
               <br />
               England to be sanctioned. But the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and especially the Hon. Attorney Gen- 
               <br />
               eral East, cannot ignore the petitions which 
               <br />
               are presented to us against the scheme, and 
               <br />
               especially so imposing a petition as that from 
               <br />
               the city of Montreal, which contains 6,000 
               <br />
               French-Canadian signatures, and which is the 
               <br />
               most numerously signed petition which has 
               <br />
               ever been presented to our legislature by a 
               <br />
               city. Isay, further, that those who vote for 
               <br />
               the scheme of Confederation take the shortest. 
               <br />
               way to lead us into annexation to the United 
               <br />
               States. I am not the ﬁrst to express this opi- 
               <br />
               nion; several hon. members from Upper Ca- 
               <br />
               nada have expressed it before me within the 
               <br />
               precincts of this House, and it is because 
               <br />
               those members from Upper Canada desire 
               <br />
               annexation to the United States that they 
               <br />
               vote in favor of the scheme of Confederation.

               time to speak plainly here, and to warn him 
               <br />
               of the danger. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               I am not an old man with one foot already 
               <br />
               in the grave, and on the verge of eternity, 
               <br />
               and I adopt my course in view of the future. 
               <br />
               Our Ministers, who, in the course of a long 
               <br />
               career, have exhausted the supply of honor 
               <br />
               and of dignity in our country, are perhaps 
               <br />
               tempted to risk the future of their country 
               <br />
               for titles, honors and larger salaries under 
               <br />
               Confederation, perhaps for the sake of being 
               <br />
               governor of one of the Federated Provinces. 
               <br />
               We know that England nobly and royally 
               <br />
               rewards those who serve her without scruple. 
               <br />
               Besides, the prospect of founding a vast 
               <br />
               empire is well worth the sacriﬁce of some 
               <br />
               months of a worn out career, at the risk of 
               <br />
               not succeeding entirely in so gigantic a ro- 
               <br />
               ject. (Hear, hear.) But for my part, Ir. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I who belong to the coming 
               <br />
               generation, and who have twenty years of 
               <br />
               future before me, cannot approve, by my 
               <br />
               vote, of a scheme of Constitution which pre- 
               <br />
               sents itself to us in such a gloomy perspective 
               <br />
               as regards our nationality, and all that we 
               <br />
               hold most dear as Frenchmen. If I am thus 
               <br />
               severe in my remarks, Mr. SPEAKER, I hope 
               <br />
               it will be understood that they proceed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> 
               <br />
               profound conviction; and it is well known 
               <br />
               that those who have honey on their lips are 
               <br />
               not always the most sincere at heart. I 
               <br />
               know also that sometimes those who state 
               <br />
               boldly what they think pay very dearly lor 
               <br />
               their boldness and independence, but no 
               <br />
               dread of this, Mr. SPEAKER, shall ever 
               <br />
               cause me to shrink from expressing my con- 
               <br />
               Victions, when I consider that my doing so 
               <br />
               may be of any use to my country. (Hear,
