               diminished by emigration to the United

               States. The difﬁculties between the see-

               tions of the province have, during long 
               <br />
               years, driven our youth to foreign countries, 
               <br />
               and that is why that considerable increase 
               <br />
               does not appear, by the census, so great as in 
               <br />
               reality it has been. Thus the total number 
               <br />
               of French-Canadian emigrants to the United 
               <br />

               <br />
               1844 to 1850 the total amounted to 30,000; 
               <br />
               making, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1‘50,</span> a grand total of 64,000 of 
               <br />
               our countrymen who had passed into foreign 
               <br />
               lands. With such an emigration going on, 
               <br />
               it is clear that our population could not in- 
               <br />
               crease with rapidity; but now, fortunately, 
               <br />
               the movement of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population:</span> has assumed 
               <br />
               acontrary direction. Many families have 
               <br />
               already returned to us, whi!st many others 
               <br />
               are only awaiting a favorable opportunity to 
               <br />
               return to the country, which they ought 
               <br />
               never to have left. The French-Canadian 
               <br />
               population in the United States is still very 
               <br />
               considerable, as the following ﬁgures will 
               <br />
               show: in the State of Vermont there are 
               <br />
               14,000 French-Canadians ; in the State of 
               <br />
               New York 20,000; in Ohio and Pennsyl- 
               <br />
               vania, 6,000; in Michigan, 30,000; in Illi- 
               <br />
               nois, 20,000; in Wisconsin, 12,000; in 
               <br />
               Indiana, 5,000 ; in Minnesota, 15,000—with- 
               <br />
               out taking into consideration the fact that 
               <br />
               nearly 35,000 of our young men, besides, are 
               <br />
               enrolled in the army of the United States. 
               <br />
               What took place in Canada also took place 
               <br />
               in Acadia, where the French population also 
               <br />
               increased in a manner which was truly 
               <br />
               astonishing. From 1707 to 1737 this in— 
               <br />
               crease amounted to a proportion of 6 per 
               <br />
               cent. per annum ; in thirty years the total 
               <br />
               had increased ﬁvefold. It continued to 
               <br />
               increase in nearly a like proportion up to 
               <br />
               1755, the memorable date of the deportation 
               <br />
               of the Acadians. From 1755 to 1855 the 
               <br />
               Acadians increased tenfold by themselves, 
               <br />
               and now the French-Acadian population in
