               learned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">geologist—impossible</span> ; science tells us

               that it does not exist. (Hear, hear.) Now 
               <br />
               every man who has the least idea of public 
               <br />
               order, of political economy, must be well aware 
               <br />
               that a mere commercial union, a union for 
               <br />
               the levying of customs—a “Zollverein,” in a 
               <br />
               word—would not sufﬁce to create the well- 
               <br />
               being and general prosperity of the ﬁve pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. The Maritime Provinces are im- 
               <br />
               mensely important to us in a social, indus- 
               <br />
               trial, oommercial, political, and especially a 
               <br />
               military point of view. New Brunswick has 
               <br />
               also considerable resources. Looking at the 
               <br />
               seasonablcness, and the other points making 
               <br />
               for the union of the provinces, we must not 
               <br />
               omit to consider it in its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rela'Qn</span> to our means 
               <br />
               of defence. In this point of view, Newfound- 
               <br />
               land is of paramount importance. Casting a 
               <br />
               glance at it on the chart, we ﬁnd it lying 
               <br />
               across the Gulf of St. Lawrence, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commanding</span> 
               <br />
               the two straits by which the trade of the 
               <br />
               countries <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surrounding</span> the gulf and the river 
               <br />
               reaches the ocean. Let that island but fell 
               <br />
               into the hands of foreigners, the trade of Can- 
               <br />
               ada would. in war time be as completely 
               <br />
               stopped as if the ice of winter had erected its 
               <br />
               permanent domicile in the middle of the gulf. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) These are the reasons which 
               <br />
               have led our statesmen to secure, by all possi- 
               <br />
               ble means, the alliance of that province, as 
               <br />
               they well understood that, that wanting, the 
               <br />
               Confederation would lose the beneﬁt of all 
               <br />
               other advantages and would be in continual 
               <br />
               danger. The seaboard of Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               1,200 miles in length, and it possesses the 
               <br />
               ﬁnest harbours in the world, roadsteads which 
               <br />
               might shelter whole ﬂeets. The main source 
               <br />
               of her wealth is her ﬁsheries, in which more 
               <br />
               than 30,000 men are annually engaged—men 
               <br />
               accustomed to brave the waves of a tempestu- 
               <br />
               ous sea. Her trade in ﬁsh with foreign na- 
               <br />
               tions brings her in contact with nearly all the 
               <br />
               maritime countries of Europe, and with the 
               <br />
               United States, and yet she has at present 
               <br />
               scarcely any such connection with Canada.

               that island and Canada would be a ad- 
               <br />
               vantage to both provinces; for Newfoundland 
               <br />
               possesses what we want and requires what we 
               <br />
               have. It appears that the Island buys from 
               <br />
               the United States to the amount of several 
               <br />
               millions of dollars yearly, and exactly those 
               <br />
               articles which we are able to furnish; and 
               <br />
               that the current of trade having taken its 
               <br />
               present direction, is owing to certain ﬁscal 
               <br />
               impediments to trade between the two pro 
               <br />
               vinces. With free trade, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would buy from Canada woollen stuﬁ's, cutlery 
               <br />
               and hardware—everything, in short, which 
               <br />
               she requires. Under Confederation, the town 
               <br />
               of St. Johns, in Newfoundland, would be the 
               <br />
               most easterly sea-port of the union, and by 
               <br />
               making it a port of call for our transatlantic 
               <br />
               steamers, it would bring us within six days of 
               <br />
               the Mother Country As to Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island, that also has its importance. Its 
               <br />
               revenue is well managed ; it is in a prosperous 
               <br />
               state, and has no debt; on the contrary, it has 
               <br />
               a considerable reserve fund. Accordingly, 
               <br />
               now is the time to take a step in the right 
               <br />
               direction. This union of the provinces is a 
               <br />
               political necessity, and any delay would entail 
               <br />
               the danger of losing the opportunity alto- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ads, with her immense commerce, is indebted 
               <br />
               for her access to the seaboard during six 
               <br />
               months of the year to the tolerant good-will 
               <br />
               of a neighboring nation. If that permission 
               <br />
               were withdrawn, our merchants must im

               thus connecting the two extremities of the

               empire—the personal element, the territorial, 
               <br />
               and the maritime element. In Canada we have

               the nal and the territorial elements; the 
               <br />
