               such an advanced stage of the debate, it is

               the House for any lengthened period, espe- 
               <br />
               cially as the topic of Confederation which 
               <br />
               has been under consideration for several

               should be doingmy duty were I to allow 
               <br />
               this question to pass without remark, and

               <br />
               Ministers call upon us to do on this occasion ? 
               <br />
               To pass an Address to Her Majesty,praying 
               <br />
               Her by a single stroke of the pen to cancel 
               <br />
               our present Constitution, and to substitute 
               <br />
               another based on the seventy-two resolutions 
               <br />
               adopted by the Conference at Quebec, held 
               <br />
               on the 10th October last. and which resolu- 
               <br />
               tions are now before the House. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am'</span> con- 
               <br />
               vinced that the Quebec Conference, when

               advancement. I may be deceived, Mr.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKI’,</span> and I sincerely hope that I am. 
               <br />
               I hope that the electors of New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               who have just rejected the scheme of the 
               <br />
               Quebec Conference, and at the same time 
               <br />
               assed a direct vote of censure against the 
               <br />
               most illustrious men in that province, for 
               <br />
               having agreed to this scheme, and, by so doing, 
               <br />
               compromised the interests of their country— 
               <br />
               I hope, I say, that these electors <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have‘also</span> 
               <br />
               been mistaken, knowing, as I do, that obedi-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ence.</span> must be yielded to the majority, and 
               <br />
               that, in spite of their triumphant opposition, 
               <br />
               Confederation will be imposed upon us as 
               <br />
               now projected. It is sought by a single 
               <br />
               stroke of the pen to abrogate our Constitu- 
               <br />
               tional Act, and to substitute for it a Consti-

               gethcr ignorant, of which, indeed, every 
               <br />
               effort is made to keep us in ignorance. We

               are urged to exchange what we now have 
               <br />
