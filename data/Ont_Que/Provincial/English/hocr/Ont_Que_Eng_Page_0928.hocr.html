               <br />
               statesmen, the wisest men, who became con- 
               <br />
               spicuous during the American revolution, were 
               <br />
               clearly of opinion that a government to be 
               <br />
               strong must be a unit, and must possess with- 
               <br />
               in itself, and in all its organs, supreme power 
               <br />
               and a commanding inﬂuence. To diﬂ'use those

               were, or even to share them with state or 
               <br />
               coal governments, they felt would weaken it 
               <br />
               in its most vital parts. They would, there- 
               <br />
               fore, have stripped the States of every attri— 
               <br />
               bute of sovereignty, and conﬁned their action 
               <br />
               to matters of a purely local or municipal char- 
               <br />
               acter; but they had not the power, and the 
               <br />
               consequences are visible in the fratricidal war 
               <br />
               now raging among them, devastating their 
               <br />
               fairest provinces and ﬁlling the land with 
               <br />
               mourning and woe. The lessons of histor 
               <br />
               and the experience of other peoples should 
               <br />
               not be lost upon us; and for myself,I hesitate 
               <br />
               not to say that if, in the proposed Feder- 
               <br />
               ation of the British American colonies, we 
               <br />
               were to follow the example of the framers of 
               <br />
               the Government of the United States, or to 
               <br />
               copy its Constitution, it would have my most 
               <br />
               determined opposition. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“heme</span> before 
               <br />
               us, however, is formed after a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> model, 
               <br />
               and in its essential features is in perfect con- 
               <br />
               trast to that on which the Constitution of the 
               <br />
               United States is based. It is true it creates 
               <br />
               local governments with large legislative and 
               <br />
               executive powers; it is true it gives those 
               <br />
               governments concurrent powers with the Gen- 
               <br />
               eral Government; it is true it gives them pes- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">session</span> of the public lands within their several 
               <br />
               jurisdictions; it is true it allows two of those 
               <br />
               governments to levy export duties on lumber, 
               <br />
               coal and other minerals,—and looked at in the 
               <br />
               light of an advanced litical science, this is 
               <br />
               to be lamented ; but ooked at in the light of 
               <br />
               possible and practicable statesmanship, it was 
               <br />
               unavoidable. I am, therefore, prepared to 
               <br />
               accept it as a whole, as in fact the best that

               stances in which it was framed. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               A careful analysis of the scheme convinces me 
               <br />
               that the powers conferred on the General or

               <br />
               which its executive will possess, and to which 
               <br />
               all local legislation will be subject, will pre— 
               <br />

               <br />
               matters of importance, so that I believe in its

               working it will be found, if not in form yet 
               <br />
               in fact and practically, a legislative union. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Taking this general and, as I 
               <br />
               believe, correct view of the ease, I shall ab- 
               <br />
               stain from all criticism of its minor details, in 
               <br />
               the hope that what is found hereafter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imma—</span> 
               <br />
               ture or unworkable will be abandoned by 
               <br />
               general consent. The Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> 
               <br />
               will take care, no doubt, that that part of the

               scheme which conﬂicts with the prerogatives 
               <br />
               of the Crown will be removed, or, at all events, 
               <br />
               be brought into harmony with them. On one 
               <br />
               or two points brought out very fully by the 
               <br />
               Catholic members of the House in oppo- 
               <br />
               sition to the scheme, I shall venture to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂer</span> a few remarks. They take exce tion to 
               <br />
               the power conferred on the General overn- 
               <br />
               ment-in the matter of marriage and divorce. 
               <br />
               I think, sir, the power is very properly placed 
               <br />
               there. I respect their religious convictions; 
               <br />
               as a Protestant, I ask them to resp t mine. 
               <br />
               We owe each other mutual tolera lon. If 
               <br />
               the Protestant section of this House and this 
               <br />
               province do not regard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">marriage</span> as a sacra- 
               <br />
               ment, and, therefore, inviolab e and indis- 
               <br />
               soluble, I believe they will be found to have as 
               <br />
               h' h an Opinion of the sacred obligations in- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">väved</span> in it, and admit it to be as binding upon 
               <br />
               the conscience of all who enter upon that hol

            </p>

               <br />
