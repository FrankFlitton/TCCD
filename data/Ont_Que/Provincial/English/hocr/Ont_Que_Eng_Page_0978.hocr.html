               when I say that I was as much astonished as 
               <br />

               to the conclusion that the state of parties at 
               <br />
               that time, and the conduct of some so—called

               <br />
               such an event; and I do not blame the Con- 
               <br />
               servatives who were in that Government for 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffered</span> a good deal personally in making the

               <br />
               they did it for any other object than to satisfy 
               <br />
               the obligations of their conscience. Their 
               <br />
               object, sir, was, no doubt, the good of the 
               <br />
               country, not the small gain or the temporary 
               <br />
               pleasure of holding for a few years the po- 
               <br />
               sition of Ministers. (Hear.) I trust they 
               <br />
               will discharge their duty as Ministers in such 
               <br />
               a way as to enable the people of the country 
               <br />
               to regard their advent to power with satisfac- 
               <br />
               tion—not to condemn them ior wrong-doing 
               <br />
               as traitors to their country. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I think, sir, there are Ministers in the Cabinet 
               <br />
               who could make far more money in the pur— 
               <br />
               suit of their various avocations than in gov- 
               <br />
               erning the country, and I trust they will be 
               <br />
               as economical as they can in all their expen- 
               <br />
               diture, while not losing sight of one great aim 
               <br />
               —that the people of this country must be pre— 
               <br />
               pared to defend themselves, so as not to be 
               <br />
               afraid of the threats and alarms that reach us 
               <br />
               every day. If in the end we arrive at a union 
               <br />
               of the colonies, good results will ﬂow from it. 
               <br />
               I think we have no evil results to fear, though 
               <br />
               I would at this moment, if I could, remedy 
               <br />
               some of the faults in these seventy-two reso- 
               <br />
               lutions. I am sorry, for instance, for one 
               <br />
               thing—that the clause relating to the general 
               <br />
               education of the people of this country was 
               <br />
               inserted in its present shape into the resolu-

               tions. I am sorry the separate school system 
               <br />
               is to be retained for Upper Canada. I am

               is mentioned in these resolutions. I had a

               Canada which will remove them from their 
               <br />
               seats, as others have been removed from those 
               <br />

               contributed by the west is spent in the east,

               <br />

               <br />
               there is not a man in Upper Canada who does 
               <br />
               not see the necessity of having our navigation 
               <br />
               improved and a sufﬁcient channel for sea- 
               <br />
               going vessels made to the seaboard. If this 
               <br />
               is attended to, there will not be so much 
               <br />
               to complain of about the Intercolonial Rail-

               <br />
               have it built ata cheaper rate. In conclusion, 
               <br />
               I would say, that notwithstanding all the

               objections Imay have to details—-yet, in view
