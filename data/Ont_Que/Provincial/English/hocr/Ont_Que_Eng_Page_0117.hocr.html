               tten. The President of the United States 
               <br />
               is said recently to have declared that the 
               <br />
               produce of the petroleum wells of the United 
               <br />
               States will in half a dozen years pay off the 
               <br />
               whole national debt of the republic. Well, 
               <br />
               sir, we too have “ struck oil,” and every day 
               <br />
               brings us intelligence of fresh discoveries— 
               <br />
               (hear, hear, and laughter)-—and if the enor- 
               <br />
               mous debt of our neighbors may possibly be 
               <br />
               met by the oily stream, may we not hope 
               <br />
               that some material addition to our annual 
               <br />
               industrial revenue may ﬂow from our petro- 
               <br />
               leum regions? (Hear, hear.) Another vast 
               <br />
               branch of British American industry is the tim- 
               <br />
               ber and lumber trade. In the year 1862, our 
               <br />
               saw-mills turned out not less than 772,000,- 
               <br />
               000 feet of manufactured lumber,and our whole 
               <br />
               timber exports summed up to the value of 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen millions of dollars. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               manufacturing interests of the provinces, too, 
               <br />
               are fast rising into importance; agricultural 
               <br />
               implement works, woollen factories and cotton 
               <br />
               mills, tanneries and shoe factories, iron works 
               <br />
               and rolling mills, ﬂax works and paper mills, 
               <br />
               and many other extensive and proﬁtable me-

               raise the value of our public securities, that it

               <br />
               marked evidence of the gratiﬁcation with which 
               <br />
               the Confederation scheme was received by all 
               <br />
               classes of the people, and the deep interest 
               <br />
               taken in its success. Let me state one fact in 
               <br />
               illustration. For some time previous to No- 
               <br />
               vember last our securities had gone very low 
               <br />

               <br />
               honorable friend the Finance Minister ex- 
               <br />
               plained the other night, of the war raging 
               <br />
               on our borders, the uncertainty which hung 
               <br />
               over the future of this province, and the 
               <br />
               fear that we might be involved in trouble with 
               <br />
               our neighbors. Our ﬁve per cent. debentures 
               <br />
               went down in the market so low as 71, but 
               <br />
               they recovered from 71 to 75, I think, upon 
               <br />
               the day the resolutions for Confederation, 
               <br />
               which we are now discussing, reached London. 
               <br />
               Well, sir, the resolutions were published in the 
               <br />
               London papers, with eulogistic editorial ar- 
               <br />
               ticles, and the immediate effect of the scheme 
               <br />
               upon the public mind was such that our ﬁve 
               <br />
               per cents. rose from 75 to 92. Hear, hear.)
