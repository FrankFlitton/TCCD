               <br />
               that we should have our doubts and appre-

               hensions about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> (Hear, hear.) I take it

               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestants</span> of Lower Canada have 
               <br />
               no cause of complaint against our French- 
               <br />
               Canadian neighbors. We have lived together 
               <br />
               since the union on good terms, and all our in- 
               <br />
               tercourse has been founded on equity and 
               <br />
               justice. (Hear, hear.) But there is a feel- 
               <br />
               ing amongst our community that they 
               <br />
               should be removed beyond the possibility of 
               <br />
               danger from any aggression by the F rench— 
               <br />
               Canadian population, and it is diﬁicult to satisfy 
               <br />
               them that the scheme before the House and 
               <br />
               country will permit them to indulge in that 
               <br />
               feeling of security. (Hear, hear.) It is not 
               <br />
               necessary for me, sir, to enter into any lengthy 
               <br />
               remarks upon this subject, nor to follow those 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen who have gone into the 
               <br />
               matter thoroughly. I have no doubt that if

               a union of all the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces can be brought about on terms that 
               <br />
               shall be just and equitable to all sections and 
               <br />
               interests, it would be very advantageous to all 
               <br />
               of them. (Hear, hear.) I shall not, sir, de- 
               <br />
               tain the House any longer, but shall conclude 
               <br />
               by expressing my sincere hope that when we 
               <br />
               are again called upon to legislate upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> 
               <br />

               important change of our Constitution will be 
               <br />

               <br />

               There is not the least doubt that the honor-

               tant in its religious belief, and we know very 
               <br />
               well that great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts</span> have been made by those

               Ma. BYMAL said—Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Semen,</span> relying 
               <br />
               upon the pledge given by the Hon. Attorney 
               <br />
               General West, that the members of this 
               <br />
               House would have a fair Opportunity of 
               <br />
               expressing their views upon all the details 
               <br />
               of this measure, I had proposed reserving 
               <br />
               what little I had to say till such time as 
               <br />
               amendments embodying my views were be— 
               <br />
               fore the House. But the pledge which I 
               <br />
               expected would be carried out in good faith 
               <br />
               has been violated by that hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               and I am compelled now to raise m voice, 
               <br />
               and in my weak way, to assert what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span> would 
               <br />
               much rather have recorded by my vote. 
               <br />
               You are well aware, sir, and every member 
               <br />
               of the House is aware, of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances</span> 
               <br />
               that called into existence the present Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and the avowed object for which it 
               <br />
               was formed; and all they asked, so far as I 
               <br />
               am aware, was that a certain degree of for- 
               <br />
               bearanoe should be shown to them, in order 
               <br />
               that they might form a scheme that would 
               <br />
               remove the diﬁcnlties existing between 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada, and, perhaps, 
               <br />
               tend to bring about a union of all the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. As I understood the policy of the 
               <br />
               Government, the Federation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada:</span> 
               <br />
               was the ﬁrst object aimed at, arranging it in 
               <br />
               such a manner as to allow the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces to come in when they desired to do 
               <br />
               so. Mr. SPuKnB, that has by some been 
               <br />
               denied ; but reading the memorandum drawn 
               <br />
               up and read by the Government at the time 
               <br />
               explanations were given to this House, and 
               <br />
               understanding as I do the purport of it, I 
               <br />
               think there is no loop-hole of escape from 
               <br />
               the obligation the Government were under 
               <br />
               to carry out the Federation of the Canadss 
               <br />
               ﬁrst, leaving it to the other provinces to 
               <br />
               come in afterwards if they saw ﬁt. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I bring, then, two charges against 
               <br />
               the Government—one against the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General West, and the other 
               <br />
               against those hon. friends in the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment with whom I havesolong acted. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst is, that the Hon. Attorney General West 
               <br />
               broke faith with the House in preventing 
               <br />
               amendments being moved; and the second 
               <br />
               is, that the Reform members of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment broke faith in not bringing down a 
               <br />
               measure for the Federation of the Canadas. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I had hoped, sir, that the 
               <br />
               infusion of some pure blood into the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment—the addition of two or three men who 
               <br />
               had denounced all sorts of wickedness and 
               <br />
               corruption so loudly as the hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               who went into the Government last sum- 
               <br />
               mer—would at least have brought about some 
               <br />
