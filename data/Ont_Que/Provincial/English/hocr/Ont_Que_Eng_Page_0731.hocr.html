               the Hon. Attorney General for Upper

               Canada observed yesterday, to despatch 
               <br />
               delegates to England, to lay before the

               ’Imperial Parliament the resolutions adopted 
               <br />
               at the Conference. The Government wish 
               <br />
               to give effect to the compromise entered into 
               <br />
               between the Maritime Provinces and Canada, 
               <br />
               to enable the Imperial Government to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> 
               <br />
               their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">counsel</span> to the governments of the 
               <br />
               provinces, who have backed out from

               their agreement, and show them that the

               document to which they would have their 
               <br />
               sanction is a compromise. They would 
               <br />
               prove to Great Britain that if one of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces, or all of them, refuse 
               <br />
               to carry out the terms of the compromise 
               <br />
               after their solemn engagement with the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government to observe it—-if, in 
               <br />
               short, they have failed to fulﬁl the terms of 
               <br />
               the treaty—Canada has been true to them, 
               <br />
               and desires its fulﬁlment. The Constitution 
               <br />
               prayed for is not a Constitution for the two 
               <br />
               Canadas only, as the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Chateauguay said it was, putting a false

               construction on the explanations of my hon.

               <br />
               House for a decision, it is not to enable 
               <br />
               them to go to England and ask for a Con- 
               <br />
               stitution for the Canadas, under a pretext that 
               <br />
               the other contracting provinces have failed 
               <br />

               had the interests of Lower Canada at heart, 
               <br />
               and have guarded them more sedulously than

               the hon. member for Hochelaga and his

               Mr. SPEAKER, I do not hesitate to maintain 
               <br />
               that that question of the seat of government 
               <br />
               was decided favorably for Lower Canada. I

               <br />
               maintain it always and against all comers. 
               <br />
               I now come to the observations of the hon. 
               <br />

               what the Government propose to do: We

               that Canada consented to compromises and

               <br />

               member for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ctunty</span> of Quebec to lay 
               <br />
               aside his fears. I assure him that not a 
               <br />
               single member of the Government has the 
               <br />
               slightest intention of asking Great Britain 
               <br />
               to legislate on the Address which we are to 
               <br />
               present, and to passa Constitution for the 
               <br />
               two Canadas. Our whole intention is to lay 
               <br />
               before the Government of the Mother Coun- 
               <br />
               try our position, as it now is, in consequence 
               <br />
               of the breaking of the treaty by the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces, in order that they 
               <br />
               may bring some pressure to bear on 
               <br />
               them to bring about the Federal union 
               <br />
               which was designed. Even though the 
               <br />
               legislatures of those provinces should rue 
               <br />
               the part they took in the plan of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con-</span> 
               <br />
               federation, the ad0ption of it would be 
               <br />
               only a question of time ; for probably within 
               <br />
               twelve months they will amend their deci- 
               <br />
               sion and accept the compromise. We say 
               <br />
               that as far as we are concerned, we can do 
               <br />
               neither more nor less than carry out the 
               <br />
               compromise ; that we are desirous of acquit- 
               <br />
               ting ourselves of the duty we owe to the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government, as they thought ﬁt to 
               <br />
               sanction it in the des atch laid before this 
               <br />
               House, as well as by t e honorable mention 
               <br />
               made of it in Her Most Gracious Majesty's 
               <br />
               Speech from the Throne. It is of conse— 
               <br />
               quence, I say, that we should show the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government that Canada, which 
               <br />
               contains more than three-fourths of the 
               <br />
               population of all the provinces on this con- 
               <br />
               tinent, has not failed to fulﬁl her part in 
               <br />
               the compromise, but that the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces it is which have broken their 
               <br />
               sworn engagement, and that if the compro- 
               <br />
               mise is not to be carried into eﬁ'eet, English 
               <br />
               supremacy over the American colonies may 
               <br />
               at no distant day be endangered. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> trust 
               <br />
               that all these considerations may have a 
               <br />
               salutary effect, that they will dissipate the
