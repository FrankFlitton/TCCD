               a diﬁ'erent position from his two reform col- 
               <br />
               leagues. He came generously to the aid of 
               <br />
               his friends who ﬁrst joined the Coalition, but 
               <br />
               he stipulated that he must ﬁrst go to his

               <br />

               <br />
               eﬂ'ect, that the scheme of Confederation was 
               <br />
               now before the country—that he knew no 
               <br />
               more about it than they did themselves, and 
               <br />
               that he must say there were features in the 
               <br />
               scheme which he did not like. I acquit him 
               <br />
               of being in the same category with hon.
