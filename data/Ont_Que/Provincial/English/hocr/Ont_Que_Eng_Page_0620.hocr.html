               To see the manner, Mr. SPEAKER, in which 
               <br />
               certain members of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> receive the 
               <br />
               account contained in one of the saddest 
               <br />
               ages of the history of New France, one 
               <br />
               would really believe that the facts which I 
               <br />
               have cited never occurred, and do not con- 
               <br />
               vey any instruction for the future. However, 
               <br />
               I am not surprised at such conduct on their 
               <br />
               part, when they can approve of a lan of a 
               <br />
               Constitution which contains a cause by 
               <br />
               which the Imperial Government is enabled 
               <br />
               even to change our name of Canadians to give 
               <br />
               us any one they may think proper. The 
               <br />
               recollection of our struggles cannot be very 
               <br />
               vivid in their memory, and the love of their 
               <br />
               nationality must be very weakly rooted in 
               <br />
               their hearts, to allow of their consenting to 
               <br />
               lose, with the name of Canadians, the 
               <br />
               memory of an heroic past. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Under Confederation, Canada will be no longer 
               <br />
               a country possessing a distinct individuality, 
               <br />
               and her own history and customs, but she 
               <br />
               will be a state in the Confederacy, the gen- 
               <br />
               eral name of which will cause the special 
               <br />
               name of each province of which it is com- 
               <br />
               posed to disappear. Look at the states of 
               <br />
               the American Union; the name of the 
               <br />
               _United States does away with that of the 
               <br />
               Individual states. 80 with Canada; the 
               <br />
               name of the Confederacy will be that by 
               <br />
               which we shall be known in foreign lands. 
               <br />
               For my part, I am proud of our history and 
               <br />
               of my designation of Canadian, and I wish 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">keep</span> it. I am not one of those who can

               listen without interest to the recital of the 
               <br />

               shewing what was the spirit of antagonism 
               <br />
               and strife which prevailed on the American 
               <br />
               continent up to 1755. We saw Acadia 
               <br />
               made a prey to the attacks of New England, 
               <br />
               and lastly, we saw her pOpulation dispersed 
               <br />
               over the inhospitable shores of this continent 
               <br />
               which border on the Atlantic ocean. N cw 
               <br />
               France had thus lost the greater part of her 
               <br />
               territory in America. The seven years’ 
               <br />
               war advanced with the strides of a giant, 
               <br />
               and every day saw the French element con— 
               <br />
               ﬁned within narrower boundaries. After a 
               <br />
               prolonged contest, during which handfuls of 
               <br />
               men struggled with armies of ten times their 
               <br />
               number, when they were without bread, with- 
               <br />
               out munitions of war and almost without hope, 
               <br />
               the battle of the Plains of Abraham struck the 
               <br />
               last blow to the French power in America. 
               <br />
               In the following year the battle of Ste. Foye, 
               <br />
               which took place on the 28th April, 1760, 
               <br />
               soon compelled the Canadians to capitulate, 
               <br />
               although they were the victors in that battle, 
               <br />
               and the English were compelled to take 
               <br />
               shelter behind the walls of Quebec. In the 
               <br />
               treaty of capitulation,England guaranteed to 
               <br />
               the French-Canadians the free exercise of 
               <br />
               their form of worship, the preservation of 
               <br />
               their institutions, the use of their language 
               <br />
               and the maintenance of their laws. After 
               <br />
               this struggle on the ﬁeld of honor, which 
               <br />
               called down upon the French-Canadians a 
               <br />
               most magniﬁcent tribute of praise from their 
               <br />
               Governor, we shall ﬁnd them engaged in a 
               <br />
               new struggle, a political struggle, yet more 
               <br />
               glorious than that which had preceded the 
               <br />
               cession of Canada to England. But permit 
               <br />
               me here, Mr. SPEAKER, to quote the eulo- 
               <br />
               gium pronounced on the Canadians by Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor VAUDREUIL in a letter which he wrote 
               <br />
               to the ministers of LOUIS XIV. :—“ With 
               <br />
               this beautiful and extensive country France 
               <br />
               loses 70,000 souls, who are of a nature so sel- 
               <br />
               dom found,that never yet were peOple so docile, 
               <br />
               so brave, and so attached to their prince.” 
               <br />
               These qualities, for which the French-Cana- 
               <br />
               dians were distinguished at that period, still 
               <br />
               exist in the hearts of the population at the 
               <br />
               present day. At the present day still they 
               <br />
               are loyal, brave and attached to monarchical 
               <br />
               institutions; they love ﬁrmly-established 
               <br />
               institutions, and the guarantees of peace 
               <br />
               accorded by a great power, and the struggles 
               <br />
               through which they have had to pass under 
               <br />
               English domination have been the best proofs 
               <br />
               of their loyalty. If we study the history of 
               <br />
               our struggles since the cession of Canada, we 
               <br />
