               be done, it would no doubt be agreeable to 
               <br />
               the pe0ple of Upper Canada, because we think 
               <br />
               that in our Common School system there 
               <br />
               should be no element of sectarianism. As 
               <br />
               a people, we are desirous of having our 
               <br />
               School law without any provision for separate 
               <br />
               schools. It is perhaps a bold statement to 
               <br />
               make, but I believe the people of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada as a whole, Roman Catholics as well 
               <br />
               as Protestants, would be content with our 
               <br />
               school system without a particle of sectarian- 
               <br />
               ism in it. We could scarcely expect that 
               <br />
               if we were to succeed in framing a basis of 
               <br />
               union under a new Constitution, we could 
               <br />
               get the sectarian clauses of the School Act 
               <br />
               removed, if they were insisted upon as sine 
               <br />
               qua non by the Roman Catholics in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada in conjunctien with the adherents of 
               <br />
               the same faith in Upper Canada. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> 
               <br />
               withstanding this, although it is a sensitive 
               <br />
               point in Upper Canada, and particularly 
               <br />
               among my own constituents, I venture to 
               <br />
               say that the people of the west generally, 1n 
               <br />
               their willingness at all times to listen to 
               <br />
               reason, will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cîuite</span> content to accept the 
               <br />
               scheme as a who e, as it has been presented 
               <br />
               to us. (Hear, hear.) I hope that no 
               <br />
               attempt will be made to increase the pri- 
               <br />
               vileges of the advocates of separate schools, 
               <br />
               but that the question will be left where 
               <br />
               we now ﬁnd it. (Hear, hear.) It is 
               <br />
               worth while, perhaps, to read a single 
               <br />
               passage, written by a distinguished man, in 
               <br />
               reference to this principle of concession. I 
               <br />
               have already instanced the views of e 
               <br />
               framers of the American Constitution when 
               <br />
               they set to work to do away with the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               Federation scheme and to adopt a new Con- 
               <br />
               stitution. When they had framed the new 
               <br />
               Constitution, we ﬁnd WASHINGTON accom- 
               <br />

               as we have the means within ourselves of

               making them to a certain extent dependent 
               <br />
               upon us. Look at the map of this country, 
               <br />
               look at the position we occupy geographic- 
               <br />
               ally; see the outlet we possess to the ocean ; 
               <br />
               look at the magniﬁcent St. Lawrence, with 
               <br />
               the vast grain growing country beyond it. 
               <br />
               Is it not in our power to draw the trade of 
               <br />
               the Great West through this its natural 
               <br />
               outlet to the ocean ? Is it not possible toao 
               <br />
               improve this channel as to bring the produce 
               <br />
               of the great Western States to market 
               <br />
               through our territory? Is it not possible, 
               <br />
               by means of a little judicious outlay, to make 
               <br />
               the peeple of the United States dependent 
               <br />
               on us, instead of us being dependent 
               <br />
               on them? (Hear, hear.) There is 
               <br />
               much that could be said on this sub- 
               <br />

               to for securing to us these beneﬁts of trade 
               <br />
               and commerce. It is not so much to the en-

               largement of the Welland and St. Lawrence 
               <br />
               canals, although that is necessary, as to the 
               <br />
               construction of a ship canal to Lake Huron 
               <br />
               through the Ottawa country, that in my 
               <br />
               opinion we must look for the ultimate com- 
               <br />
               mercial greatness of this country, as furnish-

               <br />
