               we shall not be unanimous. I for one, ever 
               <br />
               since I have thought anything about poli— 
               <br />
               tics, have always looked forward to the time 
               <br />
               when such a scheme as this might be carried 
               <br />
               out. I have been an advocate ot'a legislative 
               <br />
               union. I think that is the correct principle, 
               <br />
               but I am not ashamed to say that I am open to 
               <br />
               conviction, and in dealing with a great 
               <br />
               question like this we must-not expect to 
               <br />
               have everything to meet our own views; we 
               <br />
               must be prepared to make concessions, and 
               <br />
               take the best we can get. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We know the hesitation with which the 
               <br />
               Constitution of the United States was 
               <br />
               accepted; that WASHINGTON—the father of 
               <br />
               that great country—expressed himself, as 
               <br />
               well as many other eminent persons, against 
               <br />
               it, but accepted it as the best that could be 
               <br />
               had. We ﬁnd the same expressions falling 
               <br />
               from the gentlemen of the Conference which 
               <br />
               prepared this measure. They believe that it 
               <br />
               was the very best that could be had under 
               <br />
               the circumstances. (Hear.) Now, if we 
               <br />
               look for one moment at the work of the Con- 
               <br />
               ference which met here in Quebec, whether 
               <br />
               the scheme is what we all could desire for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> not, we must admit 
               <br />
               that the gentlemen who composed that Con- 
               <br />
               ference were men of ability, men of mind,

               proached the question in a spirit of the tru-

               <br />

               minds of Canadians at present that we ought
