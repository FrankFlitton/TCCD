               continued attention of the House, at this late 
               <br />
               period of the evening, yet such is the rest 
               <br />
               importance of the question before us, t at I 
               <br />
               venture to hope that the House will pardon 
               <br />
               me for presenting at such length my views 
               <br />
               on this matter. I may be permitted, Ihope, 
               <br />
               to refute another assertion made by the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Hochelaga. That 
               <br />
               honorable member, who has found something 
               <br />
               to censure in every article of the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation, conceived that he produced 
               <br />
               an argument that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would,</span> be irresistible by 
               <br />
               asserting that the distribution of the debt 
               <br />
               was unfair and burdensome to Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               To give a greater force to this argument, 
               <br />
               he stated that Lower Canada entered into the 
               <br />
               union with a debt of 8400,000, and that 
               <br />
               she would leave it with a burden of $30,000,- 
               <br />
               000, after having only expended in the 
               <br />
               interval the sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$12,000,000</span> for public 
               <br />
               works within her limits. This argument is 
               <br />
               most specious. Supposing that our debt was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,000,</span> and that to-day it is $30,000,000, 
               <br />
               the honorable member must at all events 
               <br />
               admit that the circumstances also have very 
               <br />
               much changed. At the time of the union 
               <br />
               our population was only 630,000, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> 
               <br />
               it is 1,250,000. The honorable member, 
               <br />
               too, must not forget that at the time of the 
               <br />
               union our territory only produced 21,000,000 
               <br />
