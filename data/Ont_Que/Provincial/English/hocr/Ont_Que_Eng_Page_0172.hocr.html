               Secretary SEWABD (who was known to be 
               <br />
               one of the principal men in the American 
               <br />
               Government) once regarded this country as a 
               <br />
               poor one, but it was clear he no longer thought 
               <br />
               so, but had formed a very high opinion of our 
               <br />
               resources and ca abilities. There was no 
               <br />
               doubt that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canned;</span> was a great country and 
               <br />
               destined to be much greater still, and he held 
               <br />
               that if we were true to ourselves we could well 
               <br />
               sustain ourselves, especially as in the eﬂ'ort 
               <br />
               (if eﬂ'ort ever were needed) we were sure to 
               <br />
               enlist the sympathies, cooperation and sup- 
               <br />
               port of the Empire. (Hear, hear. Then 
               <br />
               e was satisﬁed that as the project o Confed- 
               <br />
               eration was favorably received at home as 
               <br />
               calculated to strengthen our position, we might 
               <br />
               expect all the aid that we needed. He re- 
               <br />
               gretted not bein prepared to sup rt his 
               <br />
               views by statistic statements, but o er hon- 
               <br />
               orable members who were much more compe- 
               <br />
               tent than himself, had done so, and no doubt 
               <br />
               others would follow. Of this, however, he was 
               <br />
               convinced, that we would lose nothing by the 
               <br />
               union, but would considerably improve our re- 
               <br />
               venue. The Lower Provinces possessed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad-f</span> 
               <br />
               vantages which we had not, and among them 
               <br />
               their coal and their old ﬁelds might be re- 
               <br />
               garded as of great v ue. We would soon 
               <br />
               require a large and constant su ply of coal, a 
               <br />
               mineral which, so far, had not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lbeen</span> found in 
               <br />
               Canada. It was really melancholy that there 
               <br />
               should have been so little commercial inter- 
               <br />
               course between us and those provinces. They 
               <br />
               were constantly needing large supplies of pro- 
               <br />
               visions, which we had to sell, and it was a 
               <br />
               pity that the money expended in procuring 
               <br />
               them was not paid to us. He hoped that 
               <br />
               there would be a great revolution in the state 
               <br />
               of things before long, and that we would pro- 
               <br />
               ﬁt largely by it. In every point of view, he 
               <br />
               conceived this union to be most desirable, 
               <br />
               though he must confess he would not desire 
               <br />
               to see it carried out if he thought there was 
               <br />
               the remotest probability of its leading to a 
               <br />
               separation from the Empire. (Hear.) The 
               <br />
               Mother Country had done much for us; mis- 
               <br />
               takes had arisen, but, on the whole, we had 
               <br />
               been most kindly and generously treated by 
               <br />
               her; we had been materially assisted by loans 
               <br />
               on the guarantee of the Imperial Government, 
               <br />
               and that very fact had greatly enhanced our 
               <br />
               credit. In this way it was that our great and 
               <br />
               valuable public works had been constructed. 
               <br />
               It had often been a matter of surprise to him 
               <br />
               that we had shown so little care and anxiety 
               <br />
               with regard to our own defence, but the time 
               <br />
