               hearing. No one cared for the matter; and 
               <br />
               it was felt by every one that such was the 
               <br />
               case. Soon alter, a ministerial crisis took 
               <br />
               place. A new govern ment came in for a few 
               <br />
               hours, and started apolicy. But that policy, 
               <br />
               again, was not this policy. It did not touch 
               <br />
               this question. (Hear, hear.) It was pro- 
               <br />
               posed, indeed, to deal with that question of 
               <br />
               representation by population by applying 
               <br />
               some system of checks or guarantees, doing 
               <br />
               or trying to do something that might lessen 
               <br />
               the objection of Lower Canada to a change 
               <br />
               urged forward as that had been. But that 
               <br />
               was all. That government fell—fell instant- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ly-and</span> another was formed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> place. 
               <br />
               And the present Finance Minister, the hou- 
               <br />
               orahle member for Sherbrooke, who, with 
               <br />
               all his ability, had not been able to obtain a 
               <br />
               serious hearing for his proposal of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation of the provinces, going into the new 
               <br />
               government, induced his colleagues to come 
               <br />
               before the House and the country, with that 
               <br />
               as a professed portion of their policy. I 
               <br />
               may be pardoned, perhaps, for a single word 
               <br />
               here of personal reference, for saying, en 
               <br />
               permut, that when that idea was thus 
               <br />
               broached (as it was by a Government of 
               <br />
               which I was as ﬁrm a supporter as any man 
               <br />
               in the House), I did not fail to make it 
               <br />
               known, that if ever it should be presented 
               <br />
               to the House as a practical measure by that 
               <br />
               Government, I should cease to be (so far as 
               <br />
               it was concerned) one of such supporters. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) That was not the ﬁrst time I 
               <br />
               had thought of it. It had long before been 
               <br />
               a matter of study with me; and all the 
               <br />
               anxious reﬂection l have ever been able to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> it, has only had the result of strength- 
               <br />
               ening my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">convictions</span> against it every day. 
               <br />
               But how was this idea then brought for- 
               <br />
               ward? Tentatively, and just to neutralize 
               <br />
               the scheme which the Baows—Domou Ad- 
               <br />

               <br />
               how? _If you want to gain an object, you 
               <br />
               put that object before those to whom you 
               <br />
               propose it in the way most likely to induce 
               <br />
               them to say yes. This scheme was suggest- 
               <br />
               ed to the Imperial Government, and to the 
               <br />
               people and governments of the Lower Prov- 
               <br />
               inces, precisely in the way most calculated 
               <br />
               to induce them to say no. We went and 
               <br />
               told them, “We are in such a state of 
               <br />
               embarrassment, we have political questions 
               <br />
               which so trouble and bother us, that we 
               <br />
               do not know if we can get along at all, 
               <br />
               unless you will be so kind as to come into 
               <br />
               this union with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.”</span> (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               was just as though I were in business, and 
               <br />
               went round to half a dozen capitalists, 
               <br />
               telling them, “ I have got into debt; my 
               <br />
               business is gone to the dogs; I have no 
               <br />
               business capacity; help me by going into 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">partnership</span> with me, or I am ruined.” 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear) If the object had been not 
               <br />
               to carry it, it does appear to me that those 
               <br />
               gentlemen could not have taken a better 
               <br />
               method of accomplishing that object. And 
               <br />
               we saw this—that just so soon as it was 
               <br />
               found that the Lower Provinces did not, as 
               <br />
               under the circumstances they could not, say 
               <br />
               yes to a proposal of this kind, and that the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government let the matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drap,</span> 
               <br />
               our Administration let it drop too. e 
               <br />
               never heard another word about it The 
               <br />
               despatches were laid on our table in 
               <br />
               1859, but nobody asked a question about 
               <br />
               them. The child was still-born, and no 
               <br />
               one troubled himself about its want of 
               <br />
               baptism. We went on with our old ques- 
               <br />
               tions—representation by pepulation ; Upper 
               <br />
               Canada against Lower Canada ; measures, to 
               <br />
               a great extent; men also, to a great and 
               <br />
               increasing extent. And we quarrelled and 
               <br />
               fought about almost everything, but did not 
               <br />
               waste a thought or word upon this gigantic 
               <br />
               question of the Confederation of these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. (Hear, hear.) In a little while we 
               <br />
               drifted into another crisis—that of 1862. 
               <br />
               And from the time of that crisis, and the

               prominent demand made upon political

               parties and olitical men everywhere was,

               to set aside t e older questions of measures,

               and occupy ourselves very much more—not

               to say exclusively—with the question of
