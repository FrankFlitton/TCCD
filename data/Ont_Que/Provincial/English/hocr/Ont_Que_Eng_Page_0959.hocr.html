               These remarks, Mr. SPEAKER, are so true 
               <br />
               and so reasonable, that I should be ashamed 
               <br />
               did I not agree with them; yetif I had reason 
               <br />
               to anticipate that our country would be

               endangered by the refusal of this House to

               pass the scheme of Confederation now pro— 
               <br />
               posed to us, I would not hesitate to vote 
               <br />
               in favor of it. But I am very far from 
               <br />
               believing that our Constitution cannot be

               <br />
               for many years to come. If the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Taunt-</span>

               MACDONALD Government had not been 
               <br />
               defeated last year, and if it could have 
               <br />
               retained a majority of one or two votes only, 
               <br />
               as has been so well observed by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Beauce, Confederation would 
               <br />
               still be in the clouds, and the hon. member 
               <br />
               for South Oxford would still be at a great 
               <br />
               distance from his long-sought haven. It is, 
               <br />
               however, to be heped that the offspring of 
               <br />
               the present Administration—composed, as it 
               <br />
               is, of such heterogeneous elements—will not 
               <br />
               be the victim of premature birth, and that 
               <br />
               the Government will have something else to 
               <br />
               present to the country than a still-born child.

               (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, that great 
               <br />
               principle of sectional e uality was conse- 
               <br />
               crated anew by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Legis</span> ative Council Act 
               <br />
               of 1856. And by whom was it consecrated? 
               <br />
               By the men who are now in power. On the 
               <br />
               14th March, 1856, the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency, seconded by the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               SPENOE, moved the adoption of a law estab- 
               <br />
               lishing equality in the Legislative Council 
               <br />
               between Upper and Lower Canada, and ren- 
               <br />
               dering that branch of the Legislature elective. 
               <br />
               The principle of that law was assented to by 
               <br />
               eighty-three votes against six. I read from 
               <br />

               tion by population, eighty-nine members from

               stitution of the Upper House, and ratiﬁed

               the Constitutional Act of 1840 to which I 
               <br />
               have just referred. Not only was this prin- 
               <br />
               ciple consecrated by a large majority in both 
               <br />
               branches of the Legislature ; as I have just 
               <br />
               shewn, it was also conﬁrmed by the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of the Mother Country, ior whose 
               <br />
               sanction this law was reserved, at most eight 
               <br />
               years ago. And, Mr. SPEAKER, these m 
               <br />
               Constitutional Acts have been the means 
               <br />
               of establishing the peace, happiness and 
               <br />
               prosperity of the country since the troubles 
               <br />
               of 1837 and 1838 ; behind these two acts 
               <br />
               the French-Canadians have sheltered them— 
               <br />
               selves as behind an impregnable rampart, 
               <br />
               and yet these two acts the present Adminis- 
               <br />
               tration, sustained by a majority of French- 
               <br />
               Canadians in this House, are ready to scatter 
               <br />
               to the four winds. (Hear, hear.) For the 
               <br />
               last quarter of a century, Canada has enjoyed 
               <br />
               responsible government and the advantage 
               <br />
               of equality in the representation. What then 
               <br />
               is there to complain of, and by whom are 
               <br />
               complaints made? Who have complained 
               <br />
               during the last ten years—have the French- 
               <br />
               Canadians, have the Upper-Canadians? - No,
