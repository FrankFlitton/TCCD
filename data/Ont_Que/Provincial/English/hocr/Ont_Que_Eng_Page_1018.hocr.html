               Well, Mr. SPEAKER, that is quite true. Sir, 
               <br />
               we have been in a state of strife for a great 
               <br />
               many years. An election is a civil strife, 
               <br />
               and a lawsuit is a civil strife, but warfare is 
               <br />
               a most uncivil strife.

               HON. ATTY. GEN. M ACDONALD—The 
               <br />
               war in the United States is a most dis- 
               <br />
               astrous, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oven</span> barbarous civil war; but 
               <br />
               the word civil strife is not applicable to it. 
               <br />
               I have already explained the meaning of 
               <br />
               the term, and I hepe now that my hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, for the sake

               of the character of this House, and for the 
               <br />
               sake of the public purse, I must protest 
               <br />
               against the current of the debate which has 
               <br />
               arisen from the motion of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peel. I thought we had got through 
               <br />
               with the discussion, and that as every hon. 
               <br />
               member had had the opportunity of speak-

               <br />
               times, we had ﬁnished the debate, and taken 
               <br />
               a vote which was rather satisfactory to the 
               <br />
               Government, by which the question had been 
               <br />

               much regret that although the debate has

               been so long protracted, and although we have 
               <br />
               had an expression from almost every member 
               <br />
               of this House, we have hitherto failed in 
               <br />
               getting the arguments promised in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               went up to Pisgah’s tcp and viewed the

               promised land in the distance, just so the 
               <br />
               hon. member gives us an occasional glimpse 
               <br />
               of the promised speech, but we have thus far 
               <br />
               been disappointed in our expectations of 
               <br />
               hearing it delivered. We have been prom- 
               <br />
               ised it two or three times during the past 
               <br />
               month. The honorable member ought to 
               <br />
               remember that “ hope deferred maketh the 
               <br />
               heart sick.” I am sure I desire to have the 
               <br />
               pleasure and satisfaction of hearing from the 
               <br />

               tage of the information which the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman is well known to be able of giving 
               <br />
               this House; for though young in years, he 
               <br />
               is old in political wisdom and in that political 
               <br />
               sagaeity of which he denies me the posses- 
               <br />
               sion. Isay I am sorry, and this House must 
               <br />
               be sorry, and the country must be sorry, that 
               <br />
               the hon.‘ gentleman has practised so much 
               <br />
               sell-denial as to refuse to allow his radiance 
               <br />
               to shine forth upon this great question. 
               <br />
               The thing which so utterly destroys the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s utility is his extreme 
               <br />
               modesty. (Laughter.) Why, when he had 
               <br />
               to rush to the rescue of the disordered 
               <br />

               from the rain that hung over it through the 
               <br />
               lavish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extravagance</span> of my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               present Hon. Finance Minister, he looked, 
               <br />
               with the exercise of his great ﬁnancial ability, 
               <br />
               down into the recesses of the public chest 
               <br />
               and speedin discovered the source of all the 
               <br />
               evils that had fallen upon the country, and 
               <br />
               yet the modesty of the hon. gentleman pre- 
               <br />
               vented him from making known the remedy. 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) And so it is even now. He 
               <br />
               has been promising to give us his views upon 
               <br />
               this great question; but four weeks have 
               <br />
               passed, and his speech yet hangs ﬁre. And
