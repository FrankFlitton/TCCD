               <br />

               local, or sectional, or selﬁsh object in view. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Passing from trade, I will 
               <br />
               turn to another subject — the ship building 
               <br />
               and tonnage of those colonies— and will take 
               <br />
               the returns of 1863. In that year, the num— 
               <br />
               be of ships built in all those colonies was no 
               <br />
               less than 645, with a tonnage amounting to 
               <br />
               219,763 tons. This statement of the enor- 
               <br />
               mous amount of tonnage built in one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yat</span> is 
               <br />
               as good evidence as can be offered of the fa- 
               <br />
               cilities we possess for becoming an important 
               <br />

               <br />
               tonnage of Canada, including that of the in- 
               <br />
               land lakes, amounts to about nine million tons, 
               <br />
               a great portion of which, however, represents 
               <br />
               the tonnage of vessels performing coasting 
               <br />
               service, many of which frequently clear and 
               <br />
               arrive in the course of. one day. It is gratifying 
               <br />
               to know that the trade between Canada and 
               <br />
               the States on the other side of the lakes is 
               <br />
               of a nature to give employment to a large 
               <br />
               portion of this lake tonnage — amountin 
               <br />
               to 6,907,000 tons — but it cannot be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">classes</span> 
               <br />
               in the same category as the tonnage arriving 
               <br />
               at Quebec and Montreal, which in most cases 
               <br />
               can make only two or three trips per an- 
               <br />
               num. The sea-going tonnage of Canada 
               <br />
               amounted to 2,133,000 tous; of New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, 1,386,000; of Nova Scotia, 1,432,000 
               <br />
               tons. Consequently the amount of sea-going 
               <br />
               tonnage,. subject only to a small deduction, 
               <br />
               was actually about ﬁve million tons, of which 
               <br />
               about 2,133,000 was that of vessels trading 
               <br />
               between the St. Lawrence and foreign ports. 
               <br />
               In making this statement it is due to the 
               <br />
               House that it should be made aware that 
               <br />
               some portion of this trade will“ not be repre- 
               <br />
               sented after the contemplated union has taken 
               <br />
               lace. At present, the internal commerce 
               <br />
               tween these colonies appears in the returns 
               <br />
               of each as imports and experts, but I should 
               <br />
               be glad if I were able to make on this account 
               <br />
               a large deduction from the ﬁgures I have 
               <br />
               given. It is matter for regret on the part of 
               <br />
               all of us that the trade between these colo-

               that have followed from the working of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               one short year from the time when that treaty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> 
               <br />
               came into operation, our trade in the natural 
               <br />
               productions of the two countries swelled from 
               <br />

               with an interruption of that trade—when we 
               <br />
               have reason to fear that the action of the 
               <br />
