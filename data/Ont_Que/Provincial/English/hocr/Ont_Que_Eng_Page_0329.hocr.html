               <br />
               the contradiction in this on the part of the 
               <br />
               Government, and how illogical its conduct is. 
               <br />
               Let us for a moment suppose that this meas- 
               <br />
               ure gives rise to diﬁculties in the Cabinet, 
               <br />
               during the discussion on the details of the 
               <br />
               scheme, of suﬁcient importance to entail the 
               <br />
               resignation of the Administration. What 
               <br />
               happens? The Address having been voted 
               <br />
               by our Legislature, is sent to England, and 
               <br />
               whilst the Imperial Government is engaged 
               <br />
               in ratifying it and incorporating it in a bill, 
               <br />
               which is to become our Constitution, the 
               <br />
               present Ministry succumbs under the details 
               <br />
               of the scheme respecting the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments. A new ministry succeeds them, an 
               <br />
               appeal to the people probably takes place in 
               <br />
               the interval, and when the new Constitution 
               <br />
               comes to us from Great Britain, we have a 
               <br />
               Government and a Legislature ready to reject 
               <br />
               it before its promulgation. In view of such a 
               <br />
               prospect as this, ought we to be in a hurry to 
               <br />
               accede to the request of the Government and 
               <br />
               refuse the legitimate delay asked for by the 
               <br />
               motion now before this Honorable House? I 
               <br />
               have, then, considered that I ought not to 
               <br />
               pass over in silence the declaration of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Toronto, for I am of opinion 
               <br />
               that it is of a nature to convince us that pre- 
               <br />
               cipitation in so highly solemn a matter is 
               <br />
               most dangerous. The Constitution of a 
               <br />
               country should not be changed from base to 
               <br />
               summit until those who are appointed to 
               <br />
               watch over the public interests, and the very 
               <br />
               Constitution in question, have had time to see 
               <br />
               and to ascertain, in a positive manner, that 
               <br />
               such a change is necessary and called for by 
               <br />
               the people. Hear, hear.)

               tlemen, in again rising to address the 
               <br />
               House, I beg to assure you that I do not 
               <br />
               propose to repeat the observations I have 
               <br />
               already made on a previous occasion; but 
               <br />
               being pressed for time, I was obliged to omit 
               <br />
               to refer to certain aspects of the scheme on 
               <br />
               which I proposed to offer a few remarks 
               <br />
               when the present motion should be before 
               <br />
               the House. I was aware that this motion 
               <br />
               would come up for discussion, as it appeared 
               <br />
               upon our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minutes</span> of Proceedings. With 
               <br />
               these few preliminary observations I shall 
               <br />
               proceed, honorable gentlemen, to offer a few 
               <br />
               remarks on some few points in the scheme 
               <br />
               which I was compelled to pass over in

               for our consideration. I must refer here, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, to a wonderful incident 
               <br />
               of this afternoon’s sitting. A declaration, 
               <br />
               novel in every respect to each one of us, fell 
               <br />
               from the lips of the Honorable the Minister 
               <br />
               of Crown Lands, who has only had this one 
               <br />
               sole reason to offer us in explanation of, and 
               <br />
               excuse for, the precipitate haste with which 
               <br />
               his Government is endeavoring to obtain the 
               <br />
               adoption of the new Constitution :_“ We are 
               <br />
               anxious to obtain the vote of this House, to 
               <br />
               transmit it to New Brunswick and to the other 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces which are to enter into 
               <br />
               the Confederation.” This, then, is the real 
               <br />
               reason of this incom rehensible and indecent 
               <br />
               haste, for I cannot elieve that the reason 
               <br />
               given by the hon. member who sits immedi- 
               <br />
               ately opposite to me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Sir</span> N. F. BELLEAU), in 
               <br />
               explanation of this haste, can be a serious one. 
               <br />
               It is diﬂicult, indeed, not to consideras some- 
               <br />
               what absurd the reason alleged by the Hon. 
               <br />
               Sir N. F. BELLEAU:—“The Ministry are 
               <br />
               anxious that this scheme should be adopted 
               <br />
               forthwith, because Lord PALMERSTON is 
               <br />
               already an old man, and might die at any 
               <br />
               moment.” I would rather accept the reason 
               <br />
               given by the Hon. Minister of Crown Lands 
               <br />
               than that of my honorable friend, because 
               <br />
               I cannot believe hc was authorized to give 
               <br />
               it. Thus this House and the country now 
               <br />
               know the secret of this precipitate haste on 
               <br />
               the part of the Government, and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt they will bear it in mind. But I will 
               <br />
               venture to enquire of the Honorable the 
               <br />
               Minister of Crown Lands, who has given us 
               <br />
               this very absurd reason, whether he hopes 
               <br />
               to deceive the people of the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               by the vote which he desires to precipitate. 
               <br />
               I will ask him whether it is to be desired 
               <br />
               that this House should forthwith give a vote 
               <br />
               on this question, a vote which will undoubt- 
               <br />
               edly have the eﬁ'ect of leading them into 
               <br />
               error as regards the feelings and opinions of 
               <br />
               the people of this country in relation to the 
               <br />
               project of Confederation. Well, honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, I do not for one moment hesitate 
               <br />
               to declare to this House, that the fact alone 
               <br />
               of the anxiety of the Government to obtain 
               <br />
               forthwith a vote of this House on this im- 
               <br />
               portant measure, is that which ought most 
               <br />
               of all to put us on our guard, and ought to 
               <br />
               cause us to determine not to give it lightly, 
               <br />
               and in a manner unworthy of prudent and 
               <br />
               wise legislators. Indeed, honcrable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, our vote will have a signiﬁcance 
               <br />
               which it will be vain to seek to diminish. 
               <br />
