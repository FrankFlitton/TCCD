               Hon. Solicitor General East tol us the other

               day that in the plan of Confederation which 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> proposed for the two Canadas, I intend- 
               <br />
               ed to leave the administration and ownership 
               <br />
               of the Crown lands to the General Govern— 
               <br />
               ment, and he said that under Confederation 
               <br />
               the Crown lands would belong to the local 
               <br />
               governments, and this, in his opinion, was a 
               <br />
               great improvement on the plan which I pro- 
               <br />
               posed. Well, it must be observed that a very 
               <br />
               large amount is due on sales of Crown lands; 
               <br />
               there is about $1,000,000 due in Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and $5,000,000 or $6,000,000 in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. If these lands had remained in the 
               <br />
               union there would have been about one million 
               <br />
               from Lower Canada, and ﬁve or six millions 
               <br />
               from Upper Canada towards the payment of 
               <br />
               the general debt. We should have beneﬁted to 
               <br />
               that amount by the extinction of so much of 
               <br />
               the public debt; instead of that, under the 
               <br />
               plan of the Government, Upper Canada is to 
               <br />
               have the beneﬁt of the ﬁve or six millions 
               <br />
               due on the lands sold in Upper Canada, whilst 
               <br />
               Lower Canada will only have one million of 
               <br />
               dollars at the outside. If it were only the 
               <br />
               public lands, there would be no injustice in 
               <br />
               caving them to the local governments, but 
               <br />
               the difference in the amounts due on the lands 
               <br />
               sold gives a considerable advantage to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. There is another very serious ob- 
               <br />
               jection to the Constitution of the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council. The honorable member for Mont- 
               <br />
               morency said that the Legislative Council 
               <br />
               would serve as a protection and safeguard to 
               <br />
               the interests of the French-Canadians, be- 
               <br />
               cause in it we would have an equality of 
               <br />
               members with the other provinces. A curi- 
               <br />
               ous equality that will be! <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That</span> of which 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Montmorency spoke 
               <br />
               when he pronounced himself in favor of two 
               <br />
               elective chambers, because in that case we 
               <br />
               should have one member in three, was in- 
               <br />
               ﬁnitely preferable. In the Lower House we 
               <br />
               shall not have one member in three, nor shall 
               <br />
               we in the Upper House either, for we shall 
               <br />
               only have twenty-four councillors out of sev- 
               <br />
               enty-six. Thus we shall have equality neither 
               <br />
               in the Lower House nor in the Council. 
               <br />

               ernment will nominate the councillors, and 
               <br />
               we shall be in a great minority in the Ex— 
               <br />
               ecutive Council. Another object-ion is that 
               <br />
               the nomination of the legislative councillors 
               <br />
