               We constitute the highest branch of the

               Parliament of this country, and when the

               <br />
               reason believe that our vote has n given 
               <br />
               with a thorough knowledge of the matter, and 
               <br />
               that we fully indicate the popular feeling on 
               <br />
               this important question. They will never 
               <br />
               for a moment imagine that we have set at 
               <br />
               naught and ignored the o iuions of those 
               <br />
               whom we represent in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> ; they will 
               <br />
               never believe that the country has been so little 
               <br />
               consulted in the matteras it in fact has been. 
               <br />
               I assert, therefore, honorable gentlemen, that 
               <br />
               the vote which it is sought to make us give 
               <br />
               to-day is calculated to deceive the people of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces, both as to the views 
               <br />
               of this Honorable House and as to the 
               <br />
               opinions of the vast majority of the people of 
               <br />
               this rovince, and that we cannot give it with 
               <br />
               sa ' action either to ourselves or to those 
               <br />
               whom we represent. I have already taken 
               <br />
               occasion to state before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> that the 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation had not been sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to us complete. I am prepared to 
               <br />
               prove this statement; I maintain that only 
               <br />
               one part of the scheme has been laid before 
               <br />
               us, and under these circumstances, I would 
               <br />
               ask this Honorable House, if it is prudent to 
               <br />
               accept and sanction that with which we are but 
               <br />
               imperfectly acquainted? When I accepted 
               <br />

               my constituents their nomination to 
               <br />
               the Legislative Council, I did so with the 
               <br />
               ﬁrm determination never to accept blindly 
               <br />
               the various measures which might be sub- 
               <br />
               mitted for my approval in this House. This 
               <br />
               resolution I have adhered to hitherto, and I 
               <br />
               hope thatI shall never forget it in the course 
               <br />
               of my public career. A few minutes ago I 
               <br />
               remarked, honorable gentlemen, that the 
               <br />
               plan of Confederation had not been sub— 
               <br />
               mitted to us complete; I now propose to 
               <br />
               prove this assertion. By art. 6 of the 43rd res- 
               <br />
               olution, we perceive that the local legislatures 
               <br />
               will have the power of making laws in relation 
               <br />
               to education, saving, however, the rights and 
               <br />
               privileges enjoyed by the Catholic and Pro— 
               <br />
               tsstant minorities in relation to their separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools at the time of the union; so 
               <br />
               that b this resolution we are to aﬁrm that 
               <br />
               the mmorities shall be bound by the school 
               <br />
               laws which will be in force at the moment 
               <br />
               when Confederation will take effect. On 
               <br />
               the other hand, we are told that a measure 
               <br />
               will be b ht down for the better rotec- 
               <br />

               school laws form a portion of the scheme 
               <br />

               <br />
               We ought then to be on our guard. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If,”</span> 
               <br />
               it is pretended, the measure will not endanger

               the rights of the Catholic minority in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, why are we refused the details and 
               <br />
               the information which we ask to have 
               <br />
               afforded to us before pronouncing on the 
               <br />
               merits of the plan? I maintain that any one 
               <br />
               who desires that justice should be extended 
               <br />
               to the minorities in question, would not 
               <br />
               know how to vote as we are called upon to 
               <br />
               do. In the absence of the information which 
               <br />
               we are entitled to demand from the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment as to the nature of the guarantees to be 
               <br />
               offered by the new Constitution to the 
               <br />
               minorities of the two provinces of Canada, 
               <br />
               I do not for one instant hesitate to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">declare</span> 
               <br />
               that this Honorable House is justiﬁed, and 
               <br />
               indeed fulﬁls asacred duty in demanding the 
               <br />
               delay sought for by the motion of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Niagara. If it should so happen 
               <br />
               that the people are called upon to pronounce 
               <br />
               on the merits of the measure, it becomes of 
               <br />
               the utmost necessity that we, their representa- 
               <br />
               tives, should be able to explain and point 
               <br />
               out to them the details of the scheme. We 
               <br />
               have then every reason to insist that this 
               <br />
               information should be supplied to us. The 
               <br />
               Premier will now permit me to put to him a 
               <br />
               question. May it not happen, after the adop- 
               <br />
               tion of these resolutions, that the Protestant 
               <br />
               majority of Upper Canada may ally itself 
               <br />
               with the Protestant minority of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada in the present Parliament, and de- 
               <br />
               prive the Catholic majority of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               of the rights which they are entitled to 
               <br />
               enjoy in relation to the education of their 
               <br />
               children ? Should such an event occur, I 
               <br />
               would ask the hon. Premier what means 
               <br />
               the aggrieved minority might be able to 
               <br />
               adopt in order to obtain justice?
