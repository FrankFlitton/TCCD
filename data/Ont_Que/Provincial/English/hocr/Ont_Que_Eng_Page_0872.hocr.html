               like Mr. Oussama at the head of the move— 
               <br />
               ment hostile to Confederation, I say that it 
               <br />
               is wrong to cast ridicule on that movement, 
               <br />
               and to make apretence of believing that the 
               <br />
               members of the Liberal party, or of the Rouge 
               <br />
               party, have no religious, national or patriotic 
               <br />
               feelings. I say that the Conservative party 
               <br />
               were greatly in the Wrong in endeavoring to 
               <br />
               ridicule Mr. CHEBRIER, because he is a man 
               <br />
               who is too well known as a man of probity 
               <br />
               and of religions sentiments—and the same 
               <br />
               cannot be said of several of those who have 
               <br />
               attacked him ; and I am convinced that that 
               <br />
               gentleman sincerely believes that the nation- 
               <br />
               ality, the institutions and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religion</span> of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada are in danger. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Besides, admitting, as the Ministerial party 
               <br />
               pretend, that the Rouge party were not 
               <br />
               authorized to speak for the clergy and to 
               <br />
               defend our religious and national rights, it 
               <br />
               does not follow that all that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> members on

               this side of the House stated on this subject 
               <br />
               is not strictly true ; and if it had been possi- 
               <br />
               ble to reply to it, it would have been better 
               <br />
               to meet it t~y arguments of a serious charac- 
               <br />
               ter than by personal attacks, the latter means 
               <br />
               being only employed as a blind. And those 
               <br />
               who exclaim so loudly to-day against the 
               <br />

               <br />
               not always hold the monarehical and loyal

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> has said he will be? He will be 
               <br />
               so, that gentleman says, because the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General brought about the passing 
               <br />
               of a measure for the abolition of the seigniorial 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seigniorz.</span> brought their title-deedsto him, 
               <br />
               and he returned them a measure which was 
               <br />
               satisfactory both to the seigniors and to the 
               <br />
               censitaires. Now, I am really surprised 
               <br />
               that the Hon. Solicitor General, who, in 
               <br />
               the position which he occupies, ought 
               <br />
               to be acquainted with the history of the 
               <br />
               laws of this country, is not aware that 
               <br />
               it was the Honorable Mr. Justice DRUM- 
               <br />
               MOND who prepared and brought about the 
               <br />
               passing of the law for the abolition of the 
               <br />
               seigniorial tenure, and not the Hon. Attor- 
               <br />
               ney General for Lower Canada at all. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear. That is, therefore, no reason why 
               <br />
               he s ould deserve a reward. The Hon. 
               <br />
               Solicitor General also said that the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General was entitled to the grati- 
               <br />
               tude of his country, because he had brought 
               <br />
               about the passing of the law for judiciary 
               <br />

               Well, his registration law contains similar

               defects, and proves his complete inability to 
               <br />
