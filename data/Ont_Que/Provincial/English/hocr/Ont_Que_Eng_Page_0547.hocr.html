               If, sir, we are thinking to give other peeple 
               <br />
               the idea, that by uniting ourselves together 
               <br />
               in any such way as this, we are going to make 
               <br />
               ourselves able to take care of ourselves, we 
               <br />
               are merely humbugging ourselves, and try- 
               <br />
               ing to humbug others. The people of the 
               <br />
               United States are stronger than we are, and 
               <br />
               are known so to be ; and if we are tohold our 
               <br />
               own against or beside them, it can only be 
               <br />
               by remaining strongly, avowedly, lastingly, 
               <br />
               attached to Great Britain. This is the 
               <br />
               ﬁrm conclusion I have come to; and I 
               <br />
               believe it is the conclusion to which any 
               <br />
               one who will give his thoughtful attention 
               <br />
               to the subject must come also. And I 
               <br />
               must and do protest against the notion 
               <br />
               which seems to prevail among the advo- 
               <br />
               cates of this scheme, that somehow or other 
               <br />
               it is going so to increase our power, as 
               <br />
               to make us a formidable neighbor of the 
               <br />
               United States. The danger is, of its making 
               <br />
               that peeple more jealous of us and more 
               <br />
               hostile towards us than before. And if, 
               <br />
               besides that, it isgoing to give them and 
               <br />
               the people of England, or either of them, 
               <br />
               the idea that as a result of it we are 
               <br />
               to care less for the connection with the 
               <br />
               Empire than before—that under it we 
               <br />
               are before long to go alone, it is going to 
               <br />
               commit us to about the saddest fatal mis- 
               <br />
               take that a people ever made. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, I must apologize for the 
               <br />
               length to which I have wearied the House. 
               <br />
               (Cries of “ Go on !”) I have gone through, 
               <br />
               as well as I could, the leading points of my 
               <br />
               arguments, so far ; and have indicated a 
               <br />
               number of points of contrast between this 
               <br />
               systc m and that of the Unired States. I trust 
               <br />
               I have not been too prolix in my attempts to 
               <br />
               shew tha‘ the Constitution now offered for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> our acceptance presents machineryentirely 
               <br />
               unlike that of the United States, and entirely 
               <br />
               unlike that of the British Empire—that it 
               <br />
               is inconsistent with either—that so far from 
               <br />
               its proﬂering to us all the advantages of both 
               <br />
               and the disadvantages of neither, it rather 
               <br />
               presents to us the disadvantages of both and 
               <br />
               the advantages of neither ; that so far from 
               <br />
               its tending to improve our relations either 
               <br />
               with the Mother Country or with the 
               <br />
               United States, it holds out to us very 
               <br />
               little prospect indeed for the future, in 
               <br />
               either of these respects. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I shall not attempt to review my argument 
               <br />
               on these heads, for I do not think that to 
               <br />
               anyone at all willing to reﬂect, what I have 
               <br />
               advanced can require to be proved more 
               <br />

               provincial administrations. — The attempt 
               <br />
               must be made to combine the six majoriﬁes, 
               <br />
               so as to carry on an administration in har-

               mony with the understood wishes of the six 
               <br />
               several provinces, irrespectively of every 
               <br />
               consideration of principle, or of sound far- 
               <br />
               seeing policy. I do not see how, although 
               <br />
               this thing may be done at starting, it can be 
               <br />
               carried on—I was going to say, for any 
               <br />
               length of time—I mightsay, for any time, 
               <br />
               long or short, unless by a system of the 
               <br />
               most enormous jobbery and corruption. 
               <br />
               Whenever any sore spot shall show itself— 
               <br />
               and we may rely on it, there will be more 
               <br />
               than one such show itself very soon—then 
               <br />
               feuds and divisions of the worst sort will 
               <br />
               follow, and the machinery will no longer 
               <br />
               work. Unfortunately, there are in it none 
               <br />
               of those facilities for harmonious workings, 
               <br />
               none of those nice adaptations by which 
               <br />
               the stronger power is so tempered as 
               <br />
               not to fall too harshly on the weaker. 
               <br />
               Just so long as the majorities in all the 
               <br />
               different provinces work cordially together, 
               <br />
               well and good. But they cannot possibly 
               <br />
               work harmoniously together long; and so 
               <br />
               soon as they come into collision, there 
               <br />
               comes trouble, and with the trouble, the 
               <br />
               fabric is at an end. (Hear, hear. For 
               <br />
               myself, I am decidedly of opinion t t our 
               <br />
               true interest is to hold this machinery 
               <br />
               over, to consider it carefully, to see 
               <br />
               if something better cannot be devised. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I am sure there can. But 
               <br />
               instead of that, we are called upon emphati- 
               <br />
               calIy and earnestly at once to throw aside all 
               <br />
               considerations to the contrary, and to adopt 
               <br />
               the measure; and we are at the same time 
               <br />
               told, in unmistakable language, that we posi- 
               <br />
               tively cannot—-must not—shall nut—change 
               <br />
               a single word of it. Various considerations 
               <br />
               are urged upon us for this unseemly haste; 
               <br />
               considerations connected with the attitude 
               <br />
               of the United States, with Great Britain, 
               <br />
               with the Lower Provinces, and with our own 
               <br />
               domestic aﬂ'airs. With the permission of 
               <br />
               the House, I will touch as brieﬂy as I can 
               <br />
               on these four classes of considerations, and 
               <br />
               then cease longer to weary the House. I 
               <br />
               begin , then, with the considerations connected 
               <br />
               with the attitude of the United States, which 
               <br />
               are urged upon us as reasons why we should 
               <br />
               rush into this measure of Confederation. '.l‘o
