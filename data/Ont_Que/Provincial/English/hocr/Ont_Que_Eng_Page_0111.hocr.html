               DORION), who now leads the crusade against

               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) And when he has reﬂected on

               (Continued cheers.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, the

               second feature of this scheme as a remedial 
               <br />
               measure is, that it removes, to a large extent, 
               <br />
               the injustice of which Upper Canada has com- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Blained</span> in ﬁnancial matters. We in Upper

               anada have complained that though we paid 
               <br />
               into the public treasury more than three- 
               <br />
               fourths of the whole revenue, we had less con- 
               <br />
               trol over the system of taxation and the ex- 
               <br />

               scheme in your hand remedies that. The

               absurd line of separation between the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces is swept away for neral matters; we 
               <br />
               are to have seventeen ad itional members in 
               <br />
               the house that holds the purse; and the tax—

               revenue and expenditure. (Hear, hear.) We 
               <br />
               have also complained that immense sums of 
               <br />
               public money have been systematically taken 
               <br />
               rom the public chest for local purposes of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, in which the pe0ple of Upper

               Well, sir, this scheme remedies that. All local 
               <br />
               matters are to be banished from the General 
               <br />
               Legislature; local governments are to have 
               <br />
               control over local affairs, and if our friends in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada choose to be extravagant, they 
               <br />
               will have to bear the burden of it themselves. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) No longer shall we have to 
               <br />
               complain that one section pays the cash while 
               <br />
               the other spends it; hereafter, they who pay 
               <br />
               will spend, and they who spend more than they 
               <br />
               ought will have to bear the brunt. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It was a great thing to accomplish 
               <br />
               this, if we had accomplished nothing more, 
               <br />
               —for if we look back on our doings of the last 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen years, I think it will be acknowledged 
               <br />
               that the greatest jobs perpetrated were of a 
               <br />
               local character—that our ﬁercest contests were 
               <br />
               about local matters that stirred up sectional 
               <br />
               jealousies and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indimation</span> to its deepest depth. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> have further complained 
               <br />
               that if a sum was properly demanded for some 
               <br />
               legitimate local purpose in one section, an 
               <br />
               equivalent sum had to be appropriated to the 
               <br />
               other as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offset—thereby</span> entailing prodigal 
               <br />
               expenditure, and unnecessarily increasing the 
               <br />
               public debt. Well, sir, this scheme puts an 
               <br />
               end to that. Each province is to determine 
               <br />
               for itself its own wants, and to ﬁnd the money 
               <br />
               to meet them from its own resources. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But, sir, I am told that though true 
               <br />
               it is that local matters are to be separated and 
               <br />
               the burden of local expenditure placed upon 
               <br />
               local shoulders, we have made an exception 
               <br />
               from that principle in providing that a subsidy 
               <br />
               of ei hty cents per head shall be taken from 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gederal</span> chest and granted to the local 
               <br />
               governments for local purposes. Undoubtedly 
               <br />
               this is the fact—and I do not hesitate to admit 
               <br />
               that it would have been better if this had been 
               <br />
               otherwise. I trust I commit no breach of 
               <br />
               discretion in stating that in Conference I was 
               <br />
               one of the strongest advocates for defraying 
               <br />
               the whole of the local expenditures of the 
               <br />
               local governments by means of direct taxa- 
               <br />
               tion, and that there were liberal men in all 
               <br />
               sections of the provinces who would gladly 
               <br />
               have had it so arran But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               there was one diﬁic ty in the way—a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculty</span> 
               <br />
               which has often before been encountered in this 
               <br />
               world—and that difﬁculty was simply this, it 
               <br />
               could not be done. (Hear, and laughter.) We 
               <br />
               could neither have carried it in Conference 
               <br />
               nor yet in any one of the existing provincial 
               <br />
               legis atures. Our friends in Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               I am afraid, have a constitutional disinclination 
               <br />
               to direct taxation, and it was obvious that if 
               <br />
               the Confederation scheme had had attached to
