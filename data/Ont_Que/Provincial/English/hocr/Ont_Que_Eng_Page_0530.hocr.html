               proposed House of Commons with that of

               altogether from the principles upon which 
               <br />
               the British House of Commons is constituted,

               place on the ﬂoor of our House of Commons 
               <br />
               a number of provincial delegations, and not a 
               <br />
               number of independent members of parlia— 
               <br />
               ment. The tendency is therefore towards a

               system antagonistic to, and inconsistent 
               <br />
               with, those principles on which the British 
               <br />
               Constitution reposes. With provincial

               ont which the British system of government 
               <br />
               can hardly exist. Turning then to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> Council, and comparing its 
               <br />
               constitution with that of the Senate of the 
               <br />
               United States—the principles governing 
               <br />
               the former are diametrically Opposite to those 
               <br />
               on which the latter is founded. The Senate 
               <br />
               of the United States forms an excellent 
               <br />
               federal check upon the House of Represent- 
               <br />

               <br />
               powers given to it, and which are not pro-

               the table of the Executive Council. But 
               <br />
               this principle, which must enter into the

               ly inconsistent with the principle 01 the

               plan is this, the absolute necessity of either 
               <br />
               having an Executive Council that will be ridi-

               <br />
               of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three</span> leading features, I had passed 
               <br />
               on to consider the relations of the Federal 
               <br />
               Government with the several provinces, 
               <br />
               comparing them with the relations subsist- 
               <br />
               ing between the United States Government 
               <br />
               and the governments of the several states of 
               <br />
               the American Union. The several states or 
               <br />
               the neighboring republic commenced their 
               <br />
               existence as states with all their constitu- 
               <br />
               tions constructed on the same general plan 
               <br />
               as that of the United States, and in fact the 
               <br />
               same republican principles underlie all their 
               <br />
               governmental institutions, municipal, state 
               <br />
               and federal. But it is here proposed, that 
               <br />
               while we are to start with a system of gen- 
               <br />
               eral government, part British, part republi- 
               <br />
               can, part neither, it is to be an open ques- 
               <br />
               tion, left to the decision of each separate 
               <br />
               province, what kind of local constitution is 
               <br />
               to be constructed for itself. Each province 
               <br />
               must, of course, have an elective chamber, 
               <br />
               but as to a second chamber, that is to be as 
               <br />
               each local legislature may see ﬁt. Some, 
               <br />
               probably, will have it elective, while others 
               <br />
               may dispen e with it entirely. Then, looking 
               <br />
               to the appointment of the lieutenant-gov- 
               <br />
               ernors, and the tenure by which they are to 
               <br />
               hold oﬂice, it becomes about as clearas day that 
               <br />
               you cannot carry on responsible government 
               <br />
               in the provinces, but must have in them all 
               <br />
               a system that is neither British nor repub- 
               <br />
               lican, and that, I believe, will be found to 
               <br />
               be tetally unworkable. Turning to the 
               <br />
               assignment of powers to the Federal Govern- 
               <br />
               ment on the one hand, and the local or 
               <br />
               provincial governments on the other, we
