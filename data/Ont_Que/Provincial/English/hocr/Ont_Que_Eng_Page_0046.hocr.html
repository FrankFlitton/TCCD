               Upper and Lower Canada alone. By a happy

               concurrence of events, the time came when

               sire for union existed in the Lower Provinces,

               purpose of attempting to form a union of some 
               <br />
               kind. Whether the union should be federal

               or legislative was not then indicated, but a 
               <br />
               union of some kind was sought for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pure</span>

               were about to take such a step, and knowing

               that if we allowed the occasion to pass, if the

               organizations and form a new one, it could 
               <br />
               not be expected that they would again readily

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">destroy</span> the new organization which they had
