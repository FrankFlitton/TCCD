               Council I believe to be contrary to the wishes 
               <br />
               of a majority of the people of Western Ca- 
               <br />
               nada, and particularly of my own constitu- 
               <br />
               ents. I think it will be admitted that the 
               <br />
               elective system has given us a class of repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives in that body which would do 
               <br />
               honor to any country in the world, and I 
               <br />
               should refer to see that system continued. 
               <br />
               But w ' e I would be prepared to vote for an 
               <br />
               amendment which would have for its object 
               <br />
               the perpetuation of the present system, pro- 
               <br />
               vided it could be done without interfering 
               <br />
               with the success of Confederation, yet I do 
               <br />
               not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> that my constituents are prepared 
               <br />
               to reject the whole scheme, simply because 
               <br />
               there are a few features in it which are not 
               <br />
               exactly in accordance with their views. And 
               <br />
               I can assure 
               <br />
               no desire to 0 so. The opponents of the 
               <br />
               scheme appeal to the French population, 
               <br />
               telling them that their nationality is in danger, 
               <br />
               that they will be entirely absorbed in the 
               <br />
               Central Legislature, and that their rights and 
               <br />
               liberties will be interfered with. Then the 
               <br />
               same parties tell the English of Lower Can— 
               <br />
               ada that their nationality and their schools 
               <br />
               will be entirely at the mercy of the French in 
               <br />
               the Local Legislature. And, with a view of 
               <br />
               obtaining the defeat of the scheme in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">west,</span> they appeal to the pockets of the people 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada, asserting that they will 
               <br />
               have to bear the greater proportion of the 
               <br />
               taxation under the new system. Now, I 
               <br />
               think it has been clearly shown that the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces will contribute their full 
               <br />
               share towards the public revenue—that they 
               <br />
               will pay as much per head as Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               and much more than Lower Canada, so that 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial argument against Confederation 
               <br />
               cannot be substantiated. Those honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen who are trying to defeat the scheme 
               <br />
               by appealing to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prejudices</span> and sectional 
               <br />
               animosities of the people of Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               should bear in mind that they are pursuing a 
               <br />
               course which is calculated to mar the bar- 
               <br />
               monious working of any system of govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and that if they should succeed in de- 
               <br />
               feating the scheme, it would go very far to 
               <br />
               convince the people of Upper Canada that 
               <br />
               Lower Canada is determined not to consent 
               <br />
               to any measure of justice to Upper Canada. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It is also asserted that this 
               <br />
               scheme will bring about a separation from the 
               <br />
               Mother Country. Now, I believe that the 
               <br />
               advocates of union are as desirous to perpe- 
               <br />

               <br />

               to have that portion of our dominions opened 
               <br />
               up for settlement. Sucha course Would extend 
               <br />

               the Maritime Provinces are extensively en-

               gaged, so that the advantages would be of a 
               <br />
               mutual character. A great deal has been 
               <br />
               said about submitting the scheme to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               say that I could never make up my mind to 
               <br />
               vote for it without ﬁrst having an expression 
               <br />
               of popular opinion upon it in some way or 
               <br />
               other, unless I were perfectly satisﬁed that a

               large majority of my constituents are in favor 
               <br />
               of it. I took the precaution to hold a number 
               <br />
               of public meetings in the constituency which 
               <br />
               I represent, in order to obtain the views of 
               <br />
               the people upon it, and, in almost every in-

               stance, a large majority present at those meet- 
               <br />
               ings, not only expressed themselves in favor of 
               <br />
               the general features of the scheme, but also 
               <br />
               expressed a desire that it should be dealt with 
               <br />
               and adopted by this Parliament without ﬁrst 
               <br />
