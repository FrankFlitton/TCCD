               I now come, Mr. Srum, to the consid- 
               <br />

               <br />
               is such as to make the union practicable, and 
               <br />
               whether the details of the measures proposed 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> equitable to each and to all. In consid- 
               <br />
               ering this point, it is necessary for us ﬁrst to 
               <br />
               review the liabilities of each province, the 
               <br />
               reasons why the were incurred, the objects 
               <br />
               which have been sought. In doing so, the 
               <br />
               House will not fail to remark that the same 
               <br />
               policy _has animated the legislatures of all the 
               <br />

               Nor will any one fail to observe the intimate

               connection which all these public works have 
               <br />

               <br />
               several provinces, beginning w1th Canada. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that our whole debt, exclusive of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               The debt of Nova Scotia is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,858,547,</span> and 
               <br />
               that of New Brunswick 85,702,991; and I 
               <br />
               may notice, with reference to the debts of

               <br />
               dollars, consists of treasury notes, while the 
               <br />
               policy has been pursued both in that province 
               <br />
               and in New Brunswick of retaining in the

               <br />
               extent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,167,000.</span> It must, therefore, be

               <br />
               of these two colonies is not, on the whole 
               <br />
               amount, higher than that which the bulk of 
               <br />
               the Canadian debt now bears. Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has only incurred liabilities to the extent of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$946,000,</span> bearing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest</span> at ﬁve r cent.,

               while Prince Edward Island owes 240,673. 
               <br />
               The total liabilities of those provinces are, 
               <br />
               therefore, 811,748,211, against the interest on 
               <br />
