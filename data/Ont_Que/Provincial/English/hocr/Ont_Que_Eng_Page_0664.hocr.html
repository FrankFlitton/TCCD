               scheme there was no step of the kind con-

               <br />
               senses would venture to propose such a step ? 
               <br />
               It is diﬂicultto conceive that my honorable 
               <br />
               friend was serious when recommending it for 
               <br />
               our adoption. A more crude and ill-digested 
               <br />
               scheme (using his own words) could scarcely 
               <br />
               have emanated from his mind. What had 
               <br />
               become of all the acuteness and microscopic 
               <br />
               power he brought to bear upon the resolutions 
               <br />
               of the Quebec Conference ? “ A Colonial 
               <br />
               Council in London, something like the Indian 
               <br />
               Council !” Does he mean that we ought to 
               <br />
               have a Council in London <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> is to direct us

               governors general to this province from time 
               <br />
               to time to dictate the course of ourlegislation, 
               <br />
               and instruct us in regard to the expenditure 
               <br />
               of our money ?——because the Indian Council, 
               <br />
               under the presidency of a Secretary of State, 
               <br />

               that it is much to the interest of the British
