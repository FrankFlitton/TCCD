               not left to be speculated upon by the local 
               <br />
               governments. Now, sir, when one sees all

               that, and feels and knows that the great

               desirable, I say the magnitude of the

               mend to us, in the strongest manner, a 
               <br />
               change of the character of which I have 
               <br />
               been speaking——a change that would tend to 
               <br />
               place this country on such a footing that 
               <br />
               none can fail to see that we would even- 
               <br />
               tually become the members of a great 
               <br />
               community, and that in a much shorter space 
               <br />
               of time than many people imagine. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Allow me for a moment, sir, to 
               <br />
               allude to the history of the United States, 
               <br />
               to see the position in which that country 
               <br />
               once stood. In 1792, the United States, 
               <br />
               with a population, at that time, of nine 
               <br />
               millions of people, had a revenue of a 
               <br />
               little over four and a-half millions of dollars, 
               <br />
               while in Canada, in 1863, with a population 
               <br />
               of two and a—half’ millions, we had a revenue 
               <br />
               of fourteen millions of dollars. In 1821, 
               <br />
               when their population had greatly increased, 
               <br />
               the whole of their exports and imports 
               <br />
               amounted to ninety-eight millions of dollars, 
               <br />
               while ours, in 1863, with a population of 
               <br />
               only two and a-half millions, was no less 
               <br />
               than eighty—nine millions of dollars ; that is, 
               <br />
               within nine millions of the entire im crts 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a!!!</span> exports of the United States in 821. 
               <br />
               It is true that since that time all those facili- 
               <br />
               ties which have made the United States a 
               <br />
               great power on this continent—the con— 
               <br />
               struction of railways and telegraphs, the 
               <br />
               application of steam power to all kinds of 
               <br />
               machinery, and other inventions of the

               <br />
               still, it is nothing against the argument to

               the resolution which I hold in my hand, and 
               <br />
               which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁ‘er</span> for the adoption of this House,

               _is one that ought to be accepted. I have 
               <br />
               said, sir, that I, as ,an individual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> of

               the Legislature of Canada, had not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hesitated</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> take u n myself the responsibility of

               any constitutional manner. I said that I 
               <br />
               did so upon the same principle as I would 
               <br />
               have done if I had been voting upon them 
               <br />
               outside of the House instead of inside. I 
               <br />
               would have voted for them as an elector, be-

               contemplated union; and,—sir, I desire to oﬁ'er 
               <br />
               exactly the same opportunity to every elector 
               <br />
               to pursue the same course that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rwould</span> pursue,

               <br />
               the accomplishment of the union for an in- 
               <br />
               deﬁnite period, whereas the pressure of cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances are such that no time should be 
               <br />
               lost in placing ourselves in such a position

               the resolution I have proposed that would, 
               <br />
