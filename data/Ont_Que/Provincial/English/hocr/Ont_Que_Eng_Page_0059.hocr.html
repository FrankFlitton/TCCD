               In short, this Parliament shall settle what

               shall be the different constituencies electing

               of which will ﬁx the limits of their several

               ral limits as they please, for their own local 
               <br />
               elections. But it would evidently be un- 
               <br />
               proper to leave to the Local Legislature the 
               <br />
               power to alter the constituencies sending

               members to the General Legislature after 
               <br />
               the General Legislature shall have been 
               <br />
               called into existence. Were this the case, a 
               <br />
               member of the General Legislature might 
               <br />
               at any time ﬁnd himself ousted from his seat

               by an alteration of his constituency by the 
               <br />
               Local Legislature in his section. N c, after 
               <br />
               the General Parliament meets, in order that 
               <br />
               it may have full control of its own legislation, 
               <br />
               and be assured of its position, it must have 
               <br />
               the full power of arranging and re-arranging 
               <br />
               the electoral limits of its constituencies as it 
               <br />
               pleases, such being one of the powers essen- 
               <br />
               tially necessary to such a Legislature. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I shall not detain the House by 
               <br />
               entering into a consideration at any length 
               <br />

               <br />
               subjects which are to be assigned to the 
               <br />
               General and Local Legislatures respectively, 
               <br />
               will see that all the great questions which 
               <br />
               affect the general interests of the Confederacy 
               <br />
               as a whole, are conﬁded to the Federal Par- 
               <br />
               liament, while the local interests and local 
               <br />
               laws of each section are preserved intact, 
               <br />
               and entrusted to the care of the local 
               <br />
               bodies. As a matter of course, the General 
               <br />
               Parliament must have the power of dealing 
               <br />
               with the public debt and property of the 
               <br />
               Confederation. Of course, too, it must have 
               <br />
               the regulation of trade and commerce, of 
               <br />
               customs and excise. The Federal Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment must have the sovereign power of rais- 
               <br />
               ing money from such sources and by such 
               <br />
               means as the representatives of the people 
               <br />
               will allow. It will be seen that the local 
               <br />
               legislatures have the control of all local 
               <br />
               works ; and it is a matter of great importance,

               though lying wholly within one section, and 
               <br />
               the St. Lawrence Canals in two only, may 
               <br />

               for the general beneﬁt of the whole Feder- 
               <br />
               ation. Again, the census, the ascertaining 
               <br />
               of our numbers and the extent of our re-

               <br />
               with the defences of the country. One of 
               <br />
               the great advantages of Confederation is, that 
               <br />
               we shall have a united, a concerted, and 
               <br />
               uniform system of defence. (_Hear.) We are 
               <br />
               at this moment with a diﬁ'orent militia 
               <br />
               system in each colony—in some of the 
               <br />
               colonies with an utter want of any system 
               <br />
               of defence. We have a number of separate 
               <br />
               staff establishments, without any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrange.</span> 
               <br />
               ment between the colonies as to the means, 
               <br />
               either of defence or oﬁenee. But, under 
               <br />
               the union, we will have one system of defence 
               <br />
               and one system of militia organization. In 
               <br />
               the event of the Lower Provinces being 
               <br />
               threatened, we can send the large militia 
               <br />
               forces of Upper Canada to .their rescue. 
               <br />
               Should we have to ﬁght on our lakes against 
               <br />
               a foreign foe, we will have the hardy seamen 
               <br />
               of the Lower Provinces coming to our as— 
               <br />
               sistance and manning our vessels. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) We will have one system of defence 
               <br />
               and be one people, acting together alike in 
               <br />
               peace andin war. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> The criminal
