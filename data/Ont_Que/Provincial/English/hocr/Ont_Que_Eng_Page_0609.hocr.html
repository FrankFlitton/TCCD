               career in disgust, and retiring to the 
               <br />
               seclusion of their homes. Then it was that 
               <br />
               we saw a French-Canadian majority voting 
               <br />
               down a Ministry whose political programme 
               <br />
               aﬁ'orded more effectual guarantees for Lower

               and paltry party spirit induced them to 
               <br />

               majority, by its vote, decreed our national 
               <br />
               downfall. (Hear, hear.) Well, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               under the new Government we found repre- 
               <br />
               sentation by population again made a subject 
               <br />
               of discussion in our Legislature; and now, 
               <br />
               there is no denying it, that unfortunate 
               <br />
               concession, which places us at the mercy of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, has become an accomplished 
               <br />
               fact. (Hear, hear.) I stated, just now, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, that the hon. member for South 
               <br />
               Oxford was unable to obtain his committee 
               <br />
               under the MAODONALD-SICOTTE Adminis— 
               <br />
               tration, an essentially liberal one. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) On reference to the Journals of this 
               <br />
               House of that period, what do we ﬁnd? 
               <br />
               The Ministry which succeeded that Govern- 
               <br />
               ment had hardly taken possession of the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches, when the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               BROWN again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">came</span> before the House ask- 
               <br />
               ing for a committee, and in that instance 
               <br />
               with more success. I had the honor to pro- 
               <br />
               pose an amendment to his motion, but my 
               <br />
               amendment was rejected, and amongst the 
               <br />
               members who ﬁgure in that unfortunate divi- 
               <br />
               sion, I ﬁnd the names of the Hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works, the Hon. Provincial Secretary, 
               <br />
               and the Hon. Attorney General East. Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, this is a very signiﬁcant fact, and 
               <br />
               one extremely deserving of attention at the 
               <br />
               present moment. ln pressing that motion 
               <br />
               upon the House, I maintained that our policy 
               <br />
               was to act on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offensive,</span> instead of merely 
               <br />
               defending ourselves, as we had up to that 
               <br />
               time done; that we ought to unite as one 
               <br />
               man to obtain the re-enactment of the proviso 
               <br />
               to the 26th clause of the Act of Union, which 
               <br />
               had been shamefully struck out in 1856, 
               <br />
               when we obtained an elective Legislative 
               <br />
               Council. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear?</span> Now, on this point, 
               <br />
               which was perfectly c ear, we found these 
               <br />
               same Ministers voting for the rejection of 
               <br />
               the amendment, which asserted a right sacred 
               <br />
               to French-Canadians. Did not this vote 
               <br />
               imply that those who made this cowardly 
               <br />
               concession were prepared to yield again in 
               <br />
               the proposed constitutional changes? Yes,

               House that the scheme of Confederationwas 
               <br />

               the ﬁrst step in the direction of the object 
               <br />
               for which he had struggled during his whole

               political career, and that the scheme of Con-

               ample reward for his unremitting efforts, 
               <br />
               and a complete justiﬁcation of the princi-

               Subsequently, Mr. SPEAKER, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TAOEL</span> 
               <br />
               MACDONALD Government succumbed on a 
               <br />
               question of ﬁnance, and, ﬁnding that they 
               <br />
               could not sustain themselves without the 
               <br />
               assistance of the Opposition, that same Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment called into the Cabinet the man who 
               <br />
               had proved most hostile to Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               interests, and with whom they had ever lived 
               <br />
               in unexampled antagonism. From that 
               <br />
               alliance resulted the scheme of Confederation 
               <br />
               which is now submitted to us, and which 
               <br />
               concedes the principle of representation based 
               <br />
               on population. Ought the Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               party to have made so important a concession 
               <br />
               to Upper Canada? I am prepared to estab- 
               <br />
               lish by ﬁgures that that question contained 
               <br />
               within itself its own remedy; and those who 
               <br />
               voted in favor of its concession are in no way 
               <br />
               justiﬁable, looking at the uestion in any 
               <br />

               period which is close at hand! When we
