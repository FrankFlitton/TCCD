               welded together, which men should try to

               unite more strongly to each other by tearing

               maker’s paste. Some will answer, “ True ! 
               <br />
               the Federal principle has always and in every 
               <br />
               case proved a failure, but the cause lay in 
               <br />
               the weakness of the central power. We 
               <br />
               shall obviate that inconvenience, by establish- 
               <br />
               inga central power strong enough to pre- 
               <br />
               serve our Confederation from that danger.” 
               <br />
               But then it will be no longer a Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation ; it will be a legislative union—a union 
               <br />
               which the most zealous advocates of Confe- 
               <br />
               deration reject as incompatible with the 
               <br />
               various interests of the different provinces. 
               <br />
               If you succeed in establishing this central 
               <br />
               power, with strength enough to bear sway 
               <br />
               over the local powers, the latter will no 
               <br />
               longer have an exclusive existence; they 
               <br />
               will become the authorized delegates of the 
               <br />
               central power, their oﬁcers and every vestige 
               <br />
               of confederation will disappear from your 
               <br />
               Constitution. If you absolutely resolve to 
               <br />
               adopt the Federal principle, you cannot do 
               <br />
               it without adopting at the same time all its 
               <br />
               inconveniences. The weakness of the 
               <br />
               central power is not the fruit of the Federal 
               <br />
               system; it is its root, it is itself. This is 
               <br />
               the reason why states which are perfectly 
               <br />
               independent of each other, adopt the Federal 
               <br />
               principle solely as a means of defence against 
               <br />
               foreigners, because the central power in a 
               <br />
               confederation cannot be other than weak. 
               <br />
               We already possess, under our present Con- 
               <br />
               stitution, and without confederation, a central 
               <br />
               power stronger than any power which you 
               <br />
               can create, and to which we submit without 
               <br />
               complaint, because it is perfectly compatible 
               <br />
               with the existence of our local powers—I

               mixed up with them in any way. But if 
               <br />
               that central power was wielded by men taken 
               <br />
               from among ourselves, men who have taken 
               <br />
               part in our quarrels and animosities, and who 
               <br />
               would make use of it to give effect to the 
               <br />
               views of their party, it would become in- 
               <br />
               supportable. As it now exists, we feel it 
               <br />
               only by the beneﬁts it confers. Having 
               <br />
               thus shown the serious inconveniences 
               <br />
               innate in the Federal system, let us see 
               <br />
               whether there be anything exceptional in our 
               <br />
               position, operating in our favor, and allow- 
               <br />
               ing as to hope for immunity from those evils 
               <br />
               which have befallen all former confederations. 
               <br />
               What is our position? In what respects is 
               <br />
               it more favorable than that of other confed- 
               <br />
               erations? Let us begin with Lower Canada; 
               <br />
               its population is composed of about three- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fourths</span> French—Canadiens, and of one-fourth 
               <br />
               English-Canadians. It is impossible, even 
               <br />
               for the blindest admirers of the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation, to shut out from their view 
               <br />
               this great difference of nationality, which is 
               <br />
               certainly fated to play an important part in 
               <br />
               the destinies of the future Confederation. 
               <br />
               When Lord DURHAM wrote his celebrated 
               <br />
               report in 1839, he said, when speaking of 
               <br />
               the English-Canadians of Lower Canada :— 
               <br />
               “ The English pepulation will never submit 
               <br />
               to the authority of a parliament in which 
               <br />
               the French have a majority, or 'even the 
               <br />
               semblance of a majority.” A little further 
               <br />
               on, he added :—“ In the signiﬁcant language 
               <br />
               of one of their most eminent men, they assert 
               <br />
               that Lower Canada must become English, 
               <br />
               even if to eﬂ'ect that object it should be 
               <br />
               necessary that the province should cease to 
               <br />
               belongto England." Whatever errors Lord 
               <br />
               DURHAM may have fallen into in judging 
               <br />
               the French-Canadians, he certainly cannot 
               <br />
               be reproached with having shewn too great 
               <br />
               severity towards the English- Canadians. He 
               <br />
               merely depicted their sentiments, as they 
               <br />
               manifested themselves in his day. Since 
               <br />
               then, things have undergone a change. 
               <br />
               And last autumn, at Sherbrooke, the Hon- 
               <br />
               orable Minister of Finance presented to as a 
               <br />
               very different picture, when he said z—‘.‘ For 
               <br />
               ﬁve and twenty years harmony has reigned 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada, and the English and 
               <br />
               French populations have entered into a com- 
               <br />
               pact to labor together to promote the common 
               <br />
               interests of the country.” This pictureis
