               <br />
               Confederation. (Hear, hear.) One must be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shortesighted</span> not to see that this new order

               similar to those produced by the American 
               <br />
               Constitution of 17 88, when the citizens and 
               <br />
               public men divided into two camps, the camp 
               <br />
               of the supporters of national union and that 
               <br />
               of the friends of the state sovereignty. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Let us not then be anxious about the 
               <br />
               future of parties. What does it matter to 
               <br />
               this country what position the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga or m self may occupy 
               <br />
               in this new Constitution ? ( aughter.) What 
               <br />
               matters it to the country if we be above or 
               <br />
               below, the ﬁrst or the last, the victors or the 
               <br />
               vanquished, so long as it is happy under the 
               <br />
               new rule, and ﬁnds happiness, greatness, power 
               <br />
               and prosperity in the free development of its 
               <br />
               resources and institutions? (Hear,' hear.) 
               <br />
               The opponents of Confederation do not desire 
               <br />
               the union of the provinces for the purpose of 
               <br />
               military defence; two and two will always 
               <br />
               make four, say they, and in uniting the popu- 
               <br />
               lations of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> provinces, you will not 
               <br />
               give us more strength to resist the common 
               <br />
               enemy, unless, as facetiously remarked the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Lotbiniere, we make a 
               <br />
               treaty with the enemy, which would bind him 
               <br />
               to attack us at but one place at a timc, so as 
               <br />
               to allow us to oppose all our forces to the 
               <br />
               invasion. Yes, two and two will always 
               <br />
               make four. You are right. War between 
               <br />
               England and the United States would expose 
               <br />
               us in our colonial position to the attacks of the 
               <br />
               enemy at all vulnerable points of the re- 
               <br />
               spective provinces. But, ﬁrstly, the union 
               <br />
               carries with it the construction of the Inter- 
               <br />
               eolonial Railway, and that railway which does 
               <br />
               not particularly please the two annexationist 
               <br />
               leaders of the Opposition, would allow 
               <br />
               England and the provinces to transport troops 
               <br />
               rapidly from the furthest limits of the country 
               <br />
               to the threatened points of the national ter- 
               <br />
               ritory. Without the aid of railways how 
               <br />
               could NAPOLEON III. have been able, in a 
               <br />
               fortnight, to threw two hundred thousand 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               separation from the Mother Country; for 
               <br />
               that moment will come, whether we wish 
               <br />
               it or wish it not? Each province would 
               <br />
               form an independent state, and as to at- 
               <br />
               tack the one would no longer mean to at- 
               <br />
               tack all, inasmuch as we should have ceased 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Romans in Asia, Europe and Africa, of the 
               <br />
               English in India, and of NAPOLEON, the

               greatest warrior of modern times, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘Europe.</span> 
               <br />
               1 understand that the annexationists insist on 
               <br />
               the status quo and on isolation; but others 
               <br />
               would be blind did they listen to them, inas-

               much as reason commands them to organize, 
               <br />
               so as to be ready when danger comes. If we 
               <br />
               are four millions to-day, we shall probably be 
               <br />
               eight millions and over then ,with preportionate
