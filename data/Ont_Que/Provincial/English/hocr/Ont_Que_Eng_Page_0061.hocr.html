               Confederation, who is appointed by the 
               <br />
               Crown. This provision was inserted in the 
               <br />
               Constitution on account of the practical dif- 
               <br />

               Governor General. It must be remembered 
               <br />
               that the pardoning power not only extends 
               <br />
