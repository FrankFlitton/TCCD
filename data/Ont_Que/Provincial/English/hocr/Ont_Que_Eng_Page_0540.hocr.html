               conclusion that it will not signify for a few 
               <br />
               years, whether these western works are begun 
               <br />
               at once or not; and should propose to sit 
               <br />
               down ﬁrst a little, and count the cost. 
               <br />
               HON. J. S. MACDONALD—Insist on 
               <br />
               having a survey made, for instance, ﬁrst? 
               <br />
               Ma. DUN KIN—Well yes, that would 
               <br />
               probably be insisted upon before they would 
               <br />
               consent to commit themselves further to the 
               <br />
               undertaking. Suppose, then, Lower Canada 
               <br />
               to go with the Lower Provinces for staving 
               <br />
               off this commencement of these works, how 
               <br />
               will it fare with Upper Canada’s demand for 
               <br />
               them? And what will not be the indignation 
               <br />
               of the people of Upper Canada at being tied 
               <br />
               to, and controlled by the non-progressive 
               <br />
               people of the east? Or, su pose that Upper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada shoul agree, and the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces be seriously angry, at any 
               <br />
               over-caution eastward, or over-rashness 
               <br />
               westward; would not they too, so left 
               <br />
               out in the cold, be making things quite 
               <br />
               unpleasant? Or again, suppose the more 
               <br />
               eastern and the western interests should 
               <br />
               continue to push on both plans, careless of 
               <br />
               cost, and that Lower Canada, for fear of 
               <br />
               direct taxation, should hold back in earnest, 
               <br />
               would that make no trouble? Is not any 
               <br />
               one of these suppositions more probable 
               <br />
               than the cool assumption, over which western 
               <br />
               gentlemen are so happy, that when the time 
               <br />
               comes all interests will instantly work to- 
               <br />
               gether, and by magic do everything, cast and 
               <br />
               west, at once ? But, be this as it may, sir, 
               <br />
               on all three accounts—defences, Intercolonial 
               <br />
               road and western works—we are sure of 
               <br />
               cost, as well as of disputes, in plenty. And 
               <br />
               there is, besides, a fourth. I shall have 
               <br />
               occasion to shew presently that we are going 
               <br />
               to be called upon to spend money for yet 
               <br />
               soother kindred purpose, and a large amount 
               <br />
               too—and this, as a part of this scheme. 
               <br />
               Our star of empire is to wing its way west- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ward;</span> and we are to confederate everything in 
               <br />
               Its track, from Newfoundland to Vancouver’s 
               <br />
               Island, this last included. But, between us 
               <br />
               and it, there lies the Hudson Bay territory. 
               <br />
               So, of course, we must acquire that for 
               <br />
               confederation purposes; and the plan is, 
               <br />
               that before we get it we shall have to pay 
               <br />
               for the elephant—though, after we get him, 
               <br />
               we may ﬁnd him costly and hard to keep. 
               <br />
               It will not be diﬁcult to prove that this is 
               <br />
               contemplated by the promoters of this scheme. 
               <br />

               <br />
               extension, before we get the scheme carried 
               <br />
               out in all its contemplated amplitude, we 
               <br />
               shall have bled pretty well, and seen some

               MR. DUNKIN—I quite understand that 
               <br />
               many hon. gentlemen take little thought of 
               <br />

               <br />
               before I go further, I am handed the fyle of 
               <br />
               the Toronto Leader, and, with the leave ot 
               <br />
               the House, I will read from it the extracts 
               <br />
               from Hon. Mr. TILLEY’s speech to which I 
               <br />
               was referring some minutes ago. This jour-

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Turner,</span> we are sorry to say, does not give 
               <br />
               us much hope of the speedy enlar ement of our 
               <br />
               canals. He laughs at the idea 0 his opponent 
               <br />
               quoting Mr. BROWN as authority that this work is 
               <br />
               to be undertaken at once. “ The Conference,” says 
               <br />
               Mr. TlLl.EY, “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a;</span> reed to build the railroad without 
               <br />
               delay, the canals as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> n as the state of the ﬁnances 
               <br />
               will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pesmit.”</span> But he ridicules the idea that the 
               <br />
               ﬁnances will be held at once to admit of this 
               <br />
               being done. " Canada,” says Mr. TILLEY, “could 
               <br />
               not have been brought into the union on a promise 
               <br />
               to build her canals, for the railroad will cost 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$12,000,000,</span> which added to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$22,000,000</span> 
               <br />
               for canals, would be an amount far above what 
               <br />
               they could have gained them for without Confe- 
               <br />

               Such is Hon . Mr.Tri.LnY’s style of remark, and 
               <br />
               I do not think it is at all encouraging to the 
               <br />
               very sanguine view of the scheme taken by 
               <br />
               some western politicians. It is presumable 
               <br />
               that he will take Newfoundland, Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island and Nova Scotia with him, 
               <br />
               and along with them he will get much of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. If I should have the honor 
               <br />
               of a seat in the House, they may depend 
               <br />
               upon it, I shall do what I can to get them 
               <br />
               fair play. But I repeat, I do not expect to 
               <br />
               see them satisﬁed with the result. Well, 
               <br />
               sir, however this may be, there is going to 
               <br />
               be, at any rate, an immense amount of money 
               <br />
               required, come from whence it may. Where 
               <br />
               is it to come from ? We cannot shut our eyes 
               <br />
               to the fact, that the customs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬂ‘</span> must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come</span> 
               <br />
               down. ( Hear.) There are no two ways about 
               <br />
               that. Our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> is much higher than those 
               <br />
               of the Lower Provinces; and the advocates 
               <br />
               of Confederation there have to assure people 
               <br />
               that their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariffs</span> will not be materially raised, 
               <br />
               in order to get any sort of hearing for the 
               <br />
               scheme. To tell them that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wtariﬂ‘</span> of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iv</span> to be that of the Confederation, 
               <br />
               would be to ruin the chances of getting a 
               <br />
               favorable reception for it. (Hear, hear.)
