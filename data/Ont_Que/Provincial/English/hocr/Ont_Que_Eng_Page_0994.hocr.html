               of the people, and be perpetuated. Looking

               at this change that is considered so necessary, 
               <br />
               let us enquire what events have brought it

               about. Let honorable gentlemen on the

               <br />
               ﬁnd that it has been the cry that retrench-

               ment was absolutely necessary—that if we 
               <br />
               did not have retrenchment, or give to Upper

               consequence of her contributing so much 
               <br />
               more to the revenue, there would be a revo-

               President of the Council, for party and poli- 
               <br />

               <br />
               while he was in opposition. Not that there 
               <br />
               was really any danger of revolution, but 
               <br />
               because there was justice in the cry, they 
               <br />
               used strong language to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> to their 
               <br />
               argument. Now, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> would like to understand 
               <br />
               and I have not yet been able to understand 
               <br />
               from any member of this House who has 
               <br />
               been advocating representation by population 
               <br />
               —whether there was any reason for believing 
               <br />
               that we could not have got that constitu- 
               <br />
               tional change just as well as we can get this 
               <br />
               one. lt was party feeling that kept the 
               <br />
               people apart, yet that party feeling was 
               <br />
               swamped in a moment when the leaders of 
               <br />
               the parties brought their heads together, and 
               <br />
               declared that it should no longer exist. 
               <br />
               They united for the avowed purpose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot'reme-</span> 
               <br />
               dying the diﬁiculties under which the pro- 
               <br />
               vince labored, and for the purpose of giving 
               <br />
               the people of Upper Canada their rights; and 
               <br />
               they say this is to be accomplished by a 
               <br />
               Federal union. They might as well have 
               <br />
               formed a union for a more economical object 
               <br />
               —for the purpose of forming a Legislative 
               <br />
               union between the provinces. It may be 
               <br />
               said that hon. gentlemen of French extraction 
               <br />
               from Lower Canada were so determined 
               <br />
               to resist the demands of Upper Canada, that 
               <br />
               the rights of that section of the province 
               <br />
               could never have been obtained, unless by a 
               <br />
               Federal union of the colonies. I think, 
               <br />
               however, that they are men of intelligence, 
               <br />
               and that if they found Upper Canadians 
               <br />
               were true to their determination to contend 
               <br />
               for their rights until they should be obtained, 
               <br />
               the result would have been very different 
               <br />
               from what it has been. Hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               from Lower Canada, of French origin, must 
               <br />
               have seen that they were liable to be swept 
               <br />
               away at any moment that there should be a 
               <br />
               union between the British of Lower and of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada. If the issue had been

               placed fairly and equally before them; if 
               <br />
               they had been brought to see that matters

               had arrived at such a state that it was 
               <br />
               absolutely necessary that some change should 
               <br />
               take place—the people of the Eastern

               <br />
               against them--they would have seen that 
               <br />
               the elements on the ﬂoor of this House

               were such as would force upon them either 
               <br />
               a legislative union with the Lower Provinces, 
               <br />
               or representation by population in Canada 
               <br />
               alone. Whether a legislative union, with 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reprtsentation</span> by population as a basis, 
               <br />
               could have been obtained from the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces or not, I am not prepared to 
               <br />
               say; but I am given to understand that the 
               <br />
               people of the Lower Provinces advocated a 
               <br />
               legislative union as strongly as those of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, and that they were about to 
               <br />
               carry out a legislative union among them- 
               <br />
               selves. Now, if Prince Edward Island and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland were willing to go into a 
               <br />
               legislative union with Nova Scotia and New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, I do not see why the proposal 
               <br />
               to bring in an additional province should 
               <br />
               have effected so complete a change in their 
               <br />
               views. I am satisﬁed that if the gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen who represented the interests of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada had set themselves about 
               <br />
               trying to get that which would have been 
               <br />
               best for their people, and had endeavored to 
               <br />
               enforce the rights of Upper Canada, they 
               <br />
               would have aecomplished that which would 
               <br />
               have been of more service to the people of 
               <br />
               the united provinces, and which would have 
               <br />
               placed beyond chance or possibility those 
               <br />
               contentions which will necessarily result 
               <br />
               so soon as you have individualized those 
               <br />
               provinces by giving each a Local Legislature. 
               <br />
               By this scheme you will have increased the 
               <br />
               burdens of the people, and in so doing will 
               <br />
               have increased their opportunity for discon- 
               <br />
               tent. You have given to the general and 
               <br />
               local legislatures coordinate jurisdiction, or 
               <br />
               at least have given them the right to legislate 
               <br />
               on the same questions, and, in thus placing 
               <br />
               in their hands an element of contention, 
               <br />
               have shown that you are not building up a 
               <br />
               ﬁrm and stable government. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Now it is said that one of the strongest 
               <br />
               reasons for union is found in the necessity 
               <br />
               of placing our common country in a position 
               <br />
               of defence, but I do not see why we cannot 
               <br />
               make arrangement for a defence under our 
               <br />
               present government. Let us be told what 
               <br />
               it is that is required of us, and see whether 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> legislatures will not vote the
