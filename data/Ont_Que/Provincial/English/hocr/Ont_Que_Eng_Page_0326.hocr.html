               HON. MB. VIDAL—In compelling the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst selection of legislative councillors from 
               <br />
               the members of the Chamber, the Conference 
               <br />
               have put a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restraint</span> on the prerogative of the 
               <br />
               Crown which they had no right to impose. 
               <br />
               I am unwilling for a moment to suppose that 
               <br />
               any law or unworthy motive actuated the 
               <br />
               Canadian delegates, who alone are respon- 
               <br />
               sible for this detail, or that they did this 
               <br />
               in hopes of securing the votes of any members 
               <br />
               of this House in favor of their scheme, which 
               <br />
               they could not otherwise have been sure of; 
               <br />
               still that part of the scheme has an awkward 
               <br />
               appearance, and some honorable members may 
               <br />
               feel with the member from Wellington (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SANBOBN),</span> that if it be not a bribe, it 
               <br />
               looks something very like it. I, however, 
               <br />
               do not see it in that light. I do not think 
               <br />
               there has been anything worse than a desire 
               <br />
               to make the system of appointment palatable 
               <br />
               to the peeple, by taking a certain number of 
               <br />
               their representatives, whom they then sent 
               <br />
               to this House, to be members of the new 
               <br />
               one. (Hear, hear.) As to the boasted im- 
               <br />
               partiality apparent in the 14th resolution, I 
               <br />
               do not attach any importance to its provi- 
               <br />
               sions. If it were not the understanding that 
               <br />
               the selection would be made in the manner 
               <br />
               there laid down, there would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">h</span> strong

               scheme remains for me to speak on, and I 
               <br />
               think itis an important one. Twenty—one

               of opinion between my honorable friend and 
               <br />

               <br />
               orable gentlemen, I have said I am favorable 
               <br />
               to the scheme of union—I say it sincerely 
               <br />
               and honestly—and notwithstanding the 
               <br />
               Honorable Commissioner of Crown Lands 
               <br />
               may say “It cannot be so ; by supporting the 
               <br />
               amendment you are destroying the scheme," 
               <br />
               I cannot see it so. My course, I think, is 
               <br />
               that which is most conducive to the success 
               <br />
               of the scheme. I consider myself one of its 
               <br />
               best and most faithful friends in seeking to 
               <br />
               have it more ﬁrmly based u n the approval 
               <br />
               of the pe0ple, at the cost o a triﬂing delay. 
               <br />
               A great deal has been said, as an introduction 
               <br />
               to this measure, that was unworthy of it. 
               <br />
               We have had long accounts of political and 
               <br />
               party diﬁiculties, which have been spoken of 
               <br />
               as appertaining to it. These were too small 
               <br />
               matters to have led to this great constitu- 
               <br />
               tional change. It was clearly seen by the 
               <br />
               peeple, as well asby Her M ajesty’s represen- 
               <br />
               tative, that these diﬁiculties were not based 
               <br />
               upon what they were said to be by some of 
               <br />
               our politicians. What does His Excellency
