               <br />
               people, should have grown into the public 
               <br />
               favor. I cannot understand why I or any

               members of this House should change our

               <br />
               have, when we do not conscientiously think 
               <br />
               such change would be for the beneﬁt of the 
               <br />
               country. I say, air, that I am. quite entitled

               to maintain the same views new that I have 
               <br />
               always entertained. (Hear-.) This scheme, 
               <br />
               sir, is submitted to us on two grounds ; ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               the necessity for meeting the constitutional 
               <br />
               diﬁculties which have arisen between Up or 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada, owing to the growing 
               <br />
               demands on the part of Upper Canada for 
               <br />
               representation by poulation; and, secondly, 
               <br />
               the necessity for providing more eﬂicient 
               <br />
               means for the defence of the country than 
               <br />
               now exist. These are the only two grounds 
               <br />
               we have heard stated for the propositions 
               <br />
               now submitted to us; and, sir, I shall apply 
               <br />
               myself to ‘explain my views on these two 
               <br />
               subjects, and also upon the scheme generally. 
               <br />
               When on the ﬁrst question, I trust I shall 
               <br />
               be permitted to go a little into the history 
               <br />
               of the agitation of representation by pop- 
               <br />
               ulation, for I owe it to myself, to my 
               <br />
               constituents and the country. My name 
               <br />
               has been used in various ways. It has some- 
               <br />
               times been said that I was entirely favorable 
               <br />
               to reprœentation by population—at other 
               <br />
               times that I was entirely favorable to the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the provinces, and I will 
               <br />
               now endeavor, once more, to state as clearly 
               <br />
               as possible what my real views have been and 
               <br />
               still are. ( Hear.) The ﬁrst time represen- 
               <br />
               tation by population was mocted in this 
               <br />
               House, on behalf of Upper Canada, was, I 
               <br />
               believe, in the Session of 1852, when the 
               <br />
               Conservative party took it up, and the Hon. 
               <br />
               Sir ALLAN <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MAONAB</span> moved resolutions in fa- 
               <br />
               vor of the principle. We then found the con- 
               <br />
               servatives arrayed in support of this constitu- 
               <br />
               tional chan e. It had been mooted before on 
               <br />
               behalf .of ower Canada, but the Upper 
               <br />
               Canadians had all opposed it. I think 
               <br />
               two votes were taken in 1852, and on one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               these occasions the Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               West (Hon. J. A. MAODONALDI) voted for 
               <br />
               it; it came up incidentally. n 1854the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Masses-Mount</span> coalition took place, and we 
               <br />
               heard no more of representation by popula- 
               <br />
               tion from that quarter—that is, as mooted 
               <br />
               by the Conservative party, who from that 
               <br />
               moment unifome opposed it on every occa- 
               <br />
               sion. It was, however, taken up by the present 
               <br />
               Hon. President of the Council, the member 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in its behalf as almost threatened a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revoluQ</span> 
               <br />
               tion. As the agitation in the country in- 
               <br />
               creased, so did the ‘vote for it in this House 
               <br />
               increase, and on several occasions I expressed 
               <br />
               my views upon the subject. I never shirked 
               <br />
               the question—I never hesitated to say that 
               <br />
               something ought to be done to meet the just 
               <br />
               claims of Upper Canada, and that represen- 
               <br />
               tation based on population was in the abstract 
               <br />
               a just and correct principle. I held, at the 
               <br />
               same time, there were reasons why Lower 
               <br />
               Canada could not grant it ; I entreated Lower 
               <br />
               Canadian representatives to show themselves 
               <br />
               disposed to meet the views of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               by making, at any rate, a counter proposi- 
               <br />
               tion; and in 1856, when Parliament was 
               <br />
               sitting in Toronto, I, for the ﬁrst time, sug- 
               <br />
               gested that one means of getting over the 
               <br />
               diﬂiculty would be to substitute for the pro.— 
               <br />
               sent Legislative union a Confederation of 
               <br />
               the two Canadas, by means of which all local 
               <br />
               questions could be consigned to the delibera- 
               <br />
               tions of local legislatures, with a Central 
               <br />
               government having control of commercial 
               <br />
               and other questions of common or general 
               <br />
               interest. I stated that, considering the 
               <br />
               diﬂ’erent religious faith, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> lan- 
               <br />
               gauge, the diﬂ'erent laws that prevailed in 
               <br />
               the two sections of the country, this was the 
               <br />
               best way to meet the difﬁculty; to leave to a 
               <br />
               general government questions of trade, cur- 
               <br />
               rency, banking, public works of a general 
               <br />
               character, &amp;c., and to commit to the decision 
               <br />
               of local legislatures all matters of a local 
               <br />
               bearing. At the same time Istatod that, if 
               <br />
               these views should not prevail, I would cer- 
               <br />
               tainly go for representation by population, 
               <br />
               and such checks and guarantees as would 
               <br />
               secure the interests of each section of the 
               <br />
               country,‘aud preserve to Lower Canada its 
               <br />
               cherished institutions. (Hear, hear.) 'l‘his

               speech, sir, has been twisted in all sorts of 
               <br />
               ways. I have heard it quoted to prove that 
               <br />
               I was in favor of representation by po ula- 
               <br />

               of a Confederation of the provinces and for 
               <br />
