               tion of our own times. Let us remember 
               <br />
               this, that when the three cries among our 
               <br />
               next neighbors are money, taxation, blood, 
               <br />

               <br />
               rity. I said in this House, during the ses- 
               <br />
               sion of the year 1861, that the ﬁrst gun 
               <br />
               ﬁred at Fort Sumpter had “a message for 
               <br />
               us;” I was unheeded then; I repeat new 
               <br />
               that every one of the 2,700 great guns in the 
               <br />
               ﬁeld, and every one of the 4,600 guns aﬂoat, 
               <br />
               whenever it opens its month, repeats the 
               <br />
               solemn warning of England—prepare—pre- 
               <br />
               pare—prepare! (Cheers.) But I may be

               when they get out of this, they will have had 
               <br />
               enough of it, and they will be very glad to 
               <br />
               rest on their Iaurels. They! Who? The 
               <br />
               shoddy aristocracy have enough of it ? The 
               <br />
               disbanded army of tax-gathers have enough 
               <br />
               it? The manufacturers of false intelligence 
               <br />
               have enough of it? Who is it possible will 
               <br />
               have had enough of it? The ﬁghting men 
               <br />
               themselves? I dare say they would all like 
               <br />
               to have a furlough, but all experiences 
               <br />
               teach us, it is not of war soldiers tire but 
               <br />
               of peace; it is not of the sea sailors tire, but 
               <br />
               of the land. Jack likes to land, and have a 
               <br />
               frolic and spend his money, so does Jack’s 
               <br />
               brother the ﬁghting landsman—but the one 
               <br />
               is soon as much out of his element as the 
               <br />
               other, when parted from his comrades; when 
               <br />
               denied the gypsy joys of the cam , when he 
               <br />
               no longer feels his sword, he loo s up to it 
               <br />
               where it hangs, and sighs to take it down 
               <br />
               and be “ at work” again. He will even quit 
               <br />
               his native country, if she continues perverse- 
               <br />
               ly peaceful, and go into foreign service, 
               <br />
               rather than remain what he calls “ idle.”
