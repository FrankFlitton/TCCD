               period of 1863-64, when we ﬁnd two political

               <br />
               only a very short time, and on the 14th of 
               <br />
               June of last year came what has been called 
               <br />
               the dead -lock. Then, honorable gentlemen,

               — there was, for eight or ten days, a breathing 
               <br />
               time for the parties who had been engaged in 
               <br />
               this political strife. It was a breathing time 
               <br />
               to them, as it were, to reﬂect upon the past 
               <br />
               and to endeavor to look forward to the future. 
               <br />
               It had been thought by many that the spirit 
               <br />
               of patriotism in the hearts of our statesmen 
               <br />
               was a dead principle. In their strife they 
               <br />
               seemed to have forgotten the best interests of 
               <br />
               Canada. But, during these ten days, the spirit 
               <br />
               of patriotism revived. This was a memorable 
               <br />
               period 1n the history of Canada. The leader 
               <br />
               of the Opposition, the Hon. GEORGE BROWN 
               <br />
               ——-I speak it to his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honor—was</span> the ﬁrst to 
               <br />
               declare what he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ready</span> to do, and what he 
               <br />
               proposed was so reasonab that very soon the 
               <br />
               acceptance of his propositions was brought 
               <br />
               about. I have pleasing recollections in reler— 
               <br />
               ring to that period, particularly as having had 
               <br />
               an opportunity of giving a word of advice on 
               <br />
               the evening of the day these propositions were 
               <br />
               made. I may refer to it, as the name of the 
               <br />
               gentleman I allude to, Mr. MORRIS, a mem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               this honorable House, when the result of the 
               <br />
               resolutions was laid before us. Meeting Mr.

               <br />
               it was so reasonable, and looked so like a
