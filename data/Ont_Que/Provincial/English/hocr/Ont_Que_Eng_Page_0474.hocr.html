               <br />
               I say, then, that we ought not to hasten on a 
               <br />
               change that may prove injurious to us, without 
               <br />
               asking the people themselves whether they 
               <br />
               approve of it or not. (Hear, hear.) So 
               <br />
               anxious are the honorable gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches to have it carried, that they 
               <br />
               even quarrel amongst them selves as to the

               parentage of the scheme; and the House was

               <br />
               dent of the Council took the Hon. Attorney 
               <br />
               General West to task because that honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presumed</span> to say that it was his 
               <br />
               Government that had ﬁrst brought the matter 
               <br />
               up. (Langhter.) They appear to take great 
               <br />
               pride in the child, but this country of ours, 
               <br />
               the mother of the bantling, is travailing in 
               <br />
               agony from fear of the burdens that these 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen are endeavoring to put 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?…</span> it. (Hear, hear.) The Honorable 
               <br />
               . inister of Agriculture the other evening 
               <br />
               called our attention to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> that are 
               <br />
               occurring in the United States, and spoke of 
               <br />
               the army of contractors and tax-gatherers 
               <br />
               that was springing up there. He said that the 
               <br />
               cry of “ Tax, tax, tax!” came up perpetually 
               <br />
               from the tax-gatherers, and the cry of “ Money, 
               <br />
               money, money i” from the hordes of contrac- 
               <br />
               tors who are fattening upon the miseries of 
               <br />
               the people; and while he was talking of the 
               <br />
               message conveyed to us in the sound 
               <br />
               of every gun ﬁred in the United States, 
               <br />
               he may have thought perhaps that in the 
               <br />
               formation of this union and the building of 
               <br />
               this Intercolonial Railway, we too shall hear 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cries</span> of “ Tax, tax, tax! money, mone , 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{nosey</span> !” in the same way. (Hear, hear.) t 
               <br />
               is said again, in reference to this scheme, that 
               <br />
               every line of it shows a compromise. The 
               <br />
               Hon. Minister of Agriculture, if I remember 
               <br />
               right, used an expression of that kind. But 
               <br />
               [would ask the President of the Council and 
               <br />
               those who with him have been advocating the 
               <br />
               interests of Upper Canada, where is there any 
               <br />
               concession to Upper Canada in it? If they 
               <br />
               can point out one solitary instance, with the 
               <br />
               exception of the seventeen additional mem- 
               <br />
               bers given to the west, where anything has 
               <br />
               been conceded to that section, then I will say 
               <br />
               the scheme is deserving of my support. But 
               <br />
               lhold that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">j‘additional</span> number of repre— 
               <br />
               scntatives given to Up r Canada is no boon 
               <br />
               or concession. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ‘erences</span> between the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">two</span> provinces of Canada were not merely na- 
               <br />
               tional differences, but were of a sectional 
               <br />
               character. It was the West arrayed against 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> east, rather than nationality against na- 
               <br />
               tlonality, for was it not afact that the sixteen

               English-speaking members from Lower Cana- 
               <br />
               da united themselves with the French-Cana- 
               <br />
               dian majority, and not with the majorit of 
               <br />
               their own race in Up r Canada? The ng-

               lish members from entral Canada did the 
               <br />
               same ; and I contend, therefore, that the dif- 
               <br />
               ferences we had were sectional in their nature, 
               <br />
               and that we had no national diﬁerences that 
               <br />
               rendered a change at this time necessary. 
               <br />
               Are we going to get rid of these sectional dif- 
               <br />
               ferences by this scheme ? Will not the thirty 
               <br />
               additional members called into this legislature 
               <br />
               from the east unite with the Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               majority, and will not the same preponderance 
               <br />
               of inﬂuence be cast against Upper Canada as 
               <br />
               before? (Hear, hear.) Now, if a union of 
               <br />
               free people is to be brought about, it should 
               <br />
               be because the pee le desire it and feel that it 
               <br />
               is advantageous on the whole; and I am quite 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that if, in these provinces, we are to 
               <br />
               have a union that will confer any advantage 
               <br />
               upon us, it ought to be a L islative and not 
               <br />
               a Federal union. We shou d feel that if we 
               <br />
               are to be united, it ought to be in fact as well 
               <br />
               as in name; that we ought to be one people, 
               <br />
               and not separated from each other by sec- 
               <br />
               tions; that if we go into a union, it ought to 
               <br />
               be such a union as would make us one people; 
               <br />
               and that when a state of things arises favor- 
               <br />
               able to such a union, we will have an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of forming a union that will give us 
               <br />
               strength and protect our interests in all time 
               <br />
               to come. The Honorable President of the 
               <br />
               Council thinks that we should enter the union 
               <br />
               proposed for the purpose of protecting and 
               <br />
               defending ourselves. I would like to know 
               <br />
               of that honorable gentleman if he thinks that 
               <br />
               we, with a population of two millions and a 
               <br />
               half, can create asufricient armament, and raise 
               <br />
               a suﬂicient number of men to repel the mil- 
               <br />
               lions of the United States, should they choose 
               <br />
               to attack us? (Hear, hear.) I do not sup- 
               <br />
               pose, Mr. SPEAKER, that there would be any 
               <br />
               more read to defend the honor and integrity 
               <br />
               of Great ritain in this country than those 
               <br />
               who feel as I do in reference to this matter; 
               <br />
               and I am satisﬁed that, even with the know- 
               <br />
               ledge of certain destruction before us, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               tacked by the United States, we would have 
               <br />
               defenders springing up at any moment—de- 
               <br />
               fenders to sell their lives as dearly as possible, 
               <br />
               and to ﬁght inch by inch before they would 
               <br />
               be compelled to surrender the honor of the 
               <br />
               British Crown. But still, sir, we cannot help 
               <br />
               feeling the vast disparity of numbers between 
               <br />
               us and the United States; we can form no ar- 
               <br />
               mament that could repel them from every por-
