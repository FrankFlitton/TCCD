               again rushing into another similarly disastrous

               contest. I heard a gentleman describing this 
               <br />
               matter a short time ago, by an illustration which 
               <br />
               I will here repeat. His position was that the 
               <br />
               respective probabilities of a war with the 
               <br />
               United States, at an early or a remote period, 
               <br />
               might be learned from what is often seen 
               <br />
               when two men have been engaged in a round 
               <br />
               of ﬁsticuﬁ's. They pummell and bruise each 
               <br />
               other in the most shocking manner; and while 
               <br />
               the wounds they have received at each other's 
               <br />
               hands are fresh, while their blood is up, and 
               <br />
               while they are smarting under their injuries, 
               <br />
               if a bystander interferes with either of them, 
               <br />
               even sometimes by a little wholesome, well- 
               <br />
               meant advic'e, the wounded man will be ready 
               <br />
               to pitch into him at once, almost without 
               <br />
               thought of the odds that may exist against 
               <br />
               hm. But after such an individual cools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               and his wounds become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stiff</span> and sore, and he 
               <br />
               gets time for reﬂection, he has no desire what- 
               <br />
               ever to enter into a contest. And so, I appre- 
               <br />
               hend, will it be with our neighbors on the 
               <br />
               other side of the line. When they get cooled 
               <br />
               down after the present contest, returnto their 
               <br />
               almost desolated homes again, and see the 
               <br />
               vacancies that have been caused. and when 
               <br />
               their leaders count up the millions upon 
               <br />
               millions of dollars that their present war will 
               <br />
               have cost them, and the claims that will 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be'made</span> upon them for compensation, war 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">low,</span> and numerous other matters, they will 
               <br />
               feel _a very great aversion to entering upon 
               <br />
               hostilities which will bring down upon them 
               <br />
               the whole power of England. Therefore I 
               <br />
               hold that if we are going to expend money in 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               prepose to delay submitting a measure for

               fence, and go home to England to push
