               of that body in its present shape? I am 
               <br />
               sure that my hon. friend, warm as he now is 
               <br />
               in support of the scheme, could hardly have 
               <br />
               accepted such an issue. I am sure that 
               <br />
               even the present Government, backed as 
               <br />
               they are by a large majority in both branches 
               <br />
               of the Legislature, and possessing as they 
               <br />
               do a large amount of the talent,—I may 
               <br />
               say a majority of the talent—of Parliament, 
               <br />
               dare not bring such resolutions down as 
               <br />
               a Government measure and ask the Legis- 
               <br />
               lature to support them in carrying it through. 
               <br />
               Then my hon. friend thought that the scheme 
               <br />
               had gone through the length and breadth of 
               <br />
               the land. Hon. gentlemen, it is quite true 
               <br />
               that the resolutions have gone through the 
               <br />
               length and breadth of the land; but where 
               <br />
               has there been that discussion in Canada 
               <br />
               to which resolutions of so much importance 
               <br />
               are entitled — except in Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               where I am told that ﬁfteen counties have 
               <br />
               re udiated the resolutions when they were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submitted</span> to public meetings? Andin Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, where is the single instance of 
               <br />
               discussion of the facts having taken place 
               <br />
               except in the city of Toronto, where there 
               <br />
               was little or no discussion, and where it was 
               <br />
               promised that that city, like Quebec, should 
               <br />
               be made the seat of one of the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments? I understood my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Erie Division to take issue on the fact that 
               <br />
               the delegates to the Conference were not 
               <br />
               self-elected, and I heard my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Montreal deny it also. But if you take 
               <br />
               up a copy of the resolutions and the des- 
               <br />
               patches accompanying them. you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that they were in every sense of the word 
               <br />
               self-elected. And if they were not self- 
               <br />
               elected, who deputed them to come and do 
               <br />
               what they have done? Did the basis on 
               <br />
               which the Government was formed authorize 
               <br />
               them to enter into this compact? The basis 
               <br />
               on which the Government was formed speaks 
               <br />
               for itself. The measure they promised 
               <br />
               the people of Upper Canada was simply a 
               <br />
               measure to settle the existing diﬁculties 
               <br />
               between Upper and Lower Canada. They 
               <br />
               were to form Upper and Lower Canada into 
               <br />
               a Federation upon such a basis as would here- 
               <br />
               after allow the other provinces, if agreeable, 
               <br />
               and if they could agree as to terms, to also 
               <br />
               enter the Federation. These are the bases 
               <br />
               on which the present Government was form- 
               <br />
               ed, and these are the bases on which the 
               <br />
               members of that Government went to the 
               <br />
               country and asked for the support of their 
               <br />
               constituents. And to bear me out in this

               assertion, I have only to read the language

               You will ﬁnd it in the latter part of the 
               <br />
               Speech. His Excellency says :—“The time 
               <br />
               has arrived when the constitutional question, 
               <br />
               which has for many years agitated this prov- 
               <br />
               ince, is ripe for settlement.” What prov- 
               <br />
               ince is alluded to in this aragraph ? Most 
               <br />
               certainly the rovinco 0 Canada. " It is 
               <br />
               my intention, ’ proceeds His Excellency, 
               <br />
               “ during the approaching recess, to endeavor 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> devise a plan for this purpose, which will 
               <br />
               be laid before Parliament at its next meet- 
               <br />
               ing.” Hon. gentlemen, where is that plan ? 
               <br />
               Where is the measure so promised in the 
               <br />
               Speech from the Throne.’ “ In releasing you 
               <br />
               from further attendance,” His Excellency 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">glclles</span> on to say, “I would impress upon you 
               <br />
               t e importance of using the inﬂuence which 
               <br />
               the conﬁdence of your fellow subjects con- 
               <br />
               fers upon you to secure for any scheme which 
               <br />
               may be prepared with this object a calm and 
               <br />
               impartial consideration both in Parliament 
               <br />
               and throughout the country.” Now, what 
               <br />
               does this mean? If it means anything, 
               <br />
               it means this, that the Government pro- 
               <br />
               mised to bring down a measure to this 
               <br />
               Legislature to enable us to ConfederateUpper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada. “Well,” hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               say, “ they have brought down a larger 
               <br />
               scheme.” Yes, but who asked them to bring 
               <br />
               down that scheme? It is said that it makes 
               <br />
               no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> which scheme was laid before 
               <br />
               the House; but I contend that it makes all 
               <br />
               the diﬁ'erence, for if these resolutions had 
               <br />
               reference simpl to Upper and Lower Cana- 
               <br />
               da, they won] be susceptible of amend- 
               <br />
               ment by this House. In such a case, 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen would not have come 
               <br />
               down as we now see them shaking their 
               <br />
               resolutions in the face of the members 
               <br />
               of the Legislature, and saying, “ Here is a 
               <br />
               treaty which you must accept in its entirety 
               <br />
               or not at all." They would not be warning 
               <br />
               us at our eril to altera word or erase a line 
               <br />
               on ain 0 being branded as disuniouists. or 
               <br />
               per aps something worse than that. Had 
               <br />
               they brought down the resolutions they were 
               <br />
               pledged to bring down, we would be sitting 
               <br />
               here calmly and dispassionately, aided by 
               <br />
               the Government of the day, framing a 
               <br />
               measure which would be in very deed for 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of the two provinces. But why 
               <br />
               do the Government seek to shelter them- 
               <br />
