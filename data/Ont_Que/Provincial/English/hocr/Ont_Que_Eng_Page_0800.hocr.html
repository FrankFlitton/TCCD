               Ma. REMILLARD said—Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spams,</span> 
               <br />
               the question of a Federal union of the 
               <br />
               British North American Provinces is one 
               <br />
               of such importance, that at the present 
               <br />
               time it is engaging the attention, not only 
               <br />
               of this honorable House, but also of the 
               <br />
               whole political world. I consider, there- 
               <br />
               fore, that it is the duty of those to whom it 
               <br />
               is submitted to express, each in his own way, 
               <br />
               the reasons which induce them to adopt or 
               <br />
               reject the union in question. When for 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst.</span> time, in the year 1861, the county 
               <br />
               of Bellechasse did me the honor to send me 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               -.slightest idea that I should be called upon, 
               <br />
               .in the. beginning of 1865, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take—part</span> in 
               <br />
               the discussion of such a measure, upon 
               <br />
               which, in my Opinion, our whole .future 
               <br />
               depends. So rapid, however, is the growth 
               <br />
               of events in this age of progress of every 
               <br />
               kind, that there is no reason to besurprisod 
               <br />
               that we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> called upon to grapple 
               <br />
               with the subject of the political position of 
               <br />
               our youthful .country. I am prepared at 
               <br />
               once to acknowledge, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
               <br />
               that position has not for several years past 
               <br />
               appeared to me to be an enviable one; and 
               <br />
               in fact what has the political aspect been? 
               <br />
               Within the precincts of this House we have 
               <br />
               looked upon scenes that are to be regretted 
               <br />
               and that were of frequent occurrence. We 
               <br />
               have looked upon bitter‘and incessant strife 
               <br />
               between our public men on the subject of 
               <br />
               certain sectional diﬁculties, which should 
               <br />
               be settled in a friendly way, if it is our‘ wish 
               <br />
               at a later period to avoid serious troubles. 
               <br />
               We have seen Ministries succeed each other 
               <br />
               at intervals of hardly six months—Ministries 
               <br />
               which were daily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accused,</span> and in many cases 
               <br />
               with good reason, of having been guilty of 
               <br />
               acts of corruption in order to prolong their 
               <br />
               feeble existence. Without these precincts we 
               <br />
               have seen public journals ﬁlled with personal 
               <br />
               attacks and insults of every kind, general 
               <br />
               elections every year, carried in many coun- 
               <br />
               ties by means ot’ fraud, and the fomenting of 
               <br />
               wretched prejudices. (Hear, hear.) To 
               <br />
               such a degree had this been carried, that the 
               <br />
               people had come to consider it a highly me- 
               <br />
               ritorious action to calumniate a member or a 
               <br />
               candidate, and to deprive him of that good 
               <br />
               character which he had, in some cases, 
               <br />
               acquired by many and great sacriﬁces.

               mously declared that “ the best interests and
