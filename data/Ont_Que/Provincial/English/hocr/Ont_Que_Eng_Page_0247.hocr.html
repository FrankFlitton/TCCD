               But it does appear to me, honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men, that inasmuch as there are ﬁve different 
               <br />
               legislatures to take those resolutions into con- 
               <br />
               sideration, if any one branch of either of those 
               <br />
               lcgislatures should be able to suggest any im- 
               <br />
               provements, and the resolutions should be 
               <br />
               changed before their adoption by that branch, 
               <br />
               such a step would not defeat the whole scheme. 
               <br />
               It would be only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂering</span> so many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestions</span> 
               <br />
               on the part of the representatives of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple. Of course any alterations suggested in 
               <br />
               this manner, would go before the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament as a basis upon which to con- 
               <br />
               struct an Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Union.</span> It would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span> 
               <br />
               the Imperial Parliament an opportunity 
               <br />
               of knowing the people’s sentiments, and 
               <br />
               would not in any way really interfere 
               <br />
               with the roposed union being carried out. 
               <br />
               Therefore think that any amendment that 
               <br />
               may be made in this branch of the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture, or in the other branch, or in either of 
               <br />
               the branches of the legislatures of the Mari- 
               <br />
               time Provinces, would only go before the Im- 
               <br />
               perial Parliament as so many suggestions that 
               <br />
               might very properly be considered by the Im- 
               <br />
               perial authorities in dealing with so very im- 
               <br />
               portant a subject. Now, admitting, as I do 
               <br />
               admit, that the gentlemen who constituted 
               <br />
               the delegation from Canada in the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, were the ﬁrst men of our land—I be- 
               <br />
               lieve men of patriotism, and who desired to 
               <br />
               do only that which was for the best interests 
               <br />
               of the country—still they are not infallible. 
               <br />
               They may have made mistakes, and may have 
               <br />
               omitted some things that, even if they were 
               <br />
               again to go into conference after six months 
               <br />
               had elapsed, might be placed in the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions that would |very much improve them. 
               <br />
               My honorable friend from Peel has stated 
               <br />
               that although he approved of most of the 
               <br />
               resolutions, he desrred to see amendments 
               <br />
               made, but inasmuch as he saw their intro- 
               <br />
               duction by this House would be fatal to the 
               <br />
               whole measure, he would take the whole as 
               <br />
               it stood. I disagree with that honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman, and with the position taken by 
               <br />
               the honorable gentlemen representing the 
               <br />
               Government in this House. I think it is a 
               <br />
               mistake, and it is insulting to both the House 
               <br />
               and the country to suppose that, because a 
               <br />
               certain number of men met together and de- 
               <br />
               liberated for ﬁfteen or eighteen days, there 
               <br />
               should be no improvement made upon the 
               <br />
               result of their deliberations. Now, hon- 
               <br />
               orable ntlemen, I am one of those who, if 
               <br />
               I can convinced that a Federal union is

               to refer, and in doing so I might remark that 
               <br />
               I am aware that this is looking at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">darkest</span> 
               <br />
               side of the picture. I think that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engraft.</span> 
               <br />
               ing of this system of government upon the 
               <br />
               British Constitution has a tendency to at 
               <br />
               least introduce the republican system. It is 
               <br />
               republican so far as it goes, and that is an- 
               <br />
               other reason why I do not approve of it. If 
               <br />
               we commence to adopt the republican system, 
               <br />
               we shall perhaps get the idea of continuing 
               <br />
               the system until we go too far. It is also 
               <br />
               said that we are to have a new nationality. 
               <br />
               I do not understand that term, honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen. If we were going to have an in- 
               <br />
               dependent sovereignty in this country, then I 
               <br />
               could understand it. I believe honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen will agree with me, that after this 
               <br />
               scheme is fully carried into operation, we shall 
               <br />
               still be colonies.
