               or Helvetic Confederacy existed from the 
               <br />
               twelfth century. In 1474 LOUIS XI. of France 
               <br />
               endeavored to subdue it, but lost his trouble. 
               <br />
               In 1477 CHARLES THE BOLD of B ndy

               lost his kingdom and life while foolishly assail-

               <br />
               Switzerland became the Helvetian Republic.

               <br />
               them. In virtue of the Federal Act signed 
               <br />
               at Zurich in 1815, important amendments 
               <br />
               were made in their Constitution. The pur- 
               <br />
               pose of the Helvetian Confederation is the 
               <br />
               protection of the country against foreigners, 
               <br />
               the maintenance of peace and tranquility at 
               <br />
               home, the preservation of public liberty in the 
               <br />
               Confederation, and the increase of its general 
               <br />
               prosperity. This Confederation has survived 
               <br />
               two European revolutions, without mentioning 
               <br />
               internal troubles, and it is now ﬁfty years 
               <br />
               old. We must bear in mind that a popula- 
               <br />
               tion the meet various, the most mixed in 
               <br />
               point of origin, language and religion, lives 
               <br />
               under this Constitution. The people number 
               <br />
               about two millions and a half; about one 
               <br />
               and two-thirds of a million speak Ger- 
               <br />
               man, half a million speak French, and the 
               <br />
               remainder Italian and other languages. One 
               <br />
               half of the population is Catholic, the other 
               <br />
               Protestant. Their interests arising from 
               <br />
               locality, race and faith, are as complicated and 
               <br />
               as various as are their manners, langua and 
               <br />
               customs, and yet they all are free, all live ee- 
               <br />
               curely, respected, happy and prosperous. They 
               <br />
               all enjoy the greatest and the purest liberty.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> are twenty-two Cantons, and what is

               <br />
               It seems to me that we could ﬁnd no perfect

               and complete protection otherwise than by s 
               <br />
               Confederation of this nature, inasmuch as it 
               <br />
               is a union based on equity towards the inhabi- 
               <br />
               tants of the ﬁve provinces as its most vital 
               <br />
               and fundamental principle. As to the Con- 
               <br />
               federation of the United States, I shall merely 
               <br />
               name them. Every one knows that in 1776, 
               <br />
               when the thirteen colonies revolted against 
               <br />
               England, they believed that the only means 
               <br />
               of securing internal prosperity and of de- 
               <br />
               fending themselves against the common 
               <br />
               enemy, was to unite together for their mu- 
               <br />
               tual protection ; clearly perceiving that 
               <br />
               if they remained separate, and without any 
               <br />
               bond of union, as the uncalcnlating o 
               <br />
               nents of the present plan of Confederation 
               <br />
               would wish the Provinces of British North 
               <br />
               America to remain, their defeat was certain, 
               <br />
               and instead of coming victorioust out of the 
               <br />
               struggle, they would be easily con uered. I 
               <br />
               shall now, Mr. SPEAKER, ask to allowed 
               <br />
               to say a few words on the other confedera- 
               <br />
               tions which have existed on the continent of 
               <br />
               America. In the ﬁrst place I shall mention 
               <br />
               that of Central America, or Guatimala. That 
               <br />
               Confederation was situated on‘ the shores of 
               <br />
               the Paciﬁc Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. 
               <br />
               It consisted of ﬁve states-Guatimala, Hon- 
               <br />
               duras, San Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa 
               <br />
               Rica. These states were peopled <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">byJCreoles,</span>
