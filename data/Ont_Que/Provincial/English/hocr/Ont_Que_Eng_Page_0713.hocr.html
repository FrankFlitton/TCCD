               ation, but what do those petitions amount 
               <br />
               to? The way in which they were covered 
               <br />
               with signatures is well known. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I shall here cite an anecdote relating to 
               <br />
               the parliamentary history of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               at a period shortly before the Union. A 
               <br />
               member was talking a great deal about peti- 
               <br />
               tions in a debate upon a bill. “ Petitions !” 
               <br />
               said his opponent, “ I will undertake within 
               <br />
               afortuight to present a petition to this House 
               <br />
               praying that you may be hanged, and which 
               <br />
               shall be covered with good and valid signa- 
               <br />
               turesl” The challenge was acceptel, and 
               <br />
               at the end of three weeks the petition arri- 
               <br />
               ved, praying for the hanging of the man who 
               <br />
               had so much faith in the virtue of petitions! 
               <br />
               How had it been obtained ? By posting at 
               <br />
               a tavern situated at four cross-roads a skilful 
               <br />
               and knowing agent, who incessantly said to 
               <br />
               the frequenters of the tavern—“Do you like 
               <br />
               good r0ads ?" " Yes.” “ Well, then, sign 
               <br />
               this petition.” All signed, without reading 
               <br />
               it. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Exactly 
               <br />
               in this manner were obtained most of the 
               <br />
               signatures against Confederation. At Mont- 
               <br />
               real, agents went from tavern to tavern and 
               <br />
               induced all who were there to sign, or signed 
               <br />
               for those who resided in the vicinity without 
               <br />
               even consulting them. (Hear, hear.) Have 
               <br />
               we not also seen petitions coming from coun- 
               <br />
               ties in which the Opposition were not even 
               <br />
               able to ﬁnd candidates? They may easily 
               <br />
               obtain signatures of this description, and by 
               <br />
               this means; but that does not constitute an 
               <br />
               expression of the opinion cf Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               and those petitions will not carry elections. 
               <br />
               The hon. member ought to know something 
               <br />
               about it, he who was in power at the time of 
               <br />
               the last general election. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               lle endeavored to explain away his contra- 
               <br />
               dictions by saying that he had never been 
               <br />
               in favor of the Confederation of all the pro- 
               <br />
               vinccs. I did not state that he was in favor 
               <br />
               of this Confederation of all the provinces ; I 
               <br />
               only said that he was willing, as a member 
               <br />
               of the BROWN-DORION Government, in 
               <br />
               1858, to have representation based on popu- 
               <br />
               lation, with checks, guarantees and assur- 
               <br />
               ances; that then, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1&amp;59,</span> he proposed as an 
               <br />
               alternative to that measure, in his Montreal 
               <br />
               manifesto, Confederation of the two Canadas ; 
               <br />
               and then, in 1860-’61 he was ready to 
               <br />
               accept any possible change, even Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion of all British North America. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) To prove that he was in favor of 
               <br />
               Confederation of all the provinces, I quoted 
               <br />
               one of his speeches, in which he said, on the
