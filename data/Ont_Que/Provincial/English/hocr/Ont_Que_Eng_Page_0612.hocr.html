               1854, has fallen in ten years to 8,000 only for

               Upper Canada, whilst in Lower Canada we 
               <br />
               have increased, by natural progress, in the 
               <br />
               proportion of from 2.20 per cent. to 2.60 per 
               <br />
               cent. during the same period. And it is just at 
               <br />
               the time that-our population is increasing in 
               <br />

               Upper Canada representation based on popu- 
               <br />
               lation. Why do we not still resist ? We 
               <br />
               are told that if we wait longer the dispro- 
               <br />
               portion will be increased. I maintain, ac- 
               <br />

               of other considerations that I shall by and 
               <br />
               by have the honor to submit to this House, 
               <br />
               that we can only be the gainers in this matter, 
               <br />
               because the proportion of our natural increase 
               <br />
               is increasing, while that of immigration is 
               <br />
               diminishing. In thirty years, from 1829 to 
               <br />
               1860, 942,735 immigrants landed op our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shores,</span> nearly all of whom settled in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. And there is another fact to which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> beg to call the attention of the House, and 
               <br />
               that is, that the Irish emigration, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> 
               <br />
               amounted in 1851 to 22,381, diminished dur- 
               <br />
               ing the ten following years to 376 in 1861, 
               <br />
               and it is a well known fact that it was this 
               <br />
               wholesale deportation from the Emerald Isle 
               <br />
               which has made the population of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada what it is to-day. But it is not no- 
               <br />
               cessary to consult the census to arrive at the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the proportionate difference in 
               <br />
               the increase of the populations of the two 
               <br />
               sections of the province is only due to the 
               <br />
               arrival in the country of this million of immi- 
               <br />
               grants. If we study the proportion of births, 
               <br />
               or of the natural increase, we shall see that 
               <br />
               Lower Canada has increased its population 
               <br />
               more rapidly than Upper Canada, and that 
               <br />
               there are more births in proportion in our 
               <br />
               section of the province. As these artiﬁcial 
               <br />
               sources of increase diminish in Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               we may be certain that the equililbrium will 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established</span> between the two populations. 
               <br />
               There is yet another cause which must con- 
               <br />
               tribute to reestablish this equilibrium, and I

               <br />
               may be found in the important fact that the 
               <br />
               best <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposable</span> lands are nearly exhausted—I 
               <br />
               do not mean to say that they have lost their

               We require no better proof of my assertion

               than the report of the Honorable Commis-

               It will be observed that the whole quantity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               land sold during the past year is less by 252,471 
               <br />
               acres than in 1861. The falling off is equal to 
               <br />
               about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">385</span> per cent. The fact is signiﬁcant, and 
               <br />
               suggests en uiry as to the cause. It may, I think, 
               <br />
               he attribute to the commercial and monetary de— 
               <br />
               rangements resulting from the civil war in the 
               <br />
               neighboring country; to the retarding influence 
               <br />
               of that war upon immigration, and to the dimin- 
               <br />
               ished means of purchasers within the country by 
               <br />
               reason of the generally deﬁcient harvest of 1862. 
               <br />
               Another cause ma be mentioned, which, inan 
               <br />
               oﬂicial view, is more important than either of 
               <br />
               these, because its inﬂuence is not accidental or 
               <br />
               temporary. It is the fact that the best lands of 
               <br />
               the Crown in both sections of the province have 
               <br />
               already been sold. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quantity</span> of really good 
               <br />
               land now open for sale is, notwithstanding recent 
               <br />
               surveys, much less than formerly, and is rapidly 
               <br />
               diminishing. The new surveys in Upper Canada 
               <br />
               have added, during the last ﬁve years, no less 
               <br />
               than 2,808,172 acres to the land roll of the de- 
               <br />
               partment. The addition during the same period, 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada, was 1,968,163 acres. Yet it 
               <br />
               may be doubted if there are to-day as many acres 
               <br />
               of wild land of the ﬁrst quality at the disposal of 
               <br />
               the department as there were in 1857. The cler- 
               <br />
               gy, school and Crown lands of the western penin- 
               <br />
               sula, the most desirable, both as to quality and 
               <br />
               situation, of all the public lands of the province, 
               <br />
               are mostly sold; the few lots that remain are gen- 
               <br />
               erally of inferior quality. The new townships 
               <br />
               between the Ottawa and Lake Huron contain 
               <br />
               much good land, but they are separated from the 
               <br />
               settled townships on the St. Lawrence and north 
               <br />
               shore of Lake Ontario by a rocky, barren tract, 
               <br />
               which varies in width from ten to twenty miles, 
               <br />
               and presents a serious obstruction to the inﬂux of 
               <br />
               settlers. Moreover, the good land in these new 
               <br />
               townships is composed of small tracts, here and 
               <br />
               there, separated from each other by rocky ridges, 
               <br />
               swamps and lakes, which render difﬁcult the con- 
               <br />
               struction of roads, and interrupt the continuity 
               <br />
               of settlement. These unfavorable circumstances 
               <br />
               have induced the better class of settlers in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada to seek, at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hands</span> of private owners,
