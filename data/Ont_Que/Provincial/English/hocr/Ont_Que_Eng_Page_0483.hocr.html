               MB. MoGIVERIN—As I know the hon- 
               <br />
               orable member for Brome (Mr. DUNKIN) is 
               <br />
               unwell, I am willing the relieve him by taking 
               <br />
               the ﬂoor. At the same time, I rise with 
               <br />
               much difn'denee to make the few remarks I 
               <br />
               intend to offer on this occasion, after the able 
               <br />
               and eloquent speech to which we have just 
               <br />
               listened. But, although I may not be able, 
               <br />
               perhaps, to place before this House any views 
               <br />
               on this subject which have not already been 
               <br />
               ably placed before the House and the country 
               <br />
               by honorable ntlemeu who have preceded 
               <br />
               me, still I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeîeI</span> would be wanting in my 
               <br />
               duty to my constituents were I not to explain 
               <br />
               the reasons which induce me to take the course 
               <br />
               which I pro to take with reference to this 
               <br />
               question. he subject is certainly a very 
               <br />
               important one, and, from the momentous 
               <br />
               character of the interests involved in this 
               <br />
               proposed change of our Constitution, deserves 
               <br />
               the earnest attention of every true Canadian. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) In the ﬁrst place, I feel some 
               <br />
               explanation should be given of the reasons 
               <br />
               which have induced myself, in common with 
               <br />
               a large number of the liberal members of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, to take the course we have 
               <br />
               seen ﬁt to take with reference to the present 
               <br />
               Government, and the policy they have laid 
               <br />
               before the country. In Upper Canada—I 
               <br />
               believe in almost every constituency—there 
               <br />
               has long been an agitation having reference 
               <br />
               to the sectional difﬁculties between Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. This agitation, instead of 
               <br />
               diminishing, has continued to gather strength. 
               <br />
               Ever since the union of 1841, Western Can- 
               <br />
               ada has felt—and I think justly felt—that it 
               <br />
               did not receive that justice to which its wealth 
               <br />
               and pepulation entitled it. On the other 
               <br />
               hand, the French pepulatiou of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               believed, or professed to believe, that an in- 
               <br />
               creased representation of Upper Canada in 
               <br />
               the Legislature would tend to destroy their 
               <br />
               language, their laws, and their religion. The 
               <br />
               difﬁcult position into which we were brought 
               <br />
               by this antagonism was such, that when the 
               <br />
               proposition came from the Government that 
               <br />
               the Honorable the President of the Council 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. BROWN) should unite with them 
               <br />
               to see if some means could not be devised by 
               <br />
               which these unfortunate sectional diﬂiculties 
               <br />
               might be arranged, I felt it my duty—how- 
               <br />
               ever unpleasant, however strange it may have 
               <br />
               seemed that we should alienate ourselves from 
               <br />
               the liberal section of Lower Canada—yet, 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that some change was necessary in 
               <br />
               the management of the public affairs of this 
               <br />
               country, l felt it my duty, as an Upper Can- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Upper Canada at least—I may say of Canada 
               <br />
               generally—have become tired of the strife in 
               <br />
               which we have been involved for many years, 
               <br />
               and which has put a step to that practical 
               <br />
               and useful legislation which the country- re- 
               <br />
               uired for the development of its resources. 
               <br />
               believe the people of this country, in conse- 
               <br />
               quence of the position in which we found our- 
               <br />
               selves, had become earnestly desirous of a 
               <br />
               change; but the change they looked to was 
               <br />
               not in the direction of a union with the United 
               <br />
               States. (Hear, hear.) The change they 
               <br />
               looked for was in the direction of a union 
               <br />
               with the other British provinces; one which 
               <br />
               should embrace—I hope at no distant day— 
               <br />
               the British colonies on the far Paciﬁc coast, 
               <br />
               as well as those to the east of us, bordering 
               <br />
               on the Atlantic. Hear, hear.) I believe 
               <br />
               that this scheme o union now proposed— 
               <br />
               though I feel that it has many imperfections 
               <br />
               -—is still a step in the right direction. It is 
               <br />
               perfectly impossible that the people of this 
               <br />
               country should be satisﬁed to remain in the 
               <br />
               agitated state, politically, in which they have 
               <br />
               hitherto been, and which might ultimately 
               <br />
               land them in difﬁculties, for which no other 
               <br />
               solution could be found than that to which 
               <br />
               our neighbors on the other side of the line 
               <br />
               have unfortunately been compelled to resort. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The honorable member for 
               <br />
               Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DOBION) truly said, so 
               <br />
               long ago as 1858, that the country was then 
               <br />
               almost verging on revolution, and that a 
               <br />
               change was necessary. The necessity for such 
               <br />
               a change, instead of diminishing since, has 
               <br />
               increased. (Hear, hear.) As far as I have 
               <br />
               been able to ascertain-the feelings of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">memo</span> 
               <br />
               bers of this House, I have not as yet under- 
               <br />
               stood one honorable gentleman to state that 
               <br />
               he was opposed to a union with the other 
               <br />
               provinces. Even the honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               who has preceded me has stated that he advo- 
               <br />
               cates such a union, and believes it would be 
               <br />
               beneﬁcial to this country; only he did not like 
               <br />
               the manner and the details of the present 
               <br />
               scheme. But, while he and other honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen have condemned that scheme of 
               <br />
               union which is now submitted to the House, 
               <br />
               While professing to be in favor of union in the 
               <br />
               abstract, I have as yet failed to ﬁnd one of 
               <br />
               them offering anything as an improvement 
               <br />
               upon it. Hear, hear. 
               <br />
               HON. a. BOLTON—We have a right 
               <br />
               to amend this scheme.
