               <br />
               I complain of. We are to change our dis-

               tricts for purposes of representation in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               we like. These subdivisions of our provinces

               for representation in the Federal Parliament 
               <br />
               we are, at each of these decennial periods, to 
               <br />
               have a general readjustment of the whole 
               <br />
               country, so as to divide each province anew 
               <br />
               into its due number of aliquot parts. This 
               <br />
               is an innovation on our usages, greatly for 
               <br />
               the worse. It goes to destroy that character 
               <br />
               of reality, convenience and stability which— 
               <br />
               if our system, as awhole, is to have such 
               <br />
               character—had need be maintained to the 
               <br />
               utmost extent practicable, in respect of our 
               <br />
               constituencies and of our minor territo- 
               <br />
               rial delimitations generally. This changing 
               <br />
               every ten years brings together electors who 
               <br />
               have not been in the habit of acting with 
               <br />
               each other. In England they do nothing of 
               <br />
               this sort; they do not change their limits 
               <br />
               lightly. The several bodies of men who 
               <br />
               send representatives to the Imperial House 
               <br />
               of Commons have the habit ot so coming 
               <br />
               together, as bodies not likely to be broken 
               <br />
               up. We ought to keep this as an element 
               <br />
               of our Constitution, but it is carefully elimi- 
               <br />
               nated from it.

               _ HON. Mn. MoDOUGALL—I am sure 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman does not wish to 
               <br />
               build up an argument on a misconception of 
               <br />

               sentation. I am sure that he must have 
               <br />
               observed this fact, that it may, and probably 
               <br />
               will often happen, that there will be no 
               <br />
               change as to the number of members or 
               <br />
               electoral districts, and there certainly will 
               <br />
               be none if the increase of population in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada keeps pace with that in Up— 
               <br />

               there will be a very much more rapid rate 
               <br />
               of increase in some provinces than in others; 
               <br />
               a divergence between them in this respect, 
               <br />
               of the same kind, and perhaps, even to the 
               <br />
               same degree as in the case of the United 
               <br />
               States. There, in the old states, at every 
               <br />
               decennial revision, the number of represen— 
               <br />
               tatives lessens, and in the new states it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               creases, and that rapidly. It is only in the 
               <br />
               comparatively few states which may be said to 
               <br />
               be neither old nor new that it remains about the 
               <br />
               same. The rule is one of change, for the 
               <br />
               country everywhere. Any escape from change 
               <br />
               is the exception. And with us, those provinces 
               <br />
               which shall be found to increase faster than 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, as some certainly will be, 
               <br />
               will re-divide their whole territory every ten 
               <br />
               years, in order to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increase</span> their number of 
               <br />
               districts; and those which increase slower 
               <br />
               will do the same, in order to cut some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">06‘.</span> 
               <br />
               Even Lower Canada, to meet the varying 
               <br />
               rates of increase of its several parts, will be 
               <br />
               drawn into doing the same sort of thing. I 
               <br />
               shall be told, no doubt, that this need not 
               <br />
               be—that mere partial changes here and there 
               <br />
               may be made to answer the end; but I know 
               <br />
               that in the nature of things it will be, that 
               <br />
               such partial changes will not be made the 
               <br />
               rule. The sweeping rule is laid down, in the 
               <br />
               abstract, of basing representation on mere 
               <br />
               population; and that rule is sure to be fol- 
               <br />
               lowed out—not only as between the several 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces,</span> but also as within each ; and 
               <br />
               ere again, not only as for Federal, but also 
               <br />
               as for provincial legislation. For all legis- 
               <br />
               lative purposes, we must look to have all our 
               <br />
               territorial divisions open to frequent, one 
               <br />
               might say perpetual, reconstruction ; and 
               <br />
               this subject perpetually to the disturbing 
               <br />
               inﬂuences of the party warfare of the hour. 
               <br />
               The exigencies ot that warfare, we may be 
               <br />
               sure, will tell ; and whatever the party in the 
               <br />
               ascendant, whether in the country at large 
               <br />
               or locally, will ﬁnd means in this part of our 
               <br />
               machinery for advancing its ends—means not 
               <br />
               quite of the sort to commend themselves to 
               <br />
               one’s approval. (Hear, hear.) It is claimed, 
               <br />
               I know, as a merit of this scheme, that it 
               <br />
               allows a ﬁve years’ term to our House of 
               <br />
               Commons, in place of the two years’ term 
               <br />
               ﬁxed for the House of Representatives. 
               <br />
               Apart from these decennial revisions, I would 
               <br />
               be glad of this. But ﬁve is the half of ten, I 
               <br />
               think; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> though ourHouses of Commons may 
               <br />
               often not last their full term,there will yet sel-

               dom or never, in all probability, be more than 
               <br />
               either two or three general elections held 
               <br />
               between any two decennial revisions. A less
