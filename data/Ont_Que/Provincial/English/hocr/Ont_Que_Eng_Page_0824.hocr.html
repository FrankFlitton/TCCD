               this debate, by honorable gentlemen who 
               <br />
               were delegates to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference</span> held in 
               <br />
               this city, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tw‘</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Schemes</span> were dis- 
               <br />
               cussed in that Conference—the Legislative 
               <br />
               and the Federal—and that the former was 
               <br />
               found to be impracticable. It is, therefore, 
               <br />
               not possible for us now to decide the question 
               <br />
               in favor of a legislative union. We have 
               <br />
               evidence before us that is satisfactory to my 
               <br />
               mind, that probably all of the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refuse</span> to take part in a legisla- 
               <br />
               tive union. The Honorable Attorney General 
               <br />
               West, in.his speech at the opening of the 
               <br />
               debate, gave us suﬁicient information on the 
               <br />
               point to convince the House that this ques- 
               <br />
               tion had been fully discussed in the Confer- 
               <br />
               ence, and the legislative plan rejected, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> 
               <br />
               account of its being impracticable. For this 
               <br />
               reason, sir, believing that the choice before 
               <br />
               us is either to accept a Federal union or reject 
               <br />
               the proposal entirely,l give my assent to 
               <br />
               the present scheme without hesitation. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It is brought as one of the 
               <br />
               strongest arguments against this union 
               <br />
               that the Federal Government will be far 
               <br />
               more expensive than our present sys- 
               <br />
               tem. That may be true to some extent; 
               <br />
               but my impression is that it will not be 
               <br />
               found true to the extent represented. We 
               <br />
               must bear in mind that we have in each 
               <br />
               province a Government fully constituted, 
               <br />
               with all the machinery necessary for carry- 
               <br />
               ing on the business of government. Therefore 
               <br />
               the new machinery required would be very 
               <br />
               little, and would amount simply to the local

               of this scheme that commends itself strongly

               boring republic. I believe that to a great

               doctrine of state rights. Instead of their 
               <br />
               Central Government having, in the ﬁrst in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tain powers to the local or state governments, 
               <br />
               the very reverse is the principle on which 
               <br />
               their Constitution is founded. Their local 
               <br />
               governments possess the principal power, 
               <br />
               and have delegated certain powers to the
