               <br />
               1859, he was deeply convinced that nothing

               but representation by population or a Federal 
               <br />

               storm then lowering on the horizon. We ﬁnd 
               <br />
               therein, ﬁrstly, that we were rapidly reaching 
               <br />
               a state of things which would necessitate mod- 
               <br />
               iﬁcations in the relations between Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada; secondly, that the proposal to 
               <br />
               form a Federation of the Canadas was not 
               <br />

               <br />

               government of an immense territory, inhabited 
               <br />
               by people of different origin, belief, laws and 
               <br />
               customs, had suggested the idea; fourthly, 
               <br />
               that Lower Canada would not have any legi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               upon population if it refused a written Consti- 
               <br />
               tution, under which it would have protection 
               <br />
               for and control of its institutions; ﬁfthly, 
               <br />
