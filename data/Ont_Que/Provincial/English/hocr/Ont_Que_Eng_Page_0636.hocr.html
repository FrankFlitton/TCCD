               <br />
               The Isle of France, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequence</span> of its iso-

               lated position, is precisely m circumstances

               which allow of our forming an opinion of what 
               <br />
               the pretended liberties of the colonial system 
               <br />
               are worth when there is nothing to fear from 
               <br />
               the weakness of the colonists or the interven- 
               <br />
               tion of a neighboring power in favor of the 
               <br />
               oppressed. Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, we have a 
               <br />
               splendid opportunity of judging whether the 
               <br />
               colonial system, applied under such circum- 
               <br />
               stances, possesses that liberal character which 
               <br />
               is attributed to it. Well, I say it with regret, 
               <br />
               we see there, as we saw in Canada, the same 
               <br />
               aggressive and tyrannical licy against which 
               <br />
               we had to strive for a w ole century. The 
               <br />
               colonial system gave rise here to deep dissa- 
               <br />
               tisfaction. I shall enumerate the grievances 
               <br />
               which are complained of, grievances for which 
               <br />
               there is but too great foundation. When the 
               <br />
               Isle of France was ceded to England, it was 
               <br />
               stipulated, as in the case of Canada, that the 
               <br />
               French population should retain the use <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               their language and their religious institutions, 
               <br />
               together with the laws under which they had 
               <br />
               up to that time been governed—three liber- 
               <br />
               ties of great value to the descendants of old 
               <br />
               France. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, we shall now 
               <br />
               see whether England respected these three 
               <br />
               articles of the treaty. I hold in my hand a 
               <br />
               correspondence of no older date than the 6th 
               <br />
               May, 1862. It is written by a French col- 
               <br />
               onist in the Mauritius, and contains an ac- 
               <br />
               count of the colonial system under which his 
               <br />
               countrymen are governed. Before reading 
               <br />
               this correspondence, I must premise that the 
               <br />
               population of the island consists of two hun- 
               <br />
               dred thousand souls; that population is gov- 
               <br />
               erned by an Executive Council and a Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Council appointed for life, consisting of 
               <br />
               eighteen members, eight of whom are public 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers appointed and paid by the Government 
               <br />
               of the colony. The other ten are nearly all of 
               <br />
               English origin. Thus the French element in 
               <br />
               the Legislative Council of the Mauritius is in 
               <br />
               the proportion of about one to ﬁve, although 
               <br />
               the population is nearly entirely French :—
