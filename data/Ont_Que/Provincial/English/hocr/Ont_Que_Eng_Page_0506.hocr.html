               HON. A'r'rv. GEN. CARTIER—It is said

               the world was made by a series of accidents. 
               <br />
               Ma. DUNKIN—I dare say some people 
               <br />
               think so ; and it may be so according to the 
               <br />
               theology of my hon. friend, but not according 
               <br />
               to mine. I repeat, what has happened since 
               <br />
               has been tolerably unexpected, even by the 
               <br />
               actors in those'occurrences. I do not believe 
               <br />
               they were expected by anybody; and none, 
               <br />
               Ifaucy, have been more surprised at them 
               <br />
               than the very men who now take all the 
               <br />
               advantage pessible of them, and even the 
               <br />
               credit 0 having brought them about. And 
               <br />
               how, Mr. SPEAKER, was this scheme pre- 
               <br />
               sented to the public? Piecemeal, and with 
               <br />
               reticences innumerable ; in a way that made 
               <br />
               it hardly possible to criticise it in any of its 
               <br />
               parts. When, after several members of the 
               <br />
               Government of this province and several Other 
               <br />
               members of the Conference had.gone into 
               <br />
               long explanations of it publicly at Quebec, 
               <br />
               Montreal and Toronto, the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Hochelaga came out with a criticism 
               <br />
               upon and a dissent from it. He was set 
               <br />
               upon with a clamor, to the eﬂ'ect that he 
               <br />
               ought not to have pronounced himself so 
               <br />
               soon, as the whole scheme was not yet de- 
               <br />
               veloped ! It was said he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misrepresented</span> 
               <br />
               the scheme, and ought to have waited until its 
               <br />
               details were really known before attacking it. 
               <br />
               Brought thus before the country, in piece- 
               <br />
               meal style, with some portions kept back, 
               <br />
               and others ambiguously and even contradic- 
               <br />
               torily stated, no one could seriouslytake hold 
               <br />
               of it. After some time, it is true, a printed 
               <br />
               paper, purporting to set forth the resolutions 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“folle</span> Conference, was sent round to mem- 
               <br />
               bers, but with the word “ Private” written 
               <br />
               on it, as much asto say that it was not oﬁci- 
               <br />
               ally communicated, and must be made no 
               <br />
               public use of. That that private communi- 
               <br />
               cation was not even perfectly accurate, is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now</span> perfectly well known ; but that was of 
               <br />
               httle consequence, as it could not be made 
               <br />
               use of publicly. Such is the way in which 
               <br />
               this matter was laid before the people. Every 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pessible</span> advantage was given to the people 
               <br />
               tapraise it from every point of view, and 
               <br />
               nobod got a lair opportunity of saying that 
               <br />
               he didy not like it. The praise was carefully 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span> and published, and everything that 
               <br />
               could possibly be done to prepare the public

               that the feeling they have got up in favor of 
               <br />
               this scheme is a passing feeling of momentary 
               <br />
               duration, that they cannot themselves in the 
               <br />
               leastrely upon. (Hear,hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               it is rather curious that hon. gentlemen, in 
               <br />
               recommending this scheme of theirs, seem 
               <br />
               never to be tired of speaking of its ex- 
               <br />
               cellencies in general, and of modestly 
               <br />
               eulogiziug the wisdom, and foresight, 
               <br />
               and statesmanship of those who got it up. 
               <br />
               I cannot wonder that their judgment in this 
               <br />
               behalf should be a little led astray by their 
               <br />
               surprise at the success which has so far 
               <br />
               attended their project. Their “ oﬁicious” visit 
               <br />
               to Prince Edward Island took but a very 
               <br />
               few da 3, and it resulted in the scheme of 
               <br />
               a legis tive union for the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               being (as I think, unfortunately) laid aside; 
               <br />
               and then followed the Conference at Quebec, 
               <br />
               where these twelve honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               representing Canada, and twenty-one other 
               <br />
               gentlemen representing the Lower Pro— 
               <br />
               vinces, sat together for the long period of 
               <br />
               nineteen days—seventeen working days and 
               <br />
               two Sundays—and as the result of these 
               <br />
               seventeen days of but partial work by the 
               <br />
               way, we have from these thirty-three gentle- 
               <br />
               men a scheme of a Constitution which they 
               <br />
               vaunt of as being altogether better than that 
               <br />
               of the model republic of the United States, 
               <br />
               and even than that of the model kingdom of 
               <br />
               Great Britain . Neither the model republic nor 
               <br />
               yet the model kingdom of whose glorious tra- 
               <br />
               ditions and associations we are all so proud, is 
               <br />
               for a moment to be compared with this work 
               <br />
               of theirs. (Hear, hear.) So perfect do 
               <br />
               they seem to regard their pet measure, that 
               <br />
               they tell us we must not take time to discuss 
               <br />
               it. Even though Her Majesty’s Secretary 
               <br />
               of State has told us that there are features 
               <br />
               of it that require further consideration and
