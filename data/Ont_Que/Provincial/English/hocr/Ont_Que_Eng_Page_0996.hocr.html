               There is a refreshing coolness in the demand 
               <br />
               that Canada shall pay for the construction of a 
               <br />
               road, which is professedly designed to draw away 
               <br />
               trade from its great estuary. We have been 
               <br />
               building up the navigation of the St. Lawrence at 
               <br />
               immense expense, and have had very hard work to 
               <br />
               compete with the Hudson and Erie canals. Accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the views of the late Hon. Mr. Maseru, 
               <br />
               steamship lines were alone needed to secure the 
               <br />
               object we desire. The Ministry propose, however, 
               <br />
               to withdraw the steamships from the St. Law- 
               <br />

               of suicide in Canada to take art in the scheme.

               him to coalesce with that very respectable old 
               <br />
               corruptionist who sits along side of him, and 
               <br />

               Under these circumstances, it strikes me

               that before a change so great as this is made

               change as this is made, the people sl.ould be 
               <br />
               consulted. It may be that the reasoning

               then adopted and given expression to through

               they have not, like the Hon. President of

               the Council, obtained the new light which 
               <br />
               seems to have broken in upon his mind. 
               <br />
               We are now told—no railway, no union ; but 
               <br />
               if this railway was so complete a curse 
               <br />
               that it was not to be built when we had 
               <br />
               only to contribute ﬁve-twelfths of the expense, 
               <br />
               we ought to have some greater reason given 
               <br />
               than has yet been furnished, why this union 
               <br />
               should take place, involving as it does the 
               <br />
               construction of that Intercolonial Railway, 
               <br />
               at a cost to us of ten-twelfths of the work. 
               <br />
               What great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> is there in the circum-

               stances of the country now from what there

               was then, to make up for the great mischief

               that the railway was to do if constructed two 
               <br />
               years ago ? The Honorable President of the

               Council does not choose to answer these 
               <br />
               questions. He ﬁnds that he has got an 
               <br />
               excellent body of followers in this House at 
               <br />
               the present time, who are carried away with 
               <br />
               the idea that some change is necessary, and 
               <br />
               they are prepared to run into anything where 
               <br />
               the Honorable President leads, for the sake 
               <br />
               of the novelty; for it is said that if you 
               <br />
               get a little nOVelty to tiekle the people 
               <br />
               for a season, they may be kept quiet, little 
               <br />
               heeding the storm that will come after the 
               <br />
               calm. When this House ﬁrst met, I ob- 
               <br />
               served a great many opponents to this 
               <br />
               scheme; but somehow or other the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion of a great many of them very soon 
               <br />
               subsided. Some peeple say that several 
               <br />
               hon. members had axes to grind, and they 
               <br />
               were only holding on to the handle until 
               <br />
               they were sure the edge was sharp. (Laugh- 
               <br />
               ter.) Soon after the meeting of the House, 
               <br />
               it was observed that the Hon. President of 
               <br />
               the Council had taken a trip around among 
               <br />
               them, and the next thing we knew they 
               <br />
               had wheeled right about. Mr. SPEAKER,
