               HON. MB. LETELLIER DE ST. JUST 
               <br />
               said, that if he were suﬁcientl master of 
               <br />
               English he would address the ouse in that 
               <br />
               language, but not being so would have to use 
               <br />
               the French. The diﬁculties towhich allusion 
               <br />
               had been made were produced by two causes. 
               <br />
               They were not constitutional, however, but 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alimentary,</span> and, as he believed, could have 
               <br />
               surmounted without recourse to the 
               <br />
               constitutional change which it was proposed 
               <br />
               to adept without appeal to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com.</span> It 
               <br />
               was true that diﬁculties had su ed to 
               <br />
               diﬁculties, and that legislation was stopped, 
               <br />
               but if the leaders had sought in the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture itself for the means of removing them, he 
               <br />
               believed they would have been found. Who 
               <br />
               would guarantee the Government under the 
               <br />
               new Constitution from the recurrence of similar 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">troubles?</span> There would of course be an Op- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soläition</span> as in the smaller House. If similar 
               <br />
               ' culties happened, would the Confederation 
               <br />
               seek relief in another change of Constitution. 
               <br />
               On the contrary, would not relief be sought 
               <br />
               in the means he had suggested. At any rate 
               <br />
               he did not think such a change as the union 
               <br />
               of all the British provinces was required. In 
               <br />
               1820, when a union of Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada was proposed, it was objected that if 
               <br />
               it did not work a larger union would follow, 
               <br />
               and then, lastly, a legislative union of all the 
               <br />
               vinces. Two of these steps had already

               n taken, and we were ing on with rapid 
               <br />
               strides towards the last. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁlo</span> such a case it was 
               <br />
               not hard to conceive what would be the posi- 
               <br />
               tion of Lower Canada. It was a misfortune 
               <br />
               that we had to contend with national prejudices, 
               <br />
               but it was impossible to forget them. In the 
               <br />
               event of a legislative union would the aran— 
               <br />

               federation system be found ? Would it not 
               <br />
               then be at the mercy of those they now feared ?

               <br />
               sented; we had wheat ﬁelds, mine resources, 
               <br />
               forests, rivers and lakes, but to make them 
               <br />
               available did we require an increase of terri-' 
               <br />

               <br />
               increase would be a source of weakness, not of 
               <br />
               strength. Would it not add to our already 
               <br />
               frontier, and make us more vulnerable

               <br />
               the power of England to protect us, and 
               <br />

               it would be no advantage. Then, as to Nova

               Scotia with its small population and ﬁne

               would not the harbour be equally available to

               to Confederation a legislative union of Upper

               <br />
               penses of the province, and would be more

               <br />
               the interests of the other. Then did not Con-

               federation consecrate [establish] the principle 
               <br />
               of representation according to population ? 
               <br />
               It would give larger to one of the nationalities, 
               <br />
               and, as the General Government would be able 
               <br />
               to veto the acts of the Local Government, 
               <br />
               would there be no d r to Lower Canada? 
               <br />
               If representation by population had been so 
               <br />
               much opposed in this part, it was doubtless 
               <br />
               because there was cause of fear, yet this very

               <br />

               <br />
               had failed, and the avowal had come out at 
               <br />
               last. The resolutions not being before the
