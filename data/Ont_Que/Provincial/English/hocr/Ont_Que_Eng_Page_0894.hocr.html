               highest integrity; but all do not approve of his 
               <br />
               policy, and that is perfectly legitimate. But 
               <br />
               that is no reason for attacking his private

               <br />
               honest and upright, and yet we read in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               is very unfair. (Hear, hear.) The members 
               <br />
               of the Opposition demand an appeal to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               These demands for an appeal to the peo le 
               <br />
               are only made with the view of serving t e

               purposes of a clique, who would say to those

               vote against the overnment I” This is what 
               <br />
               they have already attempted to do by means 
               <br />
               of meetings which they have caused to be 
               <br />
               held in different counties; but I must say 
               <br />
               that in mine they did not succeed in their 
               <br />
               designs. They sent three agents there, under 
               <br />
               different pretexts, who tried by every possible 
               <br />
               means to induce the people to ronounce 
               <br />
               against the Ministerial scheme; but they did 
               <br />
               not succeed; and yet I am the humblest 
               <br />
               member of this honorable House. But as I 
               <br />
               happened just at that time to be attending to 
               <br />
               the duties of my profession at the court of the 
               <br />
               district of Beauharnois, I observed that these 
               <br />
               agents had been sent by the Montreal com- 
               <br />
               mittee, and I was enabled to defeat their little, 
               <br />
               plans and their little games. They tried to 
               <br />
               make little speeches, and hold little meetings, 
               <br />
               but as I was on the spot they gained nothing 
               <br />
               by it. But all this serves to indicate the 
               <br />
               means that have been employed by the par- 
               <br />
               tisans of the Opposition to excite the le 
               <br />
               against the measure of Confederation. I do 
               <br />
               not want to be too hard upon them, because 
               <br />
               they naturally were desirous of obtaining a 
               <br />
               triumph for their party, and they employed 
               <br />
               these means as they might have employed 
               <br />
               others, although they do not care a rush for 
               <br />
               the holy cause of nationality or religion.
