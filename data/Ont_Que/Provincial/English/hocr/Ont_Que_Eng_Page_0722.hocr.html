               HON. Mn. HOLTON—The honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman says it certainly is not. And 
               <br />
               yet he asks us to give a vote, in view of 
               <br />

               <br />
               ly on the question of the defences, but of 
               <br />
               Confederation as well. If the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman had used the arguments for 
               <br />
               withholding information which he has

               put forth, if the proposition were simply

               a money vote to place the country in a 
               <br />
               state of defence, there might be some reason 
               <br />
               in it, but he is using them to induce us 
               <br />
               to vote for a political scheme embracing all 
               <br />
               sorts of things other than the question of 
               <br />
               defence. The position the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               now assumes is unconstitutional; but being 
               <br />
               unconstitutional, it is in perfect keeping with 
               <br />
               the whole course of this Administration 
               <br />
               since its formation in June last, when it 
               <br />
               initiated its existence by pledging the Crown, 
               <br />
               inawritten document, not to exercise the 
               <br />
               prerogative of dissolution until another 
               <br />
               session of this Parliament should have'beeu 
               <br />
               held. (Hear, hear.) Isay that theirconrse 
               <br />
               in this instance is in keeping with every 
               <br />
               step they have taken since their formation. 
               <br />
               Well, sir, I have put one question to the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General West, and I propose now, 
               <br />
               with the leave of my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               member for North Wellington, who is 
               <br />
               entitled to the ﬂoor, to put another question. 
               <br />
               He may answer it or not, as he thinks 
               <br />
               proper; but the country will draw its own 
               <br />
               inference from his reply. Yesterday, he 
               <br />
               stated that in consequence of the result of 
               <br />
               the New Brunswick elections, it had become 
               <br />
               tolerably apparent that this scheme had 
               <br />
               received its ﬁrst check. In other words, he 
               <br />
               admitted plainly that the result of the New 
               <br />
               Brunswick elections was adverse to the 
               <br />
               scheme. I may add, that he knows very 
               <br />
               well a majority of the present Parliament of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia is adverse to it.
