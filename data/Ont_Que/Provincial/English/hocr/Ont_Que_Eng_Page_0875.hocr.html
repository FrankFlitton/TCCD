               a scandalous union—a state of political pro-

               inconvenient. It is assailed with relentless

               blows; it is to be thrown down without asking 
               <br />
               the leave of those most concerned ; and in its 
               <br />
               place is to be set up a new order of things 
               <br />
               under which there is to be no more r d for 
               <br />
               political principles than for the rig ts and 
               <br />
               wants of the people. A simple parliamentary

               <br />
               scheme of Confederation, because the ﬁrst 
               <br />

               <br />
               it is not a Federal union which is oﬂ'ered 
               <br />

               <br />
               Federalism is completely eliminated from this 
               <br />
               scheme, which centres everything in the 
               <br />
               General Government. Federalism means the 
               <br />
               union of certain states, which retain their 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               we are now examining, all is strength and 
               <br />
               power, in the Federal Government; all is

               Local Government! I am opposed to the 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation, because, far from 
               <br />
               removing the diﬁculties complained of 
               <br />
               between Upper Canada and Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               it must, if adopted, simply multiply them 
               <br />
               tenfold. There will be a constant conﬂict of 
               <br />
               authorities, particularly as to questions sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to the double action of the local and 
               <br />
               general 1 ' latures. I am opposed to the 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederati‘on,because the Constitu— 
               <br />
               tion in which it is to be embodied will be 
               <br />
               faulty in its very basis. We are told that 
               <br />
               the representation is to be based upon popu- 
               <br />
               lation in one House, and that the principle of 
               <br />
               equality is to prevail in the other; and to-day 
               <br />
               that principle is violated as regards New- 
               <br />
               foundland, as it will be, no doubt, tomorrow 
               <br />
               in favor of British Columbia and Vancouver 
               <br />
               Island, should these colonies think proper to 
               <br />
               enter into our proposed Confederation. What 
               <br />
               is to prevent the smaller provinces forming a 
               <br />
               league together, and thus getting the upper 
               <br />
               hand of the larger but less numerous provinces, 
               <br />
               on purely local questions ? That is one of the 
               <br />
               great defects of the Ministerial scheme, in my 
               <br />
               opinion. But, moreover, the autonomy of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada is menaced and placed at the 
               <br />
               mercy of a parliament of one hundred and 
               <br />
               ninety-four members, of whom forty-seven, or 
               <br />
               at most forty-eight only, will represent the 
               <br />
               views of the majority of its people. I am 
               <br />
               opposed to the scheme of Confederation, be- 
               <br />
               cause it takes away from the people of this 
               <br />
               country political rights which they have won 
               <br />
               by many years of struggles; among others 
               <br />
               that of electing its representatives in the Le- 
               <br />
               gislative Council, as it does its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representa-</span> 
               <br />
               tives in the Assembly. Since 1856, we 
               <br />
               have enjoyed an elective Council. For 
               <br />
               more than half a cent that reform had 
               <br />
               been asked for. Our clmms were urged in 
               <br />
               the press, in public meetings, in petitions 
               <br />
               to Parliament and to the home Government, 
               <br />
               and in the form of direct motions in the 
               <br />
               House. The Legislative Council, as constitu- 
               <br />
               ted previous to the Act of 1856, had become 
               <br />
               highly unpopular; it had also fallen into a 
               <br />
               state of utter insigniﬁcance. By infusing 
               <br />
               into it the pepular element by means of 
               <br />
               periodical elections, it was galvanised into life 
               <br />
               and became quite another bod in the estim— 
               <br />
               ation of the people. The e ectoral tern
