               honorable friend from South Wentworth (Mr. 
               <br />
               RYMAL), in furnishing an illustration to prove 
               <br />
               the impropriet of the scheme of union, com- 
               <br />
               pared it to ad ' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ggjoints</span> to a ﬁshing rod; but 
               <br />
               the comparison did not bear him out in his 
               <br />
               . conclusions, as the people of Canada have at 
               <br />
               all times, and in every emergency, shown 
               <br />
               themselves to be ssessed of that indomitable 
               <br />
               spirit which w' never quail before a foe— 
               <br />
               and the union of such material cannot fail to 
               <br />
               give them increased power to resist aggression, 
               <br />
               and to maintain and hand down to posterity 
               <br />
               the rights and privileges which we so happily 
               <br />
               enjoy. (Hear, hear.) The fact of uniting 
               <br />
               strong men together is not going to make 
               <br />

               <br />
               glory of the British Constitution. “ Union 
               <br />
               is strength” the old maxim says, and I believe 
               <br />
               that it will prove so as regards the united 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               different people on the same side of politics 
               <br />
               will look upon things. I have just noticed in 
               <br />
               the Daily News of this city, a few lines of a 
               <br />
               rather startling character. [Having read a 
               <br />
               passage from the News of the 10th of March, 
               <br />
               with reference to the abolition of the passport 
               <br />
               system, Mr. JOLY proceeded: There are

               two ways of looking at this. ere is a news- 
               <br />
               paper, supporting the Government, which says 
               <br />
               that if the Lower Provinces have not been 
               <br />
               relieved from the passport system, as Canada 
               <br />
               has been, it is certainly because their relations 
               <br />
               are not so friendly with the United States as 
               <br />
               ours. It is only since our relations became 
               <br />
               friendly with the United States—since we 
               <br />
               passed that Alien Bill, and voted that money 
               <br />
               stolen by the St. Alban’s raiders—it is only 
               <br />
               since we have bowed down before them that 
               <br />
               we have obtained relief from the obnoxious 
               <br />
               system. The Lower Provinces having taken 
               <br />
               a ﬁrmer stand, the United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               them as has been made to us. I think, there- 
               <br />
               tore it is a mistake to say that it is American 
               <br />
               inﬂuence or annexation proclivities that have 
               <br />
               caused the defeat of the friends of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confeder.</span> 
               <br />
