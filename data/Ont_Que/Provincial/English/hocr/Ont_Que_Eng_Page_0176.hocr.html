               <br />
               that it is because the Maritime Provinces are 
               <br />
               opposed to an elective Chamber, and hence we 
               <br />
               in Canada—the largest community and the 
               <br />
               most inﬂuential—give way to them, and set 
               <br />
               aside a rinciple that was solemnly adopted 
               <br />
               here, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> so far has worked without prejudice 
               <br />
               to our interests. We ﬁnd another gentleman, 
               <br />
               who, when the question came up years ago, 
               <br />
               strongly opposed the elective princrple, qmte 
               <br />
               as strongly opposes it now, because smce then 
               <br />
               certain municipalities have borrowed more 
               <br />
               than they are able to pay! These are some- 
               <br />
               what extraordinary reasons, and I trust the 
               <br />
               House will give them their due weight. I 
               <br />
               think, honorable gentlemen, that prior to the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               without, at any rate, knowin whether the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> consent to it or not; an Ido not think
