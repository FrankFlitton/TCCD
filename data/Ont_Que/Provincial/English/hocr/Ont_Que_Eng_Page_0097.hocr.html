               Looking at all these facts together, the con- 
               <br />
               clusion appears to me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irresistible</span> that the 
               <br />
               arrangement proposed is in every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> an 
               <br />
               equitable one, and that it has been made with

               a view to give to each province as nearly as 
               <br />
               possible what is right and fair, as far as what 
               <br />
               is r' ht could be discovered. N o honorable

               <br />
               undue advantages over the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parties</span> to the

               compact. The spirit in which the eliberationa 
               <br />
               of the Conference were conducted was the 
               <br />
               correct one, and had its members tried to over- 
               <br />
               reach each other—had they not been impreœed 
               <br />
               with the necessi of mutual concessions for 
               <br />
               the common g no result could ever have 
               <br />
               been arrived at. (Hear, hear.) The next
