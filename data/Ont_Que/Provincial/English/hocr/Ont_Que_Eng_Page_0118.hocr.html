               <br />
               coupled with General DIx’s order, was to

               in one day. (Hear, hear.) But, as my hon-

               orable friend the Finance Minister suggests, 
               <br />
               this is but an additional roof of the accuracy 
               <br />
               of the meat I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> sustaining—for 
               <br />
               this woul not have happened, at all events to 
               <br />
               the same extent, if all the provinces had been 
               <br />
               united and prepared, aswe are now proposing, 
               <br />
               not only for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purposes</span> of commerce but for pur-

               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, I go heartily for the union, 
               <br />
               bœause it will throw down the barriers of 
               <br />
               trade and give us the control of a market of 
               <br />
               four millions of people. (Hear, hear.) What 
               <br />
               one thing has contributed so much to the won- 
               <br />
               (Irons material progress of the United States 
               <br />
               as the free passage of their products from one 
               <br />
               State to another ? What has tended so much 
               <br />
               to the rapid advance of all branches of their 
               <br />
               industry, as the vast extent of their home

               <br />
               the energy and ingenuity of producers? Sir, 
               <br />
               I eonfœs to you that in my mind this one 
               <br />
               view of the union—the addition of nearly a 
               <br />
               million of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wople</span> to our home consumers— 
               <br />
               sweeps aside all the petty objections that are 
               <br />
               aver-red against the scheme. What, in com- 
               <br />
               parison with this great gain to our farmers and 
               <br />
               manufacturers, are even the fallacious money

               objections which the imaginations of honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite have summoned up ? All 
               <br />
               over the world we ﬁnd nations eagerly longing 
               <br />

               one day, near a million of souls to our puls-

               <br />

               <br />
               Have honorable gentlemen forgotten that the 
               <br />
               United States gladly paid twenty millions in 
               <br />
               hard cash to have Louisiana incorporated in 
               <br />
               the Republic? But what was Louisiana then 
               <br />
               to the Americans, in comparison with what 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces are at this moment to 
               <br />
               Canada? I put it to honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite—if the United States were now to 
               <br />
               oﬁ'er us the State of Maine, what possible 
               <br />
               sum could be named within the compass of 
               <br />
               our ability that we would not be prepared to 
               <br />
               pay for that addition to our country ? (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) If we were oﬁered Michigan, Iowa or 
               <br />
               Minnesota, I would like to know what sum 
               <br />
               within the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compass</span> of Canada, we would 
               <br />
               not be prepared to pay ? These are portions 
               <br />
               of a foreign country, but here is a le

               natural resources of our united omains, we 
               <br />
               hesitate to adopt it! If a Canadian goes 
               <br />
               now to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, or 
               <br />
               if a citizen of these provinces comes here, 
               <br />
               it is like going to a foreign country. The 
               <br />
               customs oﬁicer meets you at the frontier, 
               <br />

               <br />
               now before us is to throw down all barriers 
               <br />
               between the provinces—to make a citizen of 
               <br />
               one, citizen of the whole; the proposal is, 
               <br />
               that our farmers and manufacturers and 
               <br />
               mechanics shall ca their wares un uestioned 
               <br />
               into every village 0 the Maritime rovinoes; 
               <br />
               and that they shall with equal freedom bring 
               <br />
               their ﬁsh, and their coal, and their West India 
               <br />
               produce to our three millions of inhabitants. 
               <br />
               The- proposal is, that the law courts, and 
               <br />
               the schools, and the professional and in-
