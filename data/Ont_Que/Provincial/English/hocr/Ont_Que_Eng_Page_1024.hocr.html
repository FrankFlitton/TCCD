               was accomplished without a reference to the 
               <br />
               people, did any one say that these things 
               <br />
               were unconstitutional? Has my hon. friend 
               <br />
               not shown that Sir ROBERT PEEL, who was 
               <br />
               the great protector of the liberties of 
               <br />
               Parliament, quoted these proceedings with 
               <br />
               approbation, as showing what the House of 
               <br />
               Commons could do if it chose. And so 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Montmorency 
               <br />
               quoted the language of WILLIAM PITT, 
               <br />
               who, although his name in late days was con— 
               <br />
               nected with some things which did not meet 
               <br />
               the approbation of his party, was the leader 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party, and carried through 
               <br />
               to his deathbed the principles of his father 
               <br />
               the Earl of CHATHAM. He was supported 
               <br />
               by his party and by all the leadin whigs 
               <br />
               when he made his speech on the Iris union, 
               <br />
               in which he alleged that the Irish Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment had full power to vote away those rights 
               <br />
               which it was elected to preserve. His lan- 
               <br />
               guage was quoted by the honorable member, 
               <br />
               and did time permit, I would read it again 
               <br />
               to the House, for it is the language of wisdom 
               <br />
               and truth. My honorable friend from Peel 
               <br />
               says—“ Oh, that is all very well, but this is 
               <br />
               quite a different thing from the Irish union, 
               <br />
               because we have only a limited Constitution 
               <br />
               under our Constitutional Act.” Thatis quite 
               <br />
               true, but Ireland as well as this country had 
               <br />
               only a limited Constitution, under which not 
               <br />
               even a measure of supply could be laid before 
               <br />
               the Irish Parliament unless it had previously 
               <br />
               been sent to the English Government, ap- 
               <br />
               proved, and then sent back for the approval 
               <br />
               and sanction of the Irish Parliament; and it 
               <br />
               was not till 1782 that this Was changed, and 
               <br />
               the reference to England of such measures 
               <br />
               done away with. My honorable friend refers 
               <br />
               us to the language of the Constitutional Act 
               <br />
               to show how limited our Constitution is ; but 
               <br />
               by that act we are empowered, in the widest 
               <br />
               language that could be employed, to make 
               <br />
               laws for the peace, welfare and good govern- 
               <br />
               ment of the peeple of Canada. There could 
               <br />
               be no larger powers conferred upon us, and 
               <br />
               although it is quite true that Our political 
               <br />
               existence is only statutory, that constitution- 
               <br />
               ally our judges have no right to commit for 
               <br />
               contempt, and that we have no prescriptive 
               <br />
               rights such as those which the Imperial Par- 
               <br />
               liament possesses, yet this is equally true— 
               <br />
               that we stand, with regard to the people of 
               <br />
               Canada, recisely in the same position as the 
               <br />
               House 0 ' Commons in England stands with 
               <br />
               regard to the people of England. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) And no man who values representative

               Parliament to do it. A new Parliament 
               <br />
               can, however, do nothing more than we can 
               <br />
               do. Sir, I believe in my conscience, that 
               <br />
               this House, more than any House since 
               <br />
               1841, represents truly and faithfully the 
               <br />
               people of Canada. If the members of this 
               <br />
               House do not represent the country—all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> 
               <br />
               interests, classes, and communities—it never 
               <br />
               has been represented. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               believe that all classes and interests are 
               <br />
               represented here; but if the House votes for 
               <br />
               this motion, it declares that it does not re- 
               <br />
               present them. (Hear, hear.) If we repre- 
               <br />
               sent the people of Canada, then, in the 
               <br />
               words of the Constitutional Act, we are here 
               <br />
               to pass laws for the peace, welfare and good 
               <br />
               government of the country. But if we do 
               <br />
               not represent the people of Canada—if we 
               <br />
               declare so by passing this resolution—then 
               <br />
               what great criminals have we been in the 
               <br />
               sat! If we do not represent them, if we 
               <br />
               ave no right to represent them, then we 
               <br />
               have no power to pass one single bill and 
               <br />
               declare it to be law, even although it be 
               <br />
               a bill to establish a saw-mill. If we do not 
               <br />
               represent the people of Canada, we have no 
               <br />
               right to be here. But if we do represent 
               <br />

               <br />
               to think for them, to act for them; we have 
               <br />
               a right to go to the foot of the Throne 
               <br />
               and declare that we believe it to be for the

               peace, welfare and good government of the
