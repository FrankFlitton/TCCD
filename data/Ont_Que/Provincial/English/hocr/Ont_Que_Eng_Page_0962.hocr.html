               that it was also necessary to protect the

               English minorities in Lower Canada with 
               <br />

               in the Local Parliament of Lower Canada

               the majority will be composed of French-

               Canadians. The members of the Conference

               HON. Mn. DORION—I am very glad to 
               <br />
               hear this statement; but I fail to see any- 
               <br />
               thing in the resolutions themselves which 
               <br />
               gives' such an assurance, in proof of which 
               <br />
               we have the honorable member for Quebec 
               <br />
               county asking how the matter really stands. 
               <br />
               But it is not simply for the use of the French 
               <br />
               language in the Legislature that protection 
               <br />
               is needed—that is not of so great importance 
               <br />
               as is the publication of the laws and pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings of Parliament. The speeches deli- 
               <br />
               vered in this House are only addressed to a 
               <br />
               few,but the laws and proceedings of the House 
               <br />
               are addressed to the whole pe0p1e, a million 
               <br />
               or nearly a million of whom speak the French 
               <br />
               language. I now beg to address one or two 
               <br />
               observations on a diﬂereut subject. When 
               <br />
               the question was ﬁrst brought before us, I 
               <br />
               drew the attention of the Government to the 
               <br />
               discrepancy between the printed resolutions 
               <br />
               which are now submitted to us, and the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions which were despatched to the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Legislature, during the recess, by 
               <br />
               the Hon. Provincial Secretary. The discre- 
               <br />
               pancy consists in the wording of the third 
               <br />
               section of the 29th resolution. In the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions which were sent us by the Hon. Pro- 
               <br />
