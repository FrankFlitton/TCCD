               years ago, and I shall have the greatest

               tion of what occurred—for I have not since

               refreshed my memory by reading the report 
               <br />
               of the proceedings—there was a general 
               <br />
               assent to the project. Though some hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen did entertain views peculiar to 
               <br />
               themselves, and expressed opinions that per- 
               <br />
               haps did not convey a hearty or cordial 
               <br />
               assen t, yet there was a unanimous consent that 
               <br />
               this Government should be formed. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I think every one assented to that 
               <br />
               proposal. I, at all events, fully assented to it 
               <br />
               in good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">faith—(hear,</span> hear)—-and in doing so, 
               <br />
               my meaning was to allow the fullest latitude 
               <br />
               to those hon. gentlemen to concoct the best 
               <br />
               scheme they could, and to sustain them in 
               <br />
               working it out. I had no trick in my mind. 
               <br />
               I did not mean, as some honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men seem to have meant, to place them in 
               <br />
               a false position, and afterwards assail them. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I honestly meant to empower 
               <br />
               them to confer with delegates from the other 
               <br />
               provinces, and to endeavor to bring about 
               <br />
               an understanding by which a union of some 
               <br />
               sort might be accomplished. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It is true that there was one feature in the 
               <br />
               explanations given by the Hon. President of 
               <br />
               the Council which was not acceptable to me, 
               <br />
               but it was not of a character which rendered 
               <br />
               it necessary for me to make any remark at 
               <br />
               the time. To prevent misapprehension, I
