               the Hon. President of the Council has also

               said, and has acknowledged it too, that he 
               <br />
               was very much opposed to the Intercolonial 
               <br />
               Railwa , and when the Hon. Attorney Gen- 
               <br />
               eral est made the observation that he 
               <br />
               learned from a brief <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paragraph</span> in a paper 
               <br />
               called the Globe, that Messrs. SICOTTE and 
               <br />
               ROWLAND were about to return, having ac- 
               <br />
               complished the object of their mission, viz: 
               <br />
               to throw overboard the Intercolonial Railway, 
               <br />
               the Hon. President of the Council remarked, 
               <br />
               that that was “a very sensible thing—the 
               <br />
               most sensible thing they ever did.” But now 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman goes so heartily into 
               <br />
               this matter, that he will build this vast rail- 
               <br />
               way which it was so sensible to throw over— 
               <br />
               board at that time, and I think he went so 
               <br />
               far as to say he would build ﬁve intercolonial 
               <br />

               throwing it overboard at the risk of our being 
               <br />
               charged with a breach of good faith. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Now, looking at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> scheme politi— 
               <br />
               cally, I do not see that we gain any advantage 
               <br />
               from it. I do not see that it secures to us 
               <br />
               peace for the future. I do not think that it 
               <br />
               secures us against the Honorable President of 
               <br />
               the Council coming forward again as the 
               <br />

               constituency, and shaking our whole political 
               <br />
               fabric by his violent agitations. I do not 
               <br />
               think it prevents our having political ﬁre- 
               <br />
               brands in this country such as we have had. 
               <br />
               I do not think it prevents our having the 
               <br />
               same diﬂiculties on the ﬂoor of the Federal 
               <br />

               <br />
               House. (Hear, hear.) We may have, with 
               <br />
               all the additional expense we shall have gone 
               <br />
               to in order to obviate it, the same thing

               <br />

               Commercially, then, it does not hold out such

               Provinces either such assistance in men or 
               <br />
               money as to make it an object to unite 
               <br />
               with them. (Hear, hear.) In a sectional 
               <br />
               point of view the people of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               can see what they are to get. I cannot see 
               <br />
               that the people of Lower Canada are to be 
               <br />
               any better protected from the means that hon- 
               <br />
               orable gentleman has made use of to create 
               <br />

               <br />
               rid of which this expensive scheme is pro- 
               <br />
               posed. Upper Canada, it is said, will have 
               <br />
               the contro of the expenditure, because they 
               <br />
               will have seventeen members more in the Fed— 
               <br />
               eral Legislature than Lower Canada; but how 
               <br />
               easily their inﬂuence can be checked and com- 
               <br />
               pletely swamped by the addition of forty-seven 
               <br />
               members from the Lower Provinces! (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Looking at it in all these aspects, I 
               <br />
               am at a loss to understand what great beneﬁt 
               <br />
               there is in the Confederation scheme to call 
               <br />
               for its being put through in such a hurried 
               <br />
               manner. Hon. Mr. GREY said in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Low-</span> 
               <br />
               er Provinces that it might be years be- 
               <br />
               fore the change would come into eﬁect; that it 
               <br />
               would take years to think about it. He said, 
               <br />
               “It is not intended to hurry the proposed 
               <br />
               scheme into actual life and operation; it is 
               <br />
               not to be carried out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> but years may 
               <br />
               roll by before it is carried into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect.”</span> This 
               <br />
               quotation occurs in a speech made by Hon. 
               <br />

               ber last. Now that honorable gentleman also 
               <br />
               takes a very diﬁ'erent view of what is being
