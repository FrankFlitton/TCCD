               Mn. T. R. FERGUSON said—I have 
               <br />
               listened very attentively to the discussion on 
               <br />
               this question, and it is certainly most sin gu— 
               <br />
               lar, as well as amusing, to hear the diﬂ'erent 
               <br />
               views that have been expressed upon it by 
               <br />
               the advocates of the amendment. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Peel, I am certain, felt that 
               <br />
               his resolution was the most consistent and 
               <br />
               reasonable one that could have been well 
               <br />
               introduced on the subject. The hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Ontario, who seconded the 
               <br />
               motion, also, no doubt, thought it a very 
               <br />
               sensible one. I listened carefully to the 
               <br />
               _ arguments of both, and I ﬁnd that they sup- 
               <br />
               ported the motion from very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> points 
               <br />
               of view. The hon. member for Peel made 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strong</span> speech in favor of the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation which has been adopted by 
               <br />
               this House, and he said he introduced his 
               <br />
               motion for the purpose of having the people 
               <br />
               vote upon it, and with the expectation that 
               <br />
               they would carry it by a very large majority. 
               <br />
               The hon. member for North Ontario took a 
               <br />
               very different view of the eﬁ‘ect of the reso- 
               <br />
               lution, stating that he seconded it because he 
               <br />
               believed it would result in defeating the 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme.

               <br />
               was that I wished the peeple to have an

               friend's pardon ; but that was not the object 
               <br />
               and aim the hon. gentleman had in view in 
               <br />
               seconding the motion. If his object was 
               <br />
               not to have the scheme rejected, then I 
               <br />
               cannot understand his language at all. .I 
               <br />
               seldom agree with the views of the Hon. 
               <br />
               President of the Council; but on this 
               <br />
               occasion, I think he pointed out the 
               <br />
               inconsistencies of the hon. member for Peel 
               <br />
               in an excellent manner. But there are a 
               <br />
               few more left untouched, to some of which 
               <br />
               I will brieﬂy- allude. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Peel declared-that his motion was designed 
               <br />
               to secure the approval of the people, and 
               <br />
               that it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">result</span> in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approval</span> of the 
               <br />
               formation of a new -nationality. The 
               <br />
               seconder of the _rnotion' supported it because 
               <br />
               it was designe‘d-to secure the condemnation 
               <br />
               of the scheme, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> prevent us from obtain- 
               <br />
               ing that new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nationality!</span> . The-hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peel stated that he was in favor o

               having a dissolution of Parliament, so that 
               <br />
               a constitutional expression could be 'had 
               <br />
               through a general election. Now, for 
               <br />
               my own part, I doubt whether, if 
               <br />
               there were a dissolution of this House 
               <br />
               to-morrow, we would get afull, true and fair 
               <br />
               expression of opinion from the people at 
               <br />
               all. I believe that side-issues would creep 
               <br />
               in in every case—that the Conservative 
               <br />
               party would hang togetherin most instances, 
               <br />
               and the Reform party do the same, and that 
               <br />
               numerous local questions would interfere 
               <br />
               with the results sought to be obtained. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from North Ontario declares 
               <br />
               himself in favor of having a direct vote of 
               <br />
               the people. Were it not that that is declar— 
               <br />
               ed an unconstitutional method, I should say 
               <br />
               it was the only true course to be adopted, 
               <br />
               because it is the only way of properly 
               <br />
               testing public opinion on any one measure. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peel is one of the eleverest men in the 
               <br />
               province, but I must say that my experience 
               <br />
               with regard to his movements in Parliament 
               <br />
               is that he does not exhibit himself in any- 
               <br />
               thing like so clcver or successful a manner 
               <br />
               as he does when pleading at the bar. I 
               <br />
               have never seen him taking a prominent 
               <br />
               position in this House, and playing his part 
               <br />
               rn that position in a successful manner. If 
               <br />
               he had moved his amendment before the 
               <br />
               resolutions were adopted, I would have been 
               <br />
               able to have given him credit for sincerity, 
               <br />
               if not for ability, in advocating it ; but 
               <br />
               after the resolutions have been passed, 
               <br />
               he brings up an amendment to another 
               <br />
               motion that is evidently hostile to the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions. Well now, let us take a look at the 
               <br />
               assertions of the hon. member for Cornwall, 
               <br />
               and I think we will be able to see the incon— 
               <br />
               sistency still more clearly. The position he 
               <br />
               takes is, that if these resolutions are referred 
               <br />
               to the people, and are by them voted down, 
               <br />
               every honorable member who voted for them 
               <br />
               in this House must immediately resign his 
               <br />
               seat. Now, sir, what would be the result of 
               <br />
               that principle as affecting the hou. member 
               <br />
               who moved and the hon. member who 
               <br />
               seconded the amendment now in your hands ? 
               <br />
               Why, sir, instead of having them both on 
               <br />
               the ﬂoor of this House to carry out the views 
               <br />
               of the people, one of them certainly must 
               <br />
               leave, if the views of the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Cornwall are carried out. I think every 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman must see clearly that 
               <br />
               whatever way you view the positions taken 
               <br />
               by the mover and seconder of this amend- 
               <br />
               ment, their course bears a contradiction on 
               <br />
