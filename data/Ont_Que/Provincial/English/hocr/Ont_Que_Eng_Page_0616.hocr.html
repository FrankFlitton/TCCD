               Mr. SPEAKER, when we have such acts as

               members who sit on the Ministerial benches,

               should, at least, have an opportunity of

               carefully studying all the details of the

               enemy which may come forward to attack

               our territory. But I am bound to declare

               that if that Constitution is changed despite

               impossibility ! Do what you may, the same 
               <br />
               feelings will always exist. They are blame- 
               <br />
               able, perhaps, but the fact remains—they 
               <br />
               exist, and form part of the very nature of 
               <br />
               the two races. The language, the religion, 
               <br />
               the institutions and the customs of a people 
               <br />
               are so many obstacles to its union with 
               <br />
               another people, whose language, religion, 
               <br />
               institutions and customs are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ'erent</span> from 
               <br />
               theirs. And is it supposed that these feel-

               ings of rivalry and these causes of estrange- 
               <br />

               scheme of Confederation which is proposed 
               <br />
               to us? For my part, I would wish in

               Canada to see the two nationalities rival

               each other in progress in the useful 
               <br />
               works of peace. This rivalry, not of strife 
               <br />
               hand to hand, but a rivalry in the laudable 
               <br />

               sciences, and of the most profound secrets
