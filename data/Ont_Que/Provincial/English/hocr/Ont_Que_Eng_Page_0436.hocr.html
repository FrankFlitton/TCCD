               ( ear, hear.) My honorable friend seems to

               one of positive uselessness. But does my hon.

               friend think we can safely continue in our

               present position of commercial dependence on 
               <br />

               <br />

               come de dent on the ﬁscal legislation of the 
               <br />
               United tates ? Is it to come to this, that in 
               <br />
               the winter season the Upper Canada farmer 
               <br />
               shall have no means whereby he can send a 
               <br />
               barrel of ﬂour, or the Lower Canada mer- 
               <br />
               chant a bale of goods, to the seaboard, with- 
               <br />
               out the leave of the United States ? Is my

               honorable friend disposed to leave us in this 
               <br />
               condition of commercial d dency for ever ? 
               <br />
               Ioan hardly believe he deliberately say 
               <br />
               that we are to continue in such circumstances 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> be incurred. I believe with him that 
               <br />
               that work is a great and grave undertaking, 
               <br />
               and one that will involve a serious ch e on 
               <br />
               the wealth of the country. But then cou-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tend</span> that it is one which we cannot avoid— 
               <br />
               it isa necessity. We must l— ave it. It is 
               <br />
               called for by military reasons and commercial 
               <br />
               neoeæity, and the date of its construction can- 
               <br />
               not safely be postponed. Why, what have we 
               <br />
               not æen within a very recent period? Re- 
               <br />
               strictions have been put on goods sent through 
               <br />
               the United States, by the establishment of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consular</span> certiﬁcates, to such an extent that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">50“</span> could not send a bale of goods through 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> States without accompanying it with one 
               <br />

               of the freight. (Hear, hear.) Still further, 
               <br />
               the Senate of the United States had also be-

               tention of abolishing the system under which

               goods were permitted to pass in bond from 
               <br />
               England through the United States. I do

               <br />

               <br />
               In the winter season you could not send a 
               <br />
               barrel of ﬂour to England—you could not 
               <br />
               receive a single package of goods therefrom. 
               <br />
               The merchants would have to lay in a twelve 
               <br />
               months' stock of goods, and the farmer would 
               <br />
               be dependent on the condition of the market 
               <br />
               in spring, and would be compelled to force 
               <br />
               the sale of his produce at that moment, 
               <br />
               whether there was a proﬁtable market for it 
               <br />
               then or not, instead of having as now a mar- 
               <br />
               ket at all seasons, as well in England as the 
               <br />
               United States. So that whatever sacriﬁces 
               <br />
               attach to the construction of the Intercolonial

               <br />
               impossible for us to remain in our present 
               <br />

               desirable those communications are, and how 
               <br />

               No one can foresee what the future of the

               <br />
               two or more confederacies. They have a 
               <br />
               dark and uncertain future before them, for

               <br />
               they will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> an enormous load of debt

               weighing upon them, and that they will have

               to encounter great diﬂioulties before they 
               <br />
