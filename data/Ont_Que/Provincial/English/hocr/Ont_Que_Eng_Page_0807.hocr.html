               DURHAM, from the beginning to the end of 
               <br />

               federation which we are about to have im- 
               <br />
               posed upon us. Even before Lord DURHAM, 
               <br />
               Judge SEWELL, in 1814, had expressed opin- 
               <br />
               ions nearly similar to those of the noble lord, 
               <br />
               and in 1839 the whole of the present plan of 
               <br />
               Confederation was traced out. The honorable 
               <br />
               member for Montmorency pretends that Lord 
               <br />
               DURHAM was mistaken; but for my part I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd, in addition to the other causes of reproach 
               <br />
               which have been accumulated against the 
               <br />
               members of the Conference, we may urge this, 
               <br />
               that they did not give Lord DURHAM credit 
               <br />
               for the work he had already done, and that 
               <br />
               they did not endorse upon the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation now laid before us the words 
               <br />
               “ True copy of the scheme of Lord DURHAM

               <br />
               DURHAM speaks of it in his report in the 
               <br />
               following terms: “The error of Lower Can-

               preserve a French-Canadian nationality in the

               <br />
               we submit to the yoke of the oppressor, when 
               <br />
               there is no legitimate ground for imposing it 
               <br />
               upon us? Another reason which gives me 
               <br />
               good ground for haping that the work of

               hurry, as desired by the honorable members
