               tween the wisdom displayed on that point 
               <br />
               in the Constitution of the United States, 
               <br />
               and the lack of wisdom in the arrangement 
               <br />
               proposed for adoption here. There is, in 
               <br />
               the United States’ system, a clear and dis- 
               <br />
               tinct line drawn between the functions of 
               <br />
               the general 'and state governments. Some 
               <br />
               may not like the idea of state sovereignty, 
               <br />
               and many may wish that more power had 
               <br />
               been given to the General Government. But 
               <br />
               this much is plain, that it is not proposed to 
               <br />
               allow anything approaching to state sove- 
               <br />
               reignty here. We have not even an intelli- 
               <br />
               gible statement as to what powers are to be 
               <br />
               exercised by the general, and what by the 
               <br />
               local legislatures and governments. Several 
               <br />
               subjects are Speciﬁcally given to both ; many 
               <br />
               others are confusedly left in doubt between 
               <br />
               them; and there is the strange and anomalous 
               <br />
               provision that not only can the General 
               <br />
               Government disallow the acts of the provin- 
               <br />
               cial legislatures, and control and hamper and 
               <br />
               fetter provincial action in more ways than 
               <br />
               one, but that wherever any federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contravenes</span> or in any way clashes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'with</span> pro- 
               <br />
               vincial legislation, as to any matter at all 
               <br />
               common between them, such federal legis- 
               <br />
               lation shall override it, and take its place. 
               <br />
               It is not too much to say that a continuance 
               <br />
               of such a system for any length of time 
               <br />
               without serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clashing</span> is absolutely im- 
               <br />
               possible. This is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> so declared in the 
               <br />
               despatch of Her Majesty’s Colonial Secretary, 
               <br />
               and it is clearly pointed out in the London 
               <br />
               Times and in the Edinburgh Review. It 
               <br />
               seems as if our statesmen had sought to 
               <br />
               multiply points of collisicn at every turn. 
               <br />
               Then as to the non provision of apermanent 
               <br />
               seat of government, and the arrangements 
               <br />
               contemplated tor the judiciary, we ﬁnd still 
               <br />
               more ot the same sort of thing; and as to 
               <br />
               the extraordinary pains thatseem to have b ‘en 
               <br />
               taken to throw up a great wall or hedge round 
               <br />
               those institutions of Lower Canada which 
               <br />
               of late have been giving us no trouble to 
               <br />
               speak of—as to the extraordinary pains, I say, 
               <br />
               that seem to have been taken to put a wall 
               <br />
               around those institutions, and to give every 
               <br />
               possible guarantee about them on this side 
               <br />
               and on that ; why, this very machinery, prov- 
               <br />
               ided for the mere purpose of inducing people 
               <br />
               to agree to the scheme, who would not other- 
               <br />
               wise countenance it, is calculated, at no very 
               <br />
               distant day, to cause the cry to resound 
               <br />
               throughout the land—“To your tents, O, 
               <br />
               Israel 1” (Hear, hear.) I had reached this 
               <br />
               point of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.my</span> argument, when I was com-

               the House. There is just one consideration 
               <br />
               connected with these matters to which I 
               <br />
               have been alluding, that I wish to revert to

               in few words, because I believe it escaped 
               <br />
               me, in part at least, last night. A marked 
               <br />
               difference between the history of the United 
               <br />
               States just before they framed their consti- 
               <br />
               tution, and our late history, is this: the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adOptien</span> of the Constitution of the United 
               <br />
               States followed immediately upon their suc- 
               <br />
               cessful war of independence. The men who 
               <br />
               adopted it had just gone shoulder to 
               <br />
               shoulder through the severest trial that 
               <br />
               could have been given to their patience and 
               <br />
               other higher qualities. Their entire com- 
               <br />
               munities had been, you may say, united as 
               <br />
               one man, in the great struggle through 
               <br />
               which they had passed, and were then 
               <br />
               equally united in their hopes as to the 
               <br />
               grand results which their new system was 
               <br />
               to bring forth. They had tried the system 
               <br />
               of mere confederation, and were agreed that 
               <br />
               it was inadequate to meet the wants of their 
               <br />
               situation. They were all trying to remove 
               <br />
               the evils that they felt and apprehended 
               <br />
               from it, and to build up a great nationality 
               <br />
               that should endure in the future. That was 
               <br />
               the position they occupied. Ours is some 
               <br />
               thing very different indeed. We have 
               <br />
               not gone through an ordeal such as 
               <br />
               that through which they had so proudly 
               <br />
               passed. On the contrary, we have ended, 
               <br />
               temporarily ended at any rate, a series 
               <br />
               of struggles it is true, but struggles of a 
               <br />
               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> kind; struggles that have 
               <br />
               just pitted our public men one against 
               <br />
               another, and to some extent, I am sorry to 
               <br />
               say, even our faiths and races against each 
               <br />
               other. (Hear, hear.) For one,Ido believe 
               <br />
               that these struggles—of the latter class I 
               <br />
               mean—were dying out, but for these contem- 
               <br />
               plated changes, which are threatening to 
               <br />
               revive them. But, however that may he. 
               <br />
               struggles there have been amongst us, of 
               <br />
               which we have no cause to be proud; things 
               <br />
               have occurred since the union of which we 
               <br />
               ought to be ashamed, if we are not. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Of this kind are the only struggles 
               <br />
               that we have had ; and when, from such a 
               <br />
               past and present, we are told to start with 
               <br />
               the idea, so to speak, of at once creating 
               <br />
               and deveIOping the character of a new 
               <br />
               and united nation, under institutions 
               <br />
               giving us a something short of indepen- ' 
               <br />
               dence, and at the same time any quantity of 
               <br />
               matters about which to dispute <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> come to 
               <br />
               trouble, we may as well not shut our eyes to 
               <br />
               the fact, that we start with but poor omens
