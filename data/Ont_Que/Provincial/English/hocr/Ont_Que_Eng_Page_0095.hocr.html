               <br />
               that the subject was alluded to at the close of 
               <br />
               the session of 1858, in the Speech of Sir

               <br />
               mission of the honorable member I will state 
               <br />
               the result of my experience in this matter. I 
               <br />
               have been for some time attached to the 
               <br />
               Adjutant General’s ofﬁce, where I had the 
               <br />
               opportunity of examining the particularly cor- 
               <br />
               rect returns of the Militia for Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               and it always appears that out of a given 
               <br />
               population of both sexes the one-ﬁfth part 
               <br />
               shews the exact number of men, between the 
               <br />
               ages of 18 and 60, ﬁt for military duty. This 
               <br />
               is the case all the world over. The law is as 
               <br />
               uniform as that which determines the relative 
               <br />
               numbers of the two sexes; in all Christian 
               <br />
               countries the males being 21 and a fraction to 
               <br />
               20 females, while in countries where polygamy 
               <br />
               exists the case is exactly reversed, the females 
               <br />
               being 21 and a fraction, and the males 20. I 
               <br />
               have veriﬁed the fact that one-ﬁfth of our 
               <br />
               population shows the correct number of militia- 
               <br />
               men, and if the honorable member (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               CURRIE) will apply to the Adjutant General 
               <br />
               he will ﬁnd it was so.
