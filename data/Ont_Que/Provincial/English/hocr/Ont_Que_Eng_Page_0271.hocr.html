               which is well known in this House, the voice 
               <br />
               of the Attorney General West, saying “hear,

               (Hear.) I come now to another point, vin., 
               <br />
               is the scheme presented to us the same 
               <br />
               one that was promised to us by theAdmiuis- 
               <br />
               tration when it was formed? This, sir, 
               <br />
               might be but of slight importance if the 
               <br />
               manner in which this proposed Constitution 
               <br />
               was framed had not a most unfortunate hear- 
               <br />
               ing on the scheme itself; but itis a grave 
               <br />
               matter, since the scheme is so objectionable, 
               <br />
               especially as we are gravely told that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">item-</span> 
               <br />
               net be amended in the least, but thatit is 
               <br />
               brought down as a compact made between 
               <br />
               the Government of this country and delegates 
               <br />
               from the governments of N ova Scotia, New

               Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Ed-

               altered or amended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> any particular. 
               <br />
               (Hear.) The plain meaning of this is, sir, 
               <br />
               that the Lower Provinces have made out a 
               <br />
               Constitution for us and we are to adopt it.
