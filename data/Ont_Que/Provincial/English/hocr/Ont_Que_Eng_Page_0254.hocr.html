               (Hear, hear.) And the honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               thinks that his amendment would be a great 
               <br />
               improvement to the scheme of the Conference. 
               <br />
               Well, for my part, honorable gentlemen, I 
               <br />
               believe it is a great failure in the way of im- 
               <br />
               proving the scheme cf the Confederation— 
               <br />
               a very great failure indeed. The honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman has had the opportunity of speak- 
               <br />
               ing several times in this House, and very 
               <br />
               often he has made allusion to me since the 
               <br />
               Opening of Parliament. He has endeavored 
               <br />
               to place me in contradiction to myself. He 
               <br />
               has stated that, in 1856, I was a member of 
               <br />
               the Government conducting the affairs of the 
               <br />
               House, and that I was the y who brought 
               <br />
               in the measure to extend e elective princi- 
               <br />
               ple to this honorable House, and he says that 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               am here again, nine ears later, endeavcring

               <br />
               orable gentlemen, I think that when I shall 
               <br />
               have ex lained the circumstances which then 
               <br />
               forced e Government to bring forward the 
               <br />
               measure to render this House elective, you 
               <br />
               will agree with me that it was not on account 
               <br />
               of an fancy or predilection on their part that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theJective</span> system was roposed, but that it 
               <br />
               was necemitated by e circumstances in 
               <br />
               which the country found itself need. It is 
               <br />
               from no levity in the minds the members 
               <br />
               of the Government, or in my own mind; nor 
               <br />
               is there any inconsistency in what I then did 
               <br />
               and in what I am now doing. But we will 
               <br />
               have something more on that point in the 
               <br />
               course of a few moments. The honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman, the other day, said we ought to 
               <br />
