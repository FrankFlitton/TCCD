               <br />
               will feel with me that we in Canada have very 
               <br />
               little to complain of in regard to the subsidies 
               <br />
               for local government. But if a doubt yet 
               <br />
               remains on the mind of any honorable member, 
               <br />
               let him examine the Trade Returns of the 
               <br />
               several provinces, and he will see that, from

               <br />

               Upper Canada have complained that the 
               <br />
               minority of our representatives, the party de- 
               <br />
               feated at the polls of Upper Canada, have 
               <br />
               been, year after year, kept in ofﬁce by Lower 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cianada</span> votes, and that all the local patron- 
               <br />
               age of our section has been dispensed by 
               <br />
               those who did not possess the conﬁdence 
               <br />
               of the people. Well, sir, this scheme remedies 
               <br />
               that. The local patronage will be under local 
               <br />
               control, and the wishes of the majority in 
               <br />
               each section will be carried out in all local 
               <br />
               matters. (Hear, hear.) We have complained 
               <br />
               that the land system was not according to the 
               <br />
               views of our western people; that free lands 
               <br />
               for actual settlers was the right policy for us 
               <br />
               —that the price of a piece of land squeezed 
               <br />
               out of an immigrant was no consideration 
               <br />
               in comparison with the settlement among us 
               <br />
               of a hardy and industrious family; and that 
               <br />
               the colonization road system was far from 
               <br />
               satisfactory. Well, sir, this scheme remedies 
               <br />
               that. Each province is to have control of its 
               <br />
               own crown lands, crown timber and crown 
               <br />
               minerals,—and will be free to take such steps 
               <br />
               for developing them as each deems best.— 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We have complained that local 
               <br />
               works of various kinds—roads, bridges and 
               <br />
               landing piers, court houses, gaols and other 
               <br />
               structures—have been erected in an inequitable 
               <br />
               and improvident manner. Well, sir, this 
               <br />
               scheme remedies that; all local works are to 
               <br />
               be constructed by the localities and defrayed 
               <br />
               from local funds. And so on through the whole 
               <br />
               extensive details of internal local administra- 
               <br />
               tion will this reform extend. The people of 
               <br />
               Up r Canada will have the entire control of 
               <br />
               their local matters, and will no longer have to 
               <br />
               betakc themselves to Quebec for leave to open 
               <br />
               a road, to select a county town, or appoint a 
               <br />
