               could not have been stated more clearly or 
               <br />
               forcibly than we ﬁnd it in the document 
               <br />
               which I read, as coming from the Lower

               that document contains arguments in its

               favor which are unanswerable. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               In the circumstances, then, in which we are

               easible scheme, I believe that, in spite of 
               <br />
               all its objectionable features, the good which 
               <br />
               will result from it as a whole, will more than 
               <br />
               counterbalance all the difﬁculties and all the 
               <br />
               evils which may possibly grow out of it. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) And besides, it is not a ﬁnal- 
               <br />
               ity. We have every reason to believe that 
               <br />
               those principles, which, I think, should 
               <br />
               have been embodied in it, are such as 
               <br />
               will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ultimately</span> prevail. I have conﬁdence 
               <br />
               enough in the representatives of the people, 
               <br />
               and in the members of the Upper House 
               <br />
               to be nominated by the Crown, and who 
               <br />
               will compose that branch of the new Le- 
               <br />
               gislature formed under this Constitution. 
               <br />
               I say I have conﬁdence in them to believe 
               <br />
               that, if the opinions which I hold in respect 
               <br />
               to those details shall prove to be correct, 
               <br />
               the defects referred to will be removed from 
               <br />
               the Constitution. There will be no more dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty in excising the nominative principle 
               <br />
               from the future Legislative Council, than 
               <br />
               there was in excising it from the former 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               I shall merely avail myself of this oppor-

               tunity to answer two or three of the argu-

               which my hon. friend labors can be very

               easily removed; and that, if he is really in
