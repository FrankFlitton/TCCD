               Ms. DUNKIN—My honorable friend 
               <br />
               says “ without responsibility. ” I rather 
               <br />
               think not. Take the case of a senator from 
               <br />
               Massachusetts or New York. I rather 'think 
               <br />
               he will feel himself very distinctly responsible 
               <br />
               to the state he represents. He is not responsible 
               <br />
               to the whole people of the United States, nor 
               <br />
               is the Senate, as a whole, collectively respon- 
               <br />
               sible. But each senator is particularly and 
               <br />
               personally responsible to his own state, and 
               <br />
               acts under a sense of that responsibility. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Take the case which occurred 
               <br />
               a number of years ago, when President J ACK- 
               <br />
               SON named, as Minister to the British Court, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mum</span> VAN BUREN, afterwards his suc- 
               <br />
               œœor in the presidential chair. A majority 
               <br />
               of the Senate disallowed that nomination. 
               <br />
               Did not the senators who voted for or 
               <br />
               against that nomination, do so under a weighty, 
               <br />
               practical respdnsibility ? Every man of them 
               <br />
               did. They voted in the view and under the 
               <br />
               sanction of that responsibility; and some of 
               <br />
               them had to pay for the exercise of it. And 
               <br />
               so they do, all along. (Hear, hear.) This, 
               <br />
               however, is a ' 'on into which I 
               <br />
               have been led by the remark of my 
               <br />
               honorable friend. I return to the line of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ligament</span> I was pursuing. What I am just 
               <br />
               now chewing is, that in respect of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consti-</span> 
               <br />
               tuﬁon of the executive power, this scheme 
               <br />
               urged upon our acceptance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ‘ers</span> toto cœlo 
               <br />
               from the system in operation in the United 
               <br />
               States. I shall consider presently the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of its advantages or disadvantages. In 
               <br />
               the United States, as is admitted, the Senate 
               <br />
               does a certain part of what we undertake here 
               <br />
               to do by means of a Cabinet. The Federal 
               <br />
               Check so exercised by the Senate renders un- 
               <br />
               necessary, for any Federal purpose, the exist- 
               <br />
               enee of a Cabinet. Indeed they do not want 
               <br />
               a Cabinet for any purpose at all. It is not of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> system. But here, with our chief ma- 
               <br />
               gistrate not elected, we must haVe one. And 
               <br />

               yet, how are we to make it work, engrafted 
               <br />
               on a system which, in its essentials, is after 
               <br />
               all more American than British ? This is 
               <br />
               what I have now come to. I have to ask 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen opposite how they are 
               <br />
               going to organize their Cabinet, for these 
               <br />
               provinces, according to this so-called Federal 
               <br />
               scheme ? (Hear, hear.) I think I ma defy 
               <br />
               them to shew that the Cabinet can be formed 
               <br />
               on any other principle than that of a repre- 
               <br />
               sentation of the several provinces in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cap</span> 
               <br />
               binet. It is admitted that the rovinces are 
               <br />
               not real] represented to any ederal intent 
               <br />
               in the islative Council. The Cabinet 
               <br />
               here must discharge all that kind of function, 
               <br />
               which in the United States isperformed,in the 
               <br />
               Federal sense, b the Senate. And precisely 
               <br />
               as in the Unite States, wherever a Federal 
               <br />
               check is needed, the Senate has to do Federal 
               <br />
               duty as an integral part of the Executive 
               <br />
               Government. So here, when that check can- 
               <br />
               not be so got, we must seek such substitute 
               <br />
               for it as we may, in a Federal composition of 
               <br />
               the Executive Council; that is to say, by 
               <br />
               making it distinctly representative of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Well, I must say that this sort of 
               <br />
               thing is utterly variant from, and inconsistent 
               <br />
               with British practice and British principle; 
               <br />
               With the constitutional system which makes 
               <br />
               the whole Cabinet res nsible for eve act 
               <br />
               of government. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bi'itish</span> Cabinet is no 
               <br />
               Cabinet of sections, but a unit. In illustra- 
               <br />
               tion of the view which I am anxious to im- 
               <br />
               press upon the judgment of the House, let me 
               <br />
               revert for a moment to our Canadian history. 
               <br />
               I can only look forward to the future by the 
               <br />
               lights given me by the past. The union of 
               <br />
               the Canadas, consummated in 1841, was a le- 
               <br />
               gislative union. There was nothing in it 
               <br />
               savoring ever so faintly of Federalism, unless 
               <br />
               it were the clause which declared, and quite 
               <br />
               unnecessarily declared, that there should bean 
               <br />
               equal re <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resentation,</span> in the Legislative Assem- 
               <br />
               bly of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Uipper</span> and Lower Canada respectively. 
               <br />
               If the Union Act had merely distributed the 
               <br />
               constituencies in such a way as to give equal- 
               <br />
               ity of representation to Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, it would have done for practical pur- 
               <br />
               poses all it did. But besides doing this, it 
               <br />
               quite uselessly added in terms that the num- 
               <br />
               bers were to be equal—subject always, how- 
               <br />
               ever, by a strange anomaly, to our declared 
               <br />
               power <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thereafter</span> by legislation of our own 
               <br />
               to disturb that equality, if we pleased. Well, 
               <br />
               sir, when an Executive Government had to 
               <br />
               be ﬁrst organized for Canada, Lord SYDEN- 
               <br />
