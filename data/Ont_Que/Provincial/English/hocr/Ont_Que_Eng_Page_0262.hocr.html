               I now take it for granted, having given such

               an ample opportunity to my constituents to

               <br />
               that the matter was being pressed too rapidly in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House—that we might have waited for a

               But I have somewhat changed my mind from

               Independent vote, according to the best judg- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mgrt</span> I can form, since my constituents, after

               <br />
               this hour have not responded to the request. I 
               <br />
               speak here as a representative of Central Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and particularly of the Ottawa country. 
               <br />
               The le there are engaged mainly in one 
               <br />
               trade, the lumber trade; and, with reference to 
               <br />
               that trade, the promulgation of this scheme has 
               <br />
               caused us some feelings of apprehension, not 
               <br />
               to say gloom. Till <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">within‘the</span> last few hours, 
               <br />
               as late as yesterday, I was still in the dark 
               <br />
               as to the bearings of the scheme in that 
               <br />
               respect. But I have now had assurances from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me</span> Government—and particularly from one 
               <br />
               or two members of it—that the scheme is not 
               <br />
               going to inﬂict that injury <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">npoathe</span> lumbering 
               <br />
               interest which we imagined. In fact the 
               <br />
               clause relating to that subject has been so ex— 
               <br />
               plained to me, that I am now perfectly satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed. (Hear, hear.) My feeling formerly 
               <br />
               was that our trade was treated in a manner 
               <br />
               which it did not deserve. Here we have a 
               <br />
               trade employing many thousands of people— 
               <br />
               employing a large amount of shipping to c 
               <br />
               away the produce of our forests, whic 
               <br />
               exceeds the amount of the exported a 'cul— 
               <br />
               tnral produce of the country b a v ue of 
               <br />
               some two millions of dollars. e naturally 
               <br />
               felt that such a trade had some right to be 
               <br />
               considered. (Hear, hear.) However, accept- 
               <br />
               ing the assurances of honorable gentlemen, in 
               <br />

               <br />
               said in this debate on the general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> of

               the Confederation of these provinces, and as 
               <br />
               to that I shall say but little. As I have already 
               <br />
               stated, I am an advocate of union. I would 
               <br />
               even say that the scheme of the del ates to the 
               <br />
               Quebec Confererence does not go ar enough. 
               <br />
               I contend that, instead of merely taking in 
               <br />
               the provinces to the east of us, the scheme 
               <br />
               should have embraced British Columbia and 
               <br />
               the whole of the territory to the west. An 
               <br />
               honorable friend near me says that will come 
               <br />
               in good time. ‘But I am afraid that some 
               <br />

               <br />
               see the Paciﬁc as the western boundary of this 
               <br />
               young Confederation, in the same way as the 
               <br />
               Atlantic is its eastern limit, so that we should 
               <br />
               have one country stretching from ocean to 
               <br />
               ocean. (Hear, hear.) A great deal has been 
               <br />
               said in this debate on the subject of railways. 
               <br />
               Honorable gentlemen have spoken of the cost 
               <br />
               of building our railways, of the damage the 
               <br />
               Grand Trunk has done, and of the proﬁts 
               <br />
               certain gentlemen have made out of it. For 
               <br />
               the life of me, I cannot see the force of their 
               <br />
               arguments. True, the Grand Trunk has cost 
               <br />
               a eat deal of money, but how should we 
               <br />
               fee if we had to go back to the state of 
               <br />
               things which existed when we had no railroad ? 
               <br />
               What should we do if the Grand Trunk were 
               <br />
               now taken from us? I believe we could not 
               <br />
               do without it. It has become a necessity. 
               <br />
               Every man within the range of its inﬂuence,
