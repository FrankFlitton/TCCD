               ther think, and I know many others agree 
               <br />
               with me, that these resolutions may be amend- 
               <br />
               ed in some points, and yet without in the 
               <br />
               slightest degree endangering the whole scheme. 
               <br />
               But the Government say, “you must take the 
               <br />
               whole measure, or no part of it.” I very 
               <br />
               much fear that the determination of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in this respect is, if I may so speak, 
               <br />
               father to their wish. That they have fallen 
               <br />
               in love with their scheme. It is their pet 
               <br />
               measure—their bantling—and they wish to 
               <br />
               get it through, without any amendment, 
               <br />
               just as it is. Suppose amendments are 
               <br />
               proposed that really can only aﬁ'ect Canada, 
               <br />
               and cannot aﬁ'cct our relations with the other 
               <br />
               provinces at all; what reason is there that 
               <br />
               these amendments should not be made ? The 
               <br />
               Government can surely communicate with the 
               <br />
               other provinces, and get their assent. At the 
               <br />
               same time, while I am speaking on these parti- 
               <br />
               cular points, I must express my dissent from cer- 
               <br />
               tain other features of the resolutions, but they 
               <br />
               are features, I fear, that we can do nothing to 
               <br />
               alter now, for we shall be obliged, as the Gov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               years ago the Government of Canada had a 
               <br />
               conference with members of the governments 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and in 
               <br />
               that conference agreed that upon certain con—

               ditions, if the money could be obtained, with 
               <br />
               the guarantee of the home Government, at 
               <br />
               a certain rate of interest, the Intereolonial 
               <br />
               Railway should be built, and they further 
               <br />
               agreed that Canada should only have to pay 
               <br />
               ﬁve-twelfths of the cost, which was then esti-

               mated, as it was stated, at twelve millions of

               <br />

               cause he is president — who opposed that 
               <br />
               scheme because it was alleged Canada was 
               <br />
               paying far more than her just proportion but is 
               <br />
               now in favor of it. Had it not been so strong- 
               <br />
               ly opposed by a man in such a position, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               lieve the scheme would have been carried out. 
               <br />
               He who opposed it was one who had been 
               <br />
               twenty years in public life; his opinion was 
               <br />
               justly considered valuable, and many were 
               <br />
               disposed to agree with it. Had the ministry 
               <br />
               gone to the country then, taking the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railroad on their backs, I venture to 
               <br />
               say they would have been totally defeated. 
               <br />
               They would have had a large majority against 
               <br />
               them in Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> and I think a ma- 
               <br />
               jority against them in Lower Canada also. 
               <br />
               But how is it now? Why, this Intereolonial 
               <br />
               Railway is to be built out of the funds of the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Government that is proposed to 
               <br />
               be established, so that instead of Canada hav- 
               <br />
               ing to pay only ﬁve-twelfths of the whole cost, 
               <br />
               she will have to pay ten-twelfths. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) This will involve ﬁve to seven millions 
               <br />
               of dollars of an expense more than we had 
               <br />
               any occasion for incurring, for the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces were all willing to have been nsi- 
               <br />
               ble for the rest, and there is very g rea- 
               <br />
               son why they should. The countries to be 
               <br />
               beneﬁted by the Intercolonial Railway are 
               <br />
               New Brunswick and Nova Seotia, but especi- 
               <br />
               ally the former. In that province there is an 
               <br />
               extensive wilderness, with some valuable tim- 
               <br />
               ber limits, if not much farming land, through 
               <br />
               which this road will have to pass, and every 
               <br />
               acre of land within twenty or thirty miles of 
               <br />
               the road will be largely increased in value. 
               <br />
               New Brunswick would gain that advanta , 
               <br />
               while as for Nova Scotia, Halifax, its chief 
               <br />
               port, will be made an outlet by the construc-

               tion of the line, and will of course be largely 
               <br />
               beneﬁted, so that they were only proposing 
               <br />
               what was fair and equitable; but in coming 
               <br />
               down with a scheme which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">involves</span> us in

               twice as great an expenditure as was formerly
