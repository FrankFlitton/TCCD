               land friendly relations had been maintained

               were before, with the exception, perhaps, of

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> scheme. Why should it? 
               <br />
               What is it that increases the value of stocks 
               <br />
               and depreeiates them? Is it not the conﬁ-

               dence of ca italits who have invested in 
               <br />
               them, that e interest will be paid. But 
               <br />
               under this Confederation scheme will not 
               <br />
               our expenses be increased? This Intercolo— 
               <br />
               nial Railway must be built and kept up, and 
               <br />
               this must be at the cost of Canada. You 
               <br />
               have got your local governments to keep up, 
               <br />
               and you have got your Confederate Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to keep up, and if we look at the ex- 
               <br />
               perience of the past, is it likely there will 
               <br />
               be any reduction in the future? (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I have got ﬁgures here to shew what 
               <br />
               the cost of the two governments was before the 
               <br />
               union of the provinces. The whole expense 
               <br />
               of the government of Lower Canada, with the 
               <br />
               salaries of oﬁeers, &amp;o., was £57,618. In Up- 
               <br />
               per Canada we were as economical. We were 
               <br />
               then under the rule of the Family Com ct, 
               <br />
               and a worse compact we might have. ( ear, 
               <br />
               hear, and laughter.) They were high-mind- 
               <br />
               ed, and they did not stoo to matters of cor- 
               <br />
               ruption, as others have one since. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The whole expenses of the two gov- 
               <br />
               ernments were only a little over £100,000 a 
               <br />
               year. What are they now ? Some two years 
               <br />
               ago” the expenses of the civil government 
               <br />
               alone, not including the cost of the militia, 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">83,000,000.</span> - Here, in a little more 
               <br />
               than twenty years, the expenses have in- 
               <br />
               creased seven-fold, notwithstanding that we 
               <br />
               have only one Government. Now, what are 
               <br />
               we to expect from the Confederate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment? Every honorable member knows 
               <br />
               that things must be made pleasant for every-

               and you must either employ or pension them. 
               <br />
               Are we to suppose that because there is a 
               <br />
               Federation, these expenses will be lessened? 
               <br />
               I admit that in the Lower Provinces they 
               <br />
               have managed their aﬂ'airs with less expense 
               <br />

               <br />
               local governments to ay for. We will 
               <br />
               have another staﬂ' to keep up for each pro- 
               <br />
               vince, which will add very materially to our 
               <br />
               expenses. The money must come out of the 
               <br />
               pockets of the people, who will have to pay 
               <br />
               it either by direct or indirect taxation. 
               <br />
               What possible diﬁ‘erence can it make to the 
               <br />
               people of this country, whether they pay it 
               <br />
               directly by taxation or in duties? Direct 
               <br />
               taxation must be imposed, and that to a large 
               <br />
               extent, by the local governments.

               one word about the principle of changing the

               <br />
               there should be an appeal to the country— 
               <br />
               before it is carried into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect.</span> A point 
               <br />
               which I did not enter fully into before the 
               <br />
               recess was the argument that Confederation 
               <br />
               would strengthen the connection with the 
               <br />

               imperial government will sanction the scheme, 
               <br />
               but it is the policy now of that Government

               Under Secretary of State for the Colonies 
               <br />
               to his constituents ? In speaking of this 
               <br />
               scheme, he said it was favored by the Imperial
