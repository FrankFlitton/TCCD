               <br />
               a legislative union. This fact ought to add

               <br />
               statement, the case of New Zealand. New 
               <br />
               Zealand is composed of three islands, divided 
               <br />
               into eleven provinces, each of which possesses 
               <br />
               a sort of municipal council which is called 
               <br />
               a government, just as the municipalities are 
               <br />
               called provinces. Each province has a head 
               <br />
               or executive ofﬁcer, elected by the people, 
               <br />
               and charged with the carrying out of the 
               <br />
               laws. The municipal councils have the power 
               <br />
               of legislating, but their powers are restricted 
               <br />
               within very narrow limits. They cannot in- 
               <br />
               terfere even with the laws relating to wills 
               <br />
               and successions, whilst, on the other hand, the 
               <br />
               Central Government has the right to legislate 
               <br />
               on all matters affecting the colony. The po- 
               <br />
               litical system of New Zealand is exactly like 
               <br />
               our county and arish municipal system. 
               <br />
               Our county municipalities represent the cen- 
               <br />
               tral power, and our parish municipalities re- 
               <br />
               present the local governments. Had the hon.

               stitution of Belgium, he would have seen that 
               <br />
               there, there are provinces which each have a 
               <br />
               Governor and a Local Parliament, and these 
               <br />
               parliaments have much greater powers than 
               <br />
               the local councils in New Zealand, and are 
               <br />
               much more important; yet no one has ever 
               <br />
               ventured to assert that Belgium was a Con- 
               <br />
               federation, although it was divided into pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Neither is the French Empire a Con- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
