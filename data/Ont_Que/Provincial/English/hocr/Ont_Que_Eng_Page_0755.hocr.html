               I could quote also from the essays written 
               <br />
               at that time by the member for South Lanark

               dented progress which was being made by 
               <br />
               Canada at that time. And what was the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst thing to mar that prosperity? I wish to 
               <br />
               call the attention of honorable gentlemen to 
               <br />
               the fact, that the ﬁrst step in bringing about 
               <br />
               the embarrassment we are now laboring 
               <br />
               under, was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repealzof</span> the Usury laws. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, the bill of the honorable 
               <br />
               member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. BROWN) 
               <br />
               in 1853, took away the penalty attached to 
               <br />
               lending money at usurious rates. Money was 
               <br />
               then got freely—farmers and others borrowed 
               <br />
               heavily—and we commenced our downward 
               <br />
               career. Afterwards all restrictions on the 
               <br />
               lending of money were taken oﬁ'. At <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span> 
               <br />
               people could get money at six per cent., but 
               <br />
               afterwards capital came in from abroad, and 
               <br />
               the country was ﬂooded with money, but at 
               <br />
               unlimited interest. I appeal to honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, who represent the farming por- 
               <br />
               tions Of Upper Canada—I appeal to honor- 
               <br />
               able members for Lower Canada, if the 
               <br />
               can rise in their places and say that the 
               <br />
               condition of this country at present is not 
               <br />
               deplorable; that there is not an amount of 
               <br />
               private indebtedness which is frightful to con- 
               <br />
               template ? And why is this ? It is because 
               <br />
               so many are borrowing money on account of 
               <br />
               the facility of obtaining it at high rates; 
               <br />
               then, getting embarrassed, they borrow for 
               <br />
               three or four years more at 15 or 20 per 
               <br />
               cent; next they have to borrow at 30 or 40 
               <br />
               per cent, and ﬁnally are stripped of their 
               <br />
               property and ruined.
