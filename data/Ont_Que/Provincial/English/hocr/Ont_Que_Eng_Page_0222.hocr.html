               brought forward in favor of this scheme, is 
               <br />
               that it will strengthen the connection with 
               <br />
               the Mother Country. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, I yield to no one in 
               <br />
               saying that that connection ought not to be 
               <br />
               broken. I say we are inﬁnitely better here 
               <br />
               under the ﬂag of Great Britain than under 
               <br />
               that of the United States. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But no reason is assigned; we are not told 
               <br />
               in what way the connection is to be strength- 
               <br />
               ened. Can you alter the geographical posi-

               increased, nor is your population, nor is your 
               <br />
               geographical position altered. Is it because 
               <br />
               the people of the Lower Provinces are ready 
               <br />
               to expend a large sum for the defence of the 
               <br />
               country? Why, to show you what those

               provinces consider it necessary to do in this

               dto. Well, on the 7th of November as I 
               <br />
               said, the quotation was 86 to 90, and I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that on the 25th November, giving time for 
               <br />
               the news to reach England, it was only 88 
               <br />
               to 92. And now, with a strong probability 
               <br />
               of the measure passin , what is the price?
