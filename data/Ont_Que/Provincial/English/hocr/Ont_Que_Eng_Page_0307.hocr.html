               on a previous occasion, pursued a diﬂ'erent 
               <br />
               course. I well recollect that when I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span> it 
               <br />
               was the determination to introduce the elect- 
               <br />
               ive principle in relation to the membership of 
               <br />
               . this House, I said—Gentlemen, if the princi- 
               <br />
               leisgoodinonecase,itisgoodin another; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{et</span> us make the Speaker elective. No, no, 
               <br />
               they said, that will not do ; that is republi- 
               <br />
               .canism.- They would not have the Speaker 
               <br />
               made elective. You know there was a little 
               <br />
               patronage at disposal by kee ing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appoint</span> 
               <br />
               ment of the Speaker in the vernment. At 
               <br />
               that time I could make no progress in getting 
               <br />
               the House to go for making the Speaker <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elect</span> 
               <br />
               ive. Since then, however, they made the 
               <br />
               Speaker elective, and therefore the House 
               <br />
               must admit that I was right on that occasion. 
               <br />
               I opposed the House being made elective, but 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen made it elective, and 
               <br />
               now they are going to reinvest the appoint- 
               <br />
               ments in the Crown. So it is clear that when 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst change was made I was also right on 
               <br />
               that occasion. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
               <br />
               When the proposal was made to grant three 
               <br />
               millions of money to the Grand Trunk, I saw 
               <br />
               it was being done for political support, and I 
               <br />
               therefore opposed it. I also opposed the 
               <br />
               grants to the Arthabaska, and Port Hope and 
               <br />
               Peterborough railways, because I considered 
               <br />
               them only convenient methods of acquiring 
               <br />
               parliamentary support on the pretence of get- 
               <br />
               ting money for the Grand Trunk proper. 
               <br />
               Those roads were termed “ feeders” for the 
               <br />
               Grand Trunk, but I called them Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               “suckers." (Laughter.) I take to myself 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> little credit for having taken this view 
               <br />
               of those questions. I am willing to admit 
               <br />
               that the Grand Trunk is a very great beneﬁt 
               <br />
               to the province in a material point of view, 
               <br />
               but I do believe that we paid very dearly for 
               <br />
               the whistle. (Laughter.) Having paid so 
               <br />
               dearly for that road, running, as it does, 
               <br />
               through the very ﬁnest portion of the coun- 
               <br />
               try, I am disposed to be very cautious about 
               <br />
               entering upon the construction of this Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway. (Hear, hear.) I have often 
               <br />
               availed myself of a leaf out of the book of my 
               <br />
               honorable friend (Hon. Mr. Ross) and I like 
               <br />
               to stick pretty close by him, because if I get 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> the track he has the happy faculty of put- 
               <br />
               ting me on again. Now, I would like to ask 
               <br />
               him whether or not, in the remarks he made 
               <br />
               this afternoon, he stated that there had been 
               <br />
               no demand on the part of the people for an 
               <br />
               elective Legislative Council since the union.

               ple, and then inside of ten years, when their

               <br />
               had worked so admirably, they could again
