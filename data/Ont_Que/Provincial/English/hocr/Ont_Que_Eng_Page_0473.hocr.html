               Scotia have increased 8100,000 each—being

               <br />

               standing 'that dead-lock. I am not sure but 
               <br />
               the province would do better if this House

               were closed u for ten years and hon. 
               <br />
               members sent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about</span> their business. (Ironical 
               <br />
               ministerial cheers.) Then it has been said 
               <br />
               that we are bound to accept this scheme, if 
               <br />
               we cannot show some better means of getting

               <br />
               exemplify the virtue of resignation—let

               them leave their places in the front. ranks of

               this, and I have no hesitation in saying that 
               <br />
               parties in this country are not so bitterly 
               <br />
               hostile but a government or any number of 
               <br />
               governments could be formed to carry on 
               <br />
               the affairs of the country. (Hear, hear.)

               Hon. gentlemen who have been in the front

               of the political affairs of this country for 
               <br />
               years back, have fancied that the whole of 
               <br />
               the political wisdom of the country was 
               <br />
               centred in them, and that this country must

               of necessity go to ruin, if they were not at 
               <br />
               the helm ot affairs. This, I think, is claim-

               that they are not exceedingly able men. But

               so much opposed and viliﬁed by the

               them, these pure patriots from our section

               At one time, and it was not long since, this

               country was agitated from one end to the

               province, and now those who made this state-

               ment wish to add millions more to the debt 
               <br />

               (Hear, hear.) Now, if the Honorable Pro-

               vincial Secretary was sincere in his argument 
               <br />
               that retrenchment was necœsa to save us 
               <br />
               from ruin, how can he reconcile it with his 
               <br />
               sense of duty and propriety that he should 
               <br />
               be found advocating this vast extravagance at

               <br />
               prosperity that should make us exceedingly 
               <br />
               careful how we adopt experimental <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change;</span> 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd honorable gentlemen complaining of 
               <br />
               the incapacity of our railways to meet the 
               <br />
               commercial requirements made upon them— 
               <br />
               to do the business pf the countr properly. 
               <br />
               It is true the crops are not so a undant as 
               <br />
               they were; no foresight or management will 
               <br />
               ensure us a plentiful harvest, but still, even 
               <br />
               according to these honorable gentlemen, the 
               <br />
               trade of the pnovince is growing, and their 
               <br />
               statements altogether in this respect do not 
               <br />
               show that we are going to ruin. A peeple
