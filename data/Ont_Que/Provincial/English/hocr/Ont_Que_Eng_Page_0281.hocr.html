               I think, the proportion which Upper Canada 
               <br />
               would have to pay of the increased expendi-

               ture which must immediately ensue from the 
               <br />
               adoption of Confederation which is proposed to 
               <br />
               free Upper Canada from a' larger expenditure 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               will have to be paid even with Confederation, 
               <br />
               if it takes place, does not amount to more
