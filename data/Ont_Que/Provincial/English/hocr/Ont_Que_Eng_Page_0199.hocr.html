               <br />
               Let a fair and equitable system of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion be proposed, and let the people have an

               opportunity of examining into it and approv-

               ing of it, and then no man will shrink from 
               <br />
               the necessity of making the greatest sacriﬁces 
               <br />
               to defend the Constitution which has been 
               <br />
               freely accepted by the people. It may be said 
               <br />
               that the people would be compelled to march 
               <br />
               at the point of the bayonet; but the risk of 
               <br />
               such a course is great, for the arm is but 
               <br />
               feeble when it is not animated by the heart, 
               <br />
               and to defend a country effectually the heart 
               <br />
               of the people must be in the cause. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister stated that the-object of Con- 
               <br />
               federation was to strengthen the monarchical 
               <br />
               principle in this country. I do not see that 
               <br />
               it is necessary to confer upon the Crown greater 
               <br />
               privileges than it already possesses in En land 
               <br />
               itself. In England the members of the ease 
               <br />
               of Lords are not appointed by the Crown; 
               <br />
               succession in the peerage goes down hereditary 
               <br />
               from father to son; but here it is proposed 
               <br />
               that the members of the Legislative Council, 
               <br />
               which bod corresponds to the House of 
               <br />
               Lords, sho dbe selected by the Crown. Why 
               <br />
               should this be ? Why go beyond what is 
               <br />
               done in England itself? Is it that the Crown 
               <br />
               complains that it has not snﬂicient power here ? 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> As to the statement that it is proposed to

               <br />
               not of opinion that the American people are 
               <br />

               of it to put that doctrine into practice. Since

               <br />
               the case. In conclusion, I would implore the 
               <br />
               Government to grant to the people the time 
               <br />
               and the o portunity of convincing themselves 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution</span> which it has prepared is 
               <br />
               agood one, and that ithas really been planned

               with a view to their interests; and, in that 
               <br />
               case, I predict that when the time for defence 
               <br />
               comes, the ple will march like one man. 
               <br />
               But if it is intended to thrust it upon them 
               <br />
               by main force, and without consulting them, 
               <br />
               we must not, we cannot, expect them to defend 
               <br />
               their land with the like zeal. I consider that 
               <br />
               this demand is no more than just, both to 
               <br />
               ourselves and to the people whom we re t. 
               <br />
               So far as I myself am concerned, I 'd not 
               <br />
               come here to ﬁght against Confederation and 
               <br />
               destroy it at any price, but I certainly will 
               <br />
               not vote for it without being acquainted with

               gentlemen, the discussion on the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation has already been protracted, 
               <br />
               and little really remains to be said, for all 
               <br />
               the objections to the scheme have been 
               <br />
               made by the one side and replied to by the 
               <br />
               other. I may, however, be permitted to 
               <br />
               offer a few remarks on one or two of the ob— 
               <br />
               jections which were urged again yesterday. 
               <br />
               For the last three years the country has 
               <br />
               witnessed a state of things which by many 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persons</span> has been designated governmental 
               <br />
               anarchy. Government after government in 
               <br />
               rapid succession have grasped the helm of 
               <br />
               state. A state of conﬂict existed between 
               <br />
               political parties which was hourly on the 
               <br />
               increase; a conﬂict which threatened to 
               <br />
               arrest the progress of public business, and 
               <br />
               which drew the minds of our statesmen to 
               <br />
               consider whether any means could be adopted' 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remedy</span> this state of things. The men 
               <br />
               of inﬂuence throughout the country at 
               <br />
               length decided to unite, and have come to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that a remedy was to be 
               <br />
               found in a Confederation of the British 
               <br />
               American Provinces. It is not to be won- 
               <br />
               dered at that this plan should have attracted 
               <br />
               the attention of the present Administration, 
               <br />
               for it was not a new one, and the question 
               <br />
               had already been brought before the country
