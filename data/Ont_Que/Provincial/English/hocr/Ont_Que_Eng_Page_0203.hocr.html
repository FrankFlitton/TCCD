               I cannot refrain from saying a word as to 
               <br />
               the Protestants of Lower Canada, and as to 
               <br />
               the liberality evinced towards them by the 
               <br />
               French and Catholic population. It is 
               <br />
               feared that we may combine together in 
               <br />
               order to treat them unjustly. I may be 
               <br />
               wrong in referring to the fact, but it is true 
               <br />
               that the French Canadians have always lived 
               <br />
               on more cordial terms with the English 
               <br />
               Protestants than with the Irish, who are 
               <br />
               nevertheless of the same religion, and of the 
               <br />
               same belief as themselves. If this good feel- 
               <br />
               ing has always existed, what is there to fear? 
               <br />
               The hon. member for Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               OLIVIER) has said, that the plan of Con- 
               <br />
               federation was not necessary, and in that he 
               <br />
               reed with the hon. member for Grand- 
               <br />
               ville (Hon. Mr. Ls'rELLIsa). He has stated 
               <br />
               . that it would have been possible to regulate 
               <br />
               the difﬁculties which we have witnessed, 
               <br />
               without having recourse to Confederation, 
               <br />
               from the fact that many of these difﬁculties 
               <br />
               arose from the hatred existing between cer- 
               <br />
               tain individuals. Now, for my part, I do 
               <br />
               not believe that our political men were 
               <br />
               actuated by motives of mutual hatred. W hen 
               <br />
               I witnessed the struggles which occurred in 
               <br />
               the House of Assembly, the votes of want 
               <br />
               of conﬁdence which were proposed, I always 
               <br />
               felt that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> who proposed them gave good 
               <br />
               reasons for so doing. But I was not aware 
               <br />
               of the existence of hatred or personal 
               <br />
               jealousy between the parties, and that upon 
               <br />
               the removal of such feelings, the difﬁculties 
               <br />
               might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Le</span> easily overcome. But the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sate-</span> 
               <br />
               ment is made simply for want of any sound 
               <br />
               arguments against Confederation. The same 
               <br />
               hon. member also stated, that the minorities 
               <br />
               in Upper and Lower Canada wished to 
               <br />
               know the fate reserved for them, before 
               <br />
               voting for Confederation. If he had reﬂect- 
               <br />
               ed a little, he would have learned that the 
               <br />
               fate of the minorities will be deﬁned by the 
               <br />
               law, that their religion is guaranteed by 
               <br />
               treaties, and that they will be protected by the 
               <br />
               vigilance of the Federal Government, which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">witl</span> never permit the minority of one por- 
               <br />
               tion of the Confederation to be oppressed 
               <br />
               by the majority. The hon. member also 
               <br />
               contends that the local governments ought 
               <br />
               to have larger powers than those preposed 
               <br />
               to be conferred upon them, and that the 
               <br />
               Federal Government ought to have fewer 
               <br />
               powers. To hear him, one cannot help 
               <br />
               thinking that the experience of history is 
               <br />
               entirely lost on certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">individuals.</span> He 
               <br />
               must have been aware, however, that it is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span>

               this country the same germ of discord. He 
               <br />
               would have more power below and less

               very contrary, if we wish to have a strong

               <br />

               HON. SIR. N. F. BELLEAU—That 
               <br />
               makes no difference ; for he stated that he 
               <br />
               feared the Government would be surrounded 
               <br />
               by a clique. But is it not the national 
               <br />
               representation that will surround the Federal 
               <br />
               Government? Is that a clique? To say 
               <br />
               that our Government is a clique, is to vilit’y 
               <br />
               the institutions of the country. The Govern- 
               <br />
               ment will be responsible to the Legislature. 
               <br />
               Let us never lose sight of the fact, that our 
               <br />
               national representatives will always see that 
               <br />
               Lower Canada shall have in the Federal 
               <br />
               Government one, or perhaps two, representa— 
               <br />
               tives—the number is not of importance. 
               <br />
               What is of importance is, that such one, or 
               <br />
               such two members, should represent in her 
               <br />
               Executive Council the national representa- 
               <br />
               tion, which will be composed of 65 members, 
               <br />
               in the Federal Legislature. And this, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-</span> 
               <br />
               sooth, is called a clique l I insist somewhat 
               <br />
               at length upon this point, because the opera— 
               <br />
               tion of the principle of responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment in the Federal Legislature is lost sight 
               <br />
               of. I beg to call the attention of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada members to this. Suppose it were 
               <br />
               proposed to adopt a law in the Federal Legis— 
               <br />
               lature calculated to injure Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               our 65 representatives in the House of 
               <br />
               Commons discuss the law, and decide that 
               <br />
               they must oppose it; they at once commu— 
               <br />
               nicate with the members of the Government 
               <br />
               representing Lower Canada, and inform them 
               <br />
               that they cannot accept the measure, and 
               <br />
               that if it be passed, they will coalesce with 
               <br />
               the minority, which always exists under 
               <br />
               responsible government, and that they will 
               <br />
               overthrow the Ministry. Such is the weight 
               <br />
               of our inﬂuence in the Federal Government; _ 
               <br />
               and if this were not lost sight of, there
