               is the sort o liberty which a French colony 
               <br />
               may enjoy under the colonial system of 
               <br />
               England, when the colony is weak and is not 
               <br />
               situated, as Canada is, in the vicinity of a 
               <br />
               powerful republic such as the United States. 
               <br />
               I think, Mr. SPEAKER, that I have now 
               <br />
               shewn what has ever been the spirit of an- 
               <br />
               tagonism between the two races of English 
               <br />
               and French origin, on the two continents, 
               <br />
               and what has been the spirit of aggression 
               <br />
               of the English element against our popula- 
               <br />
               tion, from the founding of the colony up to 
               <br />
               our own time; we have seen colonial fanati- 
               <br />
               cism attacking our institutions, our language 
               <br />
               and our laws, and we have seen that our 
               <br />
               annihilation as a race has been the evident 
               <br />
