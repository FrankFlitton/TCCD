               anxious to enforce the details of the project

               the people were opposed to the project, I do 
               <br />
               not think that England would approve of

               <br />

               <br />
               The opinion of the country upon this p an is, 
               <br />
               to-day, quite unknown. I am quite aware 
               <br />
               that certain members can vote in favor of the 
               <br />
               project with the certain of their course 
               <br />
               meeting the approval of their constituents; for

               instance, those whose elections have taken

               place since the plan was submitted to the 
               <br />
               country. But in those parts of the country 
               <br />
               where no elections have taken place, it is im- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pouible</span> to say that the people will be satisﬁed

               <br />
               could not tell them what the plan of Con- 
               <br />
               federation was; that I could notecmmunicate 
               <br />
               it to them, because the resolutions I had 
               <br />
               received were private. I also told them that 
               <br />
               I did not wish to form my opinion before 
               <br />
               hearing the discussion and learning the de- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               the e will see that we cannot vote for a

               we shall adopt. When the project of Con-

               people of this country approve of it; but 
               <br />
               they will never suppose that the measure has 
               <br />
               been forced upon the people without affording 
               <br />
               them the op rtunity of pronouncing for or 
               <br />

               this the Local and Federal Governments have 
               <br />
               the power conferred on them of adding new 
               <br />
               taxes to those which already exist in order to 
               <br />
               meet the expenditure; and I have no doubt 
               <br />
               whatever but that they will avail themselves 
               <br />
               of that permission. All this is deœrving of 
               <br />
               consideration, and these are reasons which 
               <br />
               should induce the Government to submit the 
               <br />
               question to the pie, instead of wishing 
               <br />
               to have it decid at once; for, even allow- 
               <br />
               ing the measure to be absolutely a good one, 
               <br />
               the people will always regard it with mis- 
               <br />
               trust if it is thrust upon them. What! we 
               <br />
               are told that we are perhaps on the eve of 
               <br />
               a war with our neighbors, and we run the risk 
               <br />
               of dissatisfying the people by imposing asystem 
               <br />
               upon them to which they are perhaps opposed. 
               <br />
               It is not only in the district of Montreal that 
               <br />
               the submission of the question to the peeple is 
               <br />
               called for—the Toronto Leader as s that the 
               <br />
               people ought to be consulted, and ° appears 
               <br />
               to me to be most reasonable. For my part, I 
               <br />
               am in favor of an appeal to the people, and I 
               <br />
               cannot approve of Confederation being thrust 
               <br />
               upon them without their being consulted. 
               <br />
               Let it be well understood, if it is wished that 
               <br />
               the population should make sacriﬁces for its
