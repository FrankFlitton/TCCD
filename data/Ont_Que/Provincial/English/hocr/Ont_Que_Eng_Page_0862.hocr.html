               having formed that opinion of the honorable

               ber also told us that the Government had 
               <br />

               <br />
               had examined the question of Confederation

               from the stand-point of the ﬁve parties to the

               tate to say that if our French-Canadian Min—

               ined the question from a Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               point of view—since they were charged with 
               <br />
               the protection of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interestsT-it</span> is highly 
               <br />
               probable that many things unfavorable to

               those interests, which the scheme now pre— 
               <br />
               sents, would have been removed. But the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Vaudreuil must know 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Low</span> er Canadian Ministers at the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference</span> ought to have gone there to re- 
               <br />
               present the interests of their fellow—country- 
               <br />
               men, and to defend those interests if neces- 
               <br />
               sary, in the same way that the representatives 
               <br />
               of the other nationalities went there to repre- 
               <br />
               sent those of their fellow—countrymen ; and the 
               <br />
               event shows but too clearly how strenuously 
               <br />
               the latter worked for their own interests. 
               <br />
               The scheme of Confederation shows clearly 
               <br />
               that the English race have in this, as in every

               <br />

               Every confederation is a compromise, and 
               <br />
               where would be the compromise if nothing were 
               <br />
               conceded by both sides? The compromise made 
               <br />
               by Lower Canada is representation based upon 
               <br />

               <br />
               have just mentioned, and in my opinion it is 
               <br />
               no concession at all, since Lower Lanada had 
               <br />
               and still has the right to claim an equal repre- 
               <br />

               Let us now see what is the nature of the con— 
               <br />
               cessions made by Lower Canada to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. In the ﬁrst place, I ﬁnd this, the 
               <br />
               most important of all. and which by itself is 
               <br />
               worth all the rest—I mean the concession of 
               <br />
               representation based upon population. No
