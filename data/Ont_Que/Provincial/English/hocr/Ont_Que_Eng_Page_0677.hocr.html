               possible to ﬁnd, is the pivot on which 
               <br />
               the scheme revolves. If it be the desire

               route this road is to run should be made 
               <br />

               <br />
               The scheme of the hon. gentlemen, to some

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span> union, but it is incumbered with 
               <br />
               objectionable details—details which, in their 
               <br />
               importance, amount to principles, and to 
               <br />

               <br />
               employ what energy I can bring to hear. 
               <br />
               The scheme has been submitted to the 
               <br />
               people in New Brunswick, and it has there 
               <br />
               been admitted, as well as in Nova Scotia, that 
               <br />
               it was subject to amendment. Why should 
               <br />
               Canada not have the same right accorded? 
               <br />
               Why should we take the scheme in its en- 
               <br />
               tirety, when its authors cannot justify certain 
               <br />
               provisions which specially relate to this coun- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and hon. gentlemen will be held responsible. 
               <br />
               I have very great conﬁdence in several of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen opposite. I have very 
               <br />
               great conﬁdence in the Hon. President of the 
               <br />
               Council and the two other hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men whom he took into the Ministry with 
               <br />
               him. But, when the Hon. the President of 
               <br />
               the Council consented to go into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Ad-</span>

               ministration without getting a fair represent-

               <br />
               acting, both in Upper and in Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               he miscarried. (Laughter.) That may ac- 
               <br />
               count for some of the objectionable features 
               <br />
               of this measure. It may account for Canada 
               <br />
               consenting, and for the Hon. President of the 
               <br />
               Council giving his consent, that the voting 
               <br />
               at the Conference should be by provinces, 
               <br />
               instead of by numbers. They took very 
               <br />
               good care to arrange that we should pay 
               <br />
               according to population. (Hear, hear.) But 
               <br />
               they voted by provinces, and in that way 
               <br />
               hampered the scheme with many objectionable 
               <br />
               details. And I think, therefore, it is now 
               <br />
               competent for this House to criticise those 
               <br />
               details, and to take such steps as will en-

               sure their exclusion from the Imperial Act.
