               <br />
               the money in the winter, it is true, but how 
               <br />
               do we get it? By losing a large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount.</span> 
               <br />
               For my part, I do not believe in getting 
               <br />
               only 33. 9d. for a dollar’s worth of produce. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) And I am satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               when our farmers get to understand the 
               <br />
               question, they never will consent to be taxed 
               <br />
               for the construction of any such road. 
               <br />
               Taking the cost of transportation at two 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents</span> per ton per mile, and the distance from 
               <br />
               Halifax to Belleville at 831 miles, we ﬁnd it 
               <br />
               would cost $16.62 to transport a ton of goods 
               <br />
               between the two laces. And at such ﬁgures, 
               <br />
               does any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honorable</span> gentleman who has the 
               <br />
               slightest knowledge of commercial transac- 
               <br />
               tions believe for a moment that merchandise 
               <br />
               could be sent over the road at any such rates? 
               <br />
               Supposing you reduce the rate one cent, 
               <br />
               it would still cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">88.31,</span> which would pre- 
               <br />
               clude the possibility of carrying freight over 
               <br />
               the road ; so that, in a commercial point of 
               <br />
               view, the road would be perfectly useless. 
               <br />
               ltis true that under our present system of 
               <br />
               banking, our bankers endeavor to enforce on 
               <br />
               the purchasers of produce the necessity of 
               <br />
               immediate shipments and immediate sales, 
               <br />
               and with that view cause them to draw for 
               <br />
               their accommodation at short dates; but it 
               <br />
               is also true that by such a practice the lar- 
               <br />
               mer is in every instance the loser. The 
               <br />
               reason ol this custom is that the banks want 
               <br />
               uicker returns. But I contend that the 
               <br />
               banks should be prepared to advance money 
               <br />
               at such dates as will enable the producer to 
               <br />
               so sell his produce as to get from it a remu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nerative</span> return for his labor. But this it 
               <br />
               not done. It seems that the tendency of 
               <br />
               everything is to force freight down the rail- 
               <br />
               ways during the winter season, and to this 
               <br />
               end n oney is advanced at short dates, the 
               <br />
               farmer being the chief loser by the transac- 
               <br />
               tion. Then the Intercolonial Railway is 
               <br />
               advocated as a military necessity. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> 
               <br />
               that it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">essential</span> lor the defence of the 
               <br />
               country, to enable the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">transportation</span> of troops 
               <br />
               and militar stores. Ithin ,hou. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> to look across the lines and see 
               <br />
               what has taken place during the war in the 
               <br />
               State of Virginia and in other states, to 
               <br />
               convince us at once that for the purpose of 
               <br />
               moving troops and heavy supplies, such as 
               <br />
               artillery and ammunition, these roads are of 
               <br />
               very little use. You will ﬁnd that they 
               <br />
               have been cut in almost every direction, 
               <br />

               cut their wa wherever they wish to go. 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               were really the case that the country to be 
               <br />
               traversed by the Intercozonial Railway is of 
               <br />
               such a nature that no one could get through 
               <br />
               to it, the sooner we cease saying anything 
               <br />
               further about it the better. (Hear.) For 
               <br />
               if the country is in such a state that it is 
               <br />
               impossible for men to travel through it, I see 
               <br />
               no beneﬁt in having such a railway. (Hear. 
               <br />
               hear.) These are my views in reference to 
               <br />
               the railway. In the ﬁrst place I do not feel 
               <br />
               inclined to pay the large sum of money it is 
               <br />
               goin to cost, without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knowing</span> how much 
               <br />
               will e required. There is no nowing how 
               <br />
               much it will cost Upper Canada for her pro- 
               <br />
               portion—whether it is to be 812,000,000, 
               <br />
               315,000,000, or 320,000,000. But taking 
               <br />
               into consideration the amount of debt we 
               <br />
               will have to assume, together with our appor- 
               <br />
               tionment of the 862,500,000 assigned to 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada. as also that por- 
               <br />
               tion yet unprovided for by the resolutions; 
               <br />
               I think that by the time the Intercolo- 
               <br />
               nial Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ns</span> built, Upper Canada will be 
               <br />
               saddled with at least 850,000,000 as her 
               <br />
               share of debt. I do not see how it is pos- 
               <br />
               sible for the people to bear up under such a 
               <br />
               weight ; nor do I believe that, if the under- 
               <br />
               stood this matter as they ought to un erstand 
               <br />
               it, they would give their consent to us to 
               <br />
               vote for it. It may be thought, perhaps, that 
               <br />
               I am not in favor of Confederation. Butsuch 
               <br />
               is not the case. I would much desire the 
               <br />
               Federation of all the rovinces ; but while -

               should be based on true and proper princi-
