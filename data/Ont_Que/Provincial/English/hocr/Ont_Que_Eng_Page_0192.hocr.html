               express myself. I did, however, say at that

               <br />
               upon which it is asked to decide. For in- 
               <br />
               stance, it was stated in the resolutions, that 
               <br />
               means would be taken to effectually protect 
               <br />
               the minorities and preserve to them the rights 
               <br />
               they now possess, but we were not informed 
               <br />
               as to what those rights were, or as to the means 
               <br />
               to be used for preserving them untouched and 
               <br />
               unimpaired. If we had known what these

               means would be, we would have come pre- 
               <br />
               pared to assent to, or to dissent from them, in 
               <br />
               an intelligent manner, and to express our

               opinions as we ought to do, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> informa-

               tion was not vouchsafed. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand</span> that

               a bill, to assure to the Protestants of Lower

               Canada the uninterrupted possession and en- 
               <br />
               joyment of their rights, is to bebronght down 
               <br />
               and passed before the scheme of Federation 
               <br />
               itself is fully adopted and sanctioned; but I 
               <br />
               have not heard that any similar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure</span> is to 
               <br />
               be passed in favor of the Roman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics</span> of

               <br />
               able, but I cannot vote to adopt the resolu-

               tions until I am informed whether the Roman

               Catholics of the west are to be dealt with in

               the same manner. By refusing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> informa- 
               <br />
               tion on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tais</span> important subject, the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment has placed us in a false position, from 
               <br />
               which, I think, it is their duty to extricate 
               <br />
               us. I shall not new address myself to the in- 
               <br />
               quiry of whether the Confederation scheme bc 
               <br />
               really desirable or not, but cannot help saying 
               <br />
               that the long-standing difference <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">between</span> the 
               <br />
               two sections of the province might have been 
               <br />
               arranged, if during the last difﬁcult y between 
               <br />
               the respective parties the leading men on 
               <br />
               either side had been willing to sink their per- 
               <br />
               sonal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> and make mutual conces- 
               <br />
               sions. But as it is of no use now to refer to 
               <br />
               that subject, I will not argue the matter fur- 
               <br />
               ther. I maintain again, however. that the 
               <br />
               House has a right to expect the Government 
               <br />
               will 've us all the information in respect of 
               <br />
               the etails of the Confederation scheme as 
               <br />
               may be necessary to understand thoroughly all 
               <br />
               its provisions. My opinion is, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> as much 
               <br />
               power as possible should have been entrusted 
               <br />
               to the local governments, and as little as is 
               <br />
               consistent with the functions it will have to 
               <br />
               discharge to the Central Government, and my 
               <br />
               reason for entertaining this Opinion is, that 
               <br />
               the Supreme Government, with its wer of 
               <br />
               purse and its control of the armies, w' always
