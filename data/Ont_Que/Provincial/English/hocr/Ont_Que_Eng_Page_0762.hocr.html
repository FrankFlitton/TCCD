               proposed, and the proposition was endorsed 
               <br />
               and pressed by the Government, that this 
               <br />
               solemn agreement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be broken up, and

               of this House suspended until the debate 
               <br />
               should be brought to a close. In reference to 
               <br />
               that, I did oppose the course pursued, because 
               <br />
               I did not think it was for the interest of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ness of this House. We ﬁnd that several 
               <br />
               days were occupied in discussing whether that 
               <br />
               resolution should be adopted from day to 
               <br />
               day or not. Who is responsible for that 
               <br />
               discussion and delay ? Was it hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               on this side of the House, who desired to

               men on the Treasury benches, who sought to 
               <br />
               break up the agreement that had been entered 
               <br />
               into, of which they themselves were the

               acknowledgments to the Hon. Attorney Gen-

               <br />
               did give us the credit of being the only ones 
               <br />
               that had laid eggs that amounted to anything, 
               <br />
               the others being all addled, he might have re- 
               <br />
               ﬂected a little, and in doing so have found 
               <br />
               that the that these “ shanghais ” had 
               <br />
               laid will produce birds that in all probability 
               <br />

               <br />

               House around to their view of the question 
               <br />

               <br />
               formation of that kind in their possession, we 
               <br />
               should know what it is. (Hear, hear.) If 
               <br />
               we have a herculean labor before us to meet 
               <br />
               some approaching diﬁiculty, this House should 
               <br />
               know what that labor and that diﬁiculty is, 
               <br />
               that we may prepare to meet it as speedily 
               <br />
               and as bravely as possible. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I do not ﬁnd that the honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               are making any preparations for meeting the 
               <br />
               lack of defence under which they say the 
               <br />
               country exists, between the present time and 
               <br />
               the assembling of this House in the summer. 
               <br />
               And yet they bring the matter up to frighten 
               <br />
               the House into submission to their views. 
               <br />
               They have a puppet from which,'by keeping 
               <br />
               it suﬂiciently behind the screens, they throw 
               <br />
               a distorted shadow upon the wall and tell us 
               <br />
               to look at the giant; but when the shadow is 
               <br />
               traced to its origin, it will be found, I appre- 
               <br />
               hend, to be nothing but a puppet after all. 
               <br />
               If they were to come out boldly and give this 
               <br />
               House all the information of which they boast 
               <br />
               the possession, I am very much mistaken if 
               <br />
               the mystery would not turn out to be a mere 
               <br />
               scarecrow. They make agrcat cackling about 
               <br />
               the hawk, and then when the whole breed of 
               <br />
               chickens is gathered under their wings, it turns 
               <br />
               out that the source of their pretended fright 
               <br />
               is nothing but a harmless dove after all.
