               Upper House being that of New Brunswick, where 
               <br />
               there is a Liberal Administration, whose fate 
               <br />
               depends on the result of the elections now taking

               set terms that it was the Lower Provinces which 
               <br />
               did not want an elective Legislative Council? If,

               of the Lower Provinces, our Government had 
               <br />
               done what it engaged to do, namely— had itself

               prepared a Constitution, it would never have

               Tory Governments. Reckoning 15 to 20 years, 
               <br />
               as the average of the time each Legislative 
               <br />

               elapse before its composition could be entirely 
               <br />
               changed! We will have, thus, a Legislative

               <br />

               South Oxford (Honorable Mr. BROWN) has made 
               <br />

               difference would be that we would be bound by

               the Liberal arty generally will diﬁ‘er from him 
               <br />
               also. The overnment told us that they were

               <br />
               did not altogether please them, so as to come to

               an understanding With the Lower Province dele- 
               <br />
               gates, and that they bound themselves to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cause</span>

               the scheme to be adopted by this House without

               amendment. Does the hon. gentleman not see a

               only interested parties, the majority would act 
               <br />
               as they pleased, would examine minutel the

               <br />
               not suit them, and a proposition such as that 
               <br />
               relative to the Legislative Council would have no 
               <br />
               chance of being adOpted—it is too short a time 
               <br />
               ago since this House voted, by a crushing

               <br />
               for a Council nominated by the Crown. In fact, 
               <br />
               the Council named by the Crown had so fallen in 
               <br />

               <br />
               that it exercised no inﬂuence ; it was even difﬁcult

               had become absolutely necessary, and up to the
