               <br />
               not be desirable that the debate should close 
               <br />
               without a few words from this part of the 
               <br />
               House. And ﬁrst, a word with reference to 
               <br />
               the speech of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON). That 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman, in the course of his re- 
               <br />
               marks, said he had no personal feeling to- 
               <br />
               wards myself. I quite believe that, and I am 
               <br />
               entirely willing that the honorable gentleman 
               <br />

               the Hon. Provincial Secretary (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               MODOUGALL). I do not think that any of

               . HILLYARD CAMERON), I do say that any- 
               <br />
               thing more extraordinary than the line of ar- 
               <br />
               gument he took up here tonight, I never heard 
               <br />
               from any hon. member of this House. What 
               <br />
               was the position taken by the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               from Peel? He commenced by saying that 
               <br />
               justice to Upper Canada required the grant- 
               <br />
               ing of parliamentary reform, and that this 
               <br />
               scheme gave that measure of justice to 
               <br />
               Upper Canada. He said the province must 
               <br />
               be defended; that the question of the de- 
               <br />
               fence of this province was the most urgent 
               <br />
               and the most important question we had to 
               <br />
               consider at this moment, and that this mea- 
               <br />
               sure provided the best way of meeting that 
               <br />
               question of defence. He said that the threat- 
               <br />
               ened abolition of reciprocity with the United 
               <br />
               States required to be met—that the best in- 
               <br />
               terests Of this province would be imperilled 
               <br />
               by the repeal of the Reciprocity treaty— 
               <br />
               and that he conceived that this measure sup— 
               <br />
               plied the very best way of meeting that dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty. He said also that we cannot go on 
               <br />
               as we are—that it was quite impossible that 
               <br />
               the state of things which has existed in Ca- 
               <br />
               nada could continue—that there must be a 
               <br />
               change—and be conceived that what was pro- 
               <br />
               posed by this measure was a most desirable 
               <br />
               change. He said we had but one of two al- 
               <br />
               ternatives—a dissolution of the union, or the

               HON. MB. BROWN—I cannot speak as 
               <br />
               to that. Then the honorable gentleman went 
               <br />
               on to say that on all these grounds this mea- 
               <br />
               sure commended itself “ to every true lover 
               <br />
               of his country.” Yet, after having passed 
               <br />
               this high eulogium on the measure, what does 
               <br />
               he say ? Why, that he won’t have it now— 
               <br />
               that he won’t have it until it has been sent to 
               <br />
               the country, and the Opinion Of the electors 
               <br />
               has been Obtained upon it! He says there is 
               <br />
               danger of annexation to the United States if 
               <br />
               these difﬁculties are not met—that annexation 
               <br />
               is hanging over us—that this measure will 
               <br />
               deliver us from that dire fate—and yet he is 
               <br />
               not prepared to apply the remedy now l And 
               <br />
               what are the reasons of the honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               man for refusing to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂ‘ect</span> to a measure 
               <br />
               of which he professes to be so enamoured? 
               <br />
               Does he, like the honorable member for 
               <br />
               North Ontario, deny the power Of Parliament 
               <br />
               to pass such a measure? Not at all; he 
               <br />
               admits we have full power to pass it. Does 
               <br />
               he personally entertain any doubt as to the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt from passing it now? On the con- 
               <br />
               trary, he is enthusiastically for the measure, 
               <br />
               and declares that he would vote for it, just as 
               <br />
               it stands, as an elector at the polls. Does he 
               <br />
               want delay? On the contrary, he demands 
               <br />
               that the measure shall be urged on with all 
               <br />
               speed. (Hear, hear.) He says the sooner 
               <br />
               the members of Government are in Eng- 
               <br />
               land the better for the peOple of Canada-— 
               <br />
               that this question of Federation, and the 
               <br />
               question of defence, and the question of 
               <br />
               American reciprocity, should be urged on the 
               <br />
               British Government without one hour’s un- 
               <br />
               necessary delay. He protests that on the

               fate of this measure some Of the most vital 
               <br />
               interests of the province depend, and yet he 
               <br />
               will not have it until months Of valuable time 
               <br />
               have been lost, until the country has been
