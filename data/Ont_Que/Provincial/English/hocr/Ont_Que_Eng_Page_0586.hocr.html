               against the honorable member; for if, in a 
               <br />
               country like Belgium, in which every fourth 
               <br />
               person you meet is a beggar, it has been 
               <br />
               found requisite to make the elective franchise

               and the electoral qualiﬁcation of the senators 
               <br />
               so high, it is a proof that he has made a 
               <br />
               bad selection of examples ; it is a proof that 
               <br />
               the tendencies of Belgium are conservative. 
               <br />
               Why, then, should we adopt another course

               in Canada, where there is not one beggar

               HON. Ma. EVANTUREL—Will the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Montmorenci allow 
               <br />
               me to interrupt him in his argument 
               <br />
               in relation to the qualiﬁcations and ap- 
               <br />
               pointment of the legislative councillors. 
               <br />
               Like him, I am quite of Opinion that the con- 
               <br />
               servative element ought, of necessity, to be 
               <br />
               the basis of the Legislative Council, to coun- 
               <br />
               terbalance the popular element. This princi- 
               <br />
               ple governed the constitution of the House of 
               <br />
               Lords in England, that of the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council in Belgium, and that of every well- 
               <br />
               organized representative government. It is 
               <br />
               that element of conservatism which I desire 
               <br />
               to see introduced into the Constitution of 
               <br />
               the Confederation now before us; but the hon- 
               <br />
               orable member for Montmorency will allow 
               <br />
               me to remark that the whole of his argument 
               <br />
               applies only to the antagonism which might 
               <br />
               arise between the two branches of the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture, ina monarchical government like that of 
               <br />
               Belgium, which is not based on a Federative 
               <br />
               system like that now submitted to us by the 
               <br />
               Government. But we have not only to avoid 
               <br />
               the diﬁ'erences which might arise between 
               <br />
               the conservative and the popular elements;

               we have also to protect the rights of the

               of the proposed Confederation. That is 
               <br />
               the all important question we have to con- 
               <br />
               sider. We have accorded the principle of 
               <br />
               representation based upon pe ulation in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons of the ederal Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and that is without doubt a great sacri- 
               <br />
               ﬁce; but we ought only to make so important 
               <br />
               a concession on the condition that we shall 
               <br />
               have equality of representation in the Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive Council, and the right reserved to our- 
               <br />
               selves to appoint our twenty-four legislative 
               <br />
               councillors, in order that they may be respon- 
               <br />
               sible to the public opinion of the province and 
               <br />
               independent of the Federal Government.— 
               <br />
               Without this essential guarantee I afﬁrm that 
               <br />
               the rights of Lower Canada are in danger. 
               <br />
               For my part I am ready, on behalf of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, to give up her right to elect directl 
               <br />
               her twenty-four legislative councillors, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a?-</span> 
               <br />
               though the retention of the elective principle 
               <br />
               might perhaps be the surest means of pre- 
               <br />
               serving our institutions; but I am anxious 
               <br />
               that the new Constitution now proposed 
               <br />
               should give as adequate guarantees that the 
               <br />
               legislative councillors to be appointed for 
               <br />
               life should, at all events, be selected by the 
               <br />
               Local Government of Lower Canada, which 
               <br />
               would be responsible to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maple.</span> These 
               <br />
               not ill-grounded sources of anxiety I should 
               <br />
               like to see removed. I would bespeak the 
               <br />
               earnest attention of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency to this point, which is of the 
               <br />
               very highest importance to us Lower Cana- 
               <br />
               dians; and I hope that he will pardon me for 
               <br />
               having interrupted him, and that he will be 
               <br />
               in a position to give me such an answer as 
               <br />
               will dissipate the anxiety which I am aware
