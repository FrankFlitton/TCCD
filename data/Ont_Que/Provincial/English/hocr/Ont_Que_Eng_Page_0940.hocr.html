               speech, since he declared that they were men 
               <br />
               of the very highest order of merit, and de— 
               <br />
               served the greatest possible praise for the 
               <br />
               works and improvements they had carried out. 
               <br />
               Now this is indeed peculiarly gratifying to one 
               <br />
               in my position, after contending for years 
               <br />
               with the party of the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Richelieu, and opposing them because 
               <br />
               they constantly strove to excite popular pre- 
               <br />
               judice against all improvement and every 
               <br />
               great undertaking. I shall have occasion to 
               <br />
               exhibit to the House the means resorted to 
               <br />
               by that party, in order to prejudice the peo- 
               <br />
               ple against every man who labored in behalf of 
               <br />
               real progress, and I shall endeavor to con- 
               <br />
               trast the prejudices they appealed to ten years 
               <br />
               ago with those they are now striving to ex- 
               <br />
               cite. (Hear, hear.) The honorable member 
               <br />
               for Richelieu also stated that since the union 
               <br />
               we had advanced the settlement of our town- 
               <br />
               ships, and that this is why he wishes us to 
               <br />
               remain as we are at present. He says the 
               <br />
               union has not completed its work. He is 
               <br />
               right, only it is unfortunate that he and his 
               <br />
               party should not have succeeded in making 
               <br />
               that discovery a few years ago; it is unfortu- 
               <br />
               nate that they should only make that dis- 
               <br />
               covery now, when they themselves and the 
               <br />
               whole people are convinced that a change in 
               <br />
               the Constitution is unavoidably necessary— 
               <br />
               for we French-Canadians, a minority in the 
               <br />
               country, cannot dictate to the majority. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I shall not endeavor to excite 
               <br />
               popular prejudices, as the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Richelieu has done. I do not desire to 
               <br />
               be too severe with the honorable member, or 
               <br />
               to condemn him too strongly; for his mode 
               <br />
               of treating this question may be simply the 
               <br />
               result of some peculiarity of mental organiza-

               he want to bring about the ruin of this

               youth and inexperience, has rendered us a 
               <br />
               very questionable service. (Hear, hear.) He

               rakes up an event which occurred one hun- 
               <br />
               dred years ago, and taunts a conquering na-

               serving his fellow-countrymen—of laboring

               to promote their welfare and interests! Am

               ber has displayed an utter want of tact and 
               <br />
               experience? I trust, for the honorable mem-

               ber’s own sake, that the charge of inexperi-

               ence is the heaviest charge to which he may

               sible that he was in any way actuated by 
               <br />
               malicious motives. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> the honorable member tells us that 
               <br />
               “the union has not yet done its work.” Is 
               <br />
               he not aware that the population of Upper

               <br />
               outnumber our own population in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince? What then does he mean? Can it 
               <br />
               be that he really thinks because the union 
               <br />
               has not ﬁnished its work, that it ought to be 
               <br />
               preserved, and that we ought to remain as 
               <br />
