               The intention of the Confederation scheme, 
               <br />
               we are told by the Ministry, is the formation 
               <br />

               <br />
               on one side, on the other by the Atlantic 
               <br />
               ocean, and on the south by the American 
               <br />
               Union, while on the north it would extend to 
               <br />
               the Pole, leaving Russian America on the 
               <br />
               west. No doubt the scheme is a grand one, 
               <br />
               magniﬁcent in conception, and likely to take 
               <br />
