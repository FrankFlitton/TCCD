               <br />

               <br />
               less, that the ﬁrst law took the burthen of 
               <br />
               the Seigniorial Tenure off the shoulders of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">censitaires,</span> and from that moment the seig- 
               <br />

               <br />
               beneﬁt of the censimires. I admit that the 
               <br />
               bill was defective, and in fact I voted against 
               <br />
               the Act of 1854; but I did not act like the 
               <br />
               honorable member, and my only object was 
               <br />
               to compel the Government to do better. The 
               <br />
               honorable member may say what he likes—I 
               <br />
               maintain that the demagogues did everything 
               <br />
               in their power to ruin us, in connectioh with 
               <br />
               that question, and they are doing the very 
               <br />
               same thing now as regards Confederation. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) We French-Canadians form 
               <br />
               to—day but one-third of the population, and 
               <br />
               despite the progress we have made under the 
               <br />
               union, any man of sense who reﬂects on the 
               <br />
               position we now occupy, must admit that we 
               <br />
               ought to be delighted to accept the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation, since it will give us the con- 
               <br />
               trol of our system of education, our institu- 
               <br />
               tions, and all the interests of Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) I have made a note with re- 
               <br />
               ference to the speech of one of my friends in 
               <br />
               this House—the hon. member for Beauce 
               <br />
               (Mr. TABCHEREAU). I was really'surprised 
               <br />
               to hear him express himself as he did with 
               <br />
               reference to this question of Confederation. 
               <br />
               I am quite sure he was sincere; but I must 
               <br />
               say I think he might have expressed his own 
               <br />
               opinions and refrained from adepting the 
               <br />
               false arguments in vogue on the other side 
               <br />
               of this House. (Hear, hear.) I feel that 
               <br />
               with a friend one must not be severe. Be- 
               <br />
               tween the honorable members for Drummond 
               <br />
               and Arthabaska and Richelieu, and myself, 
               <br />
               there need be no such reticence of expression; 
               <br />
               but with the hon. memberfor Beauce it is quite 
               <br />
               a different matter. He told us that Confed- 
               <br />
               eration would give the death-blow to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> 
               <br />
               tionality; but how can be possibly think so ? 
               <br />
               I can easily understand such arguments being 
               <br />
               used by honorable gentlemen opposite, because 
               <br />
               they are in the habit of distorting facts ; but 
               <br />
               I am pained to see the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Beauce resort to such tactics, for I am con- 
               <br />
               vinced that the legislative scparation about to 
               <br />
               take place under Confederation, cannot fail 
               <br />
