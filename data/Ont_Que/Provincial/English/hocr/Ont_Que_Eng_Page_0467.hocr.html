               our district councils were appointed by 
               <br />
               the Crown ; that principle was subse- 
               <br />
               quently changed, and they are now e‘ected 
               <br />
               by the popular vote. It is impossible, sir, 
               <br />
               to take this question of Confederation into 
               <br />
               consideration,without also taking into account 
               <br />
               the question of the Intercolonial Railway. I 
               <br />
               have on several occasions spoken against the 
               <br />
               construction of that road at the expense of 
               <br />
               Canada. I never could see that any advan- 
               <br />
               tage would be derived from it, unless in a 
               <br />
               military point of view; and as a military 
               <br />
               work I did not think it worth the large sum 
               <br />
               it would cost. But if commercial advantages 
               <br />
               could be pointed out equivalent to the cost 
               <br />
               of it, then I admit its construction might 
               <br />
               become a subject of consideration. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear. I think that free intercourse and free 
               <br />
               trade with 800,000 of our fellow-subjects in 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces are not light and unim- 
               <br />
               portant considerations. They are, in my 
               <br />
               Opinion, something like an equivalent for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure—(hear,</span> hear)—and if there are 
               <br />
               no graver diﬂiculties than the building of 
               <br />
               this road in the scheme of the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference, then they may all be easily sur- 
               <br />
               mounted. (Hear, hear.) That there will 
               <br />
               be great expense in the construction of the 
               <br />
               road, and in connection with Confederation, 
               <br />
               admits scarcely of a doubt. But we have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">came</span> to a period in our history when, for 
               <br />
               various reasons, expense has become neces-

               Sary. We must have some change in our 
               <br />
               Constitution, and whether it be attended by 
               <br />
               additional expense or not, it is indispensable 
               <br />
               in order to remove the evils under which 
               <br />
               the country has so long labored. (Hear,

               SPEAKER, I approach the discussion of this 
               <br />
               subject in no degree of diﬁidenee or temerity, 
               <br />

               say, it will receive but little attention, so far 
               <br />
               as tending to change in the slightest degree 
               <br />
               the opinions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> hon. members may have

               that I represent, and to the province at

               <br />
               of this resolution in its present shape. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I am in favor of a union of 
               <br />
               the provinces, but it must be such a union 
               <br />
               as will beneﬁt and protect the interests of 
               <br />
               the provinces at large ; and I feel that those

               if we are going into the extravagances that

               <br />
               now will be considered new; and he who 
               <br />
               speaks at this stage of the discussion will 
               <br />
               speak at a disadvantage, because he can say 
               <br />
               very little that is new. He may speak on 
               <br />
               these matters that have been discussed in

               new language,_ and so make some little 
               <br />
               change, but as for the material positions, 
               <br />
               they have been already discussed, and by 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen very ably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussed,</span> 
               <br />
               I understand that the position which the 
               <br />
               Government of this country assumes, in 
               <br />
               introducing this measure with the haste in 
               <br />
               which they are doing it, declining to allow 
               <br />
               the people to have anything to say upon it, 
               <br />
               except through their representatives, who 
               <br />
               were not sent here to vote on any such 
               <br />
               measure as this, is that this country had 
               <br />
               arrived at such a stage that it was impossible 
               <br />
               for the affairs of the Government to be 
               <br />
               carried on, unless some change took place, 
               <br />
               and that of a radical character. In that 
               <br />
               assertion I do not agree. I dissent from it 
               <br />
               entirely, and I feel that it was not the 
               <br />
               necessities of this country that have brought 
               <br />
               about these resolutions, but that it was the 
               <br />
               factious conduct of honorable gentlemen on 
               <br />
               the ﬂoor of this House. If that factions con- 
               <br />
               duct had not been persevered in, there would 
               <br />
               have been no necessity for the consideration 
               <br />
               that we are now undertaking. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I feel that I am making a statement the 
               <br />
               correctness of which cannot be denied; and 
               <br />
               I shall refer to the language of the Hon. 
               <br />
               President of the Council, even since this 
               <br />
               matter has been under consideration, to 
               <br />
               establish it. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hœr.)</span> It has been 
               <br />
               stated by him that the affairs of this country 
               <br />
               had come to a dead-lock. It has been stated 
               <br />
               that we were drifting into inevitable ruin; 
               <br />
               that our debt was so fast increasing, that it 
               <br />
               was absolutely impossible to stem the torrent, 
               <br />
               or close the ﬂood-gates of the treasury that 
               <br />
               that had been opened by the mismanage- 
               <br />
               ment of hen. gentlemen sitting alongside of 
               <br />
               the President of the Council at the present 
               <br />
               time. Understand me: I am not charging 
               <br />
               those hon. gentlemen with extravagance; I 
               <br />
               am simply referring to the language used 
               <br />
               by the Honorable President of the Coun- 
               <br />
               cil. But on a recent occasion he spoke 
               <br />
               of this union as a matter to be proud of, and 
               <br />
