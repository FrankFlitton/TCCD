               <br />
               to deal with the question. Sir R. PEEL took 
               <br />
               high grounds against the doctrine, declaring that 
               <br />
               whatever may have been the circumstances that 
               <br />
               may have taken place at the election, he never 
               <br />
               would sanction the view that any House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons is incompetent to entertain a measure which 
               <br />
               is necessary for the well-being of the country. 
               <br />
               He cited in proof of the soundness of this prin- 
               <br />
               ciple Mr. PITT’S observations when a similar doc- 
               <br />
               tine was proposed at the time of the union of 
               <br />
               England and Ireland, as it had been at the time 
               <br />
               of the union with Scotland. This view had been 
               <br />
               maintained in Ireland very vehemently, but it was 
               <br />
               not held by Mr. Fox, and only slightly hinted at 
               <br />
               by SHERIDAN, in reply to whom Mr. PITT de- 
               <br />
               fended the constitutional system that Parliament, 
               <br />
               without any previous appeal to the pe0ple, had a 
               <br />

               <br />
               franchise its constituents or associate others with 
               <br />
               them. “There could not,” observed Sir R. FEEL, 
               <br />
               “ be a more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dancerous</span> example, a more purely

               cedents on the subject, especially as I ﬁnd not 
               <br />
               one precedent for submitting the question m

               ou ht to pay to the wishes of the people every 
               <br />
               de erence; and if I believed that any large

               portion of the people of Western Canada, or 
               <br />
               of the constituency which I represent, were in

               favor of having it submitted to the electors, I

               in saying that I have not conversed with one 
               <br />

               <br />
               not strongly in favor of the preposed union. 
               <br />
               I will admit that the political ties that bind 
               <br />
               men together are strong ties, and approach to 
               <br />

               the present movement, I did so believing that it 
               <br />
               was for the best interests of the country, and 
               <br />
               if properly carried out many of us will live 
               <br />
               to see this country become one of the great— 
               <br />

               she could well give towards making us a great
