               (Hear, hear.) As to us, French-Canadians 
               <br />
               and Catholics, what have we to fear from .Con- 
               <br />
               federation ? Our language, our rights and 
               <br />
               our privileges are guaranteed to us. Look 
               <br />
               at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thexUnited</span> Kingdom of Great Britain and 
               <br />
               Ireland; does it not consist of three distinct 
               <br />
               nations, holding several religious creeds ? 
               <br />
               Those three nations have fought side by side 
               <br />
               on sea and land for ages, against the enemies 
               <br />
               of their country. What glorious victories, 
               <br />
               what noble deeds in arms have they achieved! 
               <br />
               And the most perfect harmony exists among 
               <br />
               them. In England, are the Jews persecuted, 
               <br />
               deprived of their rights and privileges? Are 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Is</span> there not residing

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> And, Mr. SPEAKER, who would have believed 
               <br />
               the fact ?—the last census shows that the city 
               <br />
               of London contains 100,000 Catholics more 
               <br />
               than Rome itself—Rome the seat of the Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic Church! And a greater number of 
               <br />
               Jews than there are in J udea or all Pales- 
               <br />
               tine! (Hear, hear.) And yet all these peo- 
               <br />
               1e enjoy their respective righœ and privi- 
               <br />
               es, and worship their Creator according to 
               <br />
               the traditions of their forefathers, unmolest- 
               <br />
               ed, undisturbed by any. (Cheers.) I now 
               <br />
               come to the plan of Confederation considered 
               <br />
               intrinsically. I shall not enter into a discus- 
               <br />
               sion of its details; four members of the Ad- 
               <br />
               ministration havc given us explanations of it 
               <br />
               which were so clear and lucid, that it is use- 
               <br />
               less to enter on the subject anew. There 
               <br />
               are, no doubt, certain points which are not 
               <br />
               all that we could desire; there are certain 
               <br />
               articles which I should be disposed to reject 
               <br />
               if I were not aware that we are to look at 
               <br />
               the question from ﬁve different points of 
               <br />
               view, and not from onc sectional point of 
               <br />
               view. I can conceive that the Conference con- 
               <br />
               sidered the plan as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compromise—a</span> treaty in 
               <br />
               which the ﬁve provinces were the contracting 
               <br />
               parties; that many concessions were found to 
               <br />
               be necessary, to satisfy the interests of indi- 
               <br />
               viduals or of localities ; that great conciliation 
               <br />
               was an important element, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wit"</span> a strong

               carry forward an important negotiation, 
               <br />
               which in their absence would have utterly 
               <br />
               failed ! I am, moreover, convinced that the 
               <br />
               Ministers of Canada did everything in their 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               make us a great and strong nation ; that the 
               <br />
               dominant idea in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gminds</span> was that “ a

               As a British subject, I ﬁnd most pleasure in 
               <br />
               that article of the scheme which declares 
               <br />
               the Sovereign of Great Britain to be the 
               <br />
               head of the Executive. The monarchical 
               <br />
               element will predominate in the Constitution, 
               <br />
               and we shall thus escape that weakness 
               <br />
               which is inherent in the Constitution of the

               neighboring States. Their President, Mr.

               SPEAKER, is no more than the fortunate 
               <br />

               <br />
               temporary; he is, for four years, a kind of 
               <br />
               despot, with unlimited power and in mense 
               <br />
               patronage; his favors fall on those only who 
               <br />
               have elected him, and who can elect him 
               <br />
               anew at the expiration of four years; none 
               <br />
               feel the refreshing dews of his favors, save 
               <br />
               his party. Woe to the unlucky ones who 
               <br />
               have voted against him at his election I For 
               <br />
