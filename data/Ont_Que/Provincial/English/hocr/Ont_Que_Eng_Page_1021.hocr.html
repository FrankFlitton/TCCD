               HON. ATTY. GEN. M ACDONALD—Well, 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Peel submitted that the 
               <br />
               appeal should be made in one way, the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional way, and that was the way my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from North Ontario did not 
               <br />
               like. How could my hon. friend suppose 
               <br />
               that a vote like that could be taken in a 
               <br />
               country whose Constitution is modelled on 
               <br />
               the Constitution of England? By what 
               <br />
               contrivance known to our Constitution could 
               <br />
               we take such a vote? There is none such. 
               <br />
               There is no means, no system, by which we 
               <br />
               could make an appeal of that kind, and in- 
               <br />
               order to do it we should have to subvert the 
               <br />
               principles of the British Constitution. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman knows there is no means of 
               <br />
               doing it. We might, indeed, pass a law 
               <br />
               declaring that the people shall vore yes or 
               <br />
               no on this question ; but such a law would 
               <br />
               in itself be a change in our Constitution, and 
               <br />
               I would like to see any man representing 
               <br />
               Her Majesty in this country give his sanc- 
               <br />
               tion to a measure of that kind, which would 
               <br />
               be a. subversion of the ﬁrst principles of 
               <br />
               British constitutional government. Sir, we 
               <br />
               in this House are representatives of the 
               <br />
               people, and not mere delegates ; and to pass 
               <br />
               such a law would be robbing ourselves of 
               <br />
               the character of representatives, and be a 
               <br />
               proceeding which even the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               her for Chateauguay himself denounces in 
               <br />
               language, although he supports it in counte- 
               <br />
               nance when pressed by others. That hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is too familiar with the principles 
               <br />
               of British constitutional government to 
               <br />
               support such a proceeding himself, but still 
               <br />
               he encourages others to do it, and to say 
               <br />
               that which he would not advance himself.

               the notice was not clear, I was exceedingly
