               events for the last few years? Since the 
               <br />
               21st May, 1862, have we not had four or 
               <br />
               live governments who have managed the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> of the country? One we had which 
               <br />
               seemed to be " the darling of the nations,” 
               <br />
               the paragon government of economy and 
               <br />
               retrenchment, the MAODONALD—DORION 
               <br />
               Government. What did it do for the 
               <br />
               country? Nothing, absolutely nbthing; it 
               <br />
               had not even the moral courage to stand by 
               <br />
               its own measures. In the beginning of 
               <br />
               February, 1864, it brought in a bill (that 
               <br />
               respecting sheriffs). Well, what did it do 
               <br />
               in the circumstances? Afraid of its own 
               <br />
               work, it stood aghast at the remonstrances 
               <br />
               of some of its own partisans, who were con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tumacitus—despair</span> fell upon the leaders—- 
               <br />
               the camp was a scene of confusion ; and lo! 
               <br />
               one ﬁne day this Ministry, which was to 
               <br />
               bring back the golden age of happiness and 
               <br />
               prosperity, sank placidly to rest—became a 
               <br />
               thing of the past, and left “ not a wreck 
               <br />
               behind” to mark its accession to ower. In 
               <br />
               a word, that pattern Administration died in 
               <br />
               its virginity, died with the famous scheme of 
               <br />

               “ budget” on its conscience! (Continued

               <br />

               <br />
               from our unhappy con ition—to calm the 
               <br />
               strife of parties—to settle the many questions, 
               <br />
               often <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irreconcilably</span> incompatible with each

               ant sections of the country—a strife which 
               <br />
               threatened to become perpetual? What

               would have become of us if a rovidential

               Administration? Ever one can conceive

               that the Coalition Government, the only pos-

               we have Confederation ?" “ Why should we
