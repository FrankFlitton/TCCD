               taken, for those provinces have nothing to 
               <br />
               exchange with us. We have the same pro-

               ductions as they have, and in greater 
               <br />

               nothing but coal which we do not possess,

               <br />

               <br />
               ing it, and will afterwards cost us a great deal 
               <br />
               in repairs and working expenses, and after 
               <br />
               all, will only be of use as a substitute for a 
               <br />
               few sohooners which carry down our produce 
               <br />
               to the Gulf Provinces every season. This, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, will be a dear price to pay 
               <br />
               for the complete destruction of our little 
               <br />
               inland navigation, which ought rather to be 
               <br />
               protected. The amount of expenditure 
               <br />
               involved in the building of this railway, if 
               <br />
               wisely applied to the Opening of colonization 
               <br />
               roads, to the improvement of roads and 
               <br />
               bridges, and the clearing of the public lands, 
               <br />
               would be much more beneﬁcial to the people of 
               <br />
               this province, who would ﬁnd in these things 
               <br />
               a degree of satisfaction and happiness which 
               <br />
               would enable them to do without Confeder-

               <br />
               tical troubles. A little more good-will and‘ 
               <br />
               calmness in discussing the question, would 
               <br />
               have stiﬂed the cry for representation based 
               <br />
               on population, and our country would have 
               <br />
               been able to go on under the actual union, 
               <br />
               which is less dangerous and less expensive 
               <br />
               than that which is now proposed by the 
               <br />

               remarking upon them, I may avail -myself

               of it. But I cannot forbear remarking 
               <br />
               now, in reference to the announcement 
               <br />

               <br />
               a step in the right direction. I believe 
               <br />
               it was then stated that a mission would 
               <br />
               be sent to England to consult with the 
               <br />

               or intending to occupy the time of the 
               <br />
               House by raising a debate upon this point, 
               <br />
               I cannot help observing that it was desira- 
               <br />
               ble, before this scheme of Confederation was 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               have been preliminary to the plan Of union

               proposed, and that the Conference should

               have taken upon itself to arrange with 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government the proportionate 
               <br />
               expense which is to be borne by the two 
               <br />
               countries in relation to the defence Of these 
               <br />
               provinces; for, let it be borne in mind that 
               <br />
               this question has been forced upon us in 
               <br />
