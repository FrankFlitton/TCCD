               <br />
               his making such a statement. There is no

               tariﬁ' must be reduced, he would have known 
               <br />
               that they will bear their full proportion of 
               <br />
               the national burdens. (Hear, hear.) But, 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> I am told that the arrange- 
               <br />
               ment as to the debt is unfair—that we have 
               <br />
               thrown on the Federal exchequer the whole of 
               <br />
               the debts of the Maritime Provinces, but only 
               <br />
               a portion of the debt of Canada. There is not 
               <br />
               a 'cle of force in this objection. The 
               <br />
               whole debt of Canada is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">867,500,000,</span> but ﬁve 
               <br />
               millions of this is due to our own people, to 
               <br />
               meet which there are certain local funds. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> if we had thrown the whole 867,500,000 
               <br />
               on the Federal treasury, we must also have 
               <br />
               handed over to it the local revenues, which, so 
               <br />
               far as these ﬁve millions are concerned, would 
               <br />
               have been precisely the same thing. But, as 
               <br />
               regards the public debt with which the Fede- 
               <br />
               ral Government would start, it would not have 
               <br />
               been the same thing. By <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restricting</span> the debt 
               <br />
               of Canada to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$62,600,000,</span> we restricted the 
               <br />
               debt of the Maritime Provinces to the same 
               <br />

               Maritime Provinces must have been increased,

               thing the country needs—but this Government 
               <br />
               had no authority from Parliament to negotiate 
               <br />
