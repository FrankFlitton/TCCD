               law will be binding until it has the sanction 
               <br />

               it not made applicable to Lower Canada as

               well as to the other provinces? Nothing could 
               <br />
               be done respecting its peculiar laws without 
               <br />
               the consent of its Local Legislature, and it 
               <br />
               is quite possible to my mind, that there are 
               <br />
               some laws which it would be advantageous 
               <br />
               to all parts of the Confederation to assimilate. 
               <br />
               But they emphatically declare in’these reso— 
               <br />
               lutions that there shall be no interference 
               <br />
               with the laws of Lower Canada. 80 that 
               <br />
               while it is proposed to assimilate the laws of 
               <br />
               the other provinces, there is a large section 
               <br />
               of intervening country which is to have, for 
               <br />
               all time to come, laws separate and distinct 
               <br />
               from the rest. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Hear,</span> hear.) There is a 
               <br />
               great deal of difference in making a provision 
               <br />
               of this kind, which is to give the people the 
               <br />
               option, and which is not to be binding for all 
               <br />
               time to come unless sanctioned by them, and 
               <br />
               declaring that a law shall be forced upon the 
               <br />
               peeple whether they liked it or not. (Hear.

               I can easily understand the feeling of the 
               <br />
               French people, and can admire it—that they 
               <br />
               do not want to have anything forced upon 
               <br />

               will not allow you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to’contemplate</span> even the 
               <br />
               possibility of any change taking place for 
               <br />
               the general weal, and with their own consent, 
               <br />
               in their laws -—that they will not allow any- 
               <br />
               thing tobe introduced into this measure by 
               <br />
               which, under any circumstances whatever, 
               <br />
               ve can meddle with the laws of this particu- 
               <br />
               lar section of the country—I do not under- 
               <br />
               stand. And having feelings of this kind, and 
               <br />
               manifesting them so strongly as they do in 
               <br />
               this document, it appears to me that in 
               <br />
               going into this union, we do not go into it 
               <br />
               with the proper elements. We go into it 
               <br />
               With elements of strife and dissension, rather 
               <br />
               than of union and strength. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               That is to be regretted ; for if a change is to 
               <br />
               be made aﬁ'ecting the destinies of the people 
               <br />

               to come to a just conclusion, 1 have not been 
               <br />
               able to satisfy myself that there are not the 
               <br />
               elements of ruin rather than of safety and 
               <br />
               strength in this scheme; that there are not 
               <br />
               the elements of the dismemberment of this 
               <br />
               country from the Empire to which we belong, 
               <br />
               and have pride in belonging; that there is 
               <br />
               not the means here of causing us to drift right 
               <br />
               into the vortex of annexation to the United 
               <br />
               States, whether we will or not. So far as I 
               <br />
               am concerned, I should sooner see perish 
               <br />
               root and branch everything belonging to 
               <br />
               me, than I would become a party to a union 
               <br />
               with that power. Feeling no hostility to the 
               <br />
               peOple there—feelin as friendly to them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">toto</span>

               any other people, sti lIhave that attachment 
               <br />
               to British institutions—I have within me 
               <br />
               that feeling of allegiance to the British 
               <br />
               Crown, which would not allow me to throw 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> British connection under any circum- 
               <br />
               stances whatever, or even to accept the 
               <br />
               disruption of that connection, if it were 
               <br />
               oﬁ'ered to us by Great Britain. I feel it 
               <br />
               would be a curse to this country, if we were 
               <br />
               forced into that union—forced to adopt the 
               <br />
               licentiousness of conduct which we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               there, and habits and manners totally dis- 
               <br />
               tasteful to us.’ To be brought into that 
               <br />
               union would seem to me the greatest injury 
               <br />
               which by possibility could happen tons. In 
               <br />
               adapting the scheme before us, I feel we 
               <br />
               would be sowing the seeds of discord and 
               <br />
               strife, which would destroy our union, instead 
               <br />
               of its being cemented by this measure. I 
               <br />
               am therefore opposed to the scheme, because 
               <br />
               I believe that politically, commercially, and 
               <br />
               defensively, as a matter of economy or of 
               <br />
               sectional beneﬁt, it will not be one tittle of 
               <br />
               service to this country, but on the contrary 
               <br />
               will inﬂict on it a vast and lasting injury. 
               <br />
