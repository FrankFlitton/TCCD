               spring up with the Maritime Provinces and 
               <br />
               with the West India provinces. Some years 
               <br />
               ago there was, as mercantile men well know, 
               <br />
               aim-ge trade conducted with the West India 
               <br />
               Islands, which, from various circumstances, 
               <br />
               has almost entirely ceased. I believe that, 
               <br />
               when the provinces are united, not only will 
               <br />
               a large trade spring up in those agricultural

               <br />
               to the Lower Provinces from the nited 
               <br />
               States, but a trade will also be established 
               <br />
               with the West India Islands. Some time 
               <br />
               ago I took the trouble to look into the ﬁgures, 
               <br />
               and I was surprised to ﬁnd how large a trade 
               <br />
               was conducted twenty-ﬁve years ago with 
               <br />
               those islands; and l believe that, by carry-

               <br />

               <br />
               interest to the people of Canada. Years 
               <br />
               ago Canadian industry pushed its way up 
               <br />
               the valle of the Ottawa to the Great North 
               <br />
               West. n 1798 the North-West Company 
               <br />
               had in its employment not less than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">125,000</span> 
               <br />
               persons ; and there is no reason in the world 
               <br />
               why the trade which was then carried on 
               <br />
               should not be reëstablished between the 
               <br />
               North—West and Canada. No insuperable 
               <br />
               obstacles stand in the way. A practicable 
               <br />
               route exists w'.ich can be used by land and 
               <br />
               by water, and there is no reason why the 
               <br />
               necessary steps should not be taken to secure

               the development of the resources of that 
               <br />
               country and making them tributary to 
               <br />
               Canada. (Hear, hear.) I think it was a
