               <br />
               the end sought to be accomplished by the 
               <br />
               change that cannot but commend itself 
               <br />
               most clearly and distinctly to the mind of 
               <br />
               every one who desires to see a united and 
               <br />
               happy people inhabiting the territory of 
               <br />
               British North America, and stretching from 
               <br />
               ocean to ocean, under the rotecting ægis of 
               <br />
               the British Constitution, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> British form of 
               <br />
               government, and the British Crown. We have, 
               <br />
               in my own humble opinion, but two future 
               <br />
               states of 'existence to choose for ourselves. 
               <br />
               We have, on the one side, the Opportunity to 
               <br />
               make ourselves a nation, able and willing to 
               <br />
               protect ourselves, with the aid of the Mother 
               <br />
               Country, and to grow wealthy and prosperous 
               <br />
               under that form of existence. On the other 
               <br />
               hand, we have the certain prospect of 
               <br />
               absorption, at no distant period, into the Uni- 
               <br />
               ted States. There is no alternative. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear, ironically.) We must either adapt 
               <br />
               the one or make up our minds to submit 
               <br />
               to the other. I have no doubt but that 
               <br />
               an immense number of the people would 
               <br />
               not be willing to remain and submit to 
               <br />
               the latter alternative, but like the old 
               <br />
               U. E. loyalists, wohld even abandon all 
               <br />
               they possessed rather than cease to have 
               <br />
               the protection of the British ﬂag, and bear 
               <br />
               the name of British men—men in whom 
               <br />
               loyalty is not a mere lip sentiment, but in 
               <br />
               whom it forms as much a constituent 
               <br />
               element of the blood as the principle of 
               <br />
               vitality itself. (Hear, hear.) Iam satisﬁed, 
               <br />
               air, that there is no other alternative—no 
               <br />
               choice for us between the endeavor on our 
               <br />
               part to concentrate British power and British 
               <br />
               feeling on this continent, and falling into

               eScape taxation by going over to the Ameri-

               ment and the extending of our popu ' n

               towards attracting emigrants from the old 
               <br />
               country to our lands. But here I must 
               <br />
               refer to one feature of the scheme that has 
               <br />
               been adopted by this House that I hope to 
               <br />
               see changed. I believe it is a fatal error to 
               <br />
               place the wild lands in the hands of the 
               <br />
               local governments, who may thereby enter 
               <br />
               into regulations for immigration that will 
               <br />
               be antagonistic, and that will tend to retard 
               <br />
               rather than promote the settlement of this 
               <br />
               country. All those lands ought to have 
               <br />
               been placed in the hands of the General 
               <br />
               Government, in order that one comprehen- 
               <br />
               sive system of immigration might be adopted. 
               <br />
               When we look at Upper Canada, and ascer- 
               <br />
               tain that of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">her;</span> eighty millions of acres 
               <br />
               there are only thirteen and a half millions 
               <br />
               in the hands of proprietors—an average of 
               <br />
               nine acres to each inhabitant—when we see 
               <br />
               the vast quantity of land in this country avail- 
               <br />
               able for cultivation, not yet turned to account, 
               <br />
               we cannot help coming to the conclusion that 
               <br />
               we have a vast ﬁeld for immigration to ﬁll
