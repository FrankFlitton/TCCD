               previous question has been decided, any

               <br />
               The hon. member has said that he would

               endeavor to move his resolutions before the

               Upper Canada will not allow this, and has 
               <br />
               said that the hon; member for Peel is not 
               <br />
               entitled to do so. (Hear, hear.) I am not

               alone in feeling the apprehensions which I 
               <br />
               have expressed relative to the new Consti- 
               <br />
               tution intended for us. A member of this 
               <br />
               House, who wrote, now a long time since, on 
               <br />
               the subject of Confederation, has allowed us 
               <br />
               to see indistinctly that the resolutions as 
               <br />
               presented to us did not aﬂ'ord sufﬁcient

               <br />

               <br />
               written in 1865, avoid saying as fol ows :—

               While the hon. member for Montmorency 
               <br />
               was writing that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">article.</span> he naturally saw 
               <br />
               that Confederation would have some very com— 
               <br />
               plicated parts in its machinery, and that the 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties which might occur would not be 
               <br />
               easily surmounted—that the resolutions 
               <br />
               would need to be amended. That was, no 
               <br />
               doubt, the opinion of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency when he wrote those articles, 
               <br />
               but since he has found that the Ministry 
               <br />
               are resolved not to allow any amendment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘of</span> 
               <br />
               the resolutions, the honorable member has 
               <br />
               thought it better to take them as thev are, 
               <br />
               with all their imperfections, than to risk 
               <br />
               losing Confederation altogether. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I believe, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Spsaxxa,</span> that we 
               <br />
               needed a remedy for the constitutional dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculties in which we were involved, but I 
               <br />
               believe also that the remedy proposed would 
               <br />
               be worse than the disease sought to be 
               <br />
               cured. (Hear, hear.) I believe that the 
               <br />
               country has suﬂ'ered from those diﬂicul- 
               <br />
               ties, but on the other hand I see in Con- 
               <br />
               federation internal strife in the local legisla- 
               <br />
               tures, not to speak of that strife which will 
               <br />
               infallibly spring up at an early day between 
               <br />
               the federal and the local legislatures. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It is evident that the federal will 
               <br />
               never be able to satisfy the local legislatures. 
               <br />
               In Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cicada,</span> for instance, we shall have 
               <br />
               a pretty strong party—the English party, 
               <br />
               Protestants, who will carry their complaints 
               <br />
               to the Federal Government, just as, in Up- 
               <br />
               er Canada, they made complaints relative 
               <br />
               to representation based on population, and 
               <br />
               that party being a minority in Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               will seek a remedyfor their evils, real or 
               <br />
               imaginary, at the hands of the Federal 
               <br />
               Government. Moreover, we shall have con- 
               <br />
               stant contests and sectional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heartburnings</span> 
               <br />
               between the local legislatures themselves, on 
               <br />
               all those subjects on which their interests 
               <br />
               may come into collision. (Hear, hear.) Let 
               <br />
               us sup e, .for instance, that the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture o Lower Canada should make some 
               <br />
               perfectly just demand, something to which 
               <br />
               that province is clearly entitled, and that 
               <br />
               the representatives of Upper Canada and 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces should combine to 
               <br />
               hinder it from obtaining its demand—would 
               <br />
               the Lower Canadians be well satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treatment?</span> And this might easily 
               <br />
               happen. The hon. member for Vaudreuil 
               <br />
               (Mr. Hanwoon) has spoken in pompous 
               <br />
               language of the prosperous future which 
               <br />
               awaits us under Confederation. To hear
