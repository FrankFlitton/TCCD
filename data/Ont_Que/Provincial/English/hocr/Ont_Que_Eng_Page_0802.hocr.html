               To set us on our guard against the proposed 
               <br />
               union, the hon. member laid before us a hasty 
               <br />
               sketch of the history of Ancient Greece, in 
               <br />
               order to shew us the hatred which the 
               <br />
               Athenians bore to the Spartans. N o doubt 
               <br />
               he fears that that hatred, should the union 
               <br />
               beconsumznated, will manifest itself between 
               <br />
               the inhabitants of Lower Canada and the 
               <br />
               inhabitants of Newfoundland and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island. He also took us a long 
               <br />
               journey through various countries, in which 
               <br />
               he pointed out to us frequent insurrections, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">échauﬁ'mrées</span> and troubles of all kinds among

               that Federal unions are bad and pernicious.

               those unions cause those nations to pass

               their descent from the two wisest, the two 
               <br />
               greatest nations in the world? Lastly, had

               <br />

               <br />
               I now return to certain objections offered by 
               <br />
               other honorable members of the Opposition 
               <br />
               to the resent scheme of the Government. 
               <br />
               Thus, t ey s oke to us of divorce, and tried 
               <br />
               to show us t at great inconvenience would 
               <br />
               result from leaving to the Federal Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment the right of legislating on that subject. 
               <br />
               But they do not remark that by this means 
               <br />
               the members from Lower Canada, that is to 
               <br />
               say, in the Local Legislature, will be exon- 
               <br />
               erated from taking those questions ‘into 
               <br />
               consideration. At the present day, all the 
               <br />
               Catholic members from Lower Canada are 
               <br />
               opposed to divorce as a matter of expediency 
               <br />
               and of conscience, and yet, even in the 
               <br />
               existing Legislature, they cannot prevent it. 
               <br />
               Why, therefore, blame the Government for

               Mn. RÉMILLARD—Has it ever been 
               <br />
               very easy to impose in Lower Canada laws 
               <br />
               upon the English inhabitants of that pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               what they consider as a right ? No; it 
               <br />
               would have been an act of injustice to 
               <br />
               endeavor to force our Opinions on this subject 
               <br />
               on the English and Protestant population of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada; and if an attempt had been 
               <br />
               made to do so, Confederation would probably 
               <br />
               have failed, because the majority of the 
               <br />
               members of the Conference would have main- 
               <br />
               tained their claims, and this would have been 
               <br />
               suﬂieient to prevent Confederation. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It is not to be urged as a crime against 
               <br />
               the Government that they have permitted 
               <br />
               the Federal Legislature to have the power 
               <br />
               of legislating upon subjects upon which we 
               <br />
               ourselves may legislate. For my part, Mr.

               SPEAKER, I did not enter upon this question 
               <br />
