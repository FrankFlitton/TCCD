               HON. Somerros GENERAL LANGEVIN 
               <br />
               —-—The Minister of Finance stated the whole 
               <br />
               debt, in his speech at Sherbrooke, at 867,— 
               <br />
               263,994. The amount of the debt is $75,- 
               <br />
               578,000; but it is necessary to deduct the 
               <br />
               Sinking Fund and cash in bank, $7,132,068, 
               <br />
               reducing it to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$68,445,953;</span> the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance also deducted the Common School 
               <br />
               Fund, which amounts to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,181,958,</span> and he 
               <br />
               arrived at the result I have just given, that is 
               <br />
               to say, that the real debt of Canada is 867,- 
               <br />
               263,994. I do not give all the items of the 
               <br />
               public debt, for I do not think it devolves 
               <br />
               upon me to prove that the calculations of the 
               <br />
               Finance Minister are not correct; that is the 
               <br />
               task of those who accuse him of error; and 
               <br />
               the Public Accounts are there to shew that 
               <br />
               the Finance Minister has stated nothing but 
               <br />
               the truth. The honorable member for Ho- 
               <br />
               ohelaga has manifested excessive anxiety re- 
               <br />
               speeting the ﬁnancial position of the Confed- 
               <br />
               eration; but in this case also we have the 
               <br />
               same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guaranmes</span> as for that of the local gov- 
               <br />
               ernments. He asserted, for instance, that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was too poor to contribute to 
               <br />
               the revenue of the Confederation, and that, in 
               <br />
               place of receiving anything from that province, 
               <br />
               we shall be compelled to send down money to 
               <br />
               prevent the pee le of the island from perish- 
               <br />
               ing by cold. ' he honorable gentleman is, 
               <br />
               nevertheless, well aware that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has a large revenue, a revenue of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$480,000,</span> 
               <br />
               and that its expenses are less than its income. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will receive its share from the 
               <br />
               Federal chest, but it will also contribute to the 
               <br />
               general revenue. While I am considering this 
               <br />
               portion of the honorable gentleman’s speech, 
               <br />

               must be that that province takes a different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               view from the honorable member. The 
               <br />
               truth, however, is that Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island, like the other provinces, was treated 
               <br />
               with justice and equity by the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference, that its local r uirements were con- 
               <br />
               sidered, and that a suﬂicient revenue to pro- 
               <br />
               vide for them was awarded to it. The hen- 
               <br />
               orable member for Hochelaga, who spoke in 
               <br />
               English, took that opportunity to make a 
               <br />
               violent appeal to the members from Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, and told them that there would be 
               <br />
               enormous imposts, and that two-thirds of the 
               <br />
               revenue and of the taxes would be paid by 
               <br />
               them. He did well to speak in English, for 
               <br />
               I am certain that .he would not make the 
               <br />
               same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">œsertion</span> in French in the presence of 
               <br />
               the members from Lower Canada; he would 
               <br />
               make no a al of that nature, and I regret 
               <br />
               it, for that would give us the best of masons 
               <br />
               for entering into the Confederation; but I 
               <br />
               must acknowledge that that statement of the 
               <br />
               honorable member is not exactly correct, for 
               <br />
               the basis of the Confederation is justice to 
               <br />
               all. The honorable member for Hochelaga 
               <br />
               also said, in order to produce an eﬁ'eet upon 
               <br />
               the members from Upper Canada, that the 
               <br />
               extension of the Confederation westward was 
               <br />
