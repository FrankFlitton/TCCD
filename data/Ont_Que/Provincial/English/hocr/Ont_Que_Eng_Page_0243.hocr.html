               HON. MB. SANBORN—The resolutions

               to which Hon. Mr. DOBION was a part , and 
               <br />
               which were read by my hon. friend, con-

               party, or any one political party rather than 
               <br />
               another desired. I take it for granted that 
               <br />
               British subjects of French Canadian origin 
               <br />
               generally have their feelings in that direc- 
               <br />
               tion—that is, they desire large power for 
               <br />
               the local government—in fact they would 
               <br />
               desire the local governments to be the real 
               <br />
               governments, and that the Federation should 
               <br />
               be very much nominal, for very minor pur- 
               <br />
               poses, and with very weak powers in the 
               <br />
               Central Government; while, on the other 
               <br />
               hand, the English population of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada would take the opposite view, and 
               <br />
               desire larger powers in the Central Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and smaller powers in the Local Go- 
               <br />
               vernment. This, I think, was the view to 
               <br />
               which the resolutions read by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               had reference. Now, as regards the Reform 
               <br />
               party of Upper Canada, let us see what they 
               <br />
               had reference to—whether it was anything

               like the Constitution which is now proposed.

               <br />

               <br />
               matters, and such only as are necessarily common 
               <br />
               to the whole province. Let the functions of this
