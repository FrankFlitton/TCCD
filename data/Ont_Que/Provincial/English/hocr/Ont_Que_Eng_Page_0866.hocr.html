               way because England had established a 
               <br />
               special tribunal for this matter, and Eng— 
               <br />
               land desired that divorce should be granted 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada as well as in every 
               <br />
               other province of British North America. 
               <br />
               Our Lower Canadian Ministers have simply 
               <br />
               yielded to the British inﬂuence which has 
               <br />
               been omnipotent in the Convention. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) They say “ It is very true that the 
               <br />
               Catholic religion prohibits divorce, but vote 
               <br />
               in favor of its establishment; for if you do 
               <br />
               not, the Rouge party will return to power 
               <br />
               and destroy all your religious institutions, if 
               <br />
               you give them the control of the government 
               <br />
               of the country.” Well, gentlemen upholders 
               <br />
               of religion, ought you not to use every means 
               <br />
               to prevent these dreadful Rouges from mak- 
               <br />
               ing use of the law, which you yourselves are 
               <br />
               about to establish, which will enable them to 
               <br />
               obtain divorce whenever they please, and 
               <br />
               thus to insult the dogmas and doctrines of 
               <br />

               <br />
               that it was simply a law authorizing the de- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the confederated provinces, in accordance 
               <br />
               with the laws of the province in which it 
               <br />
               was contracted, should be deemed to be valid 
               <br />
               in lower Canada in case the husband <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> 
               <br />
               wife came to reside there. Well, I ask you, 
               <br />
               M r. SPEAKER, il there was any necessity tor 
               <br />
               making this provision in the new Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion? Would not a marriage, under the 
               <br />
               present Constitution, contracted under the 
               <br />
               circumstances referred to by the Hon. Solicitor 
               <br />
               General for Lower Canada, be as valid as it 
               <br />
               would be under the Confederation? Certainly 
               <br />
               it would! Then what do the Government 
               <br />
               mean? I am well aware that the Catholic 
               <br />
               members from Lower Canada will not admit it, 
               <br />
               and I know that they refused to believe me 
               <br />
               when I made the assertion, but 1 do not 
               <br />
               hesitate to repeat it here, that it is the 
               <br />
               intention of the Convention to legalize civil 
               <br />
               marriages. The Lower Canadian section of 
               <br />
               the Ministry has not ventured to admit it, 
               <br />

               <br />

               utterly valueless, and cannot be accepted by 
               <br />
               the Catholic members. Why say that divorce 
               <br />
               will be permitted? If the existing law 
               <br />
               authorizes divorce now, it was quite unne- 
               <br />
               cessary to make a new law on the subject, 
               <br />
               and to make it an article of the new Consti- 
               <br />
               tution. The Government takes every means 
               <br />
               in its power to conceal the real intentions of 
               <br />
               the Conference on this important point of 
               <br />
               the scheme, but I am ﬁrmly convinced that 
               <br />
               their object is perfectly understood, and the 
               <br />
               future will prove whether or not I am mis- 
               <br />
               taken when l assert that it is intended to 
               <br />
               make civil marriages legal in this country. 
               <br />
               One of the reasons—and the only one which 
               <br />
               I have been able to discover—for which the 
               <br />
               present Government has granted power to 
               <br />
               the Federal Legislature to decree divorce, is 
               <br />
               that the Protestants of Lower Canada would 
               <br />
               never, but for that provision, have given 
               <br />
               their support to the Confederation measure 
               <br />
               proposed by our Ministers. I am well aware 
               <br />
               that there are certain Protestant denomina- 
               <br />
               tions whose doctrines forbid divorce, but I 
               <br />
               do not hesitate to say that the only reason of 
               <br />
               the concession is the one I have just stated. 
               <br />
               Besides, in the pamphlet of the hon. member 
               <br />
