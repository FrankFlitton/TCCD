               charged with to-day by the Opposition? Af- 
               <br />
               ter numberless ﬁerce struggles, and two gen- 
               <br />
               eral elections, it had become impossible for 
               <br />
               any party to govern the country. The people 
               <br />
               were weary of the whole thing, and wished for 
               <br />
               a change. It was then that a coalition took 
               <br />
               place between the two parties who formed 
               <br />
               the majority in either section of the province. 
               <br />
               The Opposition should not condemn that al- 
               <br />
               liance; on the contrary, they ought to con- 
               <br />
               tinue to give their support to the honorable 
               <br />
               member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. BROWN), 
               <br />
               since he has formed an alliance with the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General for Lower Canada, in order 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd some means of carrying on the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and of removing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties</span> by 
               <br />
               which we are surrounded. It has been stated 
               <br />
               that the delegates to the Quebec Conference 
               <br />
               were not empowered to prepare a scheme such 
               <br />
               'as that now before us; but can it be said 
               <br />
               that the Government had not the right to do 
               <br />
               so? The Ministry have prepared a scheme 
               <br />
               which they now submit to us, and the ques- 
               <br />
               tion is not as to whether they were or were 
               <br />
               not empowered to prepare it, but whether the 
               <br />
               scheme is a good one, whether it is deserving 
               <br />
               of the approval of the people, and for the best 
               <br />
               interests of the province. This it is for us to 
               <br />
               say, and it is all we have to say; but it is not 
               <br />
               right to accuse hon. Ministers, who have en- 
               <br />
               deavored to discharge their duty and to re- 
               <br />
               lieve the country from its diﬂicu‘tics—it is 
               <br />
               not right to reproach them, after they have 
               <br />
               labored day and night at their task, and to 
               <br />
               tell them they had no right to do what they 
               <br />
               have done. We had a right to expect a

               with a view of Opposing the Government

               <br />
               the people, have made use Of the name of an 
               <br />
               honored citizen, now living in the retirement 
               <br />
               of private life. The honorable member for 
               <br />
               Bagot (Hon. Mr. LAFRAMBOISB) told us 
               <br />
               that Mr. C. S. CHERRIEB, of Montreal, was 
               <br />
               strongly opposed to the scheme of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, and that his Opinion should have great 
               <br />
               weight, because he is a “ devout ” man. Now, 
               <br />
               I should like to know, Mr. SPEAKER, what 
               <br />
               connection there can possibly exist between 
               <br />
               religious devotion and a discussion such as 
               <br />
               this? I was really sorry to hear such lan- 
               <br />
               guage fall from the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Bagot, for he is not in the habit of making 
               <br />
               use of arguments of that kind. It is 
               <br />
               utterly astounding to see the party who 
               <br />
               wanted to shut up the priests in their vestries, 
               <br />
               and deny them the right to hold any political 
               <br />
               Opinions, using Mr. CHERBŒB'S devotion as a 
               <br />
               weapon wherewith to combat Confederation. 
               <br />

               <br />
               great agitation promoted b the hon. member

               alliance Of the Conservative party with the

               Hon. President of the Council? Has be
