               this creation of an Empire presents difﬁculties

               and sectional interests are so many stumbling

               blocks with which the principal provisions of the 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation will come in contact. 
               <br />
               It must not be believed that the Opposition 
               <br />
               only oppose the eme because they do not

               <br />
               At the present day, with sectional e uality, 
               <br />
               Canada constitutes but a single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> who 
               <br />
               have tendencies and aspirations in common; 
               <br />
               but under Confederation such will no longer 
               <br />
               bc the case; we shall have a minority op- 
               <br />
               posed to a majority, the aggressive tendencies 
               <br />
               of which have always manifested themselves 
               <br />
               whenever the power of numbers was in their 
               <br />
               favor. If the populations of all the provin- 
               <br />
               ces were homogeneous; if their interests, their 
               <br />
               ideas, their belief and their nationality were 
               <br />
               identical, we might perhaps be more disposed 
               <br />
               to accept the by no means judicious provisions 
               <br />
               of the scheme which is submitted to ns. But 
               <br />
               as none of these are identical, we consider 
               <br />
               that we should be in danger if we did accept 
               <br />
               them. Formerly France possessed all this 
               <br />
               part of the continent; the settlers of that 
               <br />
               period, the farmers, ﬁshermen, hunters and 
               <br />
               trappers travelled over the whole extent 
               <br />
               of those immense possessions which were 
               <br />
               known by the name of New France. At 
               <br />
               this moment what remains to her of a 
               <br />
               territory that was equal in extent to Europe 
               <br />
               itself? A wretched little island at the en- 
               <br />
               trance of the Gulf, a foothold for her ﬁsheries, 
               <br />
               and a few acres of beach on the coast of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. When we consider that fact, 
               <br />
               when we see French power completely des- 
               <br />
               troyed on this continent, are we not justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in looking closely into the project of Consti- 
               <br />
               tution now submitted to us, which has for its 
               <br />
               object, I repeat, simply to complete the des- 
               <br />
               truction of the inﬂuence of the French race 
               <br />
               on this continent ? Has not the past taught 
               <br />
               us to dread the future? Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               the policy of England has ever been aggressive, 
               <br />
               and its object has always been to annihilate 
               <br />
               usasa le. And this scheme of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation is but the continued application .of that 
               <br />
               policy on this continent; its real object is 
               <br />
               nothing but the annihilation of French inﬁn-

               <br />
               the experience of the past. There was a 
               <br />
               period, after the con nest of England by the 
               <br />

               general and oﬁioial language of that country, 
               <br />
               but subse uently the conquerors were com-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> history of the Parliament of England 
               <br />
               shews that up to 1425, every bill introduced

               in the Legislature, without a single exception, 
               <br />
               was in the French language. But at that 
               <br />
               date the ﬁrst English bill was presented to Par- 
               <br />
               liament; and twenty-ﬁve years later, in 1450, 
               <br />
               the last French bill was presented in the 
               <br />
               English Parliament. After that date we no 
               <br />
               longer ﬁnd a trace of the French language in 
               <br />

               recall. We know how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long,</span> Scotland and 
               <br />
               Ireland resisted the encroachments of England 
               <br />
               The struggle was protracted and obstinate- 
               <br />
               But these two nations were compelled to sue. 
               <br />
               cumb to political encroachment, under the 
               <br />
               pressure of the powerful assimilating tenden— 
               <br />
               eies of the English nation. But let us see what 
               <br />
               means England used to attain her ends. Im- 
               <br />
               partial history tells us, as it will tell of the 
               <br />
               means employed to-day to annihilate our race 
               <br />
               on this continent. History records, in letters 
               <br />
               of gold, the names of those who have bravely 
               <br />
               struggled for the lives and liberties of nations, 
               <br />
               but it also holds up to execration the memory 
               <br />
               of those who barter those liberties and those 
               <br />
               rights for titles, honor, power, or gold. We 
               <br />
               now enjoy responsible government, dearly 
               <br />
               earned by a century of heroic struggles, and 
               <br />
               before yielding an inch of the ground we 
               <br />
               have conquered, we should see what we are 
               <br />
               likely to gain by the proposed constitutional 
               <br />
               changes. Let us proﬁt by the experience of 
               <br />
               the countries we now see lamenting the loss of 
               <br />
               their political rights resulting from constitu-
