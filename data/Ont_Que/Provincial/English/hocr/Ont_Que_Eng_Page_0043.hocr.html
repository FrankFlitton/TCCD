               Council should be a reﬂection of such o inion,

               though it was, of course, desirable t at it 
               <br />
               should not continue violently to shock it. He 
               <br />
               would have that House conservative, calm,

               considerate and watchful, to prevent the enact-

               ment of measures which, in its deliberate judg- 
               <br />
               ment, were not calculated to advance the com— 
               <br />
               mon weal. Any more rapid changes in the 
               <br />
               composition of the House than those he now

               indicated, he did not consider wholesome or 
               <br />
               desirable. From the history of the present 
               <br />
               Chamber for the last few years, it would be 
               <br />
               seen that such changes, whether among the 
               <br />
               life members or the elected members, were 
               <br />
               much more frequent than might be generally 
               <br />
               supposed. According to the present elective 
               <br />
               system twelve members went out and twelve 
               <br />
               came in every second year. Supposing that a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&lt;</span> collision had taken place between the two 
               <br />
               branches of the Legislature, and that it was de- 
               <br />
               sirable to bring the Council more in accord with 
               <br />
               the representatives of the peo le, under this 
               <br />
               system, the same members mig t be returned, 
               <br />
               not because of the soundness of their political 
               <br />
               o inions on the topic which had brought about 
               <br />
               e collision, perhaps without the slightest 
               <br />
               reference to it, - but from their position and 
               <br />
               their exertions. One might come back be- 
               <br />
               cause he was a wealthy man and had a social 
               <br />
               position which ave him a large inﬂuence, 
               <br />
               another because e was an able canvasser and 
               <br />
               well versed in election tactics, and others from 
               <br />
               causes equally removed from the political 
               <br />
               question upon which the two Houses of Par— 
               <br />
               hament were in antagonism. But suppose 
               <br />
               the twelve seats were at the of the 
               <br />
               Government, and that an irreconcilable differ- 
               <br />
               ence had existed between the two Houses, 
               <br />
               would they not have the opportunity of re—

               dress at once and thoro hly by bringing in 
               <br />

               in opinion with them and the country ?

               Undoubtedly. Well, within eight ears the 
               <br />
               changes among the life-members h been as 
               <br />
               follows :-—When the House was made elective, 
               <br />
               there were 40 such members in it; two years 
               <br />
               afterwards, at the call of the House, the num- 
               <br />
               ber was found reduced to 31 ; two years after 
               <br />

               that again to 26; in two years more, to 24; 
               <br />
               and te-day to 21, of which 21, one honorable 
               <br />
               member was now seriously indi . In 
               <br />
               eight ears, then, the number had been dimin- 
               <br />
               ished <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> half. Then changes near] as great had 
               <br />
               occurred among the elected mem rs. There 
               <br />
               had been 24 removals and ch by death 
               <br />
               and otherwise among these 48 ; and it should 
               <br />
               be remembered, that as the elected members 
               <br />
               came in by twelves, two years apart, the aver- 
               <br />
               age time had been only four years. This was 
               <br />
               suﬁcient to show the Opportunity which, even 
               <br />
               among younger men than the life-members, the 
               <br />
               Government would have of keeping the House 
               <br />
               in accord with the true interests of the

               countr , or of overcoming any unfortunate 
               <br />
               misun erstanding between the two branches. 
               <br />
               [The honorable member here went minutely 
               <br />
               into a statement of the changes eﬁ'ected 
               <br />
               by death, acceptance of oﬁce, and defeat 
               <br />
               at elections, among this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clœs</span> of members, 
               <br />
               which, however, we do not deem it neces- 
               <br />
               sary to specify.] These changes had cer— 
               <br />
               tainly altered, to some extent, the com- 
               <br />
               plexion of the House, and the future would, 
               <br />
               no doubt, be like the past in this respect. 
               <br />
               The Conference had taken all these things 
               <br />
               into consideration, and wisely concluded, as 
               <br />
               he believed, that while the chances of collision 
               <br />
               were much less under the nominative system, 
               <br />
               the opportunity of restoring harmonious 
               <br />
               action was inﬁnitely more prompt and eﬁ'eo— 
               <br />
               tive, and that there was no such danger of 
               <br />
               eollisons between the two branches of the 
               <br />
               General Legislature, as to make it a bar to 
               <br />
               the principle of nomination, which principle, 
               <br />
               in their judgment, offered the compensa 
               <br />
               advantage he had endeavored, in the earlier 
               <br />
               part of his observations, to point out. He 
               <br />
               sincerely hoped the ,House would concur in 
               <br />
               the views he had expressed, and would accept 
               <br />
               the measure now before them, as one which 
               <br />
               he believed calculated to promote the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best</span> 
               <br />
               interests of this country and the other pro-
