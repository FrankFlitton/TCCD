               this province before the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               is asked to legislate on the Address of this 
               <br />
               House. Now, the object of the amendment 
               <br />
               proposed by the hon. member for Chateau- 
               <br />
               guay is to ask that the Constitution adopted 
               <br />
               in England may not go into force until it 
               <br />
               shall have been submitted to the Legislature 
               <br />
               of this province, after the next general elec- 
               <br />
               tion, and until an Address shall have been 
               <br />
               adopted, asking that it be put in force. We 
               <br />
               ask the Imperial Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> by the 
               <br />
               Address which has just been adopted, to sub- 
               <br />
               mit t3 the Imperial Legislature an act for the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces. If, in place of Confederation, the 
               <br />
               Imperial Parliament were to establish a le- 
               <br />
               gislative union of the provinces, I ask those 
               <br />
               honorable members of this House who protest 
               <br />
               against a legislative union, how they are to 
               <br />
               present themselves before their electors—after 
               <br />
               having refused to consult them—if they also 
               <br />
               refuse to declare that they desire to consider 
               <br />
               the measure 'n when it is brought back to 
               <br />
               us, after passmg the Imperial Parliament? 
               <br />
               All we ask by this motion is that the act 
               <br />
               which is to be passed ma be submitted to 
               <br />
               our Legislature, and ratiﬁ and approved by 
               <br />
               this House, before it is deﬁnitel put in force 
               <br />
               —in short, we ask to be allowe to refuse the 
               <br />
               new Constitution if it should not suit us. 
               <br />
               We must not forget what occurred in 1856, 
               <br />
               when we asked the Imperial Parliament to 
               <br />
               change the constitution of the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council, and to render it elective. Let it not 
               <br />
               be forgotten that they gave us a measure dif- 
               <br />
               ferent from that we had asked for. We were, 
               <br />
               it is true, empowered to render the Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive Council elective, but, at the same time, a 
               <br />
               clause was struck out of the Act of Union, 
               <br />
               which clause declared that the basis of the re- 
               <br />
               presentation in the Legislative Assembly 
               <br />
               could not be changed without the concurrence 
               <br />
               of two-thirds of the members of the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture. And with that fact staring us in the 
               <br />
               face, what assurance have we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> that the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government will not give us a le- 
               <br />
               gislative union, with representation based 
               <br />

               <br />
