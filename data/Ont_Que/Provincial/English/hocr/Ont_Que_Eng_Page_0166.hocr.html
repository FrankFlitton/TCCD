               xa, we on this side had some doubt lest the 
               <br />
               Opposition might be placed at a disadvan- 
               <br />
               tage, by allowing the speeches of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to go to the country, without any 
               <br />
               comment on them. But if these ﬁve speech- 
               <br />
               es, to which we have now listened, contain 
               <br />
               all that can be said in favor of this scheme, 
               <br />
               we have no fear of letting them go unan- 
               <br />
               swmd. I listened to the speech of the 
               <br />
               Attorney General West with great disap- 
               <br />
               pointment. The cause of that disappointment 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">simple</span> enough. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               was, in at speech, giving the lie to twenty 
               <br />
               years of his political life. He was oﬁ'ering 
               <br />
               to the cause he is now advocating one speech 
               <br />
               against his continuous voice and vote for 
               <br />
               twenty years. He was struggling,all through 
               <br />
               that speech, against the consciousness of the 
               <br />
               falseness of his political position, and what 
               <br />
               every one conceived would be the brightest 
               <br />
               eﬁort of his life was the feeblest address he 
               <br />
               ever delivered on any important question, 
               <br />
               during the twenty years he has sat in this 
               <br />
               House. The Attorney General West was 
               <br />
               followed b the Attorney General East. I 
               <br />
               know not ow to characterize the speech of 
               <br />
               that hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemah,</span> further than tosay that 
               <br />
               it was quite characteristic. It was perfectly 
               <br />
               characteristic. I doubt whether any attor- 
               <br />
               nay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> who ever existed, since attorneys

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(pension</span> like this, the speech which he de- 
               <br />
               livered. It may be said of that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman, as the poet said of a very diﬁ'erent

               man’s own friends, that his speech was 
               <br />
               chieﬂy remarkable for an adroit avoidance of 
               <br />
               the very topics on which he was expected, 
               <br />
               or might have been expected, to address the 
               <br />
               House, and for a very adroit assumption of 
               <br />
               those very things which he might have been 
               <br />
               expected to rove. Such, at least, was the 
               <br />
               impression w 'ch that speech made upon my 
               <br />
               mind. Then came the speech—the hercu— 
               <br />
               lean eﬁ'ort—of my hon. friend, the President 
               <br />
               of the Council, who, I am sorry to see, isnot 
               <br />
               in his seat, and with reference, therefore, to 
               <br />
               whose speech I shall not make the remarks I 
               <br />
               might have done, if he were in his place. I 
               <br />
               must say, however, that that speech was a 
               <br />
               disappointing speech. (Cries of “ oh ! oh !” 
               <br />
               and “ hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bean”)</span> I did expect, from the 
               <br />
               conspicuous part which that hon. entleman 
               <br />
               has so long played in the politics of the 
               <br />
               country—from the leading part he has had 
               <br />
               in all the proceedings which have conduct- 
               <br />
               ed to the pro'ect now before the House— 
               <br />
               that we should have had from him, at all 
               <br />
               events, some vindication of the steps which 
               <br />
               he has seen ﬁt to take—some vindication of 
               <br />
               the principles of the proposed union, so con- 
               <br />
               trary to all those principles which he has 
               <br />
               hitherto advocated. I say, we did expect 
               <br />
               that we would have had something of that 
               <br />
               kind from that hon. gentleman. But, in— 
               <br />
               stead of that, his whole speech was mainly 
               <br />
               an apology for his abandonment of all those 
               <br />
               objects for which he has contended through 
               <br />
               his political life, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saving</span> only the shadow of 
               <br />
               representation by popu ation, to attain which 
               <br />
               shadow he seems to have sacriﬁced all the 
               <br />
               material objects, all the real objects, for the 
               <br />
               attainment of which the agitation for that 
               <br />
               change has proceeded on his part. Then we 
               <br />
               have had, to-night, the speech of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, the Minister of Agriculture, as

               which I admit was one of very great inter- 
               <br />
               est, as a historical essay—one which will 
               <br />
               read very nicely in those reports which we 
               <br />
               are to get in a few days—one which does 
               <br />
               very great credit to his literary research and 
               <br />
               literary taste—but one, which I do venture 
               <br />
               to say, had very little practical bearing on 
               <br />
               the question that is now before us. Well, I 
               <br />
               repeat, I am not afraid that these speeches 
               <br />
               should go to the country unanswered. The 
               <br />
               country will see that these hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               have utterly failed to establish a cause for 
               <br />
               revolution. They are proposing revolution, 
               <br />
               and it was incumbent upon them to estab- 
               <br />
               lish a necessity for revolution. All revolu- 
               <br />
               tions are unjustiﬁable, except on the ground
