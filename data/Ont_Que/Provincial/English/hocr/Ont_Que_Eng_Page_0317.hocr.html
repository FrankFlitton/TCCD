               l ask myself this: “ Is this Confederation 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dyesirable?</span> Do I wish for it as a lover of 
               <br />
               monarchical institutions? Do I desire it as 
               <br />
               a subject of the British Empire ? Do I wish 
               <br />
               for the perpetuation of the connection between 
               <br />
               this country and Great Britain ?” If I do 
               <br />
               I shall waive my objections on this point and 
               <br />
               the other, in my desire for the success of the 
               <br />
               principle. This Confederation has been sought 
               <br />
               after for years, but never until now has it ap- 
               <br />
               proached so near a consummation—never was 
               <br />
               it a possibility as it is now a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possibililg.</span> 
               <br />
               After years of anxiety, after years of d' — 
               <br />
               culty, after troubles here and divisions there, 
               <br />
               the scheme is found possible, and I will not 
               <br />
               put it away from me because I object to this 
               <br />
               point or to that. If this harness of the Con- 
               <br />
               federation of the country is to be put on, we 
               <br />
               cannot but expect that it will chafe here and 
               <br />
               chafe there ; but time will give relief and 
               <br />
               provide the remedy, as it has done in other 
               <br />
               circumstances before. It was so in regard to 
               <br />
               the union of 1840. The Lower Canadians had 
               <br />
               a grievance in the French language being ex- 
               <br />
               cluded from the Provincial Parliament. That 
               <br />
               chafed, as was to be expected, and provoked 
               <br />
               remonstrance. And what was the result ? 
               <br />
               The injustice complained of was done away 
               <br />
               with, and both languages were thereafter per- 
               <br />
               mitted to be used. Then it was the desire 
               <br />
               of the people that the elective system should 
               <br />
               be introduced into this House. I believe my- 
               <br />
               self that it was a mistake, but a change was 
               <br />
               desired, and a change was brought about. 
               <br />
               And so it will be in this case.. If change is 
               <br />
               seriously desired, it will be had. It would be 
               <br />
               unwise and unstatesmanlike, in my opinion, 
               <br />
               to declare that because we cannot have our 
               <br />
               way on this point or on that point—that be- 
               <br />
               cause the scheme in all its features is not ex- 
               <br />
               actly what we would like it to be—we will 
               <br />
               not have it at all. Where, honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men, is the union eﬁ'ected between any two 
               <br />
               countries, or any two individuals even, which 
               <br />
               has lasted for any length of time without 
               <br />
               mutual forbearance and mutual concessions ? 
               <br />
               Let those honorable gentlemen who have had 
               <br />
               the good fortune of forming unions, and who 
               <br />
               can therefore speak from experience, say 
               <br />
               whether any union can be formed either 
               <br />
               happy or lasting without forbearance on both 
               <br />
               sides. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) You must 
               <br />
               give up all thoughts of union unless you are 
               <br />
               willing to give and take, and cease persisting for 
               <br />
               everything you think best. Nobody ever did 
               <br />
               effect a union upon such terms, and nobody ever 
               <br />
               will. You must forbear here and give way 
               <br />
               there. I trust and believe that in the present

               <br />
               himself to this union, for by union the peo-

               HON. Ma. SEYMOUR--The Hon. Com-

               missioner of Crown Lands is right in sup- 
               <br />
               posing that I am opposed to Federation I 
               <br />
               am opposed to it, and particularly on the 
               <br />
               basis agreed upon at the Quebec Convention. 
               <br />
               I do not say that I would be opposed to a 
               <br />
               legislative union on fair and equal terms; 
               <br />
               but I am decidedly opposed to Federation 
               <br />
               on the terms now before the House. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend has said that in all unions there 
               <br />
               must be forbearance; but in this Federation 
               <br />
               scheme it appears to me the forbearance has 
               <br />
               been all on one side. The forbearance has 
               <br />
               not been mutual. When parties enter into 
               <br />
               a partnership, there ought to be forbearance 
               <br />
               on the part of each, and mutual concessions. 
               <br />
               But in this case the concessions as well as 
               <br />
               the forbearance have been all on the side of 
               <br />
               Canada. My hon. friend, with all his elo-
