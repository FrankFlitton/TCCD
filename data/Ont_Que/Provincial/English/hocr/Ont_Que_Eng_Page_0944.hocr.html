               MB. DUFRESNE—I have allowed the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Richelieu to explain 
               <br />
               what he said, or wished to say, but he had no 
               <br />
               right to conclude with an unjust insinuation. 
               <br />
               However, I am not greatly surprised, for I 
               <br />
               am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aware</span> that it is the habit of his party, 
               <br />
               and that those honorable gentlemen never lose 
               <br />
               an opportunity of insulting those who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ'er</span> 
               <br />
               from them in their o inions. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               A few days ago, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whenll</span> begged leave to inter- 
               <br />
               rupt the honorable member for Richelieu, he 
               <br />
               consented courteously, and in replying to my 
               <br />
               remark—which was not of an insulting nature 
               <br />
               —he told me that he was not like me, for my 
               <br />
               speeches and my works were as yet things of 
               <br />
               the future. It was quite true, though it is 
               <br />
               not always well to speak the whole truth, 
               <br />
               nor, in fact, to hear it. (Laughton) But I 
               <br />
               must tell him that in my humble position, 
               <br />
               not being fully informed of all that takes 
               <br />
               place in the world, I have neither the means 
               <br />
               par the leisure to bring forth works of such 
               <br />
               vast importance as those of the honorable 
               <br />
               member. I content myself with coming here 
               <br />
               to discharge my duty towards my constituents, 
               <br />
               and I do it myself. I do not employ an oﬂi- 
               <br />
               cial in making researches in the library to 
               <br />
               enable me to make long speeches. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear, and laughter.) I do not require a paid 
               <br />
               employé of the Government to prepare my 
               <br />
               speeches; and, moreover, I have not as yet 
               <br />
               found means to live at the expense of the 
               <br />
               Government. And if my speeches and works 
               <br />
               are as yet things of the future, I am not, at 
               <br />
               all events, in the habit of supporting myself, 
               <br />
               like the honorable member for Richelieu, by 
               <br />
               drawing upon the public chest, with or with- 
               <br />
               out any just claim or right. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I have now done with the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Richelieu. I have a word to say to the 
               <br />
               honorable member for the county of Bagot. 
               <br />
               Though his speech was not an excessively 
               <br />
               brilliant one, yet he did not weary the House 
               <br />
               like the honorable member for Richelieu. He

               told us that we did not represent the senti- 
               <br />
               ments of our electors, but that there was no 
               <br />
               danger of our voting for an appeal to the pce— 
               <br />
               ple on the question of Confederation, because 
               <br />
               the people are so strongly o posed to the pro- 
               <br />
               ject that the Government are not submit it 
               <br />
               for their approval. He was not the ﬁrst to 
               <br />
               make the assertion, and I shall refer to the 
               <br />
               point presently. He then told the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment “ that it never was their intention to 
               <br />
               have the question of Confederation seriously 
               <br />
               discussed, and that they did not desire a dis- 
               <br />
               cussion of their scheme. But how did the 
               <br />
               honorable member expect to be believed? 
               <br />
               Was not the Government plan laid before the 
               <br />
               House at the commencement of the session— 
               <br />
               seven weeks ago ? Have not the Government 
               <br />
               and their friends done everything in their 
               <br />
               power to promote the discussion of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion, while honorable gentlemen opposite were 
               <br />
               unwilling to do so, and constantly strove to 
               <br />
               prevent its discussion ? What was their 
               <br />
               motive in so acting ? The honorable member 
               <br />
               for Bagot was, therefore, wrong in stating 
               <br />
               that the Government did not desire a discus- 
               <br />
               sion, and that they stiﬂed discussion; for it 
               <br />
               is perfectly clear that the Opposition did not 
               <br />
               desire it, and persistently refused it. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The honorable member for Bagot is 
               <br />
               not in his seat; but when he returns I shall 
               <br />
               have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few.</span> words to sav in reply to certain 
               <br />
               points in his s h. The honorable member 
               <br />
               for Drummon and Arthabaska (Mr. J. B. E. 
               <br />
               DORION) also told us that the movement 
               <br />
               throughout the country is so strong that it 
               <br />
               cannot be resisted; that the people are dis- 
               <br />
               contented, and that the consequences of that 
               <br />
               discontent will be highly disastrous. He spoke 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vastdnumber</span> of petitions presented to the 
               <br />
               House against Confederation, in order to shew 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maple</span> are opposed to it. Well, if 
               <br />
               all the honorable members of this House who 
               <br />
               sent petitions to their counties for signature 
               <br />
               have followed the same course as the honor- 
               <br />
               able member himself, it is not surprising <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               they should be numerously signed, for we all 
               <br />
               remember the honorable member’s letter, 
               <br />
               which was read in this House a few days ago 
               <br />
               by the Honorable Attorney General for Lower 
               <br />
               Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER). There can be 
               <br />
               no two opinions as to the character of that 
               <br />
               document. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) The 
               <br />
               House will bear in mind that he wrote to the 
               <br />
               wardens of his county, directing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> to get 
               <br />
               the petitions be forwarded signed by the men, 
               <br />
               the women, and the children! <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter)</span> 
               <br />
               And when his letter was read in this House, 
               <br />
               instead of blushing with shame and confusion,
