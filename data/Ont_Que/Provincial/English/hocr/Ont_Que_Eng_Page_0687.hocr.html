               at the future of this country for which we

               <br />
               time, by an extraordinary combination of 
               <br />
               events such as may never occur again, it 
               <br />
               presents itself to those empowered to deal

               with it practically and to give it life and

               the decision we shall come to on this impor-

               tant question. When I say that there

               has been an extraordinary combination of 
               <br />
               events, I think not the least extraordinary was 
               <br />
               the coming together of the leading men from 
               <br />

               <br />
               been witnessed oi the leaders of adverse 
               <br />

               <br />
               always give in party politics, and meeting 
               <br />
               together to settle upon a common ground of 
               <br />
               action? This we saw last summer in the 
               <br />
               meeting of the delegates from all the provinces 
               <br />
               Many of these gentlemen must have known 
               <br />
               that they risked their political positions, and 
               <br />
               we now know it in a practical way. But far 
               <br />
               better for a public man to be defeated in a 
               <br />
               great cause than to succeed in a bad one. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We cannot look upon the 
               <br />
               action of those men without conceding to 
               <br />
               them, ﬁrst of all, a great amount of creditfor 
               <br />
               the honorable and patriotic spirit which they 
               <br />
               evinced. Whatever views we may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hold”</span> of 
               <br />
               their judgment, it must _be conceded on all 
               <br />
               hands that their conduct deserves a high 
               <br />
               mood of praise. (Hear, hear.) But when 
               <br />
               we see this question taken up in all the 
               <br />
               provinces, and receiving so much attention 
               <br />
               in England, and even in other portions of 
               <br />
               EurOpe, in so short a period of time, I think 
               <br />
               we must feel that there must be some great 
               <br />
               overruling cause at work to induce so vast 
               <br />
               an amount of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> to be given to the 
               <br />
               subject. I have examined the questi n 
               <br />
               carefully in this aspect, and I venture to 
               <br />
               express an Opinion respecting the cause, 
               <br />
               by reference to the history of nations. I 
               <br />
               recollect in a speech from Lord MACAULAY, 
               <br />
               in addressing the University of Aberdeen 
               <br />
               I think it was, speaking of the events of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1848,</span> the remark occurs that since the inva- 
               <br />
               sion of the Huns civilization never ran such 
               <br />
               risks as in that year. (Hear, hear.) Its 
               <br />
               dangers passed away, but the results remain. 
               <br />
               The wave which threatened to submerge, 
               <br />
               obeying a natural law, retired beyond low— 
               <br />
               water mark, and has left exposed more than 
               <br />
               one coast. Small nations seem not to be 
               <br />
               considered, the faith of treaties is laughed 
               <br />
               at, and in this boasted age of civilization the 
               <br />
               doctrine that might is right prevails as 
               <br />
               strongly as in the seventeenth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">century.</span> 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The Danes, a brave and Vir— 
               <br />
               tuous people, have been exposed to a hopeless 
               <br />
               war with Austria and Prussia, chiefs of the 
               <br />
               Teutonic race, while England and France 
               <br />
               remonstrated, by words and proto cols, but 
               <br />
               acted not. The iron heel of Russia has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crushed</span> 
               <br />
               out the last sparks of freedom in Poland—- 
               <br />
               long-suﬁ'ering Poland, for whom so much 
               <br />
