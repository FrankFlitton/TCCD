               <br />

               Lower Canada, their rights and their liber-

               elective members, because the argument has 
               <br />
               referenceto the electoral divisions. Now let 
               <br />
               us look at the other branch of the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture; and I assert that the principle has 
               <br />
               worked equall well there. There are 258,000 
               <br />

               in the other branch of e Legislature by only 
               <br />
               two Roman Catholics, and one of these, I am 
               <br />
               told, like m honorable friend opposite who 
               <br />
               has avowed ' a Roman Catholic, never 
               <br />
               goes to mass. (Laughter.) He is, however, 
               <br />
               a good Catholic, because he has an accom- 
               <br />
               plished and charmin wife and most beautiful 
               <br />
               daughters, the who e of whom are zealous

               bound to take the h of the family as a 
               <br />
               good Catholic also. (Laughter.) Then, how 
               <br />
               does the case stand for the Protestants in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada ? In Upper Canada we have 
               <br />
               just seen that 258,000 Catholics are repre- 
               <br />
               sented by just two members of their own faith 
               <br />
               in the lower branch of the Legislature. 
               <br />
               How are the 160,000 Protestants in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada represented ? Well, honorable gentle-

               men, they are represented by no less than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">14</span> 
               <br />
               members. (Hear, hear.) That is to say 
               <br />
               more by ﬁfty per cent. than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tlh‘Îly</span> would be

               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I would ask are all these

               things more matters of accident ? Is it
