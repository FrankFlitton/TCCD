               about the great men who saved our nation- 
               <br />

               such language as the hon. member has done, 
               <br />
               they would not have obtained that which

               they did obtain. (Hear, hear.) Our

               one insult to England and Englishmen.

               <br />
               members or of the Lower Canadian peOple. 
               <br />
               I am therefore convinced that they will bear 
               <br />
               no ill-will to the French-Canadians in conse- 
               <br />
               quence of that speech. (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               has been said that the scheme of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion would entail the imposition of enormous 
               <br />
               taxes, and that we should have to provide 
               <br />
               for the defence of the country. And yet 
               <br />
               most of the hon. members who oppose this 
               <br />
               scheme acknowledge that the defence of the 
               <br />
               country must he provided for, or at least 
               <br />
               that we must contribute our share to it. 
               <br />
               Under the present régime, the Government 
               <br />
               has the right of presenting a bill respecting 
               <br />
               the militia or the defences, and the members 
               <br />
               may accept it or may reject it it they con- 
               <br />
               sider it too burdensome for us; and will the 
               <br />
               case be different in the Federal Parliament? 
               <br />
               We shall lose nothing, under Confederation, 
               <br />
               in respect of defence, tor we shall have allies 
               <br />
               who will assist us in economising and in 
               <br />
               preventing the adoption of any measure 
               <br />
               which would be beyond the strength of the 
               <br />
               country, for the people of the other prov- 
               <br />
               inces are no fonder of taxation than are 
               <br />
               those of Lower Canada. It is perfectly well 
               <br />
               known that any change in our position would 
               <br />
               be only to our advantage, under Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, in relation to defence; for if the United 
               <br />
               States should attack the English provinces, 
               <br />
               they would attack all the provinces together ; 
               <br />
               they would probably begin by attacking 
               <br />
               Canada, because they think more of Canada 
               <br />
               than of the Lower Provinces. In case of 
               <br />
               difﬁculties arising between England and the 
               <br />
               United States, the burthen of war would 
               <br />
               fall upon us, for we should he ﬁrst attacked.

               It is, therefore, our interest to be able to 
               <br />
               receive aid from the Maritime Provinces, 
               <br />
               and to be able to convey the reinforcements 
               <br />
               which they would send us, and which Eng- 
               <br />
               land would send us, by railway. As regards 
               <br />
               defence, I am of opinion that Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> 
               <br />
               would be found to occupy the most advan- 
               <br />
               tageous position in the Confederacy, being 
               <br />
               situated in the centre of all the provinces. 
               <br />
               (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> In a material point of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view,</span> 
               <br />
               we could not but grow and advance. The 
               <br />
               annexationists of the district of Montreal 
               <br />
               only are afraid of Confederation. Indeed, 
               <br />
               all the commercial transactions of the dis» 
               <br />
               trict of Montreal are with the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States.</span> 
               <br />
               But if we are not desirous of being annexed 
               <br />
               to the United States, and if we are desirous 
               <br />
               of preserving the institutions which are so 
               <br />
               dear to us, I maintain that we must con- 
               <br />
               struct a Cunfederacy which shall be compe— 
               <br />
               tent to protect us from the United States. 
               <br />
               If we will do nothing to show England that 
               <br />
               we are disposed to improve our position in 
               <br />
               relation to the defence of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Britieh</span> North 
               <br />
               American Provinces, we expose ourselves to 
               <br />
               see England withdraw her forces and aban- 
               <br />
               don us, because she cannot, unaided, carry 
               <br />
               on the strife with the United States. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With</span> 
               <br />
               our help, she would be certain of victory. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) _We ought, therefore, to build 
               <br />
               up a Constitution which will establish such 
               <br />
               relations between all the provinces as shall 
               <br />
               make of them a single state and a single 
               <br />
               people, who will unite in case of war. We 
               <br />
               may change our Constitution without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alter-</span> 
               <br />
               ing our institutions, and I maintain that the 
               <br />
               more monarchical our government is, the 
               <br />
               safer will our institutions be, for in those 
               <br />
               institutions the monarchical principle espe- 
               <br />
               cially predominates. It is in consequence of 
               <br />
               our having always been at peace that those 
               <br />
               institutions have grown and prospered. If 
               <br />
               England should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abandon</span> her colonies. the 
               <br />
               United States would take possession of as, 
               <br />
               and We should soon disappear, for the Ame 
               <br />
               rican Constitution is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rotect</span> 
               <br />
               our institutions. _The citizens of the cited 
               <br />
               States would show but little respect for 
               <br />
               those institutions, and the law would not 
               <br />
               be powerful enough to prevent the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">masses</span>

               from spreading themselves in our midst, and

               that I unite with pleasure with the men
