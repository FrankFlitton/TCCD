               <br />
               of England, that, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wﬁiatever</span> their desire to

               compel us to remain unwilling subjects of the 
               <br />
               British Crown. If therefore, at the Confer- 
               <br />
               once, we had arrived at the conclusion, that 
               <br />
               it was for the interest of these provinces that a 
               <br />
               severance should take place,I am sure that Her 
               <br />
               Majesty and the Imperial Parliament would 
               <br />
               have sanctioned that severance. We accord- 
               <br />
               ingly felt that there was a propriety in giving 
               <br />
               a distinct declaration of o inion on that point, 
               <br />
               and that, in framing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution,</span> its ﬁrst 
               <br />
               sentence should declare, that “ The Execu— 
               <br />
               tive authority or government shall be vested 
               <br />
               in the Sovereign of the United Kingdom of 
               <br />
               Great Britain and Ireland, and be adminis- 
               <br />
               tered according to the well understood prin- 
               <br />
               ciples of the British Constitution, by the 
               <br />
               Sovereign ersonally, or by the Representa- 
               <br />
               tive of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sovereign</span> duly authorised.” That 
               <br />
               resolution met with the unanimous assent of 
               <br />
               the Conference. The desire to remain con- 
               <br />
               nected with Great Britain and to retain our 
               <br />
               allegiance to Her Majesty was unanimous. 
               <br />
               Not a single suggestion was made, that it 
               <br />
               could, b any possibility, be for the interest 
               <br />
               of the co ouies, or of any section or portion of 
               <br />
               them, that there should be a severance 
               <br />
               of our connection. Although we knew it to 
               <br />
               be possible that Canada, from her position, 
               <br />
               might be exposed to all the horrors of war, 
               <br />
               by reason of causes of hostility arising 
               <br />
               between Great Britain and the United States 
               <br />
               -—-causes over which we had no control, and 
               <br />
               which we had no hand in bringing about-— 
               <br />
               yet there was a unanimous feeling of 
               <br />
               willingness to run all the hazards of war, if 
               <br />
               war must come, rather than lose the con- 
               <br />
               nection between the Mother Country and 
               <br />
               these colonies. (Cheers) We provide that 
               <br />
               “ the Executive authority shall be ad- 
               <br />

               by the Representative of the Sovereign duly 
               <br />

               <br />
               that the Queen should vouchsafe us her 
               <br />

               <br />
               hear.) Let me now invite the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the House to the provisions in 
               <br />
               the Constitution respecting the legisla- 
               <br />
               tive ower. The sixth resolution says, 
               <br />
               “ There shall be a general legislature or parlia- 
               <br />
               ment for the federated provinces, composed of 
               <br />
               a Legislative Council and a House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons.” This resolution has been cavilled 
               <br />
               at in the English press as if it excluded the 
               <br />
               Sovereign as a portion of the legislature. 
               <br />
               In one sense, that stricture was just—be- 
               <br />
               cause in strict constitutional language, the 
               <br />
               legislature of England consists of King, 
               <br />
               Lords and Commons. But, on the other 
               <br />
               hand, in ordinary parlance we speak of 
               <br />
               “ the King and his Parliament,” or “the 
               <br />
               King summoning his Parliament," the 
               <br />
               three estates—Lords spiritual, temporal 
               <br />
               Lords, and the House of Commons, and I 
               <br />
               observe that such a writer as Hallam occa- 
               <br />
               sionally uses the word Parliament in that 
               <br />
               restricted sense. At best it is merely a 
               <br />
               verbal criticism. The legislature of British 
               <br />
               North America will be composed of 
               <br />
               King, Lords, and Commons. The Legi- 
               <br />
               slative Council will stand in the same 
               <br />
               relation to the Lower House, as the 
               <br />
               House of Lords to the House of Commons 
               <br />
