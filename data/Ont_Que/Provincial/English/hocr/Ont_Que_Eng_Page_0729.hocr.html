               satisfy the public mind, to allege, and truly, 
               <br />
               that the Ministry had been compelled to make 
               <br />

               <br />
               vinces had been true to their pledges ? I am 
               <br />
               _of opinion, Mr. SPEAKER, that this is asking 
               <br />
               too much of us, and that as the Lower ro- 
               <br />
               vinces are evidently no longer in the min to 
               <br />
               be united with us, we French-Canadians should 
               <br />
               be greatly in the wrong if we presented our 
               <br />
               case with the same conditions as we were led 
               <br />
               to accept, in compliance with the require- 
               <br />
               ments of the sister colonies. I think that 
               <br />
               both Upper and Lower Canada are now 
               <br />
               entitled to present themselves much more 
               <br />
               favorably before the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, and that they may say—“ These are 
               <br />
               concessions which we had made, it is true, for 
               <br />
               the sake of the common good; but the Mari- 
               <br />
               time Provinces have now gone back from their 
               <br />
               en agements, and their present desire is 
               <br />
               eit er to remain independent or to enter the 
               <br />
               American Republic! We have done our duty, 
               <br />
               and we are still ready to remain faithful 
               <br />
               to our engagements, which we had entered 
               <br />
               into with the contracting parties; but asthey 
               <br />
               gave us up, and the concessions which we 
               <br />
               made are not now held by them to be suﬂi— 
               <br />
               cient, we are come to plead our own cause 
               <br />
               before you, and to tell you that the interests 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada now require better guaran- 
               <br />
               tees than we had been obliged to accept from 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces, for the sake of com- 
               <br />
               ing to an amicable conclusion. We now come 
               <br />
               to request that England will be more favour- 
               <br />
               able to us, and relieve us from our difﬁculties 
               <br />
               by making constitutional changes less disad- 
               <br />
               vantageous to us.” In such a case, I believe 
               <br />
               that the Imperial Government would not 
               <br />
               venture to impose a Constitution on us with- 
               <br />
               out our consent, but would be favourable to 
               <br />
               our wishes. That the French-Canadians are 
               <br />

               no one will doubt; but it would be an act of 
               <br />
               folly on the part of English statesmen to 
               <br />
               impose on them a Constitution which they 
               <br />
               would reject or very strongly resist. I say 
               <br />
               this out of a feeling of loyalty, for I know 
               <br />
               that there are statesmen in En land who 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               satisﬁed with their new onstitution. How 
               <br />
               would it beneﬁt England to give us a Con- 
               <br />
               stitution which might suit her, as tending to 
               <br />
               perpetuate her rule in Lower Canada, but 
               <br />
               which would not be at the same time satis- 
               <br />
               factory to the majority in both Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada? A spirit of discontent 
               <br />
               would be soon aroused which would cool our 
               <br />
               zeal in' defending our country. This is a 
               <br />
               self-evident truth, intelligible to all the world. 
               <br />
               I trust, therefore, Mr. SPEAKER, that if the 
               <br />
               measure of Confederation is passed, it will 
               <br />
               not be forced upon us, without the present 
               <br />
               House having an opportunity of weighing 
               <br />
               its merits, and amending it. I am pre- 
               <br />
               pared, I confess, to go as far as any man, 
               <br />
               and to make the greatest concessions, to ext-ri- 
               <br />
               cate the country from its diﬁculties, and 
               <br />
               come to a good understanding, that we may 
               <br />
               make sure of a Confederation with the immense 
               <br />
               advantages which it might brin with it; but 
               <br />
               I am bound to confess, when am told, in 
               <br />
               presence of the events which have just passed, 
               <br />
               that we must submit to the conditions impœed 
               <br />
               on us by the contracting parties, who have, 
               <br />
               so soon after making it, refused toratify it——I 
               <br />
               say that I think it wrong to tie down Lower 
               <br />
               Canada absolutely to the ﬁrst conditions. I 
               <br />
               wish the extreme position which the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment have taken up in the face of the country 
               <br />
               may be productive of the greatest amount of 
               <br />
               good to it; but, for my part, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> I 
               <br />
               cannot help thinking and confessing that I 
               <br />
               have very strong fears 'on that subject. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that in the present circumstances, 
               <br />
               the Government ought to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">granwd</span> the 
               <br />
               fullest Opportunity, both to Upper and to 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, to make such suggestions as 
               <br />
               they might think ﬁt, and not to insist on the 
               <br />
               adaption of the scheme in its present form. 
               <br />
               By such a proceeding they would have aﬁ'orded 
               <br />
               members who have amendments to move a 
               <br />
