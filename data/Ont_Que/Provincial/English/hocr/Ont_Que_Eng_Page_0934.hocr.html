               of every honorable member of this House, 
               <br />
               that some ﬁfteen years since a movement 
               <br />
               was set on foot in Montreal, which had as 
               <br />
               its avowed object the severance of Canada 
               <br />
               from its connection with England, and its 
               <br />
               annexation to the United States. The gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inaugurated</span> that movement 
               <br />
               were men of inﬂuence and high standing in 
               <br />
               the country, and some of them, as we all 
               <br />
               know, now occupy prominent positions in 
               <br />
               this House; they claimed then, as they do 
               <br />
               now, to be good and loyal British subjects, 
               <br />
               and yet they deliberately framed a document 
               <br />
               to which they attached their signatures, in 
               <br />
               which they prayed their Sovereign to allow 
               <br />
               this province to withdraw from its connection 
               <br />
               with England, and attach itself to the United 
               <br />
               States. Sir, the framers of the document to 
               <br />
               which I refer—the Annexation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manifesto—</span> 
               <br />
               were not animated by a rebellious feeling 
               <br />
               against the Mother Country, but by feelings 
               <br />
               of loyalty to the interests of this country ; 
               <br />
               their arguments were logical, and founded 
               <br />
               upon those material considerations which, 
               <br />
               after all, do exercise, and must continue to 
               <br />
               exert a more powerful inﬂuence over the 
               <br />
               minds of intelligent men in the nineteenth 
               <br />
               century, than any mere sentiment, or prefer- 
               <br />
               ence for any particular form of government; 
               <br />
               and sir, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we,</span> all know that but a short time 
               <br />
               after the publication of the annexation mani- 
               <br />
               festo, a new era dawned upon the country. 
               <br />
               The Grand Trunk Railway and other im- 
               <br />
               portant public works were inaugurated. 
               <br />
               British capital ﬂowed into the province in 
               <br />
               copious streams, the pockets of the annexa- 
               <br />
               tionists were replenished, and their loyalty 
               <br />
               reestablished, upon a basis which has lasted 
               <br />
               ever since. The reciprocity, too, contributed 
               <br />
               largely to the removal of the depression 
               <br />
               which engendered the annexation movement; 
               <br />
               and under the operation of that treaty, the 
               <br />
               material interests of the country have pros- 
               <br />
               pered to a degree that will only be fully 
               <br />
               appreciated when we have been deprived of 
               <br />
               its advantages. Sir, no conceivable state of 
               <br />
               things would have induced me to become a 
               <br />
               party to that movement in favor of annexa- 
               <br />
               tion, but I am free to confess that the 
               <br />
               arguments advanced by the framers of the 
               <br />
               document to which I have referred were 
               <br />
               sound and logical—regarding them from a 
               <br />
               material point of view; and if they were so 
               <br />
               at that time, why should they not be equally 
               <br />
               so now? For the last ten years, we have 
               <br />
               enjoyed all the advantages of t‘ree intercourse 
               <br />
               and free trade with our powerful neighbors 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               of the United States. We are now in danger 
               <br />
               of being deprived of both—and if we are, 
               <br />
               what will be the condition of this country 
               <br />
               three years hence ? Shall we not be reduced 
               <br />
               to a state more disastrous to our agricultural 
               <br />
               and other‘ important interests, than we have 
               <br />
               yet experienced? And am I wrong, sir, in 
               <br />
               assuming that similar causes would once 
               <br />
               more produce the same effects? It is all very 
               <br />
               well tor hon. gentlemen to say “ No, no,” 
               <br />
               but I maintain that I am right; and, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, it is our duty to look the 
               <br />
               existing state of things in the face. The 
               <br />
               impulses of mankind have been the same 
               <br />
               in all ages. We cannot change human 
               <br />
               nature, nor make men honest or disinter- 
               <br />
               ested, by act of Parliament. But, sir, I 
               <br />
               have only referred to the past in the hepe 
               <br />
               that the recollection of the events and the 
               <br />
               state of things to which I have alluded, may 
               <br />
               have some inﬂuence upon the minds of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen—may, perhaps, induce some 
               <br />
               modiﬁcation in the course of even a single 
               <br />
               member, who has hitherto been prejudiced 
               <br />
               against the scheme of union brought down 
               <br />
               by the Government. That we have arrived 
               <br />
               at a critical period in the history of this 
               <br />
               continent, is universally admitted. Events 
               <br />
               of the most momentous character are trans- 
               <br />
               piring upon our borders, and I regret to say 
               <br />
               there exists towards us among our republi- 
               <br />
               can neighbors a deep-rooted feeling of hos- 
               <br />
               tility. Occurrences have taken place during 
               <br />
               the progress of the war which have tended, 
               <br />
               step by step, to intensify that feeling, which 
               <br />
               has displayed itself in the stoppage of unre- 
               <br />
               stricted intercourse, and the threatened abro- 
               <br />
               gation of the treaty of reciprocal free trade. 
               <br />
               In view of this state of things, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               if we wish either to continue our connection 
               <br />
               with England or to maintain a separate 
               <br />
               national existence of our own, it is our duty 
               <br />
               to devise some means by which we shall be 
               <br />
               enabled at all seasons to obtain access to the 
               <br />
               seaboard through our own territory; to 
               <br />
               strengthen ourselves numerically; to increase 
               <br />
               our wealth materially, and to add to our 
               <br />
               importance territorially. All these results, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, may, in my opinion, be 
               <br />
               obtained by the union now proposed. 
               <br />
               Sir, it is because I entertain this Opinion 
               <br />
               that I am prepared to accept the proposition 
               <br />
               under consideration without criticising its 
               <br />
               details. If I were disposed to enter into de- 
               <br />
               tails, l would most earnestly object to that 
               <br />
               part of the project which relates to the 
               <br />
               development of the N orth-West, and the 
               <br />
