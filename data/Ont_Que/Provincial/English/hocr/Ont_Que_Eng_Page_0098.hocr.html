               representation according to population should 
               <br />
               also have prevailed. But who ever heard that

               in a Federal Constitution the Upper House 
               <br />
               should be arranged on that principle ? If

               that view be the sound one, the better way

               wheels of government would unavoidably be

               more powerful members of the Confederacy

               letely overwhelm the weaker. This was 
               <br />

               for the sup rt of the schools. Upper Canada

               The honorable member at last conclu ed his

               remarks by drawing a sorry ieture of the

               condition of Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">According</span> to him, it

               appointed delegates met and devised this 
               <br />
               scheme for its further embarrassment. So 
               <br />
               far from this being the case, it is a matter 
               <br />
               of history that the Government was formed 
               <br />
               expressly for the purpose of considering and 
               <br />
               framing this ve scheme, and getting rid of 
               <br />
               the dead-locks which have so injuncusly aﬁ'ected 
               <br />
               the legislation of the country. lt appeared
