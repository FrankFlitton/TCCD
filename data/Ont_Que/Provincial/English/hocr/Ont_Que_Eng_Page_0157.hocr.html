               WILMOT, who the other day declared in

               ments also not to be overlooked. The thrifty

               Germans of Lunenberg, whose homes are 
               <br />
               the neatest upon the land, as their ﬂeet is 
               <br />
               the tightest on the sea, and other smaller 
               <br />
               subdivisions ; but I shall not prolong this 
               <br />
               analysis. I may observe, however, that this 
               <br />
               pepulation is almost universally a native 
               <br />
               population of three or four or more genera- 
               <br />
               tions. In New Brunswick, at the most there 
               <br />
               is about twelve per cent. of an immigrant peo- 
               <br />
               ple ; in Nova Scotia, about eight ; in the two 
               <br />
               islands, very much less. In the eye of the 
               <br />
               law we admit no disparity between natives 
               <br />
               and immigrants in this country; but it is to 
               <br />
               be considered that where men are born in 
               <br />
               the presence of the graves of their fathers, 
               <br />
               for even a few generations, the inﬂuence of 
               <br />
               that fact is great in enhancing their attach- 
               <br />
               ment to that soil. I admit, for my part, as 
               <br />
               an immigrant, of no divided allegiance to 
               <br />
               Canada and her interests; but it would be 
               <br />
               untrue and paltryto deny a divided aﬂ'ection 
               <br />
               between the old country and the new. Kept 
               <br />
               within just bounds, such an aﬁ'ection is rea- 
               <br />
               sonable, is right and creditable to those who 
               <br />
               cherish it. (Hear, hear.) Why I refer to 
               <br />
               this broad fact which distinguishes the popu— 
               <br />
               lations of all the four seaward provinces as 
               <br />
               much as it does Lower Canada herself, is, to 
               <br />
               show the ﬁxity and stability of that popula— 
               <br />
               tion; to show that they are by birth British 
               <br />
               Americans; that they can nearly all, of 
               <br />
               every origin, use that proud phrase when 
               <br />
               they look daily from their doors, “this is 
               <br />
               my own, my native land.” (Cheers.) Let 
               <br />
               but that population and ours come together 
               <br />
               for a generation or two—such are the ele- 
               <br />
               ments that compose, such the conditions that 
               <br />
               surround it——and their mutual descendants 
               <br />
               will bear with wonder, when the history of 
               <br />
               these present transactions are written, that 
               <br />
               this plan of union could ever have been 
               <br />
               seriously opposed by statesmen in Canada. or 
               <br />
               elsewhere. (Cheers) I am told, however, 
               <br />
               by one or two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> of this House, and
