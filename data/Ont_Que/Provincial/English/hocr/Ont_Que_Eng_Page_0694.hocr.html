               one another because of the provinces which they 
               <br />
               represent. Under our present Constitution 
               <br />
               we are not divided sectionally, but as political 
               <br />

               true the demand for constitutional changes

               <br />
               such as commerce, banking, customs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬁ‘s,</span>

               and not as representing sections. So it will 
               <br />
               be under the Confederation. People will be 
               <br />
               divided into parties by their political opinions 
               <br />
               and leanings, and not by sectional considera- 
               <br />

               <br />
               majority against Upper Canada, is to assume 
               <br />
               that Upper Canada will be at war with all the 
               <br />
               other provinces, and that they will be con- 
               <br />
               tmnally at war with it. Well, what right 
               <br />
               hasany man to assume that this will be the case 
               <br />
               —that Upper Canada will be the Ishmael of the 
               <br />
               Confederation ? I think he has none what- 
               <br />
               ever. (Hear, hear.) The addition of seven- 
               <br />

               <br />

               that Upper Canada ever asked for or expected.

               ber of the other House has taken similar

               <br />
               Provinces have been bribed into this scheme 
               <br />
               at the expense of Upper Canada, and that as 
               <br />
               regards Lower Canada, we undertake to pay 
               <br />
               her in perpetuity a subsidy of $167,000 a 
               <br />
               year; and the honorable gentleman asks if ever 
               <br />
               Lower Canada asked for anything like that 
               <br />
               under our present system ? He tells us, too, 
               <br />
               that for each of the seventeen additional mem- 
               <br />
               bers we get in the Federal Government, we 
               <br />
               pay at the rate of $16,000 each. As regards 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces, I submit that it 
               <br />
               cannot be shewn that their union with us 
               <br />
               will be to our detriment in money matters. 
               <br />
               They will contribute as large an amount per 
               <br />
               head to the general revenue as we do in 
               <br />
               U per Canada, and if any ﬁnancial effect 
               <br />
               w' be felt by Upper Canada in consequence 
               <br />
               of the union of these provinces with us, I 
               <br />
               think it must be in the direction of lessening 
               <br />
               her burdens; such, at all events, is the con- 
               <br />
               clusion I have arrived at, and such, I think, is 
               <br />
               the conclusion any man will arrive at who 
               <br />
               will take the trouble to inform himself of the 
               <br />
               position of these provinces as regards the ﬁn- 
               <br />
               ancial questions between Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. I do not know where the honorable 
               <br />
               member gets his ﬁgures, nor can I very well 
               <br />
               understand them, but in regard to the subsidy 
               <br />
               of $167,000 a year that he speaks of, what 
               <br />
               are the facts of the case ? Let it be borne in 
               <br />
               mind, sir, that as Upper Canadians we claimed 
               <br />
               that we were paying an enormous price for 
               <br />
               the present union with Lower Canada, and 
               <br />
               that we urged this as one reason why we were 
               <br />
               entitled to the concession of representation by 
               <br />
               population as an act of justice, that we might 
               <br />
               have our due share of inﬂuence in controlling 
               <br />
               the expenditure of the revenues of the country 
               <br />
               tô which we contributed so largely. Wc com- 
               <br />
               plained, and it was advanced in this Assembly 
               <br />
               over and over again, as one of the reasons for 
               <br />
               demanding representation by population, that 
               <br />
               our money was given away to sections which 
               <br />
               contributed little or nothing to the general re- 
               <br />
               venue; that while we paid seventy per cent. 
               <br />
               of the revenue and Lower Canada only thirty 
               <br />
               per cent., an equal proportion of the expen- 
               <br />
               diture was enjoyed by Lower Canada; and 
               <br />
