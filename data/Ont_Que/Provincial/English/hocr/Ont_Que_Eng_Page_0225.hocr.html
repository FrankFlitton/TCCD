               orable members not to pass a measure of

               HON. MB. BENNETT said—Honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, after the many able and eloquent 
               <br />
               speeches we have heard on this subject, it 
               <br />
               may be presumptuous in me to oﬂ'er any re- 
               <br />
               marks —(cries of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">H‘Igo</span> on.”)—but I cannot 
               <br />
               consent to give a ° ent vote upon the ques- 
               <br />
               tion before the House, and I think I would 
               <br />
               be wanting in my duty to those who sent me 
               <br />
               here if I did not make some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘observations</span> 
               <br />
               upon this important subject. Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I think honorable gentlemen ° 1 agree with 
               <br />
               me that this roject is one of the most impor- 
               <br />
               tant—indee , the most important—that has 
               <br />
               ever been brought before the Legislature of 
               <br />
               Canada. (Hear, hear.) We are about to 
               <br />
               witness a great change in the Constitution of 
               <br />
               the country, the like of which has not been 
               <br />
               seen since the union of the provinces; and I 
               <br />
               am free to say that a change of some kind or 
               <br />
               other is imperatively demanded, for I think 
               <br />
               that if the present state of things were al- 
               <br />
               lowed to continue it would be diﬁicult, if not 
               <br />
               impossible, to carry on the Government as it 
               <br />
               has been carried on for the last three or four 
               <br />

               the honorable and gallant gentleman at the 
               <br />
               head of the Government that we have been 
               <br />
               on an inclined plane, and I am sure thatif 
               <br />
               some remedy had not been proposed we would 
               <br />
               have found ourselves slidi into a state of 
               <br />
               anarchy from the bitterness of feeling which 
               <br />
               prevailed in the country. I am not so sanguine, 
               <br />
               as some honorable gentlemen seem to be, that 
               <br />
               when we get Confederation we shall have a 
               <br />
               sort of political millennium, that we shall have 
               <br />
               no more political storms and agitations, but 
               <br />
               that we shall then enjoy nothing but the calm 
               <br />
               and sunshine of political life. But I think 
               <br />
               we will ﬁnd ourselves pretty much in the 
               <br />
               same position as before with regard to parties 
               <br />
               —-that we shall have a Government party and 
               <br />
               an Opposition, for in all free constitutional 
               <br />
               governments it is better to have an opposition 
               <br />
               than to be without one. I object, not to 
               <br />
               a healthy opposition, but to a factions one. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) From the difference in the 
               <br />
               laws, language and institutions of the several 
               <br />
               provinces it.- is olear that a legislative union 
               <br />
               of them is out of the question. The rinci- 
               <br />
               ple of the double majority, as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remeg</span> for 
               <br />
               our diﬂicnlties, has proved to be‘a f ‘ un; 
               <br />
               representation b population, which would 
               <br />
               have satisﬁed pper Canada, has been per- 
               <br />
               sistently denied by Lower Canada; and, 
               <br />
               therefore, I see no resource but to fall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back.</span> 
               <br />
               upon the project of the Confederation .of the 
               <br />
               provinces. (Hear, hear.) I would like to 
               <br />
               remark upon the peculiar position in which 
               <br />
               the elected members of this House stand in 
               <br />
               reference to this subject. It has been said 
               <br />
               that, if they vote for the resolutions, the vote 
               <br />
               to make themselves members of the ones 
               <br />
               for life; that this was not contemplated by 
               <br />
               the constituencies when they were elected; 
               <br />
               and that it would be destroying the franchise 
               <br />
               and taking away a right from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peas}:</span> 
               <br />
               which the House had no authority to 
               <br />
               Well, all I can say is, that I have heard no 
               <br />
               such objections from the people of the con- 
               <br />
               stituenc which I have the honor to repre- 
               <br />
               sent. l I have heard from them is a call 
               <br />
               for delay in the consideration of this question, 
               <br />
               and I maintain that dela is not fatal or 
               <br />
               injurious to it. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> We have 
               <br />
               delayed it already for weeks; in New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick it has been postponed till after the gen- 
               <br />
               eral election; and can any one show me that 
               <br />
               it will injure the measure to ut it oﬁ‘ for a 
               <br />
               short time longer? Surelyi it is now, 
               <br />
               it will be just as cod twelve mon hence. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gloat,</span> hear.) he resolutions have been 
               <br />
               awn up by able, talented, but fallible men; 
               <br />
               and therefore we ought to weigh them care-
