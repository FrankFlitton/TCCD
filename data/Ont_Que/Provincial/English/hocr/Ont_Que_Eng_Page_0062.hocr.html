               and fully gone into by my two honorable 
               <br />
               friends. The last resolution of any import- 
               <br />
               ance is one which, although not affecting the 
               <br />
               substance of the Constitution, is of interest to 
               <br />
               us all. It is that “ Her Majesty the Queen 
               <br />
               be solicited to determine the rank and name 
               <br />
               of the federated provinces.” I do not know 
               <br />
               whether there will be any expression of 
               <br />
               opinion in this House on this subject— 
               <br />
               whether we are to be a vice-royalty, or whether 
               <br />
               we are still to retain our name and rank ass 
               <br />
               province. But I have no doubt Her Majesty 
               <br />
               will give the matter Her gracious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerap</span> 
               <br />
               tion, that She will give us a name satisfactory 
               <br />
               to us all, and that the rank She will confer 
               <br />
               a n as will be a rank worthy of our position, 
               <br />
               our resources, and of our future. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> 
               <br />
               Let me again, before I sit down, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impress</span> upon 
               <br />
               this House the necessity of meeting this 
               <br />
               question in a spirit of compromise, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> a 
               <br />
               disposition to judge the matter as a whole, 
               <br />
               to consider whether really it is for the beneﬁt 
               <br />
               and advantage of the country to form 9. Con- 
               <br />
               federation of all the provinces ; and if 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, whatever may have 
               <br />
               been their preconceived ideas as to the 
               <br />
               merits of the details of this measure, whatever 
               <br />
               ma still be their opinions as to these details, 
               <br />
               if they really believe that the scheme is one 
               <br />
               by which the prosperity of the country will 
               <br />
               be increased, and its future progress secured, 
               <br />
               I ask them to yield their own views, and to 
               <br />
               deal with the scheme according to its merits 
               <br />
               as One great whole. (H ear, hear.) One 
               <br />
               argument, but not a strong one, has been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">med</span> against this Confederation, that it is an 
               <br />
               advance towards independence. Some are 
               <br />
               apprehensive that the very fact ofour forming 
               <br />
               this union will hasten the time when we shall 
               <br />
               be severed from the mother country. I have 
               <br />
               no apprehension of that kind. I believe it 
               <br />
               will have the contrary eﬁ'ect I believe that 
               <br />
               as we grow stronger, that, as it is felt in 
               <br />
               England we have become a people, able from 
               <br />

               <br />
