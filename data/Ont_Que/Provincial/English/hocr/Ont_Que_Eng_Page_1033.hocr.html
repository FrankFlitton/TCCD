               <br />
               exists in this House itself. I have seen the

               <br />
               great leader of the Reform party ﬁnds it 
               <br />
               necessary to stand up here and throw dust in 
               <br />

               <br />
               the peeple, to whose touch he has been so 
               <br />

               sulted, the Honorable Attorney General took 
               <br />
               a diﬁ'erent course. He was asked for 
               <br />
               precedents, and told us that when vio- 
               <br />
               lent constitutional changcs had been made 
               <br />
               in England, the precedents for the course 
               <br />
               proposed by this motion were founded. He 
               <br />
               talked to us about the union of Ireland, in 
               <br />
               connection with which the career of PITT—a 
               <br />
               career that was distinguished in Britain, but 
               <br />
               which was of such a character that, though 
               <br />
               signalized throughout Europe, it yet produced 
               <br />
               a reaction that caused England to fallback 
               <br />
               in the race of national progress for many 
               <br />
               years. The result of his course was such 
               <br />
               that some of the brightest names on English 
               <br />
               history left the reform principles to which 
               <br />
               they had been attached, and connected them- 
               <br />
               selves with the Pitt party, and the same 
               <br />
               will be the result here of the game now being 
               <br />
               played by honorable gentlemen opposite. 
               <br />
               This is the precedent which, in a British 
               <br />
               constitutional country of the nineteenth cen- 
               <br />

               <br />
               over our backs. Why, sir, we have no 
               <br />

               was when this Government was formed last 
               <br />

               <br />
               knight at the head of the Government was 
               <br />

               <br />
               brought his Government before the House, he 
               <br />
               did not then hold up to us the danger of in- 
               <br />
               vasion, unless we supported his Government. 
               <br />
               The Government did not then inform us that 
               <br />
               if we did not form a Federal union we would 
               <br />
               be annexed to the United States. All these 
               <br />
               threats on their part have grown out of acci-

               dents that have happened to their policy since 
               <br />

               that is being played now is one that cannot

               but provoke a conservative reaction in this
