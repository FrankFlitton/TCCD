               Mr. SPEAKER, I think it would be a good

               thing if we were a little more aroused 
               <br />

               earnest, so that the people of the United 
               <br />
               States should not fall into the habit of 
               <br />
               regarding the British lion, as the Paris 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Charivari</span> called it, 'as a stuﬂ'ed lion. I 
               <br />
               sometimes wish the British lion would roar 
               <br />
               --(laughter)—as it has reared in times past, 
               <br />
               and as it roared when it made the Emperor 
               <br />
               of all the Russias tremble in his shoes. 
               <br />
               (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">h‘)</span> I am afraid our neighbors 
               <br />
               are getting into the very false notion that it 
               <br />
               is only the skin of the animal that we have 
               <br />
               now—(laughter)—and that if the voice 
               <br />
               were heard, it would not be a roar, but a bray. 
               <br />
               But they must not trust too much to 
               <br />
               this idea, or they will be rudely awakened 
               <br />
               some day by ﬁnding the bones, and the blood, 
               <br />
               and the muscle of the mighty old animal of 
               <br />
               yore. I feel, sir, that we cannot do our duty 
               <br />
               to the Imperial authorities, nor they to us, 
               <br />
               unless we become united into one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confedero</span> 
               <br />
               ation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead.</span> of remaining in the scattered 
               <br />
               position in which we now stand. What 
               <br />
               would be our position if we were thus 
               <br />
               united? The opponents of Confederation say 
               <br />
               we should only get a more extended frontier 
               <br />
               to defend, and have no more men to defend 
               <br />
               it with; that the frontier we should acquire 
               <br />
               would be more diﬁicult to defend with the 
               <br />
               addition of men we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> acquire, than our 
               <br />
               present frontier would be to defend with our 
               <br />
               own force ; that Canada might be called upon 
               <br />
               to send troops to the Lower Provinces, thus 
               <br />
               leaving our own frontier exposed, or they 
               <br />
               would have to send their militia force up 
               <br />
               here, leaving their borders open to attack. 
               <br />
               But, in reply to that reasoning, I would say 
               <br />
               that it is not likely we should be attacked at 
               <br />
               all points at once. We might be compelled to 
               <br />
               withdraw entirely from one portion of the 
               <br />
               territory in order to defend more important 
               <br />
               portions, or to obtain more defensible posi- 
               <br />
               tions; but no man can hesitate to agree that 
               <br />
               it is inﬁnitely better, for all purposes of 
               <br />
               defensive action, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Whole</span> militia force 
               <br />
               of the country should be under the control 
               <br />
               of one executive head, who could grasp the 
               <br />
               whole force in one hand, than that they 
               <br />
               should be scattered over awide domain of 
               <br />
               exposed territory, under the command of 
               <br />
               diﬁ‘erent executives, all of whom would have 
               <br />
               to be communicated with before any concen- 
               <br />

               <br />

               we cannot establish a nation when we have 
               <br />
               four millions of people, what shall we say of

               Greece with its pepulation of only one mil-

               boon that a government and people can
