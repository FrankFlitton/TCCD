               chcralAdministration may not be on speaking

               in that position, and :1 Lieutenant Governor in 
               <br />

               ticklish questions for adjudication by the

               fect here, which might lead to plenty of 
               <br />
               trouble. But it is said—“ Oh! there won’t 
               <br />
               be any trouble; men are in the main sensible, 
               <br />

               ifthis is so, if there is this general disposition 
               <br />
               to be sensible, and make things work well, I 
               <br />
               just want to know how we. come to have had 
               <br />
               four crises in two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years?</span> (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               There is another matter, intimately con- 
               <br />
               nected with this, to which also I must 
               <br />
               pass on. I said a little while ago, that 
               <br />
               the United States system was one of ex- 
               <br />
               ceeding skill as regards the constitution of the 
               <br />
               judiciary. DE TOCQUEVILLE, and every other 
               <br />
               writer who has treated ot‘thc United States, 
               <br />
               has awarded it this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">praise;</span> and they are 
               <br />
               right. Each state has its own judiciary; and 
               <br />
               the United States have theirs; and the func- 
               <br />
               tions of the two are most carefully laid down, 
               <br />
               so that no serious trouble has ever arisen 
               <br />
               from their clashing. The judiciary of the 
               <br />
               United States is undoubtedly the most conser- 
               <br />
               vative and strongest bulwark of their whole 
               <br />
               system. (Hear, hear.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vhat</span> then are we 
               <br />
               going to do on this head ? Just as we have 
               <br />
               forgotten all about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> where the seat 
               <br />
               of government is concerned, so here. We

               are not quite sure whether we are going to 
               <br />
               have any distinctively federal judiciary or 
               <br />
               n)t. There is a power given tohavc <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one—there</span> 
               <br />
               may be one; but we are expressly told that 
               <br />
               perhaps there will not be. But what are 
               <br />
               we told on the other hand? Oh, there 
               <br />
               is no doubt whatever, according to the re- 
               <br />
               solutions laid before us —-no doubt what- 
               <br />
               ever—that whether we have a Federal judi- 
               <br />
               ciary or not, the provincial judiciarics are to 
               <br />

               judges, and pays them, and alone can remove 
               <br />
               them. Does that take away the power from 
               <br />
               the local parliaments and governments, the

               And we are told there will be no clashing!

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Ilean)</span> I have no doubt the Hon. Attorney 
               <br />
               General East thinks he could manage courts 
               <br />
               on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system;</span> could have one authority 
               <br />
               constituting the courts and another naming 
               <br />
               and removing thejudges, and have the system 
               <br />
               work harmoniously. He may think so. I do 
               <br />
               not. I am satisﬁed if ever the scheme is 
               <br />
               tried, it will be found that it will not work. 
               <br />
               Human nature is human nature; and here is 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrstrate</span> lot of matters to quarrel over, and 
               <br />
               to quarrel over seriously. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\V</span> by, there is even 
               <br />
               a special reﬁnement of confusion as to crimi- 
               <br />
               nal matters. Criminal procedure is to be 
               <br />
               federal; civil procedure, provincial; crimi- 
               <br />
               nal legislation, proper, is to be federal; but 
               <br />
               with a most uncertain quantity of what one 
               <br />
               may call legislation about penalties, provin- 
               <br />
               cial; civil rights, in the main, provincial; 
               <br />
               but with no one can tell how much of federal 
               <br />
               interference and over-ruling, and all with 
               <br />
               courts provincial in constitution, but whose 
               <br />
               judges hold by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federal</span> tenure and under 
               <br />
               federal pay. I pity the poor man who is at 
               <br />
               once a. criminal judge and a civil judge. Be-
