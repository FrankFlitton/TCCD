               element of forty-seven members altogether 
               <br />
               to the Lower House. I say I am persuaded 
               <br />
               the people did not understand that this was 
               <br />
               tobe done without their having an oppor— 
               <br />
               tunity of speaking upon it, and of saying 
               <br />
               whether they approved of it or not. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) And I scarcely can believe that we 
               <br />
               will be able to ﬁnd, at this late day of the 
               <br />
               world’s history, in a free country such as 
               <br />
               Canada, among a people who understand 
               <br />
               what are their rights and liberties, a govern- 
               <br />
               ment prepared to act in so unconstitutional 
               <br />
               a manner—a government ready to tyrannize 
               <br />
               and to assume the part of an oligarchy. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But this Government is pre- 
               <br />
               pared to act thus. They tell their followers 
               <br />
               that they are at their peril to accept the 
               <br />
               scheme just as it is, that they are not at 
               <br />
               liberty to change a single word of it, and if 
               <br />
               they do so theywill defeat the whole project. 
               <br />
               That, however, is not the way in which hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen in the Lower Provinces deal with 
               <br />
               this question. Hon. Mr. TILLEY, in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, only two or three days ago,made the de— 
               <br />
               claration that if the people’s representatives 
               <br />
               choose to alter the resolutions, they were at 
               <br />
               liberty to do so. (Hear, hear.) And yet 
               <br />
               we in Canada are gravely told that we are 
               <br />
               not to be allowed to exercise any judgment 
               <br />
               or to pronounce any opinion upon it. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I regard the scheme itself as having 
               <br />
               been got up hastily, for it bears upon its face 
               <br />
               the evidence of haste and of compromise. 
               <br />
               Indeed, it is a complete piece of patchwork, 
               <br />
               and as we are all aware, it is a piece of patch- 
               <br />
               work in which we are 'not to be at liberty to 
               <br />
               change the patches in any respect so as to 
               <br />
               make it look better to the eye or more en- 
               <br />
               during to those who will have to wear it. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear, and laughter.) On the subject 
               <br />
               of the Legislative Council, it does strike me 
               <br />
               that the language is not such as to convey

               themselves to nominate to themselves. Is

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> these nominations can take place, I

               assume that the Executive Government

               must be in existence, and that when the

               Imperial Act passed, there would be an 
               <br />
               end to the present arrangements, and that 
               <br />
               the local legislatures and the General Le- 
               <br />
               gislature would be brought into existence at 
               <br />
               the same moment.. The present Government 
               <br />
               of United Canada would cease to exist. And 
               <br />
               how then would the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nominations</span> to the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council take place, from this 
               <br />
               Government to the Executive Government 
               <br />
               of the Confederation? (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bean)</span> In 
               <br />
               one way, these resolutions may be considered 
               <br />
               as only an outline of the Constitution. But 
               <br />
               they seem to have descended to very small 
               <br />
               details. For instance, they say that a mem- 
               <br />
               ber who is absent from the Council for two 
               <br />
               sessions shall vacate his seat. This is a very 
               <br />
               small piece of detail, and I regard it also as 
               <br />
               a very unjust piece of detail, because the 
               <br />
               cause of a member’s absence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> be sickness, 
               <br />
               and it ma be the case that a member would 
               <br />
               be sick uring the period of two sittings 
               <br />

               that when they went into detail such as this,

               the details ought to be full enough to prove
