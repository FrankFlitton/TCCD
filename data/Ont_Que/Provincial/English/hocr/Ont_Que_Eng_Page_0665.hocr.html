               to say a few words. The Government is 
               <br />
               well aware that the House must naturally feel 
               <br />
               anxious and desirous of information—and 
               <br />
               that no doubt questions will be asked—as 
               <br />
               to the course which the Government will 
               <br />
               pursue in consequence of the news that has 
               <br />
               been received irom the Province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, with reference to the result of 
               <br />
               the elections in that province. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The Government are quite prepared to state 
               <br />
               their policy on the question before the 
               <br />
               House, in view of that information. Although 
               <br />
               we have no oﬂicial information as to the 
               <br />
               result of those elections, and would not be 
               <br />
               justiﬁed, constitutionally, in making up our 
               <br />
               minds as to that result, until the Legislature 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick has declared itself either 
               <br />
               for or against the Confederation scheme; 
               <br />
               yet we know, as a matter of fact—and we 
               <br />
               cannot shut our eyes to the fact—that the

               that the question of Confederation is the 
               <br />
               only one discussed at the polls. Being: 
               <br />
               general election, there was the usual ﬁght 
               <br />
               between the ins and the outs, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister-</span> 
               <br />
               ialists and the Opposition; and, of course,: 
               <br />
               lot of other inﬂuences were at work, such as 
               <br />
               questions between the Intercolonial Railway 
               <br />
               on the one hand, and lines of railway to 
               <br />
               connect with the United States on the other. 
               <br />
               Still, we should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> be treating the House 
               <br />
               with candor if we did not state that we must 
               <br />
               consider the result of those electionsass 
               <br />
               check upon the Confederation project. The 
               <br />
               Canadian Government however, I may say 
               <br />
               at once, do not consider that the result of 
               <br />
               these elections should in any way alter their 
               <br />
               policy or their course upon this question. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) They wish it to be most de- 
               <br />
               cidedly understood, that instead of thinking 
               <br />
               ita reason for altering their course, they 
               <br />
               regard it as an additional reason for prompt 
               <br />
               and vigorous action. (Hear, hear.) We 
               <br />
               do not consider that in these events towhich 
               <br />
               I have alluded, there is any cause whatever 
               <br />
               for the abandonment of the project, or for 
               <br />
               its postponement. In fact, the only reason 
               <br />
               why we should consider them to be a matter 
               <br />
               of grave import is, that they form the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               check that the project has received since 
               <br />
               the question was submitted to the people of 
               <br />
               these provinces, at the time of the formation 
               <br />
               of the present Government of Canada. If 
               <br />
               we only look back to June last, and then 
               <br />
               regard the present condition of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion, we cannot but feel surprise at the 
               <br />
               advance which has been made. In June 
               <br />
               last we would have been satisﬁed if we could 
               <br />
               have contemplated that so soon as this the 
               <br />
               question would even have been favorably 
               <br />
               entertained by the governments of the dif- 
               <br />
               ferent provinces. But, within the 'short 
               <br />
               period which has since elapsed, a conference 
               <br />
               has been held, and the measure framed by 
               <br />
               that conference has received the sanction of 
               <br />
               the governments of all the provinces, and
