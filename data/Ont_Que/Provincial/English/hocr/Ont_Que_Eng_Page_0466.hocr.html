               he class that composes the House of Lords 
               <br />
               n England. The British Government is 
               <br />
               indoubtedly the best-balanced government 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nearest</span> approach that we can have to the 
               <br />
               House of Lords is, in my Opinion, an 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elective</span> Legislative Council, the members 
               <br />
               Jf which shall hold oﬂice for an extended 
               <br />
               period. My hon. friend from Lambton, in 
               <br />
               the very excellent speech he made to the 
               <br />
               House yesterday, said that if both Houses 
               <br />
               were made elective their circumstances and 
               <br />
               powers would be so similar that neither 
               <br />
               would be a check upon the other; but I 
               <br />
               contend that if we had an elective 
               <br />
               Upper House, with the members repre- 
               <br />
               senting larger constituencies and elected 
               <br />
               for a longer period than the members of the 
               <br />
               Lower House, it would be less liable to be 
               <br />
               inﬂuenced by every change of public opinion, 
               <br />
               and conservative enough in its character to 
               <br />
               he a wholesome check upon rash and hasty 
               <br />
               legislation. (Hear, hear.) But although 
               <br />
               the scheme now proposed does not make 
               <br />
               these provisions, there are many things in 
               <br />
               it that I can approve of. That the General 
               <br />
               Government should have control over many 
               <br />
               matters committed to it by the scheme is, I 
               <br />
               think, quite right. The customs is a branch 
               <br />
               of the administration that has ramiﬁcations 
               <br />
               throughout the whole country, and it and 
               <br />
               the appointments connected with it should 
               <br />
               bein the hands of the General Government. 
               <br />
               So, too, with regard to the post ofﬁce, which 
               <br />
               aﬁ’ects the whole country, and should be 
               <br />
               under the same control. The militia and all 
               <br />
               matters connected with the defence of the 
               <br />
               country should also be placed under the con- 
               <br />
               trol ot‘ the Central Government; and the 
               <br />
               scheme would be defective if it were other- 
               <br />
               wise: I think there is no question more 
               <br />
               important now tous than that of defence. 
               <br />
               Amilitary spirit seems to have seized the 
               <br />
               people all over the continent, and promises 
               <br />
               tocontrol their action for a long time. I 
               <br />
               think it wise, therefore, that provision should 
               <br />
               be made by which the General Government 
               <br />
               can put the country into a state of prepar- 
               <br />
               ation for whatever may occur. It is well also, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, that the judges should be 
               <br />
               appointed by that government. I like to 
               <br />
               see an independent judiciary, and believe 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ï</span> that this will be secured to us by the mode 
               <br />
               l proposed in these resolutions. (Hear, hear.)

               are so many propositions connected with 
               <br />
               them, and so little is known of what 
               <br />
               their constitution will be, that it is hardly 
               <br />
               possible indeed for me to refer to them. I 
               <br />
               would like to be informed as to their charac— 
               <br />
               ter and authority before speaking of them. 
               <br />
               My opinion is, that they should have certain 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">powers</span> deﬁned in written constitutions, so 
               <br />
               that beyond these powers they would have 
               <br />
               no right to legislate, and if they did, that 
               <br />
               their legislation should be ect aside and 
               <br />
               rendered null and void by the superior 
               <br />
               courts. I believe that the British Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion is of that elastic character that the 
               <br />
               institutions which exist under it can be made 
               <br />
               most popular and still work well. I think 
               <br />
               history has proved this to be the case. 
               <br />
               Under it we have kept sacred the great 
               <br />
               principle of responsible government which 
               <br />
               we now enjoy, and under which ministers 
               <br />
               of the Crown hold seats in and are responsi- 
               <br />
               ble to the Legislature. Well, we want no 
               <br />
               change in that principle; for I think it is 
               <br />
               the greatest safeguard to liberty, not only in 
               <br />
               England, but the world. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               With regard to the executive head of the 
               <br />
               General Government, appointment by the 
               <br />
               Crown as at present is the only mode that is 
               <br />
               desirable. It will not do to tamper with 
               <br />
               or change this provision of our govern- 
               <br />
               ment ; tor if we become detached from and 
               <br />
               cease to be a dependency of the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish Crown, what do we become? We 
               <br />
               must necessarily become independent, and 
               <br />
               when that state of political existence is 
               <br />
               reached, we know not what will follow. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The uestion may be asked, 
               <br />
               is the Constitution oreshadowed in these 
               <br />
               resolutions such as can be accepted by the 
               <br />
               people of this country ? Is there a possibil- 
               <br />
               ity, if it be defective, of bettering or amend- 
               <br />
               ing it? I think that in many of its details 
               <br />
               it has a great deal that is good; and if, in 
               <br />
               portions where it is desirable, it cannot be 
               <br />
               amended, I think, nevertheless, that the 
               <br />
               people of this country would hardly be 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in rejecting it. (Hear,hear.) There 
               <br />
               is no doubt that all history shows that 
               <br />
               nothing in the way of government is ever 
               <br />
               considered a ﬁnality. Changes are conti-
