               (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Hoche- 
               <br />
               laga (Hoa. Mr. DOBION) asserted that we 
               <br />
               had advocated this measure merely as a 
               <br />
               means of remedying the ﬁnancial injustice 
               <br />
               of which we complained. That was not the 
               <br />
               case. It is quite true that we urged very 
               <br />
               strongly—and I am not prepared at this 
               <br />
               moment to withdraw a single statement I 
               <br />
               have made with refereneeto that—we urged 
               <br />
               very strongly the injustice of the position 
               <br />
               in which we were placed, in contributing 
               <br />
               largely to the public revenue, and ﬁnding 
               <br />
               that that revenue was expended without due 
               <br />
               consideration being given to that part of the 
               <br />
               country which contributed most heavily 
               <br />
               towards it. But, at the same time, we felt 
               <br />
               that we were treated unjustly in another 
               <br />
               respect. We felt that it was not fair—that 
               <br />
               it could not be just—that four men in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada should be equal, politically, to ﬁve 
               <br />
               men in Upper Canada. We complained 
               <br />
               that our laws were framed by an eastern 
               <br />
               majority, in spite of our protestations. It 
               <br />
               was this which aggrieved us much more 
               <br />
               deeply than the mere loss of a certain sum 
               <br />
               of money. (Hear, hear.) Up to the 
               <br />
               beginning of 1862 the agitation for a redress 
               <br />
               of this grievance had been carried on 
               <br />
               throughout the whole of Western Canada ; 
               <br />
               and I am convinced that at that time there 
               <br />
               was not an individual who cpuld appear in 
               <br />
               public in Canada West, and take any share 
               <br />
               in the public discussions of -the day, with 
               <br />
               any chance of getting a favorable hearing, 
               <br />
               unless he asserted that he was in favor ot 
               <br />
               representation by population.

               <br />

               <br />
               his own Administration. The hon. member 
               <br />

               <br />
               the pe0ple of Canada West conducted their 
               <br />
               agitation with a good deal of system and 
               <br />
               order, there was nothing very alarming or 
               <br />
               dangerous about it. But the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               should have remembered that itis a character- 
               <br />
               istic of the British people, that they on all 
               <br />
               occasions conduct a political agitation with 
               <br />
               due decorum and due respect to the laws, 
               <br />
               and that it is not the less serious on that 
               <br />
               account. When they have a deep-seated 
               <br />
               feeling that injustice is being perpetrated 
               <br />
               upon them, they will not sit still under it, 
               <br />
               although they will at the same time, while 
               <br />
               conducting the agitation against it, respect 
               <br />
               the rights of other parties. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I am free to confess that, when I ﬁrst came 
               <br />
               into this House, I labored under some slight 
               <br />
               misapprehension of the position which the 
               <br />
               Lower Canadians occupied towards us of 
               <br />
               Western Canada. There is, or there was 
               <br />
               then, a popular opinion that the Lower Ca- 
               <br />
               nadians were only afra'd of representation by 
               <br />
               pOpulation, because they dreaded that the 
               <br />
               people of Canada West would use the larger 
               <br />
               power they would thereby obtain for the inju- 
               <br />
               ry, if not the destruction, of their religious 
               <br />
               institutions. That is entirely an error. I am 
               <br />
               convinced that the people of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               have no such Opinion and no such fear. In 
               <br />
               speaking the other day on that subject, the 
               <br />
               honorable member fer-Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Demon) quoted from a speech of mine deliv- 
               <br />
               ered in Toronto a few days before this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">session</span> 
               <br />
               commenced; and I do not think the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman shewed his usual candor or fair- 
               <br />
               ness in making the representation he did. 
               <br />
               He represented me as having stated at that 
               <br />
               meeting, that I had abandoned representa- 
               <br />
               tion by population, as a thing that was not 
               <br />
               advisable, or possible, or something of that
