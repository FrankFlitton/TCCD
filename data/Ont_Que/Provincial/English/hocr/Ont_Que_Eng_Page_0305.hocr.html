               Conservatives, and as I believe, entertaining

               whole face of the Government. And the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               thing this unholy alliance does is to go to work

               at the suggestion of the chief with the still, 
               <br />
               small voice to upset our Constitution. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) When a great constitutional question 
               <br />
               comes before this House, designed as it is to 
               <br />
               sweep an entire constitution from our Statute 
               <br />
               Book, and replace it with another, I think you 
               <br />
               will agree with me, honorable gentlemen, that 
               <br />
               this is one of the most important measures 
               <br />
               that could come from any government on the 
               <br />
               face of the earth. (Hear, hear.) Well, 1 
               <br />
               would ask those people who are so anxious to 
               <br />
               see responsible government carried out in 
               <br />
               this country in its integrity, is this a govern- 
               <br />
               ment that you can recognize as representing 
               <br />
               the well-understood wishes of the people ? A 
               <br />
               government claiming to be a responsible 
               <br />
               government ought to have for its basis re- 
               <br />
               turns made from the polls, and ought not to 
               <br />
               have its origin through the instrumentalit 
               <br />
               of ministerial convenience. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               would like to ask if, at the last general elec- 
               <br />
               tion, this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subset</span> was mooted to the people in 
               <br />
               any section 0 the province ?—whether it was 
               <br />
               a subject to which the slightest reference was 
               <br />
               ever made by the votes of the people when they 
               <br />
               returned their representatives? I do not 
               <br />
               think that it could have been, because it is 
               <br />
               a measure that has emanated from the particu- 
               <br />
               lar individual to whom I have referred, since 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TAOHE-MAODONALD</span> Government got into 
               <br />
               that unfortunate political dilemma. The 
               <br />
               people were not aware at the last general 
               <br />
               election that an such measure as this was to 
               <br />
               come before t e Legislature. Honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, I would not stand up here and 
               <br />
               speak in this manner if the subject brought 
               <br />
               under our consideration was any ordinary 
               <br />

               <br />
               disposing of the amendment now before us. 
               <br />
               Why, honorable gentlemen, there is nothing 
               <br />
               of the kind in the amendment. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me</span> 
               <br />

               should delay the measure until after the next

               proper for me to refer to in a more pointed

               manner. I do not argue for a week or a 
               <br />
               month’s delay. I think there ought to be a 
               <br />
               much longer time allowed. I think the tree- 
               <br />

               If we cannot have the usual constitutional

               mode of arriving at the true views, opinions, 
               <br />
               and impressions of the people in relation to

               the scheme, I do not want any delay at all. 
               <br />
               I do not want the opinion of the people taken, 
               <br />
               unless it can be done in such a manner as will 
               <br />
