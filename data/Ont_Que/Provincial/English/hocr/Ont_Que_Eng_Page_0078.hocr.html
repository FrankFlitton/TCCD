               understood their position too well. If they had

               <br />

               <br />
               would say this, to their honor and credit, that, 
               <br />
               if to-day Canada was a portion of the British 
               <br />
               Empire, it was due to the conservatism of the

               <br />
               to cast their lot with the democratic element— 
               <br />
               they knew the hollowness of democracy. (Hear,

               of America was broken up and divided against 
               <br />

               difference to be observed in considering the 
               <br />

               Federation for the purpose of carrying out and 
               <br />
               perpetuating democracy on this continent; 
               <br />
               but we, who had the beneﬁt of being able to

               gent American statesmen and writers must 
               <br />

               governmental powers had become too extend-

               planted legitimate authority; and we now saw
