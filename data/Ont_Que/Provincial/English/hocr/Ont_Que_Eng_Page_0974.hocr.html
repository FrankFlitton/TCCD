               has had some experience in that way of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               claim them as such. and tenaciously cling 
               <br />
               to them. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I 
               <br />
               have not time to go into this subject at this 
               <br />
               point, and show how objectionable are many 
               <br />
               of the details; but I maintain the position 
               <br />
               that it is most absurd and illogical to ask us 
               <br />
               to accept the scheme as a whole, and leave 
               <br />
               such objectionable details to be regulated 
               <br />
               hereafter. When the union of these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces took place in 1841, the discussion in 
               <br />
               relation to it in the British Houses of Par- 
               <br />
               liament showed that the framers of the 
               <br />
               Union Act expected that any diﬁculties that 
               <br />
               might grow out of it would be easily regu- 
               <br />
               lated by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> united Parliament of Canada— 
               <br />
               that such questions as representation by 
               <br />
               population could be dealt with at any time. 
               <br />
               But what happened? Why ! Lower Canada 
               <br />
               treated equal representation as a vested right, 
               <br />
               and stood ﬁrmly on that right. This being the 
               <br />
               case, there was no process provided by which 
               <br />
               the evil could be regulated. The result was 
               <br />
               that a great struggle came on, the diﬂiculties 
               <br />
               arising out of which, honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite tell us. have proved our Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion to be a failure. From this experience 
               <br />
               of the past, we ought to learn that it is very 
               <br />
               bad policy- to deliberately put errors in our 
               <br />
               Constitution and trust to the future to remedy 
               <br />
               them. If you speak of a union of all Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North America, nobody objects. Every- 
               <br />
               body is in favor of a union, provided the 
               <br />
               details are satisfactory ; but providing imper- 
               <br />
               fect details and trusting to the future for 
               <br />
               rendering them what they ought to have 
               <br />
               been made at the outset, reminds me of an 
               <br />
               incident a friend related the other day. 
               <br />
               A carter was about to take a friend of mine 
               <br />
               with his baggage to the railway station, when 
               <br />
               my friend observed that one of the tugs was 
               <br />
               nothing but a piece of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ro;</span> e. Says my friend, 
               <br />
               “ You are not going to take me through these 
               <br />
               twenty miles of woods with that string, are 
               <br />
               you?” “Oh! never mind,” says he, “I have 
               <br />
               more strings in my pocket with which I can 
               <br />
               regulate that on the road.” So hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the Treasury benches ask us to follow 
               <br />
               them in their rickety concern, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assuring</span> us 
               <br />
               that they have a pocketful oi strings with 
               <br />
               which they can regulate things on the way. 
               <br />
               ( Laughter.) But, sir, they will ﬁnd no little 
               <br />
               diﬁculty in bringing their poeketful of 
               <br />
               strings into operation. They will ﬁnd almost 
               <br />
               insurmountable diﬁiculties in the way of re- 
               <br />

               carried into effect. First of all, so sweeping 
               <br />
               a measure as this—one for sweeping away 
               <br />
               our entire Constitution and substituting a 
               <br />

               not to be carried out until it is submitted to

               the people; and, secondly, the multitude of 
               <br />
               details which it embraces ought to be calmly 
               <br />
               and critically considered, with a view to

               <br />
               I do not say that this is the feeling of the

               Conservative party of mv own constitu- 
               <br />
               ency, or of the Eastern Townships; but 
               <br />
               I do say that even among that party 
               <br />
               there are grave apprehensions of diﬁ- 
               <br />

               is to be allowed even for their consideration, 
               <br />
               to say nothing of their amendment. And 
               <br />
               many of that party have no hesitation in 
               <br />
               giving expression to those feelings. I have 
               <br />
               not met with a man, conservative or re-

               of the House, who has not been ready to 
               <br />
