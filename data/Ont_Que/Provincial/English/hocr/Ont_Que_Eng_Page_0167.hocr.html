               <br />
               therefore, bound to establish this necessity. 
               <br />
               The country will see too, that they have 
               <br />
               failed to explain, to vindicate and to justify 
               <br />
               the disregard of parliamentary law and of 
               <br />
               parliamentary usage by which they are at-

               sent, not merely to the principle of union— 
               <br />
               which would be perfectly proper—but to all 
               <br />
               the clumsy contrivances adopted by that self- 
               <br />
               constituted junta which sat in Quebec a few 
               <br />
               weeks since, for giving eﬁ'ect to that union, 
               <br />
               and to all those huxtering arrangements by 
               <br />
               which the representatives of the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces were induced to give in their ad-

               <br />
               ion of their provinces to this scheme. I say, 
               <br />
               they quite failed to explain this and to vindi- 
               <br />
               cate it. The country too will see that these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen have carefully refrained from 
               <br />
               entering into any explanation of the con- 
               <br />
               comitants of this scheme—of the proposed 
               <br />
               constitutions of the local governments for 
               <br />
               instance, which are, at least, as important 
               <br />
               as the Constitution of the Federal Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. It is quite manifest that a union, 
               <br />
               even if encrally desirable, might become 
               <br />
               undesirab e from the bad, or inconvenient, 
               <br />
               or ex ensive arrangements incident to the 
               <br />
               ' adoption of that union. And that really ex- 
               <br />
               lains the position of many hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               in this House. who, like myself, are not op- 
               <br />
               posed to the Federal principle, but who ﬁnd 
               <br />
               themselves obliged to go counter apparently 
               <br />
               to their own convictions, because they can- 
               <br />
               not accept a union clogged with such condi- 
               <br />
               tions as this union is. (Hear, hear.) Then 
               <br />
               it might have been expected that some fur- 
               <br />
               ther, some more distinct, information might 
               <br />
               have been given than has been given, on the 
               <br />
               all-important question of education, in res- 
               <br />
               pect of which, we have been given to under-

               <br />
               of the proposed federation of the provinces. 
               <br />
               We might also have expected that some in-

               formation would have been vouchsafed to us 
               <br />

               what sort of utterances have we had on that

               Council that the subject was engaging the 
               <br />
               attention of the Imperial Government, and 
               <br />
               he vindicated union, because defence can be 
               <br />
               better given by united, than by separate 
               <br />
               colonies. And what have we been told to- 
               <br />
               night by the Minister of Agriculture? That 
               <br />
               despatches are received by every second mail 
               <br />
               from England telling us that we are entering 
               <br />
               on a new era with reference to the question 
               <br />
               of defence. What does all this mean ? It 
               <br />
               means that, in connection with this union, 
               <br />
               we are to have entailed upon us untold ex- 
               <br />
               penditures for the defence of the country. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Ought they not to place this 
               <br />
               information, these despatches, before the

               irrevocable action is taken with regard to 
               <br />
               the scheme? These are a few, and but a

               few, of the leading topics which constitute

               <br />

               <br />
               the fullest possible information, but in res-
