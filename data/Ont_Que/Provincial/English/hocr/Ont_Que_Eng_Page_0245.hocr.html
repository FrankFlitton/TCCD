               endeavor to ﬁnd common ground of agree- 
               <br />
               ment. It is important that no party, or at 
               <br />
               least no sectional interest among political 
               <br />
               parties, should betray itself in the discussion 
               <br />
               of so important a subject. I shall now en- 
               <br />
               deavor to take a brief view of the scheme, 
               <br />
               as it is presented, and endeavor to give an 
               <br />
               exposition of the views which I entertain 
               <br />
               with regard to this matter. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It a pears to me, in the ﬁrst place, that the 
               <br />
               origin of this scheme was not what it ought 
               <br />
               to have been. It did not emanate from the 
               <br />
               people, but from the fact that certain politi- 
               <br />
               cal diﬂiculties existed in Canada, in conse- 
               <br />
               uepce of the political parties being so equally 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               'vided that it was found impracticable toget 
               <br />
               on with the government of this province. 
               <br />
               The scheme emanated from the Government 
               <br />
               of this country in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eonseguence</span> of those politi- 
               <br />
               cal diﬁiculties, and ha not its origin with 
               <br />
               any movement among the masses of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple. It is very well known that at the last 
               <br />
               general election, in 1863, this was not among 
               <br />
               the questions that were brought before the 
               <br />
               country It was not one of those questions 
               <br />
               that the people were called upon to decide in 
               <br />
               returning members to represent them in the 
               <br />
               Legislature. It is very true that the scheme 
               <br />
               of a Federal union of all the provinces has 
               <br />
               been spoken of for a quarter of a century by 
               <br />
               eminent men of all shades of politics. We 
               <br />
               may refer to the convention that was held at 
               <br />
               Kingston, at which the British American 
               <br />
               League was formed. That convention was 
               <br />
               convened b the Conservative party of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gubsequently,</span> the great meeting— 
               <br />
               if I may use that expression—that was con- 
               <br />
               vened in the city of Toronto, referred to the 
               <br />
               same question. But I go back and appeal to 
               <br />
               the fact that at the last general election, it 
               <br />
               was not one of those questions that were re- 
               <br />
               ferred to the arbitrament of the people to 
               <br />
               decide by their votes as to the desirability of 
               <br />
               union. I think ever honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               will agree with me t at this was the fact. 
               <br />
               Now, honorable gentlemen, I desire to speak 
               <br />
               in a temperate tone and manner in regard to 
               <br />
               this scheme. I believe the gentlemen that 
               <br />
               now constitute the Government of Canada, as

               its origin, at least was by them put before the

               therefore observe that this is a measure

               emanatin from the minds of the foremost 
               <br />

               <br />
               men on the continent of America. Still, it is 
               <br />
               not a measure that has emanated from the 
               <br />
               people, and I would ask you all, honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, in reference to the change of 
               <br />
               a country’s Constitution, if history does not 
               <br />
               bear me out in asserting that all such changes 
               <br />
               are preceded by a rising of the people in favor 
               <br />
               of the change. The people, feeling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oppmd</span> 
               <br />
               by the existing state of things, rise in their 
               <br />
               majesty and put an end to its continuance, 
               <br />
               and demand a new Constitution. But in re- 
               <br />
               gard to a change <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effected</span> in the manner in 
               <br />
               which this is proposed, by the united 
               <br />
               wisdom of the several governments, without 
               <br />
               any convulsion, I hold that under those cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances the people of the whole country to 
               <br />

               <br />
               .opportunity of considering the great change. 
               <br />
               It is not suﬂicient in my mind that a few of 
               <br />
               the leading spirits of the land should be able 
               <br />
               to control and bring about so great a change 
               <br />
               without the initiatory ste being taken on 
               <br />
               the part of the people. ow, honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, I would refer to the representation in 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst conference—the conference in which 
               <br />
               the initiatory steps were taken—at Charlotte- 
               <br />
               town. All honorable gentlemen are aware 
               <br />
               that the governments of the several Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces had decreed by resolutions passed 
               <br />
               during former sessions of their several par— 
               <br />
               liaments, that they were to send delegates to 
               <br />
               meet at Charlottetown, for the purpose of 
               <br />
               uniting their several governments under one 
               <br />
               government; in other words, to consolidate 
               <br />
               their governments into what would be termed 
               <br />
               a legislative union. We could all understand 
               <br />
               from the position of those several local gov- 
               <br />
               ernments that it was a matter of very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> 
               <br />
               importance that they should unite their gov 
               <br />
               ernments under one to obviate the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessity</span> 
               <br />
               of having diﬁ'erent'rates of duty; and in fac 
               <br />
               their interests were so blended that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> 
               <br />
               understand that union was of very great im
