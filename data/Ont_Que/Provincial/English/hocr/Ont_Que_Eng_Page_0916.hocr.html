               please the English people if you choose; I

               am of opinion our best <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defence</span> is to culti-

               mer 'al and political relations, and then, sir, 
               <br />
               I do ot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fear</span> that if we do what is right, 
               <br />
               they will do us any wrong. Sound and 
               <br />
               honorable conduct on our part is of more 
               <br />
               strength than all the forts of masonry or 
               <br />
               earthwork that we shall ever see. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> the prompt and 
               <br />
               manly course that our Government has pur- 
               <br />
               sued with regard 'to the Alien Bill, and call- 
               <br />
               ing out a portion of our volunteers to repress 
               <br />
               raiding and piracy, will entitle them to the 
               <br />
               gratitude of every right-minded man in this 
               <br />
               country. Sir, had they commenced to build 
               <br />
               forts and arm ships, instead of the manly 
               <br />
               and honorable course which they did pursue, 
               <br />
               they would, in my Opinion, have found use 
               <br />
               for their volunteers and their forts too; 
               <br />
               while I hepe that in a very short time they 
               <br />
               will not require either. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               wish now to say a few words about this great 
               <br />
               Confederation, from which so much is ex- 
               <br />
               pected, commercially and politically. I am 
               <br />
               of opinion that the advantages will be very 
               <br />
               evenly divided—they taking our grain and 
               <br />
               ﬂour, while we buy their ﬁsh and oil. We will 
               <br />
               have an open market for our manufactures 
               <br />
               with them, and they will have the same 
               <br />
               for theirs with us, so that it is a mere mat- 
               <br />
               ter of who gives most. But at present the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces import from the United 
               <br />
               States ﬂour and grain, if I am correct, to 
               <br />
               the amount of three or four millions of dol- 
               <br />
               lars’ worth per annum, which our political 
               <br />
               and more intimate relations would in a more 
               <br />
               or less degree attract to Canada; and I have 
               <br />
               no doubt our merchants would know how to 
               <br />
               turn those advantages to account. Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">82mm,</span> these are some of the reasons

               motion of the best interests of this our

               scheme as proposed is, as near as it can be, 
               <br />
               fair to all the provinces Before I close, I 
               <br />
               would just say a word with rcferen ce to the 
               <br />
               course pursued by my respected and honora- 
               <br />
               ble colleague from Toronto West (Mr. J. 
               <br />
               MACDONALD). I have no hesitation in saying 
               <br />
               that I am conﬁdent that he is sincere in his 
               <br />
               opposition, and he may be right; but I am 
               <br />
               not so sure that he represents the wishes of 
               <br />
               his constituents. I attended a large and inﬂu- 
               <br />
               ential meeting of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> citizens of the city of

               Toronto before the meeting of this House, 
               <br />
               and a gentleman there proposed that the 
               <br />
               scheme should not be carried into effect 
               <br />
               until it was referred to the peeple, but he 
               <br />
               could not get even a seconder to his resolu- 
               <br />
               tion. For myself, I feel justiﬁed by the 
               <br />
               result of that meeting in supporting this 
               <br />
               scheme throughout. The meeting was ex- 
               <br />
               tensively advertised—all had an opportunity 
               <br />
               to attend, and both sides of the question were 
               <br />
               ably argued. I shall record my vote for 
               <br />
               the scheme, and shall he py to see it

               MB. SHAN LY said—In rising to address 
               <br />
               the House on the great question under 
               <br />
               debate, it is not my intention to go minutely 
               <br />
               into the subject; for after all that has been 
               <br />
               said, and the great length to which the 
               <br />
               debate has dragged on, I cannot expect to be 
               <br />
               able to ﬁx the attention of my hearers for 
               <br />
               very long, even were the subject one to 
               <br />
               which I could speak authoritatively, instead 
               <br />
               of being, as it is, one that the ablest and 
               <br />
               most statesmanlike among us must in a great 
               <br />
               measure accept upon faith—trusting to the 
               <br />
               future to develope the excellencies claimed 
               <br />
               for it on the one hand, or to establish the 
               <br />
               faults that are charged on it on the other. 
               <br />
               But though I do not pretend to be able to 
               <br />
               say anything new on the subject, or to throw 
               <br />
               any light on the uncertain future that lies 
               <br />
               before us, still I would be unwilling that in, 
               <br />
               perhaps, the most important division ever 
               <br />
               taken in a Colonial Legislature, my vote

               some, at all events, of the reasons that 
               <br />
               actuate me in voting as I intend to vote. 
               <br />
               One feature has been strikingly observable 
               <br />
               in the debate, and that is, that from ﬁrst to
