               <br />
               better protected under the propos system, 
               <br />
               and that ain is one of the strongest reasons 
               <br />
               in favor o Confederation. N ct only indeed 
               <br />
               did we assure ourselves of that protection, 
               <br />
               but the provinces who were parties to the 
               <br />
               Confederation desired it also. All local 
               <br />
               interests will be submitted and left to the de- 
               <br />
               cision of the local legislatures. There will 
               <br />
               be other exceptions with respect to Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, and, in fact, all the exceptions in 
               <br />
               the scheme of Confederation are in favor of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. These restrictions in favor 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada were obtained by the 
               <br />
               delegates from that province ; but they seek 
               <br />
               no thanks for their conduct, as they con- 
               <br />
               sider that in so doin they only performed 
               <br />
               a duty—a duty incum ent on all true patriots 
               <br />
               and good citizens. All that they now come 
               <br />
               to this House and ask for, is its sanction 
               <br />
               to the measure which ensures these privi- 
               <br />
               leges to the populations which they repre- 
               <br />
               sent. I may add that, under Confederation, 
               <br />
               all questions relating to the colon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lation</span> of our 
               <br />
               wild lands, and the disposition and sale of 
               <br />
               those same lands, our civil laws and all 
               <br />
               measures of a local nature—in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact</span> every- 
               <br />
               thing which concerns and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affects</span> those in- 
               <br />
               terests which are most dear to us as a 
               <br />
               people, will be reserved for the action of 
               <br />
               our local legislature; all our charitable and 
               <br />
               other institutions will be protected by the 
               <br />
               same authority. There is also the question 
               <br />
               of education. Upon this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> as upon all 
               <br />
               others, the Lower Canadian delegates have 
               <br />
               seen tethe preservation of certain privileges, 
               <br />
               and that question has been left to our Local 
               <br />
               Legislature, so that the Federal Legislature 
               <br />
               shall not be able to interfere with it. It has 
               <br />
               been said that with respect to agriculture the 
               <br />
               power of legislation would be exercised con- 
               <br />
               currently by the Federal Legislature and the 
               <br />
               local legislatures. But the House is perfectly 
               <br />
               well aware for what reason that concurrent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pour</span> was allowed. Every one, indeed, is 
               <br />
               aware that certain general interests may arise 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mpoeting</span> which the intervention of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Central</span> Legislature may be neceœary; but, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lit-_</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Smut,</span> all interests relating to local

               <br />

               <br />
               the subjectof the details of the measure, and 
               <br />
               I shall reply to the observation of the honor- 
               <br />
               able member for llochelaga on that subject. 
               <br />
               That honorable gentleman objects to the 
               <br />
               appointment of the legislative councillors 
               <br />
               by the Central Government, and adds that 
               <br />
               those councillors will be appointed by a Tory 
               <br />
               government, and will necessarily be selected 
               <br />
               from among the tories. In making that 
               <br />
               assertion the honorable member did not act 
               <br />
               with that frankness which we are entitled to 
               <br />
               expect from him. (Hear, hear.) He hardly 
               <br />
               alluded, if he did so at all, to the clause 
               <br />
               in the resolutions bv which the op osition, 
               <br />

               <br />
               are protected In that clause it is provided 
               <br />
               that the Central Parliament, in making 
               <br />
               the appointments in question, shall be 
               <br />
               careful to watch over the interests of the Cp- 
               <br />
               position, as well as over those of the Ministerial 
               <br />
               party. Now, Mr. SPEAKER, when agcvern- 
               <br />
               ment binds itself in this way, is it reasonable 
               <br />
               and fair to believe or to suppose that it will 
               <br />
               break its word which has been so solemnly 
               <br />
               pledged ? For my part, I am convinced that 
               <br />
               the members of the present Government, 
               <br />
               should they form part of the Central Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, would fulﬁl what has been promised, 
               <br />
               and would watch over the rights of the 0 
               <br />
               sition as over those of the other party. he 
               <br />
               honorable member for Hochelaga also re- 
               <br />
               tended that the Maritime Provinces ad 
               <br />
               forced upon us the clause which provides 
               <br />
               that the legislative councillors in the Gen- 
               <br />
               eral Parliament shall be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pointed</span> by the 
               <br />
               Crown. Yet, the honorabc member right 
               <br />
               well knows that the elective principle in 
               <br />
               our existing Legislative Council was mere- 
               <br />
               ly an experiment, and that in Lower Ca- 
               <br />
               nada we have become tired of the system, 
               <br />
               not because the councillors who have been 
               <br />
               elected by the people are unworthy of the 
               <br />
               position which they occupy, or because their 
               <br />
               selection was an unfortunate selection, but 
               <br />
               because the very nature of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> prevents 
               <br />
               a large number of men of talent, of men 
               <br />
               ualiﬁed in eve respect and worthy to sit in
