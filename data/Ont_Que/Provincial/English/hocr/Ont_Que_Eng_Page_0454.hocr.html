               they had no authority for their action in the

               these resolutions; but they met in accordance 
               <br />
               with a pledge given by this Government, and 
               <br />
               must be held tohave been called together with 
               <br />
               the sanction of the Parliament of Canada, 
               <br />
               because Parliament gave the Government,

               formed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ’ect</span> the Federation, its conﬁ-

               dence. They met also with the sanction of 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government, as now appears 
               <br />
               from statements and despatches in possession 
               <br />
               of this House. (Hear, hear.) But coming 
               <br />
               now to the present aspect of the matter, I feel 
               <br />
               that this country has reason to be satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with a scheme of so practical a nature as that 
               <br />
               new under the consideration of the House. 
               <br />
               I believe that the plan of union proposed will 
               <br />
               be found to meet the exigencies of our local 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pnâdon,</span> give latitude to local development, 
               <br />
               and due protection to local interests, and yet 
               <br />
               secure that general control which is essentially 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span> for the proper vernment of a 
               <br />
               country placed under the ominion of the 
               <br />
               British Crown. (Hear, hear.) And while I 
               <br />
               than look upon the plan, I desire to state em- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">°cdly</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clearly</span> that it is no new prin- 
               <br />
               ciple that the people of this country and the 
               <br />
               members of this House are asked to give their 
               <br />
               sanction to. The question of colonial union, 
               <br />
               in one shape or another, is one that has en- 
               <br />
               gaged the attention of high intellects and able 
               <br />
               statesmen in England; and I think I will be 
               <br />
               able to show to the House that the very prin- 
               <br />
               ciple we are now endeavoring to introduce as 
               <br />
               a principle of government in these British 
               <br />
               North American Provinces, is one that has 
               <br />
               received the sanction of eminent men in 
               <br />
               England, and more than that, the sanction of 
               <br />
               a solemn act of the Imperial Parliament.

               (Hear, hear.) I will go back a few ears, 
               <br />
               when the condition of the Australian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonies</span> 
               <br />
               rendered it necessary for the statesmen of 
               <br />
               Great Britain to endeavor to ﬁnd a practical 
               <br />
               solution of the diﬁiculty of governing those 
               <br />
               great and growing dependencies of the British 
               <br />
               Crown. What was the practical mode adopted 
               <br />
               when events made it necessary that they 
               <br />
               should form a new Constitution for the 
               <br />
               more perfect government of those colonies? 
               <br />
               Why, the Imperial Government revived an 
               <br />
               old committee of the Privy Council, called 
               <br />
               the “Committee on Trade and Foreign Plan- 
               <br />
               tations,” and referred the question to it, call- 
               <br />
               ing in to its aid, as new members of the com- 
               <br />
               mittee, Lord CAMPBELL, then Chancellor of 
               <br />
               the Duch of Lancaster, Sir JAMES STEPHEN 
               <br />
               and Sir DWARD RYAN. The result of the 
               <br />
               deliberations of that committee was a report 
               <br />
               in which the eminent men who composed it 
               <br />
               recommended the formation of a general as- 
               <br />
               sembly, to which the control of the general 
               <br />
               affairs of the Australian colonies should be 
               <br />
               entrusted, with local governments having local 
               <br />
               jurisdiction and certain deﬁned powers grant- 
               <br />
               ed to them. I hold in my hands a series of 
               <br />
               letters on the colonial policy of England, ad- 
               <br />
               dressed by Earl GREY to Lord JOHN RUS-

               <br />
               mittee of the Privy Council that I have re- 
               <br />
               ferred to, and I ﬁnd that the plan there sug- 
               <br />
               gested is analogous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the one we are now 
               <br />
               asked to give practical effect to in this coun- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try:</span> (Hear, hear.) The proposition of the 
               <br />
               committee was that there should be a Gover- 
               <br />
               nor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gen'hral</span> to administer the affairs of the 
               <br />
               Australian colonies, and that he should con- 
               <br />
               vene a body, to be called the General Assem- 
               <br />
               bly of Australia, on receiving a request to 
               <br />
               that cﬂ'ect from two or more of the Australian 
               <br />
               legislatures; and it was recommended that 
               <br />
               this General Assembly, so convened, should 
               <br />
               have the power to make laws respecting the 
               <br />
               imposition of duties on imports and exports, 
               <br />
               the post ofﬁce, the formation of roads, canals 
               <br />
               and railways, and a variety of other subjects. 
               <br />
               The advantages of this plan were so manifest, 
               <br />
               as uniting those colonies together and secur- 
               <br />
               ing for them a better and more satisfactory 
               <br />
               form of government than they had before en- 
               <br />
               joyed, that the report was at once adeptcd by 
               <br />
               the Privy Council, embodied in a bill and 
               <br />
               submitted to Parliament. The bill passed 
               <br />
               the House of Commons and reached the 
               <br />
               House of Lords; but while before that body
