               I have alluded, sir, to the wishes of the

               Mother Country relative to the movement

               that the feeling there is one of universal 
               <br />
               approbation. Still, so much has been said 
               <br />
               relative to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinidns</span> existing in the

               it right to remark on this branch of the sub-

               ject rather more full than I should other-

               <br />
               tance ot it. I know of nothing that would 
               <br />
               so much tend to discourage the people of 
               <br />
               this country as that an impression should go 
               <br />
               abroad that the Mother Country was intend- 
               <br />
               ing to cast us adrift—to sever the connection. 
               <br />
               I have no doubt myself sir, that did such an 
               <br />
               opinion really exist in the Mother Country, 
               <br />
               and were it to be carried into effect at the 
               <br />
               present time, or within any short period of 
               <br />
               time, the only alternative—I fear, the only 
               <br />
               alternative—would be our annexation to the 
               <br />
               United States. (Hear, hear.) Therefore, 
               <br />
               Ifecl it to be of great importance that no 
               <br />
               doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> exist in the minds of the people

               <br />
               tained towards us at home. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               the member for Brome dwelt at considerable 
               <br />
               length on the subject. He expressed, and I 
               <br />
               am quite sure he entertains the strongest 
               <br />
               desire for the perpetuation of this connec- 
               <br />
               tion; yet it did seem to me that he dwelt 
               <br />
               with peculiar satisfaction upon every word 
               <br />
               he could extract from speeches and pam- 
               <br />
               phlets, which appeared to him to point to a 
               <br />
               desire to sever that connection, and I cannot 
               <br />
               butremember that he was frequently cheered 
               <br />
               with “ Hear, hears ’-’ corresponding with the 
               <br />
               sentiments he expressed. The remarks made 
               <br />
               by the hon. member from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bronte</span> were, to my 
               <br />
               mind, most extraordinary. The deductions

               men and gentlemen in the Imperial Parlia-

               appeared to me the design and tendency of 
               <br />
               those speeches, that I cannot account for it 
               <br />
               in any other way, than by presuming that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend was not in his usual health, 
               <br />
               and that his mind did not possess that degree 
               <br />
               of clearness which he generally brings to 
               <br />
               hear on every subject he investigates. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It seemed to me that 
               <br />
               he looked at everything relating to 
               <br />
               this question through a distorted medium. 
               <br />
               I listened with the greatest pleasure to the 
               <br />
               dissection the hon. gentleman made of these 
               <br />
               resolutions, and to the microscopic analysis 
               <br />
               to which he subjected the smallest part of 
               <br />
               their provisions. It showed the great acute- 
               <br />
               ness of his observation, as well as the large 
               <br />
               and extended information of his mind. But 
               <br />
               I could not help feeling that he was looking 
               <br />
               at this subject through the diseoloured lens 
               <br />
               of a powerfully microscOpic mind. (Laugh- 
               <br />
               ter.) I have no doubt whatever that this 
               <br />
               also was the impression made by his speech 
               <br />
               on other hon. gentlemen. His talents 
               <br />
               and his ability I fully recognize, and 
               <br />
               I have no doubt that every hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               listened, equally with myself, with pleasure 
               <br />
               to what I may call the excruciating dissec- 
               <br />
               tion to which he submitted these important 
               <br />
               resolutions. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
               <br />
               But I must at the same time say that the 
               <br />
               result of all his analysis, and the summing 
               <br />
               up of all his observations, only proved to me 
               <br />
               that the ground on which the advocates of 
               <br />
               this scheme stand is well nigh immovable 
               <br />
               and unassailable, and convinced me of the 
               <br />
               smallness of the objections which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hav’e</span> yet 
               <br />
               been urged against it. Of course my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Brome, considering the tempera- 
               <br />
               ment of his mind, dwelt at length and with 
               <br />
               much force upon the article which lately 
               <br />
               appeared in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Edinburgh</span> Review. I must 
               <br />
               acknowledge that in that article there are 
               <br />
               passages of extreme oﬁ‘ensiveness, such as I 
               <br />
               regret to see in any British publication, and 
               <br />
               which were uncalled for and imprudent. 
               <br />
               If I thought that the article reﬂected 
               <br />
               the views of either of the parties now divid- 
               <br />
               ing the political world in Great Britain, I 
               <br />
               should indeed say that our connection with 
               <br />
               the Mother Country was precarious, and that 
               <br />
               it behoved us to ask with pertinacity what 
               <br />
               really was the intention of the statesmen 
               <br />
               and the people at home with regard to us. 
               <br />
               But, sir, we have happily the most conclu-
