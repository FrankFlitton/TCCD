               speak brieﬂy upon the question rather than 
               <br />
               indulge in long set speeches, I determined to 
               <br />
               give an example in this respect and bring my 
               <br />
               remarks within reasonable bounds. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I believe then, sir, in the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               that Confederation is desirable ; in the second, 
               <br />
               that it is attainable; and, in the third place, 
               <br />
               that it is the best thing we can get, and this 
               <br />
               last is perhaps the strongest reason of all for 
               <br />
               accepting it. It is quite clear that we must 
               <br />
               have a settlement of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> in some 
               <br />
               way, and I think the scheme proposed is a 
               <br />
               very favorable settlement of them. I think 
               <br />
               it is more than perhaps some of us expected 
               <br />
               at the time when the present Government was 
               <br />
               formed to bring about a settlement; and I do 
               <br />
               think, sir, that it would be the greatest act 
               <br />
               of madness that western members of this 
               <br />
               House could rpetrate to vote against it. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iieam</span> not, however, afraid that 
               <br />
               it will be voted against by them. I believe 
               <br />
               that under it we have obtained representation 
               <br />
               by pOpulation, that we have obtained what we 
               <br />
               have long contended was justly due to us, that 
               <br />
               we have obtained our legitimate inﬂuence in 
               <br />
               framing the ﬁnancial policy of the country, 
               <br />
               and that beyond this we have obtained the 
               <br />
               prospect of building <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up</span> a great British Union 
               <br />
               on this continent. e should, therefore, I 
               <br />
               think, in view of these great advantages, over- 
               <br />
               look those objections which may be regarded 
               <br />
               as antecedent to the scheme, and endeavor 
               <br />
               heartily to carry out the work successfully. I 
               <br />
               shall willingly yield my support to the scheme, 
               <br />
               and I believe it will be acceptable to the people 
               <br />
               I represent—not only to the people of the
