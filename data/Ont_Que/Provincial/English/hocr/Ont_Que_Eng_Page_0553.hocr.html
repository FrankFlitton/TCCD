               Federation as a measure tending to constitute a 
               <br />
               power strong enough, with the aid of this country, 
               <br />
               which I trust may never be withdrawn from those 
               <br />
               provinces, to acquire an importance which, 
               <br />
               separately, they eou’d not obtain. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               If I saw in this Federation a desire to separate 
               <br />
               from this country, I should think it a matter of 
               <br />
               much more doubtful policy and advantage; but 
               <br />

               at present, resolutions not yet submitted to the

               on the part of the provinces to maintain for 
               <br />
               themselves the blessing of the connection with 
               <br />
               this country, and a determined and deliberate
