               here is what was said by a gentleman who,

               The continuation of the Reciprocity treaty with 
               <br />
               the United States is favorable, not only to the 
               <br />

               the Canadians are in a position to be greatly 
               <br />
               beneﬁted, in an industrial and commercial sense, 
               <br />
               by the annexation of Canada to the United States,

               “ Those who speak the truth to the people in 
               <br />
               times of crises like the present, are really the 
               <br />
               most loyal men,” adds Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN ; 
               <br />
               and he is right ; therefore, it is that I take 
               <br />
               it upon myself to speak thus frankly and to 
               <br />
               tell the truth to the people. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               “ But,” it will be said, “annexation is 
               <br />
               national suicide, and the people will never

               <br />
               The people of Lower Canada will reply, that 
               <br />
               Louisiana contained but 30,000 whites 
               <br />
               when it was sold to the United States for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$14,000,000,</span> and that Lower Canada counts 
               <br />
               more than 1,000,000 of inhabitants; that 
               <br />
               there is, therefore, no comparison between 
               <br />
               the position of Louisiana at that time and 
               <br />
               that we now occupy. Besides, those 30,000 
               <br />
               Whites in Louisiana were not all French ; 
               <br />
               for thirty years previous to 1800, Louisiana 
               <br />
               had belonged to the Spaniards. N 0 one can 
               <br />
               deny that. It was in 1803 that it was 
               <br />
               ceded by France to the United States, and 
               <br />
               yet its French p0pulation has not been 
               <br />
               absorbed and has not disappeared. Hear,

               <br />
               States, Louisiana has always governed itself 
               <br />
               as it liked, and in its oWn way. It is true

               French as it was under the domination of 
               <br />
               France. (Hear, hear.)° To those who tell 
               <br />
               our people that annexation would annihilate

               <br />
               ality and their religion, they will reply that 
               <br />
               there is no danger of their being transported 
               <br />
               like the inhabitants of Acadia, and that 
               <br />
               Lower Canada would be as independent as 
               <br />
               any of the other states of the union ; that 
               <br />
               they would, therefore, manage their own

               aﬂairs, and protect ,their interests as they 
               <br />
               thought proper, without fear of intervention 
               <br />
               on the part of the General Government or 
               <br />
               of the other states ; for they would possess, 
               <br />
               like all the other states, full and entire 
               <br />
               sovereignty in all matters specially relating 
               <br />
               to their own interests. They would be 
               <br />
               obliged to submit to the Federal Government 
               <br />
               only as regards matters of general interest, 
               <br />
               such as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pistal</span> matters, the tariff, foreign 
               <br />
               relations, defence against enemies, &amp;c., <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">M.</span> 
               <br />
               With regard to local matters, they would be 
               <br />
               perfectly sovereign in their own country, 
               <br />
               and they could make all the laws they 
               <br />
               thought proper, provided such laws were not 
               <br />
               hostile to the other states. Thus, as regards 
               <br />
               the question of divorce, they might legislate 
               <br />
               so that divorce could not be eﬁ'ected within 
               <br />
               their limits. At present some of the states 
               <br />
               have divorce laws, while others have not; 
               <br />
               divorce is not permitted everywhere. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) In the same way as regards the 
               <br />
               militia; the pe0ple will tell you that they 
               <br />
               might do like Vermont, which has formed 
               <br />
               part of the American union since its found- 
               <br />
               ation, and which never adopted a militia 
               <br />
               law until January, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1864,</span> because the political 
               <br />
               organization of the United States never 
               <br />
               rendered it necessary for the American peo- 
               <br />
               ple to maintain armies in each state in time 
               <br />
               of peace, and each state is perfectly free as 
               <br />
               regards the organization of its militia, pro— 
               <br />
               vided it furnishes the number of soldiers 
               <br />
               assigned to its population, in time of war. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) They do not ruin themselves 
               <br />
               in time of peace to organize the militia. A
