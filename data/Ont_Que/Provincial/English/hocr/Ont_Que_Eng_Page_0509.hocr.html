               ment of lieutenant-governors is again a bait, 
               <br />
               and perhaps not a small one for more than 
               <br />
               a few of our public men. The power of 
               <br />
               disallowance of local bills, and also that of 
               <br />
               reserving them for the sanction of the Gen- 
               <br />
               eral overnment, are on the one hand 
               <br />
               represented as realities—powers that will 
               <br />
               really be exercised by the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to restrain improper local legislation— 
               <br />
               to make everything safe for those who want 
               <br />
               a Legislative rather than a Federal union; 
               <br />
               but on the other hand, to those who do not 
               <br />
               want a legislative union, it is represented 
               <br />
               that they mean nothing at all, and will never 
               <br />
               be exercised. (Hear, hear.) Uniformity 
               <br />
               of laws again is to be given to all the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, if they desire it, except Lower Ca- 
               <br />
               nada; but by a peculiar provision of the 
               <br />
               Constitution, although nothing can be done 
               <br />
               by the General Parliament to render the 
               <br />
               laws uniform, without the consent of the 
               <br />
               provinces concerned, it is stipulated that it 
               <br />
               shall be impossible for Lower Canada, even 
               <br />
               though she should desire it, to have her laws 
               <br />
               uniform with those of the other provinces. 
               <br />
               So, too, with regard to education in Upper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada; the provision is to be 
               <br />
               made, no one knows how, for everybody, and 
               <br />
               all are guaranteed some sort of satisfaction. 
               <br />
               It is true we are not told what the promised 
               <br />
               measures on this head are to be; whether 
               <br />
               they really will give increased facilities to 
               <br />
               the minorities in the two sections for the 
               <br />
               education of their youth in their own way 
               <br />
               or not; but we are to take the promise as 
               <br />
               all right, and everybody is required to be 
               <br />
               content. Turning to the ﬁnancial features 
               <br />
               of the scheme, we ﬁnd it roundly stated that 
               <br />
               all the debts and liabilities of each province 
               <br />
               are to be assumed by the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment; but if we look again into details we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that—no, they are not. There is a 
               <br />
               something here, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">too,</span> beyond what appears 
               <br />
               on the face of things. Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada are each to stay burthened with some 
               <br />
               unstated parts of the debt of Canada, and the 
               <br />
               other provinces are to have bonuses of unstated 
               <br />
               and variant mounts, not easy to be come at. 
               <br />
               The ﬁnancial portion of the scheme, equally 
               <br />
               with every other, is prcsented to everybody 
               <br />
               in whatever light he would like to view it in. 
               <br />
               It will surely bring about economy, because 
               <br />
               the local governments will have so little to 
               <br />
               expend unless they resort to direct taxation ; 
               <br />
               but yet, on the other hand, it is as surely to 
               <br />
               carry us through all sorts of wild expendi- 
               <br />
               tare—to give us new and exhaustless credit 
               <br />

               I repeat, there is everywhere throughout this

               rary in its success. (Hear, hear.) Seriously, 
               <br />
               then, Mr. SPEAKER, I pass on to examine 
               <br />
               this work in a constitutional point of view, 
               <br />
               clearing away, as best one may, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> ambigu- 
               <br />
               ities that surround it, dealin with it as it is,

               and comparing it primarily wrth the Constitu-

               tion of the United States, and secondari] with 
               <br />
               the Constitution of Great Britain. wish 
               <br />
               I could compare it primarily with that of 
               <br />
               Great Britain ; but it is so much more like 
               <br />
               that of the United States, that I cannot. In 
               <br />
               parts only has it any resemblance to the 
               <br />
               British Constitution ; and for this reason the 
               <br />
               order of comparison cannot be reversed. I 
               <br />
               must say, before I go further, that I am by 
               <br />
               no means an admirer of a great deal that I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in the Constitution of the United States. 
               <br />
               I have always preferred, decidedly preferred, 
               <br />
               and do now preter, our own British Consti— 
               <br />
               tution. But this, at least, no one can deny, 
               <br />
               that the framers of the American Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion were great men, wise men, far-seeing 
               <br />
               men; that their work was a great work; and 
               <br />
               that to compare anybody else’s work— 
               <br />
               especially a work such as this, of the few 
               <br />
               gentlemen, doubtless able gentlemen, who 
               <br />
               framed this Constitution—with it, is to 
               <br />
               submit that work to a very severe and trying 
               <br />
               test. (Hear, hear.) The framers of the 
               <br />
               Constitution of the United States were, 
               <br />
               indeed, great men—living in, and the 
               <br />
               product of a great a a, who had pasœd 
               <br />
               through a great ordea and been brought 
               <br />
               up to the level of their work by great 
               <br />
               events in which they had been leading 
               <br />
               actors ; and their work was a great 
               <br />
               work, which cost much time and much
