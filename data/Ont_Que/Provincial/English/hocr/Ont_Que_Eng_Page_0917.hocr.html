               <br />
               country some four months ago. The

               frankly and squarely, that they would add

               loss with other honorable members to say 
               <br />
               anything new upon it, I, too, will have to 
               <br />
               turn to my fault-ﬁnding instincts in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               instance. The honorable member for Man- 
               <br />
               treal Centre (Hon. Mr. Ross) has said in his 
               <br />
               able speech that if we could not improve on 
               <br />
               the project, we should forbear to ﬁnd fault 
               <br />
               with it. I do not agree with him. On the 
               <br />
               contrary, I conceive that even though ap- 
               <br />
               proving of th esolutions as a whole, it is 
               <br />
               the duty of me ers speaking to the question 
               <br />
               to point out and place on record the faults 
               <br />
               that strike them as likely to require correc- 
               <br />
               tion by and by. And ﬁrst of all—coming to 
               <br />
               discuss Confederation from my own stand- 
               <br />
               point—-I would say that I have long looked 
               <br />
               forward to the time when the whole of the 
               <br />
               British North American Provinces would be 
               <br />
               united under one stable government ; believ- 
               <br />
               ing, as I always have believed ever since I 
               <br />
               came to know this country well, that we pos- 
               <br />
               sess all the elements, in natural resources and 
               <br />
               endowments, and in distinctive geographical 
               <br />
               position, to form the ouud-work of a power 
               <br />
               on this continent. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> feared, nevertheless, 
               <br />
               when the project was foreshadowed here last 
               <br />
               year, that the time was not yet full for 
               <br />
               bringing about the desired combination. I 
               <br />
               feared that the almost total separation, poii- 
               <br />
               tical and social, which had heretofore existed 
               <br />
               between ourselves and the provinces below, 
               <br />
               might possibly cause a premature union to 
               <br />
               result in permanent estrangement. It ap- 
               <br />
               peared to me that we should ﬁrst — have 
               <br />
               cultivated social and commercial relations 
               <br />
               with our kindred on the seaboard before 
               <br />
               uniting, for better for worse, in a olitical 
               <br />

               of the Confederation project when it was so 
               <br />
               suddenly sprung upon us at the close of last

               session ; and I confess that I still entertain 
               <br />
               grave apprehensions that we may be about to 
               <br />
               come together upon too short an acquaint- 
               <br />
               ance, before we have an opportunity of 
               <br />
               knowing one another, and learning to adapt 
               <br />
               ourselves the one to the other. In this con- 
               <br />
               sists my broad and general objection, not to 
               <br />
               the principle of Confederation, but to the 
               <br />
               hastiness with which it is sought to be car- 
               <br />
               ried out—threatening, as I fear, to mar our 
               <br />
               destiny in striving to overtake it. _To the

               I allude to the Federal feature of the pro-

               ject. I own to a rooted dislike, if notto

               <br />
               warm eulogium which the Hon. President 
               <br />
               of the Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN) has passed 
               <br />

               <br />
               clothe it in other than most distasteful 
               <br />
               colors in my sight. However 'the Federal

               <br />
               that such a country, with such a people, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ever; I repeat, the Federal form of govern-

               <br />

               most marked and evil result of the system

               limited proportion of the latter; and I would 
               <br />
               much fear, if we are to see Canada redivided,

               schools for that class of politicians who take to 
               <br />
               politics as toa trade, and whose after-presence 
               <br />
