               introduction and increase—the rapid increase

               Now, sir, I object as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">western</span> man 
               <br />
               (and I will be pardoned if I allude to the 
               <br />
               sectional question) to the great injustice 
               <br />
               which will be done to the peeple of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada in the heavy burdens which she 
               <br />
               will have to bear in the carrying on of the 
               <br />
               General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> In the able speech 
               <br />
               delivered by the Hon. the Minister 'of 
               <br />
               Finance at Sherbrooke, he said that when 
               <br />
               the population of Canada should reach ﬁve 
               <br />
               millions (a larger papulatiou than that of 
               <br />
               the proposed Confederation at present), the 
               <br />
               revenue which would be derived for public 
               <br />
               purposes would not be a farthing more than 
               <br />
               now. One hon. gentleman has said in this 
               <br />
               House that it is as cheap to govern three 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miilions</span> as ﬁve millions of people. That may 
               <br />
               be true, but one million of money will not 
               <br />
               0 as far as ﬁve millions in making those 
               <br />
               local improvements which Upper Canada 
               <br />
               would require, and to which the people of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada would be justly and fairly 
               <br />
               entitled. Then I object further to the 
               <br />
               scheme, because while Upper Canada will 
               <br />
               contribute the largest amount to the general 
               <br />
               revenue, she will also have to hear the heavy 
               <br />
               share of defensive and other public works in 
               <br />
