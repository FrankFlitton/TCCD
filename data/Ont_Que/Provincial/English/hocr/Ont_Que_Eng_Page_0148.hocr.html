               <br />
               and force us into a new course of conduct. 
               <br />
               What are these warnings? We have had at 
               <br />
               least three. The ﬁrst is from Eu gland, and 
               <br />
               is a friendly warnin . England warned us 
               <br />
               by several matters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0%</span> fact, according to her 
               <br />
               custom, rather than verbiage, that the colo-

               nice had entered upon a new era of existence, 
               <br />
               a new phase in their career. She has given 
               <br />
               us thiswarning in several different shapes— 
               <br />
               when she gave us “ Responsible Govern- 
               <br />
               ment”—when she adopted Free Trade—when 
               <br />
               she repealed the Navigation laws—and when, 
               <br />
               three or four years ago, she commenced that 
               <br />
               series of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cﬁcial</span> despatches in relation to 
               <br />
               militia and defence which she has ever since 
               <br />
               poured in on us, in a steady stream, always 
               <br />
               bearing the same solemn burthen—“ prepare ! 
               <br />
               prepare! prepare !” These warnin gave 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no</span> notice that the old order of things etween 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonies</span> and the Mother Country had 
               <br />
               ceased, and that a new order must take its 
               <br />
               place. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">éHear,</span> hear.) About four ears 
               <br />
               ago, the rst despatches began to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mali-e.-</span> 
               <br />
               ed to this country, from the Colonial Oﬁce, 
               <br />
               upon the subject. From that day to this 
               <br />
               there has been a steady stream of despatches 
               <br />
               in this direction, either upon particular or 
               <br />
               general points connected with our defence; 
               <br />
               and I venture to say, that if bound up to- 
               <br />
               gether, the despatches of the lamented Duke 
               <br />

               of this province to the Mother Country 
               <br />
               had changed ; and we were told in the most 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explicit</span> language that could be emplo ed, 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friendly</span> warnings ; and if we have failed to 
               <br />
               do our part in regard to them, we must, at

               may call the other warnin from without—

               publican America gave us her notices in times 
               <br />
               past, through her press, and her demagogues 
               <br />
               and her statesmen,—but of late days she has 
               <br />
               given us much more intelligible notices— 
               <br />
               such as the notice to abrogate the Recipro- 
               <br />
               city Treaty, and to arm the lakes, contrary 
               <br />
               to the provisions of the addenda to the treaty 
               <br />
               of 1818. She has given us another notice 
               <br />
               in imposing a vexatious passport system ; 
               <br />
               another in her avowed pur ose to construct 
               <br />
               a ship canal round the Fal s of Niagara, so 
               <br />
               as “ to pass war vessels from Lake Ontario 
               <br />
               to Lake Erie ;” and yet another, the most 
               <br />
               striking one of all, has been given to us, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               House a few ﬁgures which show the amazing, 
               <br />
               the unprecedented growth, which has not, 
               <br />
               perhaps, a parallel in the annals of the past, 
               <br />
               of the military power of our neighbors with- 
               <br />
               in the ast three or four years. I have the 
               <br />
               details ere by me, but shall only read the 
               <br />
               results, to show the House the emphatic 
               <br />
               meaning of this most serious warning. In 
               <br />
               January, 1861, the regular army of the 
               <br />
               United States, including of course the whole 
               <br />
               of the States, did not exceed 15,000 men. 
               <br />
               This number was reduced, from desertion 
               <br />
               and other causes, by 5,000 men, leaving 
               <br />
               10,000 men as the army of the States. In 
               <br />
               December, 1862—that is, from January, 
               <br />
               1861, to January, 1863, this army of 10,000 
               <br />
               was increased to 800,000 soldiers actually in 
               <br />
               the ﬁeld. (Hear, hear.) No doubt there 
               <br />
               are exaggerations in some of these ﬁgures— 
               <br />
               the rosters were, doubtless, in some cases 
               <br />
               ﬁlled with ﬁctitious names, in order to procure 
               <br />
               the beauties that were oﬂ'ered ; but if we 
               <br />
               allow two-thirds as correct, we ﬁnd that a 
               <br />
