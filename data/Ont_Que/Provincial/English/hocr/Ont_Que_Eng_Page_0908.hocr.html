               kind. The assertion is a libel on the people 
               <br />
               of Canada, who, I believe, are truly loyal to 
               <br />

               in these resoutions for the construction of

               see that no decisive provision is made for the

               they stand, were it not for the positive

               assurances ef the Government that that mat-

               ter would be attended to simultaneously 
               <br />
               with the construction of that road. For 
               <br />
               I hold it to be of essential importance that 
               <br />
               we should proceed, as soon as possible, with 
               <br />
               the opening up of the North-West country 
               <br />
               and the extension of our canal system.

               <br />
               may be permitted to say that I hope, that in 
               <br />
               going on with the canals, the Government 
               <br />
               will not overlook the necessity which exists 
               <br />
               for the construction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> Georgian

               that that is the best feasible route by which 
               <br />
               we can hope to bring the trade of the Great 
               <br />
               West through this country. (Hear, hear.) I do 
               <br />
               hope the Government will seriously consider

               <br />
               elections in one of the eastern provinces. 
               <br />
               When I heard that many of those elections 
               <br />
               in New Brunswick had gone against the 
               <br />
               scheme, I was at a loss to decide what 
               <br />
               would be the proper course—whether the 
               <br />
               scheme should still be pressed, or whether 
               <br />
               we should turn our attention to some other 
               <br />
               scheme. On full consideration of the subject, 
               <br />
               I have arrived at the conclusion that the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment have acted properly, and that they 
               <br />
               deserve every credit for the prompt action 
               <br />
               they have taken to get a speedy decision on 
               <br />
               this question. It is clear that the question 
               <br />
               of our defences, and that of our commercial 
               <br />
               relations with the United States, must be 
               <br />
               immediately looked to. Some steps must, 
               <br />
               as soon as possible, be taken to put the 
               <br />
               country in a proper state of defence. The 
               <br />
               season is approaching when we would be in 
               <br />

               nerment to take prom t action, that we may
