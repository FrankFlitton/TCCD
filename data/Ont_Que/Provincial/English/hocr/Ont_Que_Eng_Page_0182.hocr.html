               HON. Mn. REESOR—I shall be very 
               <br />
               brief in the remarks I have now to make to 
               <br />
               the House. I do not object to the objects of 
               <br />
               these resolutions, or to the measure per se, 
               <br />
               but I do object to some of its details. I hope 
               <br />
               to see a union of the British North American 
               <br />
               Colonies effected, but what I am anxious for 
               <br />
               is that the conditions of the union may be so 
               <br />
               satisfaeto and well considered, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> there 
               <br />
               will not embraced therein the seeds of 
               <br />
               future disruption, or anything that will give 
               <br />
               rise to a desire on the part of any of the prov- 
               <br />
               inces to separate from the union, or prevent 
               <br />
               other portions of British North America 
               <br />
               coming in hereafter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> forming parts of this 
               <br />
               proposed Confederation. I hope we shall be 
               <br />
               some day a great British North American 
               <br />
               Confederacy, but that is the greater reason 
               <br />
               why the terms of the agreement should be of 
               <br />
               such a character that we can all, or nearly all, 
               <br />
               approve of them. We must bear in mind, 
               <br />
               also, that one reason why those who were 
               <br />
               heretofore the exponents of the views of two 
               <br />
               great political parties are all on one side at 
               <br />
               the present time, arises from the very peculiar 
               <br />
               circumstances in which the country has been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">placed</span> for the last eight or ten years. Those 
               <br />
               who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supmrt</span> this measure have given as reasons 
               <br />
               for it that we have had so many political 
               <br />
               erisœ, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changes</span> have been so varied, 
               <br />
               that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Memes</span> necessary for some great con-

               same time carefully enumerated the political 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changes</span> that have taken place during the past 
               <br />

               ALD Government with an equally slim major- 
               <br />
               ity;—so that we were really in a state of 
               <br />
               political crisis like that of a merchant, who, 
               <br />
               having suﬁered many losses in business affairs, 
               <br />
               yet, with his credit still good, at last becomes 
               <br />
               confused, and, incapable of exercising his judg- 
               <br />
               ment, launches into some scheme that proves 
               <br />
               ruinous, whereas calmness and deliberation 
               <br />
               might have retrieved his situation. We had 
               <br />
               three governments formed within as many 
               <br />
               years, each failing in turn to administer affairs 
               <br />
               to the satisfaction of the people. We had, in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TACBÈ-MACDONALD</span> cabinet, a Finance 
               <br />
               Minister on whom a vote of censure of the most 
               <br />
               serious character was passed, which amountcd 
               <br />
               to a vote of want of conﬁdence in the whole 
               <br />
               Government. At that time we had in opposi- 
               <br />
               tion the gentleman who is now the President 
               <br />
               of the Council, who had contended for ten 
               <br />
               years for a change of the constitutional rela- 
               <br />
               tions between Upper and Lower Canada. He 
               <br />
               failed to accomplish his object. He could not 
               <br />
               consistently ally himself with his opponents 
               <br />
               without some new scheme to lay before the 
               <br />
               country. To form a government, he could 
               <br />
               not. I‘he Finance Minister being condemned, 
               <br />
               the government was bound to reconstruct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> 
               <br />
               resi n. Each party desired to rule, _but 
               <br />
               neit er was able. Out of political adversity 
               <br />
               grew political desperation. It was called by 
               <br />
               some a political millennium, and perhaps it 
               <br />
               was; but matters were just in that shape to 
               <br />
               induce parties to take up almost any new 
               <br />
               scheme, as in this case, in which I think they 
               <br />
               have gone on quite too rapidly. They have 
               <br />
               not deliberated suﬁiciently to propose a mes- 
               <br />
               sure of that mature character which the 
               <br />
               country had a right to expect. Perhaps as 
               <br />
               good a measure has been brought out as could 
               <br />
               have been, considering the short time that has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elapæd,</span> and the disadvantages under which 
               <br />
               they labored during the discussion of the 
               <br />
               scheme. But it must be admitted that when 
               <br />
               this measure was agreed to by our Government, 
               <br />
               they adopted a hasty course. The country 
               <br />
               heard only one side of the question. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear)</span> 
               <br />
               They had the great daily news apers, the 
               <br />
               chief organs of public opinion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">both</span> politi- 
               <br />
               cal parties, all on their side, and there was only 
               <br />
               a small portion of the country press, and that 
               <br />
               not widely circulated, that gave the opposite 
               <br />
               side of the question. And so it has been 
               <br />
               going on up to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> time; and now we 
               <br />
               have the scheme brought before us in 
               <br />
               its present shape. I consider that, under 
               <br />
               these circumstances, it is our duty to give 
               <br />
               very serious attention to the question, before 
               <br />
               we adopt it as it is. (Hear, hear.) I fur—
