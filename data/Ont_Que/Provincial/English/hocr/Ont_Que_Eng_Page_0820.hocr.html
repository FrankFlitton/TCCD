               the great Liberal party. I should be sorry 
               <br />
               to see such a calamity. I have always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-l</span>

               ness the destruction of the great Liberal

               that that party will not be destroyed in any 
               <br />
               such manner. After this great scheme is 
               <br />
               perfected, we will have parties the same as 
               <br />

               <br />
               events there will still be a great Liberal 
               <br />
               party. (Cheers and laughter.) Party is

               country; but I trust that party feeling will 
               <br />
               not be manifested for the sake of creating 
               <br />
               divisions and discards, but that all parties 
               <br />
               will unite to build up a power here which 
               <br />
               will be felt and respected throughout the 
               <br />
               world. (Hear, hear, and cheers.) The hen- 
               <br />
               orable member for B'rome (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Doux…)</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> some remarks which it struck me were 
               <br />
               very singular in their character, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which.</span> 
               <br />
               are a fair instance of the manner he adopts 
               <br />
               to illustrate and substantiate his views. He 
               <br />
               quoted from English statesmen and English 
               <br />
               publications all that could possibly be cited 
               <br />
               to throw doubt upon the scheme; but the 
               <br />
               moment English opinion was invoked in its 
               <br />
               favor, he turned round and declared that 
               <br />
               English views on Canadian aﬂ'airs were en- 
               <br />
               tirely unreliable. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)

               not present, I shall not refer further to his

               said that the cry of annexation had been 
               <br />
               raised in order to push this scheme through.
