               success in war than I have of the American

               <br />
               seen them at sea. They certainly have come 
               <br />
               out as amilitary nation in such a way as 
               <br />
               almost to astonish the world. But, sir, let 
               <br />
               us consider a little more closely what their 
               <br />
               circumstances are in other respects. No 
               <br />
               doubt they have an enormous navy, but that 
               <br />
               very navy would not be more than suﬁoient 
               <br />
               to defend their harbors in case of a war with 
               <br />
               England. It is not because I imagine their 
               <br />
               ships could not cope singly with British 
               <br />
               ships—it is not because I believe their men 
               <br />
               are lacking in skill or courage, or that they 
               <br />
               are unable to build <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sumoient</span> vessels—but 
               <br />
               they lack this—and it is a consideration 
               <br />
               which we cannot and ought not to forget- 
               <br />
               that they have not a single harbor in any 
               <br />
               sea, except on their own coast, to reﬁt their 
               <br />
               vessels. (Hear, hear.) Supposing them to 
               <br />
               send a ﬂeet of 20 or 30 ships to England.

               Sailing vessels now-a-days can do nothing; 
               <br />
               all vessels of war have to be prepelled by 
               <br />
               steam; and there is no neutral port in the 
               <br />
               world where in time of war with England, 
               <br />
               the navy of the United States would be able 
               <br />
               to obtain assistance. For I take it for grant- 
               <br />
               ed that in the event of a war with England 
               <br />
               the United States would have few allies. 
               <br />
               And, as I belore remarked, thereis not a port 
               <br />
               in the world wh :re they could get an ounce of 
               <br />
               coal or any addition to their armament. In this 
               <br />
               would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cow-ﬁst</span> our great safety. They have 
               <br />
               no ports in the Indian Sea, in the east Atlan- 
               <br />
               tic, the Mediterranean or China seas, and it is 
               <br />
               simply because men of war could not exist 
               <br />
               without coaling and reﬁtting that the navy 
               <br />
               of the United States would be placed at so 
               <br />
               great disadvantage. It is contrary to interna-

               tional law, as the House is well aware, that 
               <br />

               But there is yetanother view to be taken of 
               <br />
               the question. Do we not know that in the

               <br />
               landing at every point. The navy of Eng-

               land, the arsenals of England, the purse of

               England, and all the appliances and require— 
               <br />
               ments of war would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> brought tobear upon 
               <br />
               and be available to us in such astrugzle. We

               other things the most essential. n all respects 
               <br />
               we should be in a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ'erent</span> position from

               the Confederate States at the present day.

               we can to encourage and evoke a military

               position in such a war? We could not. 
               <br />
               We should have to make common cause
