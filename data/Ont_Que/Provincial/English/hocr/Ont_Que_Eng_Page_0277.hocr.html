               ber for Peterborough stated the other day, and 
               <br />
               ocrrec I believe, that the lace for our mili-

               thing to be of some use. No doubt of this. 
               <br />
               Why, sir, it is absurd to ak of defending 
               <br />
               this country with such. a rce as we could 
               <br />
               maintain when we have the recent example 
               <br />
               before our eyes of a country in Europe pos- 
               <br />
               sessin as l a defensive force, literally 
               <br />
               wi oif the ma by an invading army of 
               <br />
               some 75,000 or 8 ,000 men. The kingdom 
               <br />
               of Denmark consists now of only two small 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">islands—less</span> by far, in extent, than one of 
               <br />
               our large counties; and this dismemherment 
               <br />
               has been forced upon it, although it had a 
               <br />
               standing army of30,000 men, and the feel- 
               <br />
               ing of the whole pulation was in favor of 
               <br />
               the war. (Hear, ear.) I do not use this 
               <br />
               argument for the purpose of showing that 
               <br />
               something ought not to be done respecting our 
               <br />
               militia. I am willing that we should make 
               <br />
               sacriﬁces, if neeœsa , for the purpose of or- 
               <br />
               ganizin it thorough ; but.I am decidedly 
               <br />
               oppose to a standing army, and do not 
               <br />
               believe we could raise an army now that 
               <br />
               would be able to withstand the force that 
               <br />
               could be sent against it. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We have sent to the frontier 2,000 men, 
               <br />
               whose services for a year will cost us a 
               <br />
               million and a~half ; and at the same rate 
               <br />
               of cx diture, 50,000 men would cost us 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">o'er.</span> irty millions of money. Now, if the 
               <br />
               whole defence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of'the</span> country is to rest upon 
               <br />
               us, I ask again what would such a force 
               <br />
               amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to,</span> ? (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, when 
               <br />
               I look into the. provisions of this scheme, I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd another most objectionable one. It is that 
               <br />
               which gives the General Government control 
               <br />
               over all the acts of the local legislatures. What 
               <br />
               diﬁculties may not arise under this system ? 
               <br />
               Now, knowing that the General Government 
               <br />

               late has it been the policy of the Imperial

               sire in this respect, when their wishes are 
               <br />
               constitutionally expressed. The axiom on

               <br />
               tures. Do you not see that it is quite possible

               for a majority in a local government to be 
               <br />

               <br />

               General Government to disallow the laws en-

               or in order to serve their own purposes or

               necessary and (Hear, hear.) We

               know how high party feeling runs sometimes 
               <br />
               upon local matters even of trivial importance, 
               <br />
               and we may ﬁnd parties so hotly opposed to 
               <br />
               each other in the local legislatures, that the 
               <br />

               sir, I ﬁnd that in addition to all the other
