               the last week it has been to me not without

               its ludicrous aspects. When I have heard 
               <br />
               honorable members get up day after day and 
               <br />
               argue gravely for union with a people who 
               <br />
               we now know will have no union with us, and 
               <br />
               arguing that that union will be a means by 
               <br />
               which we could emerge from our sectional 
               <br />
               diﬁculties here in Canada, it has presented 
               <br />
               to my mind a most ludicrous aspect. I can- 
               <br />
               not conceive why hon. gentlemen, in the face 
               <br />
               of the intelligence we have had from New 
               <br />
               Brunswick and Newfoundland, and for what 
               <br />
               we know is likely to be the action of Prince

               Edward Island and Nova Scotia, should go 
               <br />
               on gravely arguing in favor of this as a live 
               <br />
               scheme, from which anything else could come 
               <br />
               than the perpetuation of the oﬂicial life of a 
               <br />
               few hon. gentlemen, brought together by 
               <br />
               means that I shall not now allude to more 
               <br />
               particularly, but which I shall take another 
               <br />
               occasion to' characterise in such terms as I 
               <br />
               think are appropriate. Their Confederation 
               <br />
               scheme is dead, sir, and they know it is dead; 
               <br />
               and yet they go on and ask their supporters 
               <br />
               here to vote for this string of seventy-two 
               <br />
               propositions. The hon. gentleman who has 
               <br />
               just taken his seat, said he was going to vote 
               <br />
               for the motion, but wished it to be distinctly 
               <br />
               understood that he was not in favor of any 
               <br />
               one of the propositions which the motion em- 
               <br />
               braces. I tell my honorable friend that he is 
               <br />
               going to record his vote in favor of every one 
               <br />
               of these propositions. I tell him that the 
               <br />
               Government will not give to him, or to this 
               <br />
