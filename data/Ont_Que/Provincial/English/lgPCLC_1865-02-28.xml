     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—Before the 
     <lb/>
     House rises, I desire to submit a statement 
     <lb/>
     of the revenue of the Island of Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward, which has come into my hands since 
     <lb/>
     the close of the debate on the proposed union 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and the Lower Provinces. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Niagara seemed to take 
     <lb/>
     exception to what I said in relation to that 
     <lb/>
     particular point, and I am therefore happy 
     <lb/>
     to be able to satisfy the hon. member that 
     <lb/>
     what I then stated is fully sustained by the 
     <lb/>
     authentic return now before me. I hold in 
     <lb/>
     my hand a " Report of the Comptroller of 
     <lb/>
     Customs and Sundry Statistics " of that 
     <lb/>
     colony for the year 1863, which shows that 
     <lb/>
     the total revenue of the island for that year 
     <lb/>
     was £61,688 14s. 4d., island currency, equal 
     <lb/>
     to £41,125 16s. 3d., sterling, an increase 
     <lb/>
     over the previous year of nearly 35 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member seemed to think it impos<lb break="no"/>sible that such a sum as I had stated should 
     <lb/>
     have been raised, and suggested that a great 
     <lb/>
     part must have come from local sources. 
     <lb/>
    Well, the amount derived from excise and 
     <lb/>duties on imports for 1863 was £46,057 6s. 
     <lb/>7d., island currency, from the post office 
     <lb/>£1,590, and from custom house office fees, 
     <lb/>£71 9s. 9d. ; together £47,718 16s. 4d., 
     <lb/>island currency, or about £32,000, sterling, 
     <lb/>equal to $156,000 or thereabouts. There 
     <lb/>are a good many other items of revenue, but 
     <lb/>I have selected these three, as those certain 
     <lb/>to come into the treasury of the General 
     <lb/>Government, and there may be others. But 
     <lb/>it will be seen that these alone would make 
     <lb/>up the sum I gave as the revenue of the 
     <lb/>island, which would be available for the 
     <lb/>general purposes of the Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I did not question 
     <lb/>
     the correctness of the figures of the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Commissioner of Crown Lands, but I felt 
     <lb/>
     and expressed some surprise at the sum, 
     <lb/>
     which, when compared with former years, 
     <lb/>
     exhibited, as I thought, an almost incredible 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     increase. Will the Honorable Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     state what proportion of these imports was 
     <lb/>
     foreign, and what came from the provinces it 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to unite, as after the union no 
     <lb/>
     revenue would of course be derived from the 
     <lb/>
     latter ?

     the value of 24,991 tons of shipping built in
