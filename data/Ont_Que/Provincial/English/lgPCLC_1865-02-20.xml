<!-- GL, 2016-11-15, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

<!--<p>
     years before. The progress of the country 
     <lb/>
     requires that from time to time men should 
     <lb/>
     enter this House as representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of the day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. ARMSTRONG moved that 
     <lb/>
     the House do now adjourn.—-Contents, 21 ; 
     <lb/>
     Non—Contents, 29. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MB. OLIVIER—I shall now en- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     deavor to answer an objection made by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lands 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL) to the motion of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Niagara (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     CURRIE). He would make it appear that 
     <lb/>
     the motion is inconsistent with the position 
     <lb/>
     taken by the honorable member who seconded 
     <lb/>
     the motion, because he declared himself as 
     <lb/>
     favorable to Confederation. For my part, I 
     <lb/>
     can see no inconsistency in the proceeding 
     <lb/>
     of the honorable member, who merely asks 
     <lb/>
     that time be allowed that the people may 
     <lb/>
     give their opinions on the question. He 
     <lb/>
     does not care in what manner it is allowed. 
     <lb/>
     If the Government do allow time for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose, it will rest with them to say whether 
     <lb/>
     the question shall be submitted to the peeple 
     <lb/>
     by means of a general election, or some 
     <lb/>
     other way. The amendment of the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Niagara does not suggest 
     <lb/>
     any particular way of submitting the ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the country. He only asks that 
     <lb/>
     it be so submitted, leaving to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to choose the most convenient method 
     <lb/>
     of doing it. And this is exactly the position 
     <lb/>
     which I have myself taken. I have told 
     <lb/>
     honorable members who seemed to believe 
     <lb/>
     me altogether opposed to Confederation, that 
     <lb/>
     it is not the case, that I only want time to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain whether the eople are in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme or not. Only if the project is 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the people, it is desirable that 
     <lb/>
     it be presented to them in all its details, 
     <lb/>
     and not in the skeleton shape in which it 
     <lb/>
     is now laid before us. I have no intention 
     <lb/>
     to weary the attention of the House, but I 
     <lb/>
     thought it right to express my views and 
     <lb/>
     say why I intend to vote in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     motion of the honorable member for Ni<lb break="no"/>agara. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The amendment moved by the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Cnam was then put to the vote, and lost

            <p>MONDAY, <hi rendition="simple:italic">February</hi> 20, 1865. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:AIKI1">HON. MR. AIKINS</persName> said — Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, when I last had the honor of address<lb break="no"/>ing the House, it will be remembered by 
     <lb/>
     those hon. gentlemen who were present that I 
     <lb/>
     spoke very strongly in relation to the changes 
     <lb/>
     contemplated by these resolutions in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to this Chamber. Since then, although 
     <lb/>
     I have listened very attentively to the 
     <lb/>
     speeches of honorable gentlemen, I have 
     <lb/>
     heard no good reason to convince me that the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle as re ds this honorable 
     <lb/>
     House should be abolished. It has been 
     <lb/>
     asserted by those who are strong advocates 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, that if any amendment 
     <lb/>
     is passed affecting the general principles of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions, it will be considered a defeat ; 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme will have to be considered 
     <lb/>
     again, and that negotiations with the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces wil have to be resumed 
     <lb/>
     in order to meet the altered view of the case. 
     <lb/>
     Had the amendment of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Wellington (Hon. Mr. SANBOBN) been car<lb break="no"/>ried, this might have been the case ; but as 
     <lb/>
     the motion which I amabout to move applies 
     <lb/>
     only to the Canadas, that would not be so. 
     <lb/>
     It will be remembered that that amendment 
     <lb/>
     afirmed not only the elective principle for all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, but that the life members who 
     <lb/>
     are now sitting in this House should continue 
     <lb/>
     to hold their seats. It went further and 
     <lb/>
     declared that a number to correspond with 
     <lb/>
     the life members should be admitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Chamber from the Maritime Provinces. In 
     <lb/>
     referring to the vote which was taken on this 
     <lb/>
     amendment, I find that in the 4l votes cast 
     <lb/>
     against it, 11 of the life members of the 
     <lb/>
     House voted against, while only three voted 
     <lb/>
     for it ; thus they, by a large majority vote, 
     <lb/>
     negatived the principles therein affirmed. I 
     <lb/>
     refer to this particularly, for this reason, that 
     <lb/>
     the ground may be taken by the lilc mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this Chamber that my amendment is 
     <lb/>
     specially directed against, and if carried, 
     <lb/>
     would be applicable to these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/><pb n="317" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0317.jpg"/><fw type="num">317</fw>men. The vote they have already given on the<lb/>
            resolution referred to is my vindication,
and <lb/>
they, in affirming the general principles of <lb/>
the Confederation resolutions, will vote for <lb/>
that which may deprive them of their seats. </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>—Hear, hear. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:AIKI1">HON.
MB. AIKINS</persName>—The hon. Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Crown Lands cries " Hear, hear !" <lb/>
But, after the life members of the <lb/>
House have affirmed by their votes that <lb/>
they do not desire that the elective principle <lb/>
should obtain, I do not think they can find <lb/>
fault with me, an elective member, for affirm<lb break="no"/>ing that it should prevail. And it does <lb/>
appear to me, hon. gentlemen, that this <lb/>
House, if constituted as foreshadowed by <lb/>
these resolutions, would be one of the most <lb/>
independent and irresponsible bodies that <lb/>
could possibly be created, the Crown possess<lb break="no"/>ing no power whatever over it. There is no<lb/>
power of dissolution; the Crown has no <lb/>
power to add to the number; and whatever <lb/>
difficulties might possibly occur under the <lb/>
elective system, when the opportunity is <lb/>
afforded to the people of correcting those diffi<lb break="no"/>culties, it will be found that these difficulties <lb/>
will be largely increased under the proposed <lb/>
system. It has been stated by some hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers that a dead-lock might occur. That was <lb/>
the impression which prevailed when the elect<lb break="no"/>ive principle was introduced ; but few have <lb/>
thought proper to use such an argument <lb/>
during the present debate, because it has <lb/>
not been proved by the result.
But if it <lb/>
were possible for a dead-lock to
occur under <lb/>
the elective system, it is far more probable <lb/>
under the system proposed in the resolutions. <lb/>
If a feeling had been manifested by this <lb/>
Chamber since the elective principle was <lb/>
introduced—if we had attempted in any one <lb/>
respect to usurp the exclusive privileges of <lb/>
the Legislative Assembly—it might then with <lb/>
truth be affirmed that the
introduction of <lb/>
the elective principle in this Chamber was a <lb/>
dangerous one. But such has not been the <lb/>
case. I think that the elective principle <lb/>
has worked well, and that so far as the danger <lb/>
of a conflict is concerned, it is as far removed <lb/>
under the present system as under the <lb/>
nominative system. Holding these views, I <lb/>
have thought it proper to place my amend<lb break="no"/>ment before the House, and I trust that the <lb/>
question will be discussed fairly on its merits. <lb/>
I beg now to move, seconded by Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Bureau,-<lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">To resolve, in amendment the resolutions
of <lb/>
the Hon. Sir E. P. Tache,—That
the Legislative <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
            Councillors representing Upper and Lower
Canada <lb/>
in the Legislative Council of the General Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, shall be elected as at present, to represent <lb/>
the forty-eight electoral divisions mentioned in <lb/>
schedule A of chapter first of the Consolidated <lb/>
Statutes of Canada and each such Councillor <lb/>
shall reside or possess the qualification in the <lb/>
division he is elected to represent. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> The ground may be taken by many hon. <lb/>
gentlemen who are strongly in favor of this <lb/>
scheme, that there is much more symmetry <lb/>
in the scheme presented by the resolutions,
<lb/>
and which this motion, if carried, would mar. <lb/>
But really there is very little harmony in <lb/>
them. Under them the appointed council<lb break="no"/>lors will, in Lower Canada, be required to <lb/>
reside in certain divisions or to hold their <lb/>
property there. In Upper Canada the same <lb/>
property qualification applies,
but as to <lb/>
residence there is no restriction ; whilst in <lb/>
one of the Maritime Provinces (Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward) qualification is based on personal <lb/>
preperty only. Hence there is in reality <lb/>
very little symmetry about the scheme. <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELL2">HON. Sir. N. F. BELLEAU</persName> raised the <lb/>
point of order that the amendment had in <lb/>
substance been already disposed of by the vote <lb/>
on the amendment of Hon. Mr. SANBORN. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Hon. The SPEAKER</persName>—The ques<lb break="no"/>tion of order raised by the hon. gentleman is <lb/>
whether the amendment now proposed is not <lb/>
substantially the same as the one voted on by <lb/>
the House and brought forward by the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. SANBORN, and if it is, whether it is in <lb/>
order? Before giving my decision, I wish that <lb/>
the mover of the amendment should himself <lb/>
explain the difference between his motion <lb/>
and that already decided by the House, if <lb/>
he thinks proper to do so. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:AIKI1">HON. MR. AIKINS</persName>—I contend that it is <lb/>
not the same, in effect, as the motion brought <lb/>
forward by the hon. member for Welling<lb break="no"/>ton. It is true that the elective principle is <lb/>
aflirmed in both; but then the motion of <lb/>
the Hon. Mr. SANBORN went further and <lb/>
applied the elective principle to the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces, and was favorable to the retention <lb/>
of the life members, and it also extended <lb/>
the life principle to the Maritime Provinces, <lb/>
and contemplated the addition of ten life <lb/>
members to this Chamber from these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. My motion simply aflirms the elec<lb break="no"/>tive principle so far as Canada is concerned, <lb/>
and between the two I think there is a <lb/>
material difference. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—There is no doubt that <lb/>
the motion of the honorable member for <lb/>

            <fw type="num">318</fw>
            
Wellington embraced all that this
contains, <lb/>
and a great deal more. So that if in the <lb/>
motion that was disposed of the other day, <lb/>
there was embraced what this motion con<lb break="no"/>tains, the present motion is out of order, <lb/>
containing as it does a principle which has <lb/>
already been pronounced upon by this House. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">THE HON.
THE SPEAKER</persName>—There may <lb/>
be some difficulty in deciding on a matter of <lb/>
this kind, because the two motions, although <lb/>
not exactly identical, are very nearly so in one <lb/>
particular. The argument that the motion <lb/>
of Hon. Mr. SANBORN contained more than <lb/>
is embraced in this motion does not apply. <lb/>
The question is, does this affirm what was <lb/>
contained in the motion already voted upon ? <lb/>
That in deciding on this particular matter, <lb/>
we have decided on other things connected <lb/>
with it, does not affect the
position. Rules <lb/>
on questions of this kind have been made to <lb/>
prevent Parliament deciding one day con<lb break="no"/>trary to another, and to avoid
also surprises, <lb/>
by questions being introduced a second time <lb/>
in the absence of members who may have <lb/>
previously voted on them. Were this motion <lb/>
to carry, it would affirm a principle which <lb/>
was negatived when the motion of the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. SANBORN was before the House. It is <lb/>
not necessary that the two motions should be <lb/>
exactly the same; it is sufficient if they are <lb/>
substantially alike. I will quote a few words <lb/>
on this point from MAY :-<lb/></p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">It is a rule in both Houses not to permit any <lb/>
question or bill to be offered which is substan<lb break="no"/>tially the same as one on which their judgment has <lb/>
already been pronounced during the same session. <lb/>
This is necessary to avoid different decisions being <lb/>
given, and to prevent surprises
by a question <lb/>
being resolved first in the afiirmatlve and next <lb/>
in the negative. <lb/></quote>

<p>
Should we pass this motion now before the <lb/>
House, we should be doing what MAY says <lb/>
the rule of Parliament has been framed
to <lb/>
avoid, for it would be affirming a principle <lb/>
on one day, and in another day the contrary. <lb/>
I am bound to say that in my opinion the <lb/>
resolution is substantially contained in the <lb/>
resolution already decided upon, and that <lb/>
therefore it is out of order. (Hear, hear.) </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:AIKI1">HON. MR. AIKINS</persName>—I must confess that <lb/>
1 would like to have had the opinion of the <lb/>
House on the motion; but I am quite willing <lb/>
to abide by the decision of the Speaker. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">THE Hon.
THE SPEAKER</persName>—That the de<lb break="no"/>cision I have given may be well understood- <lb break="yes"/>
to remove all apprehension on the score of a <lb/>
          
            <cb/> 
          
 motion once negatived not being supposed
to <lb/>
be finally disposed of, I may say that we find <lb/>
this in the rules of the Imperial Parliament: <lb/>
" A question once carried or negatived can<lb break="no"/>not be brought forward again." <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FLIN1">HON. MR. FLINT</persName> said—Honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, I deeply regret that the amendment <lb/>
of my honorable friend could not have been <lb/>
placed before the House, in order to a more <lb/>
direct vote being elicited on the principle <lb/>
therein contained, that of the application of <lb/>
the elective principle to this House. It is <lb/>
true that the honorable member for Welling<lb break="no"/>ton embodied the same principle in the <lb/>
resolution which he brought before the <lb/>
House, and which was negatived. I confess <lb/>
I hardly expected, when I saw this amend<lb break="no"/>ment on the notice paper, that it would be <lb/>
allowed to be proceeded with. Still I was <lb/>
in hopes that the House would have borne <lb/>
with the honorable gentleman, and would <lb/>
have allowed his motion to be placed on the <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Journals</hi> of the House. Having
been sent <lb/>
here by a constituency which embraces about <lb/>
75,000 souls, upon the elective principle, I <lb/>
feel that I should but ill discharge my duty <lb/>
to that constituency, without having received <lb/>
from them their direct and positive instruc<lb break="no"/>tions to the contrary, were I to
stand up on <lb/>
the floor of this House and advocate the <lb/>
taking away from them of the privilege of <lb/>
the elective franchise which has been con<lb break="no"/>ceded to them by Parliament. If
this prin<lb break="no"/>ciple had not been granted, the position <lb/>
would be altogether changed; but having <lb/>
once granted to a people the
right of saying <lb/>
whom they will have to represent them in <lb/>
this Chamber, they ought also to be asked, <lb/>
before we are called upon to vote, whether <lb/>
they desire to give back the privilege into <lb/>
the hands of the Government. I would not <lb/>
for a moment think of placing them in so <lb/>
false a position. I cannot, therefore, look <lb/>
with favor upon that portion of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions which goes to take away from the people <lb/>
the right to nominate and select members to <lb/>
this Honorable House. So much has been <lb/>
said on this subject that it would be hardly <lb/>
worth while for me to consume the time of <lb/>
the House in going over the ground which <lb/>
so many others have gone over already. I <lb/>
have not heard, however, in all the speeches <lb/>
which have been made in advocacy of this <lb/>
measure, anything to cause me to swerve for <lb/>
a moment from the views I have always en<lb break="no"/>tertained after reading this portion of the <lb/>
resolutions. I may say that when I was <lb/>
           
            <pb n="319" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0319.jpg"/>

 elected, it is true that Federation was <lb/>
before the country, but it was before the <lb/>
country in a very different shape from what <lb/>
it is at the present time. After the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the day was defeated last session, <lb/>
and after arrangements had been entered <lb/>
into, it was understood by these arrange<lb break="no"/>ments that we were to have Federation of <lb/>
the two Canadas. That was all that was <lb/>
placed before us. In issuing my short <lb/>
address, I stated I was in favor of Feder<lb break="no"/>ation. I am so still—(hear)—but
while in <lb/>
favor of Confederation of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, I desire it should be carried out in <lb/>
such a way that it will conduce to the best <lb/>
interests of all concerned. I wish that no <lb/>
advantage may be taken by any one of the <lb/>
provinces over the others. When I
came <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> before my constituents for election, as
hon. <lb/>
gentlemen may be aware, I had no opposition <lb/>
—-—I was elected by acclamation. All I could <lb/>
say to the people on the measure was simply <lb/>
this, that I approved of the scheme marked <lb/>
out by the Government when the new ad<lb break="no"/>ministration was formed, but I knew nothing <lb/>
as to what had subsequently taken place. <lb/>
I told them that I was in favor of change<lb break="no"/>that I was in favor of a Federation of the <lb/>
two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, <lb/>
in order that we might live together in peace, <lb/>
as I was satisfied, from what we had witnessed <lb/>
as transpiring for many years,
that it was <lb/>
impossible to live longer together—that it <lb/>
was better to separate, and in separating we <lb/>
would probably be better friends. I also <lb/>
stated that the time must come when the <lb/>
Confederation of all the provinces would <lb/>
take place, and that if Confederation was <lb/>
formed upon a just basis, it
would no <lb/>
doubt be the means of a vast amount of good <lb/>
to our common country. (Hear, hear.) The <lb/>
first knowledge I had of
Confederation was, <lb/>
as a matter of course, when the delegates <lb/>
met and passed the resolutions which <lb/>
are now before us with a slight alter<lb break="no"/>ation or two of no moment. When
these <lb/>
resolutions were printed by the Government <lb/>
I received one from the Honorable the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary, marked "Private,"
and I <lb/>
also at the same time received a note from <lb/>
that honorable gentleman, stating that these <lb/>
resolutions were not then intended for the <lb/>
eye of the public. The consequence was, <lb/>
I felt that I could not read these resolutions, <lb/>
and meet my constituents and tell them that <lb/>
I knew nothing in reference to Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, Thus feeling my hands tied, I placed <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
 the resolutions in my desk, and left them
<lb/>
there; and never did examine them to ascer<lb break="no"/>tain what honorable gentlemen had done <lb/>
until I took my seat on the floor of the <lb/>
House. I could not feel free to place myself <lb/>
in a position before my constituents, and on <lb/>
being asked from time to time what were <lb/>
the prospects of Confederation and what <lb/>
were its details, give a truthful reply with <lb/>
the restrictions placed upon me, were I to <lb/>
have read the resolutions; and therefore I <lb/>
did not read the resolutions, so that I might <lb/>
honestly say I knew nothing about them. I <lb/>
feel, honorable gentlemen, that it would be <lb/>
impossible for me, under existing circum<lb break="no"/>stances, to vote away that right which has
<lb/>
been granted by the Constitution,
of our <lb/>
country to those who now have the privilege <lb/>
conferred upon them of exercising the <lb/>
elective franchise so far as regards this <lb/>
Chamber. I feel that I should do a great <lb/>
wrong and perpetrate a great injury to the <lb/>
electors who sent me here, were I
to vote for <lb/>
that portion of the scheme which contem<lb break="no"/>plates the taking away of their franchise <lb/>
altogether. I have no objection, as a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of course, to the life members, if they <lb/>
so desire it, voting away their rights, or of <lb/>
placing their seats in the hands of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment to be dealt with as they please; <lb/>
and so far as I am individually concerned, <lb/>
I would have no objection to sacrifice my <lb/>
seat in the House for the good of the country <lb/>
and of my constituents. They have sent me <lb/>
here, not because I was anxious to be placed <lb/>
in this position, however honorable it may <lb/>
be, but because I was their choice. And I<lb/>
must say that it was one of the proudest <lb/>
and happiest days of my life when found, <lb/>
after having battled politically for so many <lb/>
years on the side of reform, that I could go <lb/>
into a constituency embracing 75,000 souls, <lb/>
of all descriptions and shades of politics, and <lb/>
that I had so far given satisfaction that not <lb/>
a man was to be found who raised his voice <lb/>
against my re-election. (Hear, hear.) I <lb/>
have gained, I may say, all that I desire in <lb/>
the way of earthly honor; but I feel, like <lb/>
many other honorable gentlemen, that in <lb/>
being placed in this high and honorable <lb/>
position, it is my duty to act faithfully to<lb break="no"/>wards those who sent me here; and I feel I <lb/>
should do wrong if, on an occasion like this, <lb/>
I should give my vote for placing that portion <lb/>
of Upper Canada which I am sent to repre<lb break="no"/>sent in a worse position than they occupied <lb/>
before. Having made these few remarks <lb/>
          
            <pb n="320" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0320.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">320</fw>
          
 with reference to the elective principle,
I <lb/>
desire now to speak about one or two other <lb/>
things in connection with these resolutions. <lb/>
And one thing in particular, I find, has not <lb/>
been spoken of by any member on the floor <lb/>
of this House. I refer now to the sixth <lb/>
clause, with reference to education. Now, <lb/>
hon. gentlemen, it strikes me it was decidedly <lb/>
wrong on the part of the delegates to place <lb/>
anything in reference to the education of <lb/>
the people of Upper and Lower Canada in <lb/>
this scheme. I will give my reasons for <lb/>
it, and I think those reasons are good. I <lb/>
think it should be left fully and entirely to <lb/>
the people of Upper and Lower Canada to <lb/>
decide what is best with reference to this <lb/>
matter. We see already that both in Upper <lb/>
and Lower Canada both parties are actively <lb/>
engaged endeavoring to press upon the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of both Houses of Parliament the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of granting them greater privileges than <lb/>
they already enjoy. They seem to be deter<lb break="no"/>mined to have nothing less for their Catholic <lb/>
education than a full staff of ofiicers, together <lb/>
with model and normal schools, and all the <lb/>
paraphernalia which attach to the present <lb/>
common school system. That which in <lb/>
Upper Canada was regarded as a finality in <lb/>
school matters is now scouted at, and the advo<lb break="no"/>cates of separate schools go so far as to insist <lb/>
upon having a college; and the object is no <lb/>
doubt to place themselves in a position to <lb/>
be wholly independent of the proposed local <lb/>
government of Upper Canada. So far as I <lb/>
am individually concerned in reference to <lb/>
schools, I would far rather that the school <lb/>
system was worked out in both
provinces on <lb/>
the principle of the common schools. I see <lb/>
no reason why in any neighborhood a portion <lb/>
of the children should be sent to one de<lb break="no"/>scription of school, and a portion of the <lb/>
children sent to another description of <lb/>
school. I believe it is wrong in principle, <lb/>
and that the children of our common country <lb/>
should grow up together and be educated <lb/>
together. In our public schools there should <lb/>
be nothing taught which would have the <lb/>
effect of preventing any person from sending <lb/>
their children to them. These are my views <lb/>
in reference to schools. I believe that the <lb/>
effect of giving exclusive rights
and privi<lb break="no"/>leges to certain parties has had a tendency <lb/>
to weaken the good feeling which should <lb/>
subsist between all classes of the community, <lb/>
and which is now seen in the demand from <lb/>
both sections for different systems of educa<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear, hear.) The next thing to <lb/>
which I desire to call the attention of the <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
 House is that of the Intercolonial
Railway. <lb/>
I am opposed <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi> to that
great road. I <lb/>
am opposed to it for the best of all reasons. <lb/>
In the first place, I am not satisfied with it, <lb/>
because I do not know what it is going to <lb/>
cost. There is nothing in these resolutions <lb/>
to indicate what is to be the expense; nor <lb/>
have I been able to discover from what has <lb/>
taken place on the floor of the House, any <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">data</hi> on the subject.
Consequently, I do <lb/>
not feel that it would be my duty to vote <lb/>
for a measure which is going to entail upon <lb/>
Upper Canada a large amount of debt, with<lb break="no"/>out first knowing what that debt is to be. <lb/>
So far from this being regarded as a com<lb break="no"/>mercial undertaking, I cannot for the life of <lb/>
me see how it is possible that it can be <lb/>
worked commercially. The hon. member <lb/>
from Montreal (Hon. Mr. FERRIER), who <lb/>
spoke in his place the other evening, never <lb/>
touched upon this subject. All he told us <lb/>
in reference to this great scheme was simply <lb/>
this: that there were 100 odd cars lying at <lb/>
Montreal laden with produce, and that they <lb/>
could not go forward because on the other <lb/>
side of the lines they had so much to do that <lb/>
they could not send the cars through. But <lb/>
this was no argument at all in favor of the <lb/>
Intereolonial Railway. But
supposing the <lb/>
road were built, do hon. gentlemen believe <lb/>
for a moment that it would pay running <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> expenses? There is no doubt in my mind <lb/>
that to keep it open a subsidy would be <lb/>
required, like that which is paid to the ocean <lb/>
steamers. It was stated the other day by <lb/>
the hon. member from Montreal that two <lb/>
cents per ton per mile was a very small rate <lb/>
for railway carriage. But taking it at that <lb/>
figure, what do we find? From Toronto to <lb/>
the seaboard, over the Intercolonial Railway, <lb/>
the distance may be estimated at 939 miles, <lb/>
and to send a barrel of flour that distance by <lb/>
railway, at a cost of two cents per mile per <lb/>
ton, the charges on the flour
would be not <lb/>
less than $2.08. But supposing one-half <lb/>
this tariff were charged—one
cent per ton <lb/>
per mile—and we are told that at such a <lb/>
rate the road would be run at a loss, the <lb/>
cost would be $1.04 ; and by the
time the <lb/>
barrel of flour was laid down in Liverpool, <lb/>
there would be charges on it for carriage of <lb/>
eight or ten cents per each bushel of wheat <lb/>
over what was formerly paid. These figures <lb/>
are based on the authority of hon. gentlemen <lb/>
opposite. "Oh! but," say they, "the farmer <lb/>
gets the benefit of his money during the <lb/>
winter." I do not see that this is any <lb/>
argument at all in a commercial point of <lb/>
       
            <pb n="321" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0321.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">321</fw>
        
 view. We
have the advantage of getting <lb/>
the money in the winter, it is true, but how <lb/>
do we get it? By losing a large amount.
<lb/>
For my part, I do not believe in getting <lb/>
only 33. 9d. for a dollar's worth of produce. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) And I am satisfied
that <lb/>
when our farmers get to understand the <lb/>
question, they never will consent to be taxed <lb/>
for the construction of any such road. <lb/>
Taking the cost of transportation at two <lb/>
cents per ton per mile, and the
distance from <lb/>
Halifax to Belleville at 831 miles, we find it <lb/>
would cost $16.62 to transport a ton of goods <lb/>
between the two places. And at such figures, <lb/>
does any honorable gentleman who
has the <lb/>
slightest knowledge of commercial transac<lb break="no"/>tions believe for a moment that merchandise <lb/>
could be sent over the road at any such rates? <lb/>
Supposing you reduce the rate one cent, <lb/>
it would still cost $8.31, which
would pre<lb break="no"/>clude the possibility of carrying freight over <lb/>
the road; so that, in a commercial point of <lb/>
view, the road would be perfectly useless. <lb/>
It is true that under our present system of <lb/>
banking, our bankers endeavor to enforce on <lb/>
the purchasers of produce the necessity of <lb/>
immediate shipments and immediate sales, <lb/>
and with that view cause them to draw for <lb/>
their accommodation at short dates; but it <lb/>
is also true that by such a practice the far<lb break="no"/>mer is in every instance the loser. The <lb/>
reason of this custom is that the banks want <lb/>
quicker returns. But I contend that the <lb/>
banks should be prepared to advance money <lb/>
at such dates as will enable the producer to <lb/>
so sell his produce as to get from it a remu<lb break="no"/>nerative return for his labor.
But this it <lb/>
not done. It seems that the tendency of <lb/>
everything is to force freight down the rail<lb break="no"/>ways during the winter season, and to this <lb/>
end money is advanced at short dates, the <lb/>
farmer being the chief loser by the transac<lb break="no"/>tion. Then the Intercolonial Railway is <lb/>
advocated as a military necessity. It is said
<lb/>
that it is essential for the
defence of the <lb/>
country, to enable the transportation
of troops <lb/>
and military stores. I think, hon. gentlemen, <lb/>
we have only to look across the
lines and see <lb/>
what has taken place during the war in the <lb/>
State of Virginia and in other states, to <lb/>
convince us at once that for the purpose of <lb/>
moving troops and heavy supplies, such as <lb/>
artillery and ammunition, these roads are of <lb/>
very little use. You will find that they <lb/>
have been cut in almost every direction, <lb/>
and the facilities they were supposed to <lb/>
possess for transportation have
been proved <lb/>
to be well nigh worthless for any practical <lb/>
42 <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
       
purpose,—and that, too, in a country
where <lb/>
they are able in a short time to rebuild any
<lb/>
portions of the roads which may be destroyed. <lb/>
But how would it he on the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway? That road is intended
to run <lb/>
through a country near the boundary of the <lb/>
State of Maine, over which troops could be <lb/>
distributed at given points so as, in case of <lb/>
necessity, to break up the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way in every direction and to prevent the <lb/>
transportation of troops and munitions of <lb/>
war during the winter. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">AN HON. MEMBER</persName>—They would be <lb/>
unable to reach it so as to cut it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FLIN1">HON. MR. FLINT</persName>—That
is a very curious <lb/>
idea: " They cannot reach it." I look
upon <lb/>
the Americans as a class of persons who can <lb/>
cut their way wherever they wish to go. <lb/>
Nothing would be easier than for them to <lb/>
cut the Intercolonial Railway. But if it <lb/>
were really the case that the country to be <lb/>
traversed by the Intercolonial Railway is of <lb/>
such a nature that no one could get through <lb/>
to it, the sooner we cease saying anything <lb/>
further about it the better. (Hear.) For <lb/>
if the country is in such a state that it is <lb/>
impossible for men to travel through it, I see <lb/>
no benefit in having such a railway. (Hear. <lb/>
hear.) These are my views in reference to <lb/>
the railway. In the first place I do not feel <lb/>
inclined to pay the large sum of money it is <lb/>
going to cost, without knowing
how much <lb/>
will be required. There is no knowing how <lb/>
much it will cost Upper Canada for her pro<lb break="no"/>portion—whether it is to be $12,000,000, <lb/>
$15,000,000, or $20,000,000. But taking <lb/>
into consideration the amount of debt we <lb/>
will have to assume, together with our appor<lb break="no"/>tionment of the $62,500,000 assigned to <lb/>
Upper and Lower Canada. as also that por<lb break="no"/>tion yet unprovided for by the resolutions; <lb/>
I think that by the time the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway is built, Upper
Canada will be <lb/>
saddled with at least $50,000,000 as her <lb/>
share of debt. I do not see how it is pos<lb break="no"/>sible for the people to bear up under such a <lb/>
weight; nor do I believe that, if the under<lb break="no"/>stood this matter as they ought to understand <lb/>
it, they would give their consent to us to <lb/>
vote for it. It may be thought, perhaps, that <lb/>
I am not in favor of Confederation. But such <lb/>
is not the case. I would much desire the <lb/>
Federation of all the provinces; but while <lb/>
I would desire the Federation of
all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, I do desire that that Federation <lb/>
should be based on true and proper princi<lb break="no"/>ples--that every portion of these
provinces <lb/>
of Her Majesty's dominion should
share and <lb/>
        
            <pb n="322" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0322.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">322</fw>
       
 share alike. I do not believe in one
portion <lb/>
of the provinces being placed in a position of <lb/>
inferiority to the others. I believe Upper <lb/>
Canada should have its just rights—I
be<lb break="no"/>lieve Lower Canada should have its just <lb/>
rights-and I believe that the other provin<lb break="no"/>ces should have their just rights. We should <lb/>
come together not with a feeling of distrust, <lb/>
but with a feeling of mutual good will, ready <lb/>
to take each other by the hand and to press <lb/>
forward to what I would hope might prove <lb/>
an honorable destiny. (Hear, hear.) I am <lb/>
well satisfied that the more this question is <lb/>
discussed—notwithstanding the remarks of <lb/>
some hon. gentlemen to the contrary—the <lb/>
more the question is discussed and ventilat<lb break="no"/>ed, the greater will be the dissatisfaction of <lb/>
the people with it. I have received but one <lb/>
letter from my constituents on the point, and <lb/>
the simple reference of that writer is this: <lb/>
"Do not you vote for the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way" He says, " I should like
Federation; <lb/>
but do not vote for the
Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way." But, hon. gentlemen, whether I had <lb/>
received such an admonition or not, I could <lb/>
not see my way clear to vote for the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions as they now stand. I have paid all <lb/>
possible attention to the speeches which have <lb/>
been delivered in this chamber. I have list<lb break="no"/>ened with every degree of respectful
attention <lb/>
to the hon. and gallant Knight who leads the <lb/>
Government, and also to his hon.
colleague <lb/>
the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and I <lb/>
should be happy if it were in my power to <lb/>
go with them in the vote which is about to <lb/>
be cast; but I do not see how that is possible, <lb/>
if I am at the same time to discharge my duty <lb/>
to my constituents, to myself, and to my coun<lb break="no"/>try. I can never consent to vote away the <lb/>
rights which belong to the people, without first <lb/>
asking the people for their consent. If the <lb/>
time is given them necessary to make up <lb/>
their minds on this subject, and they then <lb/>
say to this House: "We are willing to try <lb/>
this scheme—we are willing to take it with <lb/>
all its defects, in the hope that it will be <lb/>
found to work well," I will give my vote for <lb/>
it as it now stands. But, in the absence of <lb/>
this opportunity being afl'orded, I must say <lb/>
that if I am in the House when the vote is <lb/>
called on this measure, I shall have to record <lb/>
my name against it, and in so doing I shall <lb/>
be acting conscientiously. I shall do so be<lb break="no"/>cause I think it a duty incumbent
on me, <lb/>
however painful it may be for me to vote <lb/>
contrary to the views of the Government in <lb/>
this respect, and contrary to a large majority <lb/>
of this House. And while I would concede <lb/>
      
            <cb/>

 to every hon. gentleman who may differ
from <lb/>
me the same freedom of judgment that I <lb/>
claim for myself—while I would look with <lb/>
all charity on the course thought proper to <lb/>
be taken by my fellow members, I feel per<lb break="no"/>suaded that they will not begrudge me the <lb/>
right of discharging my duty in accordance <lb/>
with the dictates of my conscience, and what <lb/>
I believe to be for the good of my consti<lb break="no"/>tuents. And if my constituents do not agree <lb/>
with me in what I am about to do, they have <lb/>
only to say, " Mr. FLINT, your conduct does <lb/>
not accord with our views; we desire that <lb/>
you should retire from public life,"
and I <lb/>
shall be most happy to conform to their <lb/>
wishes. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DEBE1">HON. MR. DE BEAUJEU</persName> said—Honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen, I think it an act of patriotism <lb/>
to support the resolutions submitted to us, <lb/>
having for their object the Confederation of <lb/>
several provinces, so as to bring them into a <lb/>
group, with the view of forming a nationality. <lb/>
This project will not surprise any one, when <lb/>
he recollects that this immense territory is <lb/>
occupied by the descendants of the two first. <lb/>
powers of the world, and that the greatest <lb/>
portion of them are of Norman and Breton <lb/>
blood. They will also remember that the <lb/>
Normans were the most adventurous pioneers, <lb/>
fit for all hazardous colonizations, and daring <lb/>
navigators. After having established their <lb/>
dominion over the British Islands, and over <lb/>
a part of France, Naples, Sicily, even in <lb/>
Jerusalem, Antioch, and near Constantinople, <lb/>
they crossed the ocean and established them<lb break="no"/>selves on the Canary Islands, and afterwards <lb/>
came close on the borders of the Saint Law<lb break="no"/>rence and the Mississippi—a voyage that <lb/>
their ancestors had commenced in the environs <lb/>
of Novgorod, and where a nucleus of their <lb/>
race is yet to be found. The French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian countrymen of this Honorable House <lb/>
ought more than others to be proud of the <lb/>
scheme, and it oughtto brin to their memory <lb/>
that France had once this object
in view, but <lb/>
even on a larger scale (having then a territory <lb/>
of 1,800 leagues), and of making on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent a second to herself by calling it <hi rendition="simple:italic">La <lb/>
Nouvelle France</hi>. She was then seconded in <lb/>
this great undertaking by her best
military  <lb/>
and civil administrators. Among the fore-</p>
            <p>most was the Count DE FRONTENAC, and the <lb/>
Marquis of DENONVILLE, and LA GALISSON<lb break="no"/>NIÈRE, and also the celebrated Intendant <lb/>
TALON. The French Government was then ' <lb/>
laboring under the same dificulty of seeking ' <lb/>
for an open sea-port in winter, so as to
avoid <lb/>
being shut up by the ice during
five months <lb/>

 of the year, having their powerful
neighbors, <lb/>
as we have now, to contend with. The Che<lb break="no"/>valier D'IBERVILLE, one of the brave sons of <lb/>
Montreal, the equal, as it is admitted by the <lb/>
best navy historians, of the celebrated JEAN <lb/>
BART, after having made, in
1695, two glori<lb break="no"/>ous expeditions to the Hudson Bay, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, and to some of the other present Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces, wrote a <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mémoire</hi>, in 1701, on <lb/>
the situation of Boston and New York and <lb/>
other coasts of the then British colonies, <lb/>
pointing out the necessity of possessing a sea<lb break="no"/>port during winter. Well, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, this now may be effected without shed<lb break="no"/>ding of blood or money, only by securing the <lb/>
Confederation as agreed at the Convention by <lb/>
the most distinguished parties <hi rendition="simple:italic">contractantes</hi> <lb/>
of these British Provinces, in extending the <lb/>
present railroad from Rivière du
Loup to the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Maritime Provinces, so as to connect in
winter <lb/>
the most remote parts of Western Canada to <lb/>
the sea. The advantages to be derived from <lb/>
the annexation of these Maritime Provinces <lb/>
have been most ably developed at the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of this debate by the brilliant speech and <lb/>
sound logic of the gallant Premier, and also <lb/>
by other able speeches in support of those <lb/>
resolutions. I will,
nevertheless, add that the <lb/>
Province of Canada will also derive the im<lb break="no"/>mense advantage of beginning the nucleus of <lb/>
our future military being, particularly if you <lb/>
get the great assistance of the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that we are entitled to. Let us all <lb/>
recollect that France commenced her Canadian <lb/>
being by sending divers companies of troops <lb/>
by rotation to the present Maritime Provinces, <lb/>
and also to Louisiana. Those companies were <lb/>
commanded by officers who held
the rank of <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">capitaines des détachements de la marine</hi>,
equal <lb/>
in rank to a lieutenant-colonel in the army. <lb/>
Those companies were in the habit of being <lb/>
trained for navy purposes. I entertain no <lb/>
doubt that the frequent intercourse with those <lb/>
Maritime Provinces, coupled with the navy <lb/>
ship school that the Imperial
Government, as <lb/>
I understand, has the intention of establishing <lb/>
at Quebec, similar to those in England and <lb/>
France, will promote this object; and especially <lb/>
if England open the door of her academies of <lb/>
Woolwich and Sandhurst to our youths, as <lb/>
France was in the habit of doing when pos<lb break="no"/>sessed of these colonies—in admitting, as <lb/>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">cadets de marine</hi>, at Brest
and Rochefort, the <lb/>
sons of those colonists who, as military and <lb/>
civilian administrators, had deserved such a <lb/>
reward—and, by so doing, they formed a good <lb/>
colonial navy, and it was from it sprang <lb/>
up those able and brave oficers—the glory of <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
   
the past history of the French Canadians;
<lb/>
and the honor that the had so acquired re<lb break="no"/>flected also over Old France. Amongst the <lb/>
great number whose memory ought not to be <lb/>forgotten, not only by the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, but also by the Maritime Provinces, at <lb/>
the birth and development of a new nation, <lb/>
and to the defence of which those men have <lb/>
contributed by their intelligence and courage, <lb/>
I will name, amongst others, BONAVENTURE,
<lb/>
SÉVIGNY, CHATEAUGUAY, D'ALLIGNY,
TIL<lb break="no"/>LY, GRANVILLE, SOULANGES, VAUDREUIL, <lb/>
BEAUHARNOIS, LONGEUIL, REPENTIGNY, <lb/>BOISHÉRBERT, ST. OURS, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.; and many <lb/>
of those distinguished navy oflicers became <lb/>
governors not only in the French colonies of <lb/>
America and lndia, but commanded also sea<lb break="no"/>ports in France. BENOIT, CHAUSSEGROS DE <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>LÉRY, the two VAUDREUILS, and PIERRE<lb/>
BEDOUT rose to the rank of Rear Admiral, <lb/>
and one of them, ROUER DE LA
CORDON<lb break="no"/>NIÈRE, was even complimented by Fox in the <lb/>
English Parliament, for his generous and gal<lb break="no"/>lant conduct towards his enemies. Now, hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, besides the establishment of <lb/>
the colonial navy, we should also promote the <lb/>
military organization and martial spirit, the <lb/>
natural accompaniment and the best safe<lb break="no"/>guard of freedom, by assuming part of the <lb/>
military defences of this colony, proportioned <lb/>
to our population and revenues, of course <lb/>
with the effective assistance of the Imperial <lb/>
Government. And I hope that England will <lb/>
call out, to exercise the highest functions of <lb/>
statesmanship, such of her subjects in those <lb/>
colonies as will render themselves fit to fill <lb/>
such situations in future. Why should she <lb/>
not even employ them in the diplomatic ser<lb break="no"/>vice, or as governors of her other colonies, as <lb/>
France did formerly, in granting those favors <lb/>
for eminent services? And in spite of the <lb/>
intrigues of those near the <hi rendition="simple:italic">soleil levant</hi> at <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ver<lb break="no"/>sailles</hi>, the daring exploits of those brave col<lb break="no"/>onists, in that glorious struggle from 1698 to <lb/>
1759, forced the French monarch to do them <lb/>
ample justice, and by so doing the most of <lb/>
the military commands and governorships <lb/>
of the French colonies fell into the hands of <lb/>
Canadian born subjects. 1 have said so much <lb/>
to show that the policy of England ought to <lb/>
have been directed to promote, in these colonies, <lb/>
the appointments in the civil as well as in the <lb/>
military career to her colonial subjects, as <lb/>
well as those living in the British Isles.<lb break="no"/>(Hear, hear.) Referring again to
the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces, I will say to my French Can<lb break="no"/>adian countrymen that they have too many <lb/>
glorious pages in the past history of America, <lb/>

 and particularly in relation to these
provinces, <lb/>
not to feel a sympathy towards them, as there <lb/>
still exist a large number of the old Acadians <lb/>
who will feel proud to renew old acquaint<lb break="no"/>ance, and to live with them as brothers, <lb/>
happy under the protection of the English <lb/>
Government. Let me call to their memory <lb/>
some of the places which were the theatre of <lb/>
the exploits of the brave officers I have al- <lb break="yes"/>
read mentioned, such as Port Royal, or <lb/>
Louisbourg, now Annapolis; Chebucto, now <lb/>
Halifax; Port Lajoie, now Charlottetown; <lb/>
L'Isle Royale, now Cape Breton; Isle St. <lb/>
Jean, now Prince Edward Island, &amp;c., &amp;c. I <lb/>
hope, also, that the construction of a good <lb/>
route to Rivière Rouge, the Rocky Moun<lb break="no"/>tains and British Columbia, will bring those <lb/>
places to an easy access for
commerce, trading<lb/>
and agriculture, to our growing population, and <lb/>
will prevent them emigrating to the United <lb/>
States, as they will find glorious <hi rendition="simple:italic">souvenirs</hi>
<lb/>
in the former places, where their Canadian <lb/>
brothers have already formed flourishing agri<lb break="no"/>cultural settlements, and opened up valuable <lb/>
mines. I trust that my French Canadian <lb/>
countrymen in this House will see the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of adopting the resolutions now laid be<lb break="no"/>fore them, trusting as they should do to the <lb/>
good disposition of the Home Government, as <lb/>
this new Constitution is well calculated to <lb/>
develope the resources of this fine and immense <lb/>
country. And the best proof that we are <lb/>
taking the right steps to secure our happiness, <lb/>
is found amongst other articles hostile to Brit<lb break="no"/>ish interests, in an article of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Courrier
des <lb/>
 Etats Unis</hi>, when the question
of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion was agitated in 1853, and which runs as <lb/>
follows:-<lb/>
            </p>

           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Notwithstanding
all that may be said, written <lb/>
or spouted about English tyranny and rapacity, <lb/>
we must acknowledge that Great Britain has

            <p> Should this great project be adopted, our im<lb break="no"/>portance would rise on the continent of <lb/>
Europe, and we would be on the same footing <lb/>
at least as our American neighbors, belonging <lb/>

our credit will rise in consequence. The <lb/>
Lower Canadians will recollect that in 1840, <lb/>
after the temporary suspension of the Act of <lb/>

in <lb/>
1763, have not been abrogated, and I am of <lb/>

our future rights are as safe as they were for<lb break="no"/>merly. (Hear, hear.) Before I close I will <lb/>
answer the remarks made by the honorable <lb/>
member for Lanaudière division, in a speech a <lb/>
few days ago, respecting the Monroe doctrine, <lb/>
alleging that we ought not to legislate upon <lb/>
this delicate subject, or words to that effect. <lb/>
I will quote two letters lately discovered and <lb/>
published by Monsieur PIERRE MERGOZ, <lb/>
Guardian of Archives of the Ministry of the <lb/>
Foreign Affairs in France, and his remarks on <lb/>
these two great honored navigators who dis<lb break="no"/>covered the Mississippi and other parts of <lb/>
America, and which remarks are as follow:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">We cannot shut our eyes to the affinity of
the <lb/>
interests of the present times and those of former <lb/>
days, and which recommend the memory of LA<lb break="no"/>SALLE and D'IBERVILLE. In 1699 D"IBERVILLE <lb/>
wrote on the subject of Louisiana: "If France <lb/>
does not take possession of this part of America, <lb/>
which is the finest, to have a colony strong <lb/>
enough to resist those that England possesses in <lb/>
the east from Pescadoue to the Caroline, these <lb/>
colonies, which are becoming very extensive, will <lb/>
increase to such an extent that in less than a cen<lb break="no"/>tury they will be strong enough to seize upon <lb/>
the whole continent of America, and to expel all <lb/>
other nations " D'IBERVILLE wrote again in <lb/>
November, 1702: "What may be said against <lb/>
the establishment that the king has made at Mo<lb break="no"/>bile?  It is the only one that
could sustain Ame<lb break="no"/>rica against the undertakings of the English on <lb/>
this continent. In a few years they will be able <lb/>
to forward in fifteen days, by means of their large <lb/>
navy, more than 20,000 or 30,000 men upon <lb/>
such of the French islands as they would be in<lb break="no"/>clined to attack, the distance not being, at the <lb/>
utmost, more than 500 to 600 leagues, the wind <lb/>
being generally favorable to carry them on those <lb/>
shores, and by land they may reach Mexico."
<lb/>
"These views (says Mr. MERGOZ),
together with <lb/>
D'IBERVILLE's remarks, will
account for the na<lb break="no"/>tural uneasiness felt by the European powers at <lb/>
what is now taking place in South America." <lb/>

            <p> What I have just quoted is, I believe,
suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to convince the honorable member for <lb/>
the Lanaudière Division that the European <lb/>
Powers were not disposed, even
at those <lb/>
remote times, to favor the doctrine now called <lb/>
the Monroe; the British colonists of these <lb/>
times being now replaced by our republican
<lb/>
neighbors. Having said so much, I will con<lb break="no"/>clude by stating that I shall

            <p> <persName ref="pers:HAMI2">HON. MR. HAMILTON</persName> (Inkerman)<lb break="no"/>Honorable gentlemen, so much as been said <lb/>
during the course of the present debate with <lb/>
reference to the elected members of this House,

and the rights of the electors who sent
us here, <lb/>
that I desire to make a very few remarks to <lb/>
explain why I, representing a Lower Canadian <lb/>
division, a majority of whom will be amongst <lb/>
the minority of the Lower Canada of the <lb/>
future, have decided that it is my duty to vote <lb/>
for the resolutions of the Quebec Conference <lb/>
as they have been laid before us by the <lb/>
Government, and consequently against all the <lb/>
amendments. I am free to confess, honorable <lb/>
gentlemen, that there are among
the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions some that I would have gladly seen, as I <lb/>
conceive, amended; but considering, from the <lb/>
nature of the thing itself, and therefore fully <lb/>
concurring in what many of as heard from an <lb/>
eminent and distinguished statesman in another <lb/>
place, that the whole scheme of Confederation <lb/>
partook of the nature of a treaty, into which, <lb/>
as a matter of course, the spirit of compromise <lb/>
must largely enter; and the Government hav<lb break="no"/>ing, as I also consider they were bound to do, <lb/>
informed us we must accept the scheme as a <lb/>
whole, or reject it as a whole, I conceived it <lb/>
was my duty not to be a bar in the way, <lb/>
however humble, of the passage of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, and I came to this conclusion the more <lb/>
willingly because I have been for a long time <lb/>
an advocate for a union of the provinces, and <lb/>
I have been so because it is indisputable that <lb/>
a much greater share of our
self-defence must <lb/>
rest upon ourselves than
heretofore; and <lb/>
though at the best our means of defence may <lb/>
not be as great as we could wish, yet it must <lb/>
be manifest they must be greater by being <lb/>
consolidated under one head. Some hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, especially my neighbor from St. Clair, <lb/>
have ridiculed the idea of Confederation in<lb break="no"/>creasing our powers of defence, inasmuch as <lb/>
under the best of circumstances it must take a <lb/>
long time to perfect our arrangements; but I <lb/>
would ask hon. gentlemen to consider what <lb/>
will be the effect in England,
as to our defences, <lb/>
if we reject or even postpone this scheme of <lb/>
Confederation, coming as it would on the <lb/>
heels of a rejected Militia Bill. During the <lb/>
discussion, we have had, if the
term is par<lb break="no"/>liamentary and may be used, many fancy finance <lb/>
statements. Now, without
disputing the cor<lb break="no"/>rectness of any of them, I would ask the <lb/>
honorable gentlemen who have made them, <lb/>
have they made any calculation as to the costs <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>we would be at after we had been gobbled
up <lb/>
by our neighbors south of 45°, or, to use the <lb/>
words of the honorable and gallant Knight the <lb/>
Premier, after we had slid down the inclined <lb/>
plane, and become merged in the
neighboring <lb/>
republic? I for one would say that such a<lb/>
position was altogether too
oontemptible to <lb/>
           
            <cb/>   
       
occupy. With reference to the change
doing <lb/>
away with our elective Legislative Council, of <lb/>
which we have heard so much, I for one can <lb/>
say that I consider the delegates came to <lb/>
the only correct conclusion, and this is no new <lb/>
conclusion, and involves no change of opinion <lb/>
on my part, for I can appeal to an honorable <lb/>
member of this House as to whether, within <lb/>
half an hour of taking my seat in it, I did <lb/>
not express the opinion that though it was not <lb/>
right to speak ill of the bridge over which one <lb/>
had crossed safely, yet that I was
opposed to <lb/>
the elective system as applied to this House. <lb/>
I also dissent from the sentiments I have heard <lb/>
expressed by many honorable members of this <lb/>
House as to our position here, for I never <lb/>
understood that I came here as the mere <lb/>
delegate of the men of Inkerman, to vote just <lb/>
as the most active village politicians happened <lb/>
to pull the wires for me. No, gentlemen, I <lb/>
came here, as I thought, as the representative <lb/>
of my division, to do my best according to <lb/>
my humble ability in legislating for the <lb/>
benefit of the whole country, and
under no <lb/>
other circumstances would I have accepted <lb/>
the position. I shall not occupy your time, <lb/>
honorable gentlemen, in saying that which has <lb/>
been better said by others; but thanking you <lb/>
for the few moments' hearing you have so <lb/>
kindly given me, conclude by reducing my <lb/>
explanations as follows: I vote for Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation because I consider it essential to the <lb/>
maintenance of British connection, and to <lb/>
preserve that, I for one am prepared to make <lb/>
man sacrifices. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BLAK2">HON. MR. BLAKE</persName>—I feel it to be my <lb/>
duty, honorable gentlemen, to make a few <lb/>
remarks upon the general question of Federa<lb break="no"/>tion before the vote is taken. A great deal <lb/>
has been said about the manner in which the <lb/>
scheme has originated. It has been said that <lb/>
the honorable gentlemen composing the Con<lb break="no"/>ference were self-elected. Now I hold that <lb/>
it is most unfair to charge honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have, as members of a government, <lb/>
entered into this matter at the request of His <lb/>
Excellency the Governor-General, with a sin<lb break="no"/>cere desire to do the best that could be done <lb/>
for the interests of Canada, with being too <lb/>
precipitate, especially when the subject was <lb/>
surrounded with so much difficulty. Although <lb/>
I have been an advocate of a union of the <lb/>
provinces for very many years, yet I am fully <lb/>
prepared to admit that there are some matters <lb/>
of detail in these resolutions that are very <lb/>
distasteful to me. I refer particularly to the <lb/>
abandonment of the elective principle in the <lb/>
constitution of this branch of the Legislature. <lb/>
     
            <pb n="326" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0326.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">326</fw>
     
I was always in favor of the elective
principle <lb/>
as applied to the Legislative Council, and a <lb/>
very large proportion of my constituency is <lb/>
also in favor of it.  I am opposed to
the build<lb break="no"/>ing of the Intercolonial Railway, on account <lb/>
of the immense expenditure which it will <lb/>
entail upon the country, not only now, but <lb/>
for all time to come. I think that that <lb/>
expenditure will be so great that it will fall <lb/>
very heavily on our finances, which are now <lb/>
so very poorly able to bear the burden, and <lb/>
that the road will be of very little
use to the <lb/>
country. Much has been said about this <lb/>
scheme not being understood by the people. <lb/>
With regard to that, I can only speak of my <lb/>
own locality. Before coming here, I went <lb/>
through my own constituency, and conversed <lb/>
with a great many leading men of all political <lb/>
parties, and all urged me to go for Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, without a single exception. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) I pointed out the objections which I <lb/>
had to the scheme. I told them that I dis<lb break="no"/>approved of the elective
principle being ignor<lb break="no"/>ed—of the building of the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway—and of the increased expense of <lb/>
maintaining two sets of government. I pointed <lb/>
out all these and other objections, but not<lb break="no"/>withstanding, they said that it would be far <lb/>
better to take Federation, even as proposed by <lb/>
the resolutions, than to remain as we are. <lb/>
They said: " The government of the country <lb/>
has come to a dead-lock; we have seen
one strong <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> party pitted against another strong
party; we <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>have seen two or three governments formed <lb/>
that were unable to pass a single important <lb/>
measure, and some change is therefore abso<lb break="no"/>lutely necessary." The question then arises, <lb/>
What are we to do ? Now, I would ask the <lb/>
opponents of this scheme, if they have any <lb/>
other plan to propose that will relieve the <lb/>
country of the difficulties under
which it has <lb/>
been laboring? (Hear, hear.) On the other <lb/>
hand, we have been told by high authority <lb/>
that we were on the brink of ruin. We were <lb/>
told by the honorable and gallant Knight at <lb/>
the head of the Government, that we were on <lb/>
an " inclined plane," on which we were fast <lb/>
sliding into the republic of the United States <lb/>
of America. I think it is therefore my duty <lb/>
to vote for the resolutions as they stand, and <lb/>
to vote for no amendments of any kind. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) We are told that if
we adopt <lb/>
any amendments to the resolutions, the whole <lb/>
scheme must fall to the ground. Are we to <lb/>
go back to the position we formerly occupied, <lb/>
or will it not be better to accept these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, on which a new Constitution may be <lb/>
formed ? If it is not formed to suit us, we <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
      
 can alter it hereafter. It is not, I apprehend, <lb/>
to be like the laws of the Medea and Persians,
<lb/>
totally unalterable. The Constitutions of <lb/>
Great Britain, of the United States, and of <lb/>
the different civilized nations now in existence <lb/>
have been altered, and why are we to expect <lb/>
that these resolutions are a finalit ? Gentle<lb break="no"/>men, the Constitution of the Confederation <lb/>
can be altered in future as easily as our <lb/>
present Constitution has been altered. I hope <lb/>
this scheme will go into effect at an early <lb/>
period, and I trust it will be productive of a <lb/>
vast amount of good to our country. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Honorable gentlemen say it is a <lb/>
revolution. It may be a revolution, but <lb/>
certainly it is not so violent a one as was <lb/>
proposed in 1837 and 1838. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
There has been a great deal of heavy artillery <lb/>
brought into play since this debate began, but <lb/>
I hope that the revolution will be carried out <lb/>
without the shedding of blood. (Hear, hear <lb/>
and laughter.) I am prepared to give my <lb/>
vote for the scheme. (Cheers) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:READ1">HON. MR READ</persName> next addressed the <lb/>
House. He said—Honorable gentlemen, I <lb/>
have voted for delay in the passage of these <lb/>
resolutions, believing that to be my duty; and <lb/>
if I have been wrong in doing so, it has been <lb/>
through want of judgement. I have
had no <lb/>
other intention in so doing than to promote <lb/>
the best interests of the country. As,
how<lb break="no"/>ever, I observe that a large majority of this <lb/>
House entertains a different opinion, I shall <lb/>
no longer attempt to mar the scheme, but <lb/>
shall give it my support when the time for <lb/>
voting upon it arrives. (Hear, hear, and <lb/>
cheers.) I never intended to mar it, but I <lb/>
wished to be sure that the country was satis<lb/>fied with it, and would appreciate it when <lb/>
they got it. (Hear.) I think human nature <lb/>
is the same now as it always was and always <lb/>
will be. As the hon. Premier and the hon. <lb/>
Commissioner of Crown Lands have used <lb/>
some comparisons with reference to the pro<lb break="no"/>posed union, I have also a comparison to <lb/>
make. They said that a union could not be <lb/>
effected without some sacrifices—a little giving
<lb/>
and taking all round. I think so too, but I <lb/>
think there is a different way in which this <lb/>
proposed union must be viewed. I compare <lb/>
Canada to a young man who has had guar<lb break="no"/>dians appointed to take care of his estate; <lb/>
but having arrived at that age
that his guar<lb break="no"/>dians think it is time he should be married, <lb/>
they arrange a matrimonial alliance for him. <lb/>
He is all the time looking on, and expecting <lb/>
to be asked how the arrangement suits him. <lb/>
But in this case it appears he is not to be <lb/>
         
            <pb n="327" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0327.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">327</fw>
      
 asked at all.
(Hear, hear.) When they have <lb/>
all things in readiness, he says to himself: <lb/>
"You may have power to marry me, but you <lb/>
cannot make me live happily." Now, had he <lb/>
been consulted, he would probably have made <lb/>
the same choice and have been fully satisfied <lb/>
with the alliance. As human nature is always <lb/>
the same, I have thought these were sufficiently <lb/>
strong reasons for wishing to have some delay, <lb/>
in order that the people, after the matter was <lb/>
fully before them, might cordially enter into <lb/>
the proposed union. I am favorably
impressed <lb/>
with a great many of the resolutions compos<lb break="no"/>ing this measure. I cannot, however, agree<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> with my hon. friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Ross), that Upper Canada would
build the <lb/>
Intercolonial Railway herself rather than be <lb/>
without it. Upper Canada does
not produce <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>anything that can be profitably taken over <lb/>
the road. There is no alternative, however, <lb/>
but to build it, if Confederation is to be <lb/>
carried out. In 1862, we had a good bargain <lb/>
thrown open to us, but as we refused to accept <lb/>
it at the time, we cannot now get it without <lb/>
paying a higher price. Along with the ma<lb break="no"/>trimonial alliance into which we are about to <lb/>
enter, there will be fresh responsibilities, and <lb/>
I really do not think the country is quite <lb/>
prepared for them. (Hear, hear, and laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) It seems we are pretty certain to form <lb/>
the alliance, and it is equally certain that <lb/>
those little responsibilities will immediately <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>spring up. (Laughter.) I think, however, <lb/>
that we must call them great
responsibilities, <lb/>
and I repeat, much greater than we are pre<lb break="no"/>pared for. I would make a great sacrifice
for <lb/>
the defence of the country, but if England <lb/>
tells us we must do more than the country is <lb/>
able to do, I do not think we will be willing <lb/>
to submit to it. We are prepared to do all <lb/>
we can, but I am not prepared to go to such <lb/>
an enormous expense as to involve our country <lb/>
in such debt as will render it an undesirable <lb/>
place to live in. With Confederation we will <lb/>
have to go to great expense, not only for our <lb/>
defences and our militia, but also for a navy; <lb/>
because I believe that, as soon as the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans put an increased number of gun-boats <lb/>
on the lakes, we will have to put on an equal <lb/>
number, and it is very doubtful to me if we <lb/>
can afford it. (Hear, hear.) Where is the <lb/>
money to come from ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. Mr. CURRIE</persName>—Yes—where is the <lb/>
money to come from? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:READ1">HON. Mr. READ</persName>—We are now very <lb/>
heavily taxed, and have a heavy bill to pay <lb/>
for interest on our large debt. I would like <lb/>
to see the Government adopt some method by <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          
 which this interest should not go out of
the <lb/>
country. I do not like to see so much bor<lb break="no"/>rowed from abroad. Interest is a thing that <lb/>
accumulates very rapidly, and it has to be <lb/>
paid regularly. If some system could be de<lb break="no"/>vised by which this borrowing from abroad <lb/>
could be stopped, the Federation scheme would <lb/>
suit me much better, especially when we con<lb break="no"/>sider that the taxes of the people of this <lb/>
country, per head, have been running up at <lb/>
an alarming rate—from one dollar to three<lb break="no"/>since the union, in 1841. It seems that the <lb/>
Confederation is to increase our taxes; that <lb/>
fact is generally admitted, independent of the <lb/>
ex use of building the Intercolonial Railway. <lb/>
I do not see where all the money is to come <lb/>
from, but I dare say the Finance Minister <lb/>
will find out some means of raising it by in<lb break="no"/>creased taxation. When the final vote comes <lb/>
on, I shall be prepared to support the motion <lb/>
rather than have it rejected
altogether, and <lb/>
shall press my opposition no
further. (Hear, <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">THE HON. THE SPEAKER</persName>—The motion <lb/>
proposed in amendment to the main motion <lb/>
by Hon. Mr. CURRIE was in the following <lb/>
words :—"That in a matter of such great im<lb break="no"/>portance as the proposed Confederation of this <lb/>

" That His Excellency the Governor General <lb/>

may be <lb/>
quite a different thing from the manifestation <lb/>
of that will by a direct vote, as provided for <lb/>

this kind it is my opinion that a liberal in<lb break="no"/>terpretation of the rules and practice of the <lb/>

taken a most extraordinary turn. At first, <lb/>
honorable members addressed the House in <lb/>
favor of the resolutions—members
of the <lb/>
Government more especially, and then some <lb/>
honorable gentlemen supporting them; but <lb/>
latterly we have heard several
honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen expressing their views very strongly and <lb/>
emphatically against many of the resolutions <lb/>
embraced in the scheme of Confederation, but <lb/>
while expressing themselves so strongly, they <lb/>
seemed to feel it to be their duty to support <lb/>
it as a whole. (Hear, hear.)
Now, it strikes <lb/>
me, and I trust it will strike some other hon<lb break="no"/>orable members, also, that we have been <lb/>
elected to this Legislature with a view to <lb/>
perfect as far as possible every scheme or pro<lb break="no"/>position that may properly come before it. <lb/>
If we have views on a particular measure <lb/>
which would lead us to propose amendments <lb/>

or scope from what it is when first introduced, <lb/>
I maintain that it is our duty to express our <lb/>

 views in that direction—not taking the
mea<lb break="no"/>sure without looking fairly and impartially <lb/>
into it, or accepting it in the belief that we <lb/>
have no right to dispute or alter any portion <lb/>
of it. For my part, I look upon the scheme <lb/>
now before the House as upon the whole very <lb/>
different from what we had a right to expect <lb/>
from the members of the present
Government. <lb/>
They have been strongly supported in both <lb/>
Houses of Parliament and in the country, <lb/>
and I do not desire to see an difficulty thrown <lb/>
in their way, or anything done calculated to <lb/>
lessen their support in the Legislature; but <lb/>
at the same time I do say that, with the sup<lb break="no"/>port and confidence they have received, they <lb/>
ought to have brought forward a better scheme <lb/>
than that which they have presented to the <lb/>
House and country. Why, take the question <lb/>
of the Intercolonial Railroad involved in these <lb/>
resolutions, and what do we find? More than <lb/>
two years ago the governments of the provin<lb break="no"/>ces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia made <lb/>
a proposition to the Canadian Government to <lb/>
build this road and pay seven-twelfths of <lb/>
the cost, Canada to pay the remaining five-<lb break="yes"/>twelfths. Well, what arrangement
have we <lb/>
now—what has time brought about—what <lb/>
advantages have these two years gained for <lb/>
us? This, that the Government of Canada <lb/>
come down to the Legislature with a scheme <lb/>
according to which Canada will have to pay <lb/>
towards the construction of this road nine- <lb break="yes"/>
twelfths of the entire amount, and the other <lb/>
provinces the balance—thus involving addi<lb break="no"/>tional expense on the part of Canada to the <lb/>
amount of several millions of dollars—certainly <lb/>
not less than six millions to build the Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
colonial Railway alone—more than was de<lb break="no"/>manded of us two years ago—and a total <lb/>
additional expenditure that will add to the <lb/>
annual taxation of Canada more than a mil<lb break="no"/>lion and a half of dollars for all time to come. <lb/>
This heavy expenditure over the proposition <lb/>
made two years ago has, therefore, been need<lb break="no"/>lessly undertaken. It is admitted, even by <lb/>
the promoters of this scheme, that the east<lb break="no"/>ern provinces will benefit far more largely <lb/>
than Canada by the construction of the Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
colonial Railway. It is admitted by the best <lb/>
commercial men who have spoken upon the <lb/>
subject, that as a commercial undertaking it <lb/>
will not pay. It is admitted that it will be <lb/>
of little or no value whatever as a defensive <lb/>
work. This being the case, why then rush <lb/>
into this large expenditure with such precipi<lb break="no"/>tancy ; why not, at least, postpone its passage<lb/>
in order to get a measure of a more perfect
<lb/>
character, and one more in harmony with the <lb/>

 wishes of the people chiefly interested? Hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen who betray such
anxiety to <lb/>
press this scheme at once should remember <lb/>
that we are not voting away our own but the <lb/>
people's money, and that this
should not be <lb/>
done to the extent that is now proposed, <lb/>
without consulting their wishes in the matter. <lb/>
This the law requires before a municipal <lb/>
council can make any special grant of money. <lb/>
In such cases a vote of the people has to be<lb/>
taken, which is conclusive as to whether the <lb/>
proposed expenditure shall be incurred or not; <lb/>
and yet we are here passing a measure of vast<lb break="no"/>ly greater importance to them, a measure in<lb break="no"/>volving a revolution in our political affairs—a <lb/>
measure involving an immense outlay of money <lb/>
without asking whether the
people are favorable <lb/>
to it or not. (Hear, hear.) I maintain, honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen, that before it is finally passed<lb/>
upon, the whole question should be submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the people, and that the law which re<lb break="no"/>quires a reference to them in minor
matters, <lb/>
should be extended in a matter
which so near<lb break="no"/>ly concerns their future condition and pros<lb break="no"/>perity. The people of the eastern provinces <lb/>
have very little to complain of in the plan of <lb/>
Confederation proposed. The fact is, they <lb/>
will be largely the gainers by it, if it is <lb/>
carried out. In Nova Scotia and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, the members of the governments of <lb/>
those provinces, and other public men, see the <lb/>
great advantage they have gained over Cana<lb break="no"/>da, and are not slow to set them before the <lb/>
people. They are naturally anxious that the <lb/>
scheme shall be carried as speedily as pos<lb break="no"/>sible, and are making every effort in this di<lb break="no"/>rection, for under it unprofitable local works <lb/>
in those provinces are assumed and paid for <lb/>
by the General Government; such, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, as the railways of New Brunswick, <lb/>
which, before five years go round, will, I have <lb/>
no doubt, be run at very considerable cost be<lb break="no"/>yond the returns they will yield to the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government. The Hon. Mr. TILLEY, in <lb/>
a speech to the electors of St. John, sets forth <lb/>
the advantages to be gained by New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick by the union, as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">New Brunswick is allowed to enter the
Confed<lb break="no"/>eration with a debt of seven millions, and Nova <lb/>
Scotia with a debt of eight millions.
Now, what <lb/>
was the nature of the arrangement by which we <lb/>
came in? It was found that the debt of Canada <lb/>
was not much larger per head than
that of New <lb/>
Brunswick. We came in on better terms than <lb/>
that province. <lb/>
</quote>

            <p> Mr. TILLEY then proceeds to show how New <lb/>
Brunswick gained a clear advantage of $610,<lb break="no"/>000 a year for all time to come on the Interco<lb break="no"/><cb/>lonial Railway alone. So much better are
the <lb/>
terms to that province under the Intercolonial <lb/>
scheme than those upon which they offered
<lb/>
themselves to join us in building that road, <lb/>
two years ago, Hon. Mr. TILLEY says :-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Of the cost of that road (the
Intercolonial Rail <lb/>
way) New Brunswick and Nova Scotia had guar<lb break="no"/>anteed the provincial credit for seven twelfths, <lb/>
and Canada for five-twelfths. Now, if the Con<lb break="no"/>federation would build the road, New Brunswick <lb/>
and Nova Scotia would be relieved of the inter<lb break="no"/>est on the seven millions,
amounting to $420,000, <lb/>
as well as upon the interest of the three and a <lb/>
half-twelfths of the three millions sterling, <lb/>
amounting to $l90,000, making in all $610,000
<lb/>
provided for by the General Government. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> This liberal bribe to bring New Brunswick
<lb/>
into the union, one would think, was quite <lb/>
enough to satisfy the little province; but on. <lb/>
Mr. TILLEY adds:-<lb/>
            </p>
           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Over and above all these advantages, we
get <lb/>
for ten years a subsidy of $63,000
per anuum. <lb/>
Our local expenditures summed up
amount to <lb/>
$320,630, and we get from the
General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, without increased taxation, $90,000,
in <lb/>
lieu of our import duty and casual territorial <lb/>
revenue, 80 cents per head on the
population,<lb/>
making $201,637, and a special
subsidy of <lb/>
$63,000 a year for ten years,
making in all <lb/>
$354,637, being $34,000 over and above our <lb/>
present necessities. <lb/>
           </quote>

            <p> These (says Hon. Mr. TILLEY) are the
prin<lb break="no"/>cipal points looked to. Hon. Mr. TILLEY is <lb/>
very candid, and acknowledges these advan <lb/>
tages in the name of "subsidies." He further <lb/>
assures his audience in the following words :-<lb/>
            </p>
           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">But we are asked,
what guarantee have on that <lb/>
you will continue to receive these subsidies pro<lb break="no"/>mised by the General Government? Most un<lb break="no"/>questionable security—we are not
at the mercy of <lb/>
the Canadians. ' ' ? So close is the contest <lb/>
between parties in the Canadian Legislature, that <lb/>
even the five Prince Edward Island members
by <lb/>
their votes, could turn victory
on whatever side <lb/>
they choose, and have the game entirely in their <lb/>
own hands. <lb/>
           </quote>

            <p> This is the success with which Hon. Mr.
TIL<lb break="no"/>LIY has acted on behalf of the people of New <lb/>
Brunswick, and I think the Commissioner of <lb/>
Crown Lands, when he reflects upon the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages that the eastern provinces have re<lb break="no"/>ceived over those obtained by Canada, will <lb/>
admit that I was not far astray the other day <lb/>
when I said that our public men had acted <lb/>
with a great deal of recklessness. It appears
<lb/>
to me that they went to work with the deter<lb break="no"/>mination to get Confederation--to get it on <lb/>
fair terms if they could, but to get it on any <lb/>
terms that might be found necessary to con<lb break="no"/><pb n="330" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0330.jpg"/><fw type="num">330</fw>cede to the Lower Provinces. (Hear,
hear.) <lb/>
Another of the delegates to the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference, Hon. Mr. WHELAN, of Prince Edward <lb/>
Island, enumerates all the advantages that <lb/>
will be secured to that province by Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and winds up by saying, that that little <lb/>
island will have $40,000 a year more than <lb/>
necessary to carry on its local affairs. (Hear.) <lb/>
Taking all these circumstances into consider<lb break="no"/>ation, I do think the Government ought to have <lb/>
given more time to deliberate upon and perfect <lb/>
this measure; and, at any rate, to leave it <lb/>
over till another session of Parliament before <lb/>
demanding a final decision upon the question. <lb/>
Failing to do that, and failing to consent <lb/>
to any alteration in any one of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, however objectionable, I think it <lb/>
it is our duty to refer it to the people <lb/>
for their decision upon it. I know I will <lb/>
be met with the objection that this is con<lb break="no"/>trary to British practice—that a reference <lb/>
to the people in the manner I propose is <lb/>
unknown to the British Constitution. We <lb/>
may say the same thing in regard
to every <lb/>
branch of legislation and public business in <lb/>
this country, that it differs in some respects <lb/>
from the mode of conducting it which pre<lb break="no"/>vails in England; but we must remember <lb/>
that we are differently situated
in this coun<lb break="no"/>try from the people of England, and that our <lb/>
feelings and habits of thought upon public <lb/>
affairs are altogether different. And
since we <lb/>
have adopted the principle in the conduct of <lb/>
our municipal affairs, to refer all matters in<lb break="no"/>volving the expenditure of money for special <lb/>
purposes to the people, it will do no possible <lb/>
harm to apply it to this measure; and if the <lb/>
peeple adopt it, and it should afterwards prove <lb/>
that they had entered into a bad bargain, <lb/>
they would have no one to blame but them<lb break="no"/>selves, and I have no doubt would, under <lb/>
such circumstances, bear it more patiently. <lb/>
But if we take the opposite course, if we <lb/>
close this arrangement on terms disadvan<lb break="no"/>tageous to us, it will be many years before a <lb/>
change can be effected. Would Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, at the demand of Canada, give <lb/>
up the lien, the constitutional right she will <lb/>
have obtained under this scheme, to the <lb/>
money she receives over and above what is <lb/>
necessary to meet her local requirements? <lb/>
Not at all. Would Newfoundland give up <lb/>
her bonus of $160,000 a year for
all time, <lb/>
should the looked for coal not be found to <lb/>
pay? Not a bit of it. Would Nova Scotia
<lb/>
give up her right to impose an export duty <lb/>
on coals and other minerals, because Canada <lb/>
found that this right gave her undue advan<lb/><cb/>tages? Certainly not.  Would New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick surrender her right to levy an export <lb/>
duty on timber, or, at the call of Canada, <lb/>
give any extra assistance towards the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Intereolonial Railway, which will <lb/>
benefit her far more largely than any of the <lb/>
other provinces, inasmuch as it will open up <lb/>
a large tract of country within her borders, <lb/>
and render the land and timber it contains <lb/>
far more valuable? Undoubtedly she would <lb/>
not; we would have to abide by our agree<lb break="no"/>ment, no matter how invidious might be the <lb/>
advantages it conferred, no matter how  un<lb break="no"/>favorably it might affect western interests. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) The complaint that has been <lb/>
made against the working of the present union <lb/>
is that in Lower Canada the people do not <lb/>
pay as much in taxes to the general rev<lb break="no"/>enue, man for man, as the people of Upper <lb/>
Canada. It was contended, I believe, by <lb/>
the present Attorney General East, at a <lb/>
speech delivered some years since to his con<lb break="no"/>stituents at Verchères, that the expenditure
<lb/>
for the redemption of seigniorial rights did not <lb/>
affect Lower Canada very much, because
<lb/>
Upper Canada paid two-thirds of the revenue <lb/>
of the country; and all the advocates of the <lb/>
western section, who have urged
its rights <lb/>
before the people, have taken the ground that <lb/>
it contributed in that proportion to the public <lb/>
exchequer. Now, if there be any truth in <lb/>
this statement, it must follow that under this <lb/>
arrangement Canada, at all events, will have <lb/>
to pay more, man for man, than the eastern <lb/>
provinces to the general revenue,
because it <lb/>
cannot be contended, I apprehend, that Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, Newfoundland, or either of <lb/>
the other Maritime Provinces, however pros<lb break="no"/>perous their condition may be, have a popula<lb break="no"/>tion as wealthy as that of Upper Canada. or <lb/>
one that will contribute as much in taxes to <lb/>
the General Government. If then, during the <lb/>
past, Lower Canada has paid less than Upper <lb/>
Canada to the revenue, while enjoying the <lb/>
benefit of as large or perhaps a. larger expen<lb break="no"/>diture than that section, what is proposed to <lb/>
be done now? Why, to remove that diffi<lb break="no"/>culty which led almost to a dead-lock in our <lb/>
legislation, to get rid of the embarrassments <lb/>
that have beset the Government of this coun<lb break="no"/>try for many years past, we are asked to adopt <lb/>
a scheme that will perpetuate them on a larger <lb/>
scale than before, and involve, in the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Intercolonial Railway alone, <lb/>
the expenditure of a million or a million and <lb/>
a half annually for ever. (Hear, hear.)
How<lb/>
absurd then to urge on this scheme without at <lb/>
           least sharing the responsibility of it with the<lb/>

people? Why not take time and maturely <lb/>
consider it? Why not submit it to the <lb/>
verdict of those who have to pay its cost, <lb/>
and if they accept it, let them bear the con<lb break="no"/>sequences. (Hear, hear.) With regard to <lb/>
the constitution of the Upper
House of the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> General Legislature,
a good deal <lb/>
has been said, but I think the main point has <lb/>
too often been lost sight of. The
course <lb/>
of the debate upon these resolutions has
<lb/>
seemed to run in some instances as though <lb/>
we regarded a membership of this branch of <lb/>
the Legislature a position which
we ought to <lb/>
occupy by right, as though we had some sort <lb/>
of a constitutional right to remain here, and <lb/>
as though governments and parliamentary <lb/>
bodies were instituted by the people, not for <lb/>
the benefit of the community, but for the ad<lb break="no"/>vancement of those who compose them. We <lb/>
would seem to have overlooked a fundamental <lb/>
principle of all free governments, that govern<lb break="no"/>ments should be carried on for the good of the <lb/>
governed; and the principle of responsible <lb/>
government, according to which government <lb/>
must be carried on according to the well-un<lb break="no"/>derstood wishes of the people.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. MCCREA</persName>—As expressed by <lb/>
their representatives. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON.
MR. REESOR</persName>—As expressed, my <lb/>
honorable friend says, by their representa<lb break="no"/>tives. Very well; we must remember that <lb/>
those who constitute the Government of this <lb/>
country have brought down here a very curi<lb break="no"/>ous scheme, and have held out to you the in<lb break="no"/>ducement that if you support it you have a <lb/>
chance of being appointed for life to the seat <lb/>
you occupy; and there is thus a probability <lb/>
of your being blinded to what you owe to the <lb/>
people, of your ignoring the constituencies <lb/>
that sent you here, and of your forgetting the <lb/>
duty you owe to the country. Now,
I hold <lb/>
with regard to the elective
principle in this <lb/>
House, that the oftener a man is brought in <lb/>
contact with the people in a
legitimate way, <lb/>
to learn their wishes as constitutionally and <lb/>
properly expressed, the more
likely he is to <lb/>
use his influence and talent in
conducting the <lb/>
government in such a manner as to
secure the <lb/>
happiness and prosperity of the
country. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.)  It is said that, as
you have a<lb/>
responsible government, the
Government of <lb/>
the day will be held responsible
to the people, <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>through their representatives in the lower
<lb/>
branch of the Legislature for the
appoint<lb break="no"/>ments, it may make to this House.
Admitting <lb/>
this to be the case, we know what
the ten<lb break="no"/>dency is in England, and what it
was <lb/>
in this country when the Government <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
 had the appointment
of the members of the <lb/>
Legislative Council; the effect will be to find <lb/>
a place in this House for men distinguished <lb/>
for the aid they have given at elections to cer<lb break="no"/>tain men or parties, and not as a reward of <lb/>
true merit or legislative ability. Further<lb break="no"/>more, if this House is to be of any value at <lb/>
all, it is as affording a
wholesome check over <lb/>
hasty and unwise legislation. But if you <lb/>
place the whole legislation of the country in <lb/>
the hands of a single man or body, I care not <lb/>
whether it is democratic or aristocratic in its <lb/>
tendencies, a power like that in the hands of <lb/>
the Executive to create the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil is a dangerous one. Unrestrained or un<lb break="no"/>checked action by a single elected body of the <lb/>
most democratic character is apt to go astray <lb/>
if they feel they have only themselves to con<lb break="no"/>sult. This is what is proposed to be done <lb/>
under this scheme; but let this House be <lb/>
elected, as before, by the people; let them be <lb/>
returned for a period of eight years as at pre<lb break="no"/>sent, or even longer if desired, and then, if <lb/>
there is a demand for legislation of a selfish <lb/>
or ill-considered character—a demand which, <lb/>
founded on ignorance or passion, is likely to <lb/>
right itself after the lapse of a few years—the <lb/>
members of this House would take the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility upon themselves of rejecting it, <lb/>
and public opinion would eventually sustain <lb/>
them and acknowledge that they
have done <lb/>
some service to the country. But inasmuch <lb/>
as you appoint these members for life, you <lb/>
have no check over them, nor are they so <lb/>
likely to check legislation of an immature and <lb/>
ill-considered character. While the Ministry <lb/>
of the day which appoints them remains in <lb/>
power, it will expect and receive a cordial <lb/>
support from them; but let it be defeated, and <lb/>
a ministry, formed out of the opposite party<lb/>
obtain office, there will certainly be difficulty <lb/>
—there will be a tendency to dead-locks be<lb break="no"/>tween the two branches of the
legislature, and <lb/>
a repetition of these scenes which were wit<lb break="no"/>nessed in this country some years ago, and <lb/>
which formed one of the principal causes that <lb/>
brought about the rebellion of 1837. Honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen say that we will have the <lb/>
power to remedy these defects in the scheme <lb/>
if they are found to be injurious in their ac<lb break="no"/>tion, but it is well known from the experience <lb/>
of the past that no power can be brought to <lb/>
bear to bring about any change that may be <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>required, without a great deal of agitation <lb/>and labor. What has been the
agitation to <lb/>
secure a change in the representation of the <lb/>
two sections of Canada in Parliament? It <lb/>
has been going on for ten or twelve years, <lb/>
          
            <pb n="332" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0332.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">332</fw>
         
 and yet, on the eve of accomplishment,
those<lb/>
who have advocated it have not effected <lb/>
a change of the nature that was desired, <lb/>
but have jumped into a new and totally <lb/>
different scheme, that really seems to me <lb/>
to have been brought about for the sole <lb/>
purpose of advancing their own personal aims, <lb/>
rather than satisfying any demand on the <lb/>
part of the people. (Hear, hear.) The hon<lb break="no"/>orable and gallant Knight at the head of the <lb/>
Government stated that we were on an in<lb break="no"/>clined plane, and in danger of sliding into the <lb/>
republicanism of the United
States. This <lb/>
phrase has been referred to so often by honor<lb break="no"/>able members who have spoken, and so many <lb/>
deductions have been drawn from it, that I <lb/>
may perhaps be permitted to say a few words <lb/>
upon it. I think all must see that the ten<lb break="no"/>dency of the scheme now before the House <lb/>
will be in a few years to impose direct taxation <lb/>
upon the people for the support of the local <lb/>
governments. Let us then have direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion, and what will be the result? If there is <lb/>
a large expenditure on the part of the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government, in addition to this taxation, <lb/>
political agitators will arise, who will cry out <lb/>
that the public burdens are unequally borne <lb/>
—(hear)—that two-thirds of the revenue is <lb/>
borne by the people living west of Quebec<lb break="no"/>that is, the population west of this city <lb/>
will, man for man, pay twice as much to <lb/>
the public exchequer as the population east <lb/>
of it. There will undoubtedly be
the same <lb/>
tendency, under such a state of
things, as has <lb/>
been charged to exist on the part of the Lower <lb/>
Canadian representatives since the union was <lb/>
formed—namely, a tendency on the
part of <lb/>
those who pay the smaller portion of the re<lb break="no"/>venue to spend the public money freely and <lb/>
extravagantly. They will naturally say when <lb/>
any appropriation is proposed for their own <lb/>
section—" We will go for this expenditure, <lb/>
for it will benefit us; and we will support a <lb/>
corresponding expenditure in the other sec<lb break="no"/>tion, because we have not so much to pay of <lb/>
it as the people of that section--we will have <lb/>
only fifty cents to pay of it, while they will <lb/>
have to pay a dollar." This argument will <lb/>
be used in support of all extravagant and <lb/>
wasteful expenditures, and you may depend <lb/>
upon it that they will soon be incurred. Then <lb/>
you will have political agitators who will con<lb break="no"/>stantly keep these things before
the people, <lb/>
who will demand a dissolution of the union of <lb/>
the provinces as a remedy for the evil. Then <lb/>
a further difficulty will be found in the fact <lb/>
that breadstuffs, the American market for <lb/>
       
            <cb/>
           
which will probably be  closed,
cannot be <lb/>
transported to the Lower from the
Upper <lb/>
Provinces without being protected by a
heavy <lb/>
import duty. Will the representatives from <lb/>
the Lower Provinces allow that import duty <lb/>
to be imposed? No, undoubtedly they will not. <lb/>
Attempt to carry it in the interest of Upper <lb/>
Canada and you will at once transform the <lb/>
whole of them into advocates for the repeal <lb/>
of the union. Thus you create cause <lb/>
for agitation in all the sections, and it <lb/>
will not long continue until you will again <lb/>
see another dead-lock. You will
again have <lb/>
three administrations formed and three gen<lb break="no"/>eral elections occurring within two years, and <lb/>
again you will have suflicient excuse for <lb/>
another change in the Constitution. And you <lb/>
may rely upon it, that before such an agita<lb break="no"/>tion goes on five years it will be made an ex<lb break="no"/>cuse for sliding further down
the inclined <lb/>
plane than would have been afforded if we had <lb/>
remained as we were. (Hear, hear. I can<lb break="no"/>not help coming to the conclusion, honorable <lb/>
gentlemen, that these resolutions contain the <lb/>
seeds of our destruction as colonies. There <lb/>
can be no political advantage in the proposed
<lb/>
union, unless we assume the rights and respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities of an independent country. We are <lb/>
not yet prepared for that step. Our popula<lb break="no"/>tion is not numerous enough; we are too young <lb/>
and too weak to assume these rights and res<lb break="no"/>ponsibilities. We have no commercial advan<lb break="no"/>tages to gain by the union. Why then force <lb/>
it upon us? Let it remain for more mature <lb/>
consideration, and the evils you have will be <lb/>
borne the more quietly; but if you force it <lb/>
upon the people prematurely, and the evils I <lb/>
fear spring from  it, depend upon
it that the <lb/>
public men who press it forward will be as <lb/>
seriously condemned as they are now
highly <lb/>
lauded. The fact is, the people of the country <lb/>
do not understand this scheme. How can it be <lb/>
expected that they should understand it in all its <lb/>
bearings? Why, the honorable member from <lb/>
the Rideau Division said he heard the expla<lb break="no"/>nations of it and was here a couple of weeks <lb/>
before he understood it, and that he had sent <lb/>
2000 circulars to his constituents that they <lb/>
might have a knowledge of it. How can he <lb/>
expect them to understand it from these print<lb break="no"/>ed documents, when he himself, with the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of hearing all the explanations upon <lb/>
it, was two weeks in gaining an understand<lb break="no"/>ing of it? Honorable gentlemen, I am in the <lb/>
abstract in favor of the union of these colon- <lb break="yes"/>
ice—(hear, hear)—but I do not wish to force <lb/>
on this scheme in a way that is unfair and un<lb break="no"/><pb n="333" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0333.jpg"/><fw type="num">333<lb/></fw>just,
that will lead to future difficulties of <lb/>
even a graver character than
those we are now <lb/>
laboring under, and that will give cause for the <lb/>
advocacy of such a change in our position as <lb/>
few in this country would desire to see brought <lb/>
about. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The House then divided upon the amend<lb break="no"/>ment, with the following result:-<lb/>

the measure which is now before the House, <lb/>

think it is but just and fair that I should close <lb/>

I think that before the vote is taken I should <lb/>
have an opportunity of answering
the argu<lb break="no"/>ments that have been advanced against the <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I would ask if it is <lb/>

            </p>
            <p>  <persName ref="pers:RYAN3">HON. MR.
RYAN</persName> said—The importance <lb/>
of the vote we are about to give on these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions is very great, as the future of the <lb/>
country is so largely dependent upon it, and <lb/>
representing as l do the division of Victoria,<lb/>
which is one of the most important in the <lb/>
country, containing a large representation of<lb/>
those sections or divisions of races which make <lb/>
up the population of Canada, I think it is due to<lb/>
     
            <cb/>   
         
        
 my constituents to make a few
observations <lb/>
upon the subject before us. (Hear)
If <lb/>
the constituency I represent is, perhaps, not <lb/>
quite the most numerous in the
country, it <lb/>
possesses a large share of the
wealth, busi<lb break="no"/>ness and manufacturing energy
and commer<lb break="no"/>cial enterprise of the province. It also <lb/>
contains, in not very unequal proportions, <lb/>
people of the different nationalities. religions <lb/>
and languages which most largely prevail <lb/>
amongst us. You have the French element. <lb/>
with the Roman Catholic religion and <lb/>
French language; you have the English, <lb/>
Scotch and Irish Protestant element, and <lb/>
you have the Irish Roman Catholic element, <lb/>
which I may be said more especially to repre<lb break="no"/>sent, and which is by no means an unimportant <lb/>
one. Go through Canada, and you will find <lb/>
that these, with a few European foreigners, <lb/>
such as Germans and Norwegians, make up <lb/>
nearly the whole population. My division <lb/>
is, in fact, an epitome of Canada. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) It may not be too much to say that <lb/>
the opinion and feeling of Montreal will be <lb/>
a fair representation of what the opinion of <lb/>
the country generally is, and that if Montreal <lb/>
has come to a nearly unanimous conclusion, <lb/>
it is very likely the different sections of the <lb/>
country will have arrived at a very similar <lb/>
one on the subject of Confederation. I am <lb/>
happy to be able to state with confidence, <lb/>
that I have taken pains to ascertain the <lb/>
opinions of each of the different
sections of <lb/>
my constituency to which I have alluded, <lb/>
and that I believe they are in consonance <lb/>
with the votes I have given in this chamber. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I have alluded to the energy <lb/>
of my constituents. to their great commercial <lb/>
enterprise. I believe that energy is one of <lb/>
their leading characteristics, and I may say <lb/>
this, that if that energy has led them, on <lb/>
rare occasions, a little further than their own <lb/>
interest and that of the country required, <lb/>
they, nevertheless, on such occasions acted <lb/>
on an honest and generous impulse, or were <lb/>
prompted by the feeling that some injustice <lb/>
had been done to them. I was greatly <lb/>
gratified with the remarks of the honorable <lb/>
and gallant Premier at the commencement <lb/>
of
this debate, when alluding to events <lb/>
which long since took place in Montreal; he <lb/>
put the blame where it really should
rest<lb break="no"/>on the Legislature of the day, which was <lb/>
pressing on the people a measure distasteful<lb/>
to them, and which was vainly
remonstrated <lb/>
against by numerous
portions of the country. <lb/>
The
same impulsive character which led <lb/>
         


            <pb n="334" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0334.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">334</fw>
          
 them at that time into a course which is <lb/>
certainly much to be regretted, afterwards <lb/>
led them to countenance a movement of <lb/>
which I disapproved at the time, and which <lb/>
I opposed with all my might—the move- <lb break="yes"/>
meat towards annexation. They favored <lb/>
that movement, because they thought they <lb/>
had been aggrieved and maltreated. But I <lb/>
may tell you now, that this
feeling has com<lb break="no"/>pletely vanished, and that their wish now is <lb/>
to place Canada on a footing in which, united <lb/>
with the Lower Provinces and in close con<lb break="no"/>nection with Great Britain, she may be <lb/>
thoroughly independent of her neighbors, <lb/>
and free from any need of looking again <lb/>
towards Washington. (Hear, hear.) In <lb/>
considering the project of
Confederation, one <lb/>
of the principal subjects which has
under<lb break="no"/>gone discussion in this House has been the <lb/>
proposed Constitution of the Council, and <lb/>
the most prominent question connected with <lb/>
it has been the question of the elective <hi rendition="simple:italic">versus</hi> <lb/>
the nominative principle. Although an <lb/>
elected member, I voted without the least <lb/>
hesitation against the elective principle, and <lb/>
I believe that in doing so I represented the <lb/>
views of my constituents as well as my own—I <lb/>
mean the great majority of my constituents,
<lb/>
for there may be some exceptions with re<lb break="no"/>gard to this point, as there are no doubt <lb/>
with respect to the general question of Con<lb break="no"/>federation. I based my vote on what is, I <lb/>
think, a true principle in politics, which is <lb/>
that if you wish a check to be established, <lb/>
such as I think this Council is intended to <lb/>
establish on the legislation of the other <lb/>
branch, you must not have the two Chambers <lb/>
returnable by the same constituents. If the <lb/>
constituents of both Houses are nearly the <lb/>
same, you lose the power of check, or at <lb/>
least you will not have it effectual, because <lb/>
you will have the same sentiments and feel<lb break="no"/>ings represented in this House as in the <lb/>
other. I am not singular in this opinion, <lb/>
but were I to cite the opinions of men who <lb/>
are of a conservative turn of mind, and who <lb/>
have always upheld the privileges of the <lb/>
aristocracy and the prerogative of the Crown, <lb/>
I should, perhaps, give you opinions which <lb/>
would carry less weight with the opponents <lb/>
of this measure than will that of a gentleman <lb/>
whose views I will cite, who has written a <lb/>
great deal, and very ably, and who belongs <lb/>
to the ranks of the advanced Liberal party <lb/>
in England—I mean Mr. JOHN STUART <lb/>
MILL. In his chapter on the Second <lb/>
Chamber (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Considerations on
Representative <lb/>
Government</hi>, page 212), he says:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">That there should be in every polity a centre <lb/>
of resistance to the predominant power in the <lb/>
Constitution—and in a democratic constitution,
<lb/>
therefore, a nucleus of resistance to the demo<lb break="no"/>cracy—I have already maintained, and I regard it <lb/>
as a fundamental maxim of government.
If any <lb/>
people who possess a democratic representation <lb/>
are, from their historical antecedents, more willing <lb/>
to tolerate such a centre of resistance in the form <lb/>
of a Second Chamber or House of Lords than in <lb/>
any other shape, this constitutes a strong reason <lb/>
for having it in that shape. <lb/>
</quote>

            <p> Now, honorable gentlemen, I think a
Second <lb/>
Chamber, constituted nearly in the same <lb/>
way as the Lower Chamber, would be wholly <lb/>
ineffectual to stop the current of legislation <lb/>
coming from that Chamber; the point, in<lb break="no"/>deed, admits of very little question. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) The objections which have been raised <lb/>
to nomination by the Crown or the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Government arc of very little effect at <lb/>
this time of day. For myself I should have <lb/>
preferred to have the nomination of legis<lb break="no"/>ative councillors vested in the Crown inde<lb break="no"/>pendently of the recommendation of the <lb/>
Local Government, so as to have left the pre<lb break="no"/>rogative unfettered. There is no doubt that <lb/>
abuses formerly existed in Canada when the <lb/>
nominative system was in force—before res<lb break="no"/>ponsible government was established and <lb/>
when the Colonial Office meddled a good deal <lb/>
with the affairs of the
province; but now <lb/>
every honorable gentleman with any know<lb break="no"/>ledge of historical events in Canada will say <lb/>
at once the case is altogether altered. So <lb/>
far from interfering in our internal matters, <lb/>
the Colonial Oflice now leaves us a great deal <lb/>
to ourselves and lets us do as we please. <lb/>
There never was a freer Constitution than <lb/>
ours. Under these altered circumstances, I <lb/>
should have preferred, I say, that in order <lb/>
to avoid all appearance of nominations for <lb/>
party purposes, the direct nomination of le<lb break="no"/>gislative councillors should have been left to <lb/>
the Crown or the Crown's representative in <lb/>
the Confederation. (Hear.) There was <lb/>
one remark made by the hon. member lor <lb/>
Wellington in reference to Mr. CARDWELL's
<lb/>
letter, which I think was made in error. He <lb/>
inferred from that dispatch that Mr. CARD<lb break="no"/>WELL was opposed to the nominative sys<lb break="no"/>tem. Now, the passage he alluded
to was<lb/>
this:-<lb/>
            </p>
           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The second point which Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment desired should be reconsidered is the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the Legislative Council. They appreciate <lb/>
the considerations which have influenced
the Con<lb break="no"/>ference in determining the mode in which this <lb/>
body, so important to the constitution of the Le<lb break="no"/><pb n="335"

appears to <lb/>
them to require further consideration whether, if <lb/>
the members be appointed for life, and their <lb/>

<lb/>
means of restoring harmony
between the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council and the popular Assembly, if it shall <lb/>
ever unfortunately happen that a decided differ<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion shall arise between them. <lb/>
           </quote>
            <p> Now the point of this (Mr. CARDWELL'S) <lb/>
objection clearly is to the number being fixed, <lb/>
not to the principle of nomination, nor to <lb/>
members being appointed for life. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Like many honorable
gentlemen in <lb/>
this House, there are certain of the clauses <lb/>
in these resolutions which, I think, might <lb/>
have been improved. I, for instance, might <lb/>
have preferred the Confederate seat of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment being established elsewhere than at <lb/>
Ottawa; and, with reference to this subject, <lb/>
I have been much struck with a remark, <lb/>
which I will cite, from a recent writer, who <lb/>
says that—"Any country compelled to fore<lb break="no"/>go the use of its natural chief city, and make <lb/>
some inferior and ill-placed town the seat of <lb/>
its government, labors under incalculable <lb/>
disadvantages." Everybody, however, has <lb/>
his own little bantling, and thinks it <lb/>
the handsomest in the world; and I <lb/>
doubt very much if, after all, we should <lb/>
have made the plan of Confederation much <lb/>
better, had every one of us been consult<lb break="no"/>ed and taken into the Conference, at Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town or Quebec, to urge our own
special views. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I rather infer, from the dif<lb break="no"/>ferences of opinion I have heard around me <lb/>
in these debates, that the compromise system <lb/>
would not have been so easily adopted by us <lb/>
as by the gentlemen who composed these <lb/>
conferences. I hope, however, that we shall <lb/>
adopt that system now, and get through the <lb/>
debate in the faith that they have done what <lb/>
is best for the interests at the country, and <lb/>
that the measure is so important, as a whole, <lb/>
as to render it unwise to place minor impedi<lb break="no"/>ments in its way to interrupt its course. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I have marked several sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the resolutions which I think are <lb/>
open to objection or susceptible of improve<lb break="no"/>ment, and I hope the honorable and gallant <lb/>
Knight at the head of the Government will <lb/>
give some explanations respecting the views <lb/>
which animated the Conference in reference <lb/>
to them. One of them is a matter in which <lb/>
Lower Canada is somewhat peculiarly inter<lb break="no"/>ested—the system of marriage and divorce, <lb/>
which, I see, is to be left in the hands of the <lb/>
Federal Government. I hope nothing will <lb/>
be done by the General Government, in rela<lb break="no"/><cb/>tion to this action, which will outrage
the <lb/>
feelings of Lower Canada, or lead to the <lb/>
laxity, in dealing with the marriage tie, <lb/>
which prevails south of the line 45°. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Again, emigration is a subject which <lb/>
is left to the Local as well as the General <lb/>
Government to deal with. I think it should <lb/>
be under the care of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment entirely. Then, as to the question of <lb/>
education, I hope that the Government will secure <lb/>
to Roman Catholics in Upper Canada the <lb/>
same rights which will be extended to Pro<lb break="no"/>testants in Lower Canada. To have the same <lb/>
privileges is only equal justice, which I trust <lb/>
and believe will be granted. Having been <lb/>
in communication with several of the Roman <lb/>
Catholic clergy, I can say that they desire to <lb/>
have every justice done to their Protestant <lb/>
fellow-subjects, but expect to have the same <lb/>
privileges granted to Roman
Catholics in <lb/>
Upper Canada (who are the minority there,)
<lb/>
as will be given to the Protestant minority <lb/>
in Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) I must <lb/>
also refer to the clause which gives to local <lb/>
governments the right of dividing the sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the Confederation into constituencies <lb/>
and electoral divisions. This power may <lb/>
become very dangerous and lead to great <lb/>
practical injustice, and should, I think, be <lb/>
placed in the hands et the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I come now to the question of rail<lb break="no"/>way extension, and this is a matter which <lb/>
seems to have been a serious stumbling-block <lb/>
to a great number of those who are really <lb/>
favorable to the measure of Confederation. <lb/>
Now, I do not think the Intercolonial Railway <lb/>
will be a profitable concern, all at once; but <lb/>
I think I can remove a few of the objections <lb/>
which have been raised to this part of the <lb/>
scheme. In the first place, I think
a mistake <lb/>
prevails as to what will be the cost of carrying <lb/>
freight on this railway. I have here the annual <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Trade and Navigation Returns of New <lb/>
Brunswick</hi> for 1863, in which I find the <lb/>
following statement:-<lb/>
            </p>
           
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
If New Brunswick was connected with Mon<lb break="no"/>treal and Quebec by direct railway communication <lb/>
through British territory, our importations from <lb/>
the States would decrease immediately, and much <lb/>
of our flour and other supplies would come direct <lb/>
from Canada; and in the event of the Reciprocity <lb/>
Treaty and the bonding system of the United <lb/>
States, which allows British goods to pass through <lb/>
their territory free of duty under bond
to Canada, <lb/>
being abolished, Saint John would probably <lb/>
become the Atlantic shipping port of Canada for <lb/>
the winter months. <lb/>

would be so very extravagant that this
could <lb/>
not come to pass; but in the same report, <lb/>
which has very opportunely come to hand, as <lb/>
it corroborates the remarks I made during the <lb/>
debate on the Address as to the fact that <lb/>
we should have some offset in the trade of <lb/>
the Lower Provinces, under Confederation, <lb/>
for what we should lose if the Reciprocity <lb/>
Treaty were to be annulled, I find the <lb/>
following statement:-<lb/>
            </p>
         
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The cost of transportation of flour from
Mont<lb break="no"/>real to Portland, Maine, by rail, has been reduced <lb/>
to the low figure of 35 cents per barrel, and from <lb/>
Portland, Maine, to this port, it can be conveyed <lb/>
for 25 cents by steamer, or 15 cents by sailing <lb/>
vessel, making altogether 60 cents for conveying
<lb/>
a barrel of flour, weighing 200 lbs., by rail and <lb/>
steam, a distance of 585 miles, and it could be <lb/>
delivered at this port (St. John, N. B.) within <lb/>
five or six days from the time of loading at Mont<lb break="no"/>real. Of course these low rates of railway <lb/>
freight apply to large quantities only. <lb/>
</quote>

            <p> Well now, gentlemen, the distance from <lb/>
Montreal to St. John, by railway, is at a <lb/>
rough estimate about 600 miles. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>
—Not so much<lb break="no"/>about 500 only. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:RYAN3">HON. MR. RYAN</persName>—So much the better <lb/>
for my argument, but I will give my hon. <lb/>
friend the benefit of the 600 miles. Now, <lb/>
the further a barrel of flour is carried the <lb/>
less the freight per mile is, because you get <lb/>
rid of the cost of handling it at successive <lb/>
stages. If you can carry it from Montreal <lb/>
to Portland, say 300 miles, for 35 cents, <lb/>
you can certainly carry it 600 miles for less <lb/>
than twice that sum, or let us say for 60 <lb/>
cents, not more than what it now costs by <lb/>
the combined rail and steamboat route <hi rendition="simple:italic">via</hi> <lb/>
Portland, while the flour conveyed all the <lb/>
way by rail will be the better for not being <lb/>
moved about from one means of conveyance <lb/>
to another. I have indeed reason to believe, <lb/>
from a very good railway authority, that it <lb/>
would pay a railway company well
to <lb/>
carry flour from Montreal to St. John <lb/>
for from 60 to 70 cents per barrel, and <lb/>
that if it were necessary, the work could <lb/>
be done at a profit at 50 cents per barrel. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I want to shew by this, that <lb/>
the carrying of flour over the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway will not be so difficult of accom<lb break="no"/>plishment as people who have not
gone into <lb/>
the calculation closely may be disposed to <lb/>
imagine. (Hear, hear.) I have here, too, <lb/>
a statement of the imports of flour into New <lb/>
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. <lb/>
It is as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
<table>
<row><cell>Imports of Flour.</cell> <cell>Barrels.</cell></row>

            <p> If we now look at our imports and experts
<lb/>
for 1863, we shall find that we imported <lb/>
into Canada 4,210,942 bushels of wheat, <lb/>
while we exported only 3,030,407 bushels. <lb/>
Well, this may appear strange, considering <lb/>
that we are an agricultural and exporting <lb/>
country; but we come next to the article of <lb/>
flour, and find that while we imported only <lb/>
229,793 barrels, we exported 1,095,691 <lb/>
barrels.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—We imported wheat <lb/>
to grind it into flour. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:RYAN3">HON. MR. RYAN</persName>—Exactly so. The <lb/>
excess of flour exported was 865,898 barrels, <lb/>
which, taken at 4 1/2 bushels to
the barrel, <lb/>
would be equal to 3,896,541 bushels of <lb/>
wheat. Deducting from this the excess of <lb/>
our imports over our exports of wheat, vis., <lb/>
1,180,535 bushels, will leave us 2,716,006 <lb/>
for export, which at the same calculation, <lb/>
viz., 4 1/2  bushels to the barrel,
gives as <lb/>
603,557 barrels of surplus flour, ground from <lb/>
wheat in Canada, with which to supply the <lb/>
demand of the three Maritime Provinces <lb/>
mentioned of 797,000 barrels. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
Thus, if the Reciprocity Treaty be repealed, <lb/>
we can just about supply what they annually <lb/>
require. (Hear, hear.) Their

            <p> These under Confederation would go duty <lb/>
free from Canada. There is a large manu<lb break="no"/>facture of such articles, and with them, as <lb/>
with some other articles we make, we might <lb/>
supply the Lower Province markets. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) If there is one feature in our con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Lower Provinces which we <lb/>
must not lose sight of, it is their possessing <lb/>
coal in large quantities; this is sure eventu<lb break="no"/>ally to create manufacturing communities <lb/>
amongst them, to increase their population, <lb/>
and cause a larger home demand than at <lb/>
present, for the agricultural productions of <lb/>
Western Canada. (Hear, hear.) I may <lb/>
now recur to the Intercolonial Railway ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and express a hope that it will be gone <lb/>
about by the Government in the
most econo<lb break="no"/>mical manner possible. This much may be <lb/>
said. that whatever money is spent on it will <lb/>
be spent in the country, that is, in our new <lb/>
country, will be spent among ourselves, and <lb/>
will attract a great army of laborers; and <lb/>
I do hope and trust the
Administration <lb/>
will so arrange the prosecution of the <lb/>
work, that these laborers shall be induced <lb/>
to settle on the lands traversed
by the <lb/>
hue, which, I am told, are very favorable <lb/>
to settlement, so that another market for our <lb/>
manufactures and productions may be formed ; <lb/>
and that if the Reciprocity Treaty should be <lb/>
lost to us (an event which I deprecate as <lb/>
   
            <cb/>
      
 much as anyone), we may have something to
<lb/>
fall back upon—which we shall have, hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, if we look at our position boldly and <lb/>
energetically, and take advantage of circum<lb break="no"/>stances as they arise (Hear, hear.) With <lb/>
respect to the statement that the road will <lb/>
not be valuable for purposes of defence, not <lb/>
being a military man, that is, nothing more. <lb/>
than a militia oficer, I do not pretend to <lb/>
offer a very valuable opinion: but it appears <lb/>
to me that, removed a certain distance from <lb/>
the frontier as it will be, an attack on the <lb/>
railway must be next to impossible in the <lb/>
winter time; besides, it will be our duty to <lb/>
guard our frontier in such a way that incur<lb break="no"/>sions cannot be made upon us with effect, <lb/>
and I hope we shall be able to do so. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) It has been remarked that the <lb/>
English Government would not think of send<lb break="no"/>ing a military force from Halifax to Canada <lb/>
by railway, but I confess I
differ from this <lb/>
view. In the war which is now going on in <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> the United States, if it has been proved
that <lb/>
railways can be easily broken up, it has also <lb/>
been proved that they can easily be relaid, <lb/>
          and the value set upon them by military
men <lb/>
             is clearly exemplified by the struggles
they <lb/>
             make to gain or to retain possession of
them. <lb/>
            If a railway is partially broken up, they
have <lb/>
             appliances at hand quickly to repair it.
It <lb/>
            is a part of modern warfare to lay
railways <lb/>
           and lines of telegraph, and armies have
corps <lb/>
            attached to them whose special duty this
is. <lb/>
            (Hear, hear.) There is another thing, <lb/>
            important in a military point of view,
which <lb/>
            has been lost sight of—which is, that
although <lb/>
            soldiers might walk over the snow,
military <lb/>
            munitions and the heavy articles used in
war, <lb/>
           such as cannon and mortars, can not be
put on <lb/>
             snow-shoes. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) I <lb/>
think the railway would be of incalculable <lb/>
value for transporting such things as these <lb/>
if there were occasion for it, which I hope <lb/>
there never will be. It is, however, meet to <lb/>
be prepared for such an eventuality as war, <lb/>
for that is the best way to avoid it. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) I may here refer to what some <lb/>
honorable gentlemen have remarked in this <lb/>
debate, that the circumstance of certain <lb/>
portions of the population of the Lower <lb/>
Provinces being occupied in maritime pur<lb break="no"/>suits, diminishes to that extent their power <lb/>
of aiding Canada in case of war.
In this <lb/>
opinion am unable to concur; for if there <lb/>
be one arm more than another in which <lb/>
they can assist us, it is by the aid of their
<lb/>
hardy seafaring population, who will swarm <lb/>
the seaports of the Confederacy and the <lb/>

foe. It has been said, honorable gentlemen, <lb/>
that this measure is being hurried through <lb/>
the House, and complaint has been made <lb/>
that it has not been referred to the country <lb/>
for arbitrament. But, look at the conse<lb break="no"/>quences of so referring it to the country. <lb/>
Look at the consequences of
delay. You <lb/>
have read the telegram today
which gives <lb/>
the news of the assembling of
the British <lb/>
Parliament, and I am glad to see a statement <lb/>
in Her Majesty's Speech, that She has <lb/>
approved of the measure which is now under <lb/>
our consideration. Well, gentlemen, the <lb/>
Parliament of Great Britain will not sit for <lb/>
an unlimited time. Its session, this year, <lb/>
may be shorter than usual, for the natural <lb/>
dissolution of this and the assembling
of a <lb/>
new Parliament are drawing near, and con<lb break="no"/>tending parties generally make an effort, <lb/>
towards the close of a Parliament, to make a <lb/>
change in the Administration. Any one who <lb/>
reads the English papers and political docu<lb break="no"/>ments will see that a change of Ministry is <lb/>
confidently expected by some people; and if <lb/>
a defeat of the present Ministry takes place, <lb/>
and Parliament is dissolved, their own affairs <lb/>
will occupy the minds of British statesmen, <lb/>
so that when again called together, for a short <lb/>
time in summer, it may be merely to legis<lb break="no"/>late on local matters, and our Confederation <lb/>
project may thus be indefinitely
delayed. <lb/>

it will be a severe blow to the cause of the <lb/>

Canada expressed in the United States for <lb/>
the last three years. They will, perhaps, <lb/>
turn north for further conquests, and try to <lb/>
humble a power which has not in every way <lb/>
met their wishes. We should, at all events, <lb/>
be prepared to meet such a contingency, <lb/>
prepared to repel attack, prepared to defend
<lb/>

which we live. I will conclude by saying <lb/>
that if the citizens of Montreal have been <lb/>
accused in former times of energy in a wrong <lb/>

will further <lb/>
say they have come to this country to find a <lb/>
home and they have found one, where they are <lb/>
not oppressed by any wrongs, where there is <lb/>
no invidious distinction between races and <lb/>
creeds. They appreciate the blessing and <lb/>
value of the institutions under which they <lb/>
live, they are ready to defend them, and <lb/>
they look on the union ot the British <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:PRIC1">HON. MR. PRICE</persName>—Honorable gentlemen, <lb/>
being one of the newly elected members of <lb/>
this House, I would like to say a few words, <lb/>
by way of defining my position, before the <lb/>
vote is taken. Although I have said that I <lb/>
was in favor of Confederation as the only <lb/>
means by which we could make proper pro<lb break="no"/>vision for our defence, yet, until I understood <lb/>
the details more clearly than
what I could <lb/>
learn from the resolutions, I could not make <lb/>
up my mind to vote for it. Previous to the <lb/>
declaration at the election in my division, the <lb/>
press had circulated the views of the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, and I went over the details so far as I <lb/>
was in possession of them, and the verdict of <lb/>
the people at the hustings was unanimously <lb/>
in favor of the scheme. (Hear, hear.)
I <lb/>
would like to enter into a discussion
of the <lb/>
details, clause by clause, but it is impossible <lb/>
to do so at the present time. It is not sur<lb break="no"/>prising that almost every member of the <lb/>
House is opposed to one or more of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions; it is impossible for us, even when we <lb/>
go into committee on almost any subject, to <lb/>
unanimously agree on all the clauses. Before <lb/>
going further wish to thank my honorable <lb/>
friend the gallant knight at the head of the <lb/>
Government, for his kind remarks with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to my father and myself, at the opening <lb/>
of this debate. For the last twenty years I <lb/>
have been known and resided in the consti<lb break="no"/>tuency which sent me here, and if I have been <lb/>
elected without much opposition, it was from <lb/>
friendship towards me on the part of my con<lb break="no"/>stituents. Although I represent people
hav<lb break="no"/>ing different religious views, yet I believe <lb/>
only twenty-six Protestant votes were given <lb/>
for me. I have had a great deal
of personal <lb/>
friendship and intercourse with the Roman <lb/>
Catholic clergy of Lower Canada, and must <lb/>
say I have always found them liberal and <lb/>
loyal in their views, and, as a
body, almost <lb/>

            <fw type="num">339</fw>
          unanimous in supporting the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, being convinced that it is the only <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">sortie</hi> from our present political troubles, and <lb/>
of our continuing under the
British Crown, <lb/>
knowing well the liberty that all subjects en<lb break="no"/>joy under it; and I feel certain that
if ever <lb/>
flie day comes to defend the British flag <lb/>
on this soil, while a shred is left on the <lb/>
staff they will be there to defend it. Being <lb/>
an elected member of this,House, who by <lb/>
this scheme may be offered a seat for life, <lb/>
beg to say that I care little for the chance; <lb/>
but I have been congratulated by my consti<lb break="no"/>tuents, on all sides, upon the prospect before <lb/>
me, and if I vote for the measure as it stands <lb/>
I shall not, therefore, in any way displease <lb/>
them. Although I voted for rendering this <lb/>
House elective, in 1856, yet I did so, contrary <lb/>
to my Own convictions, for the sole purpose <lb/>
of sustaining the Government, believing that <lb/>
this House should be a conservative body. I <lb/>
consider that this should be a special branch, <lb/>
where we should judge measures without re<lb break="no"/>ference to popular prejudices, if such a <lb/>
thing were possible. I think we are here to <lb/>
judge without that political partiality which <lb/>
actuates most of the members of the Lower <lb/>
House, some of whom got their seats by a <lb/>
majority of one. I am sure persons elected <lb/>
in that manner can hardly claim to represent <lb/>
the popular feeling of the country. For my <lb/>
part, I intend to vote for these
resolutions, <lb/>
for it becomes a matter of choice with us <lb/>
either to support them and thus become one <lb/>
strong Confederacy, or else by driblets into <lb/>
the American Union. (Hear,
hear.) I am <lb/>
fully convinced that we are tending rapidly <lb/>
towards annexation, and that the only thing <lb/>
that can save us is the formation of a strong <lb/>
Confederacy. And if that is not done imme<lb break="no"/>diately, I firmly believe that we shall let the <lb/>
golden opportunity slip, and will not again <lb/>
have the opportunity. Honorable gentlemen <lb/>
say that our debt will be rapidly increased <lb/>
under Confederation. Well, that is hard to <lb/>
say, but I think it quite likely it may in<lb break="no"/>crease slightly. But what would be our debt <lb/>
if we were annexed to the United States? <lb/>
What would our taxes be if we had a propor<lb break="no"/>tion of the enormous war debt of that country <lb/>
to pay, in addition to our own? For my <lb/>
part, believing as I do that this is the only <lb/>
hope of the country, and the present the only <lb/>
opportunity we shall have of carrying it <lb/>
through—and so far as I know it
is the only <lb/>
one—I should feel myself unworthy the posi<lb break="no"/>tion I hold if I did not vote in favor of it. <lb/>
It is the only practicable scheme that has <lb/>
 
            <cb/>
    ever come before the country for settling
the <lb/>
difficulties that have afiieted the country. <lb/>
For the past ten years, during which I have <lb/>
had the honor of being a representative of the <lb/>
people, there has always been a running fight <lb/>
between the ins and outs—first one side and <lb/>
then the other, contending for office, and the <lb/>
result has been anything but satisfactory to <lb/>
the country. I think if honorable members <lb/>
would take an impartial view of this question, <lb/>
and consider that we cannot alter the details, <lb/>
if we desired to do so, without defeating the <lb/>
whole, they would not hesitate to vote for it. <lb/>
As I understand it, the details in reference to <lb/>
the formation of our own local governments <lb/>
will be brought before us, and we shall <lb/>
then have ample opportunity of considering <lb/>
and amending them if we think it necessary. <lb/>

<lb/>
a celebrated writer on Representative Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but he did not go far enough. Mr. <lb/>

           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The consideration which tells most in my <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—The 34th sub-sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the same clause commits to the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government "the establishment of a <lb/>
general Court of Appeal for the Federated pro<lb break="no"/>vinces." Is that to be in lieu of the Courts <lb/>
of Appeal we now have? Is it intended to <lb/>
do away with the present Court of Appeal <lb/>
and to establish a new one? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—I do not think <lb/>
my honorable friend has caught the meaning <lb/>
of what is intended. It does not say the <lb/>
general Court of Appeal shall be established, <lb/>
but that the power to establish it shall be in <lb/>
the General Government. <lb/>

<lb/>
<persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—If a statute of <lb/>
the Parliament of the United Provinces shall <lb/>
be passed creating a Court of Appeal, it will <lb/>
state whether it is in lieu of, or in addition <lb/>
to, the present Courts of Appeal. I should <lb/>
suppose it would be in addition. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I think that point <lb/>
is one which we ought to understand before <lb/>
giving a final vote; and I do not think the <lb/>
Hon. Commissioner of Crown
Lands, with <lb/>
reference to it, has fulfilled his promise to <lb/>
give an explicit answer to any question which <lb/>
might be put, to elicit further information <lb/>
about the scheme. Then the 43rd clause <lb/>
gives the Nova Scotia Legislature power to <lb/>
make laws respecting export duties on coal. <lb/>
What is the meaning of that ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—I thought I <lb/>
had explained that the export duty there <lb/>
was almost synonymous with our royalty. It <lb/>
is levied in lieu of a royalty at the mine; <lb/>
and we therefore permit the Nova Scotia <lb/>
Government to exact it on coal coming to <lb/>
this country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <lb/>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman must see it cannot be a royalty, be<lb break="no"/>cause the royalty must apply to all coal con<lb break="no"/>sumed in the Province of Nova
Scotia, while <lb/>
the export duty only applies to coal exported <lb/>
from that province. The 9th sub-section
<lb/>
of that clause imposes on the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, " the establishment, maintenance and <lb/>
management of penitentiaries, and of public <lb/>
and reformatory prisons." There is but one <lb/>
penitentiary
in Canada, which is situated in <lb/>
Upper Canada.  Does this clause impose on <lb/>

the
Local Legislature of Lower Canada
the <lb/>
construction and maintenance of a new Peni<lb break="no"/>tentiary, leaving to Upper Canada
the Peni<lb break="no"/>tentiary now in existence in that province? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—No
doubt; but <lb/>
Lower Canada may arrange with Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada for the temporary use of the Peniten<lb break="no"/>tiary, so long as she requires it, or for its per<lb break="no"/>manent use, if that is thought better. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—By the 6th sub<lb break="no"/>section the local legislatures have the control <lb/>
of " Education; saving the rights and privil<lb break="no"/>eges which the Protestant or Catholic minor<lb break="no"/>ity in both Canadas may possess as to their <lb/>
denominational schools at the time when <lb/>
the union into operation." I do not <lb/>
know whether the representations which <lb/>
have been made in some portions of the <lb/>
country are correct—that, under this section,
<lb/>
the Roman Catholics would be entitled to no <lb/>
more schools than they have at the passing of <lb/>
the act? Will the Commissioner of Crown <lb/>
Lands please explain ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—By this section <lb/>
it is affirmed that the principle of action with <lb/>
reference to those schools which may be in <lb/>
existence at the time the Confederation takes <lb/>
effect, shall continue in operation. Should <lb/>
this Parliament and the other legislatures <lb/>
adopt the scheme, and if the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment adopts an act giving effect to it, there <lb/>
will be found in existence
certain principles <lb/>
by which the minorities in Upper
and Lower <lb/>
Canada will be respectively protected, and <lb/>
those principles will continue in operation. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—But suppose no <lb/>
alteration is made in the Common School Law <lb/>
of Upper Canada—and, as I understand, none <lb/>
is promised—would the Roman Catholics be <lb/>
entitled to establish more separate schools ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—The present <lb/>
Act would continue to operate, and the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman knows what are the rights of <lb/>
Roman Catholic schools under that Act. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON.
MR. CURRIE</persName>—That is the way in <lb/>
which I understand it. With reference to <lb/>
the 61st clause, I would-ask is it proposed, at <lb/>
this session of the Legislature, to arrange the <lb/>
balance of the debt—not taken into the Con<lb break="no"/>federation—between Upper and Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—It is proposed, <lb/>
before any Federation scheme goes into oper<lb break="no"/>ation, that the debt shall be
arranged between <lb/>
Up and Lower Canada. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. 
MR. CURRIE</persName>—In the 64th section <lb/>
it is provided that, "in
consideration of the <lb/>
tranfer to the General Parliament of the <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
 powers of taxation, an annual grant in
aid of <lb/>
each province shall he made, equal to eighty <lb/>
cents per head of the population, as establish<lb break="no"/>ed by the census of 1861; the population of <lb/>
Newfoundland being estimated at 130,000." <lb/>
Would the Commissioner of Crown Lands <lb/>
state why the population of Newfoundland is <lb/>
to be estimated at 130,000, while the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the other provinces is taken according <lb/>
to the census of 1861—Newfoundland
thus <lb/>
being allowed 8,000 of a population more than <lb/>
it would be entitled to under the census, and <lb/>
being allowed to take in on that basis $200,<lb break="no"/>000 more of debt, and also receiving more <lb/>
subsidy than it would otherwise be entitled <lb/>
to? If we are to assume that the population of <lb/>
Newfoundland increased 8,000 between 1861 <lb/>
and 1864 or 1865, why should not a similar <lb/>
increase be allowed to Canada? Assuming <lb/>
that the population of Canada increased at no <lb/>
more rapid rate, we would have an increase of <lb/>
160,000, which would entitle us to go into <lb/>
the Confederation with a debt exceeding that ' <lb/>
with which we now go in of upwards of $4,<lb break="no"/>000,000, and which would give us $130,000 <lb/>
a year more of subsidy. I cannot understand <lb/>
why the population of Newfoundland should <lb/>
be taken at 130,000, when all the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—most of them, at all events, increasing <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> in population much more rapidly than New<lb break="no"/>foundland—go in with the population ascer<lb break="no"/>tained by the census of 1861. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—The reason is <lb/>
just this, that there happened to be no census <lb/>
taken in Newfoundland in 1861. The last <lb/>
census there was some years before—I think <lb/>
in 1857. The estimated increase, if I recol<lb break="no"/>lect rightly, was based on the increase which <lb/>
had taken place during the period between the <lb/>
previous census and that of 1857; and, taking <lb/>
that ratio of increase, it was found that the <lb/>
population, at the time of the union, would be <lb/>
close upon 130,000. We therefore put it at <lb/>
that fi re. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is right in saying that the last census <lb/>
of Newfoundland was taken in 1857; but the <lb/>
increase should have been reckoned only for a <lb/>
period of four years, and I can scarcely be<lb break="no"/>lieve that Newfoundland could be entitled to <lb/>
an increase of 8,000 in its population in four <lb/>
years, giving to that colony the benefit of <lb/>
four years' increase more than Canada. Our <lb/>
census was taken in 1861. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON.
MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—Not at all; we <lb/>
all go in with the amounts of our respective <lb/>
populations estimated at the same time; 130,<lb break="no"/>000 was the estimated population
of New<lb break="no"/><pb n="342" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0342.jpg"/><fw type="num">342</fw>foundland at that date. We had no desire
to <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> give Newfoundland any advantage. Its
popu<lb break="no"/>lation was estimated at 130,000 at the time <lb/>
at which the populations of the other provin<lb break="no"/>ces were taken.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Perhaps the Hon. <lb/>
Commissioner of Crown Lands will inform us <lb/>
whether, in stating the revenues of the various <lb/>
provinces, the customs revenue raised on <lb/>
goods exported from one province to another <lb/>
was taken into account? Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, in 1861, paid customs duties amounting <lb/>
to £17,769 sterling; of that, only £11,096 <lb/>
was paid on goods imported from foreign <lb/>
countries, or countries other than those which, <lb/>
it is proposed, shall form part of this union; <lb/>
so that the people of that island paid only <lb/>
about 70 cents per head in duties on goods <lb/>
brought in from countries outside the proposed <lb/>
Confederation. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—What do you <lb/>
make the total customs revenue of Prince d- <lb break="yes"/>
ward Island for that year? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Seventeen
thousand <lb/>
seven hundred and sixty-nine pounds sterling. <lb/>
Great Britain furnished the largest proportion <lb/>
of the imports; then Nova Scotia; then the <lb/>
United States; then New Brunswick. The <lb/>
whole duties, as I have said, paid on
goods <lb/>
coming from other countries than the British <lb/>
Provinces, were £11,096, or about two-thirds <lb/>
of the entire customs revenue. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—I suppose the <lb/>
person who was probably the best informed <lb/>
about the state of the revenue in Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, was the Secretary of the <lb/>
Treasury, Hon. Mr. POPE; and our estimate <lb/>
of the revenue of that island was based on <lb/>
a printed return which Mr. POPE handed <lb/>
round among the members of the Conference, <lb/>
informing us what had been the revenue of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island in 1863, and for a <lb/>
series of years before 1863. In the same way <lb/>
Hon. Mr. TILLEY furnished the statement of <lb/>
revenue for New Brunswick, Dr. TUPPER for <lb/>
Nova Scotia, and Hon. Mr. GALT for Canada; <lb/>
and on these statements furnished by the <lb/>
Ministers of Finance for the various pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the estimates were based. I observe <lb/>
that the Minister of Finance, Hon. Mr. GALT <lb/>
in a speech delivered elsewhere, puts down the <lb/>
total revenue of Prince Edward Island at <lb/>
$197,000, all of which is from
customs and <lb/>
excise, save about $32,000. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ALEX1">HON. MR. ALEXANDER</persName>—My hon. <lb/>
friend from Niagara (Hon. Mr. CURRIE) in <lb/>
his own speech stated the revenue of Prince <lb/>
Edward Island at $153,000. <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
     
 <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName> then rose to wind <lb/>
up the debate, with a general reply. He <lb/>
said:—Hon. gentlemen, I was very anxious <lb/>
that ample opportunity should be given to the <lb/>
members of this Honorable House to express <lb/>
their opinions on the matter which has been <lb/>
for the last two or three weeks under debate. <lb/>
And now as I see no member disposed to rise, <lb/>
with the view of offering any further remarks. <lb/>
I think the time has come when the debate <lb/>
may be closed, if such is the pleasure of the <lb/>
House. I commenced, hon. gentlemen, to <lb/>
take notes—pretty copious notes—with the <lb/>
view of answering the statements and argu<lb break="no"/>ments of hon. gentlemen who have spoken in <lb/>
opposition to the scheme. But, at the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion of some of my friends, I have taken <lb/>
my pen and crossed out all these notes<lb break="no"/>(hear, hear)—by way of compromise, if I <lb/>
may so express my —(laughter)—and in <lb/>
order that might not provoke further dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. I hope that this sacrifice of mine<lb break="no"/>for it is a sacrifice—(laughter)—will be taken <lb/>
in good part, and that the few remarks I have <lb/>
now to make will not be of a nature to provoke <lb/>
any reply. In the first place, I must answer <lb/>
a question that was put to me, I think by my <lb/>
hon. friend from St. Clair Division (Hon. <lb/>
Mr. VIDAL). He said he did not understand <lb/>
exactly what I meant by the province being <lb/>
at the top of an inclined plane. It is true <lb/>
that in going over very rapidly the different
<lb/>
topics on which I touched, I did not explain <lb/>
that figure very fully. But I stated that the <lb/>
province stood in a twofold danger—of being <lb/>
dragged violently into the American Union, <lb/>
and, in the next place, as we stood on an in<lb break="no"/>clined plane, of slipping down gradually, and <lb/>
without our being aware of it, into the vortex <lb/>
below. It seems to me that the thing was <lb/>
plain enough. Still, as I am a Frenchman, <lb/>
and cannot express myself in English in the <lb/>
manner I would like, I think I should be <lb/>
allowed the privilege which is conceded to per<lb break="no"/>sons belonging to certain foreign nationalities. <lb/>
For instance, they say that an Englishman is <lb/>
allowed to speak once, an Irishman twice-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">AN HON. MEMBER</persName>—Three times. <lb/>
(Laughter.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÊ</persName>—Well, three <lb/>
times be it; that is still better. And a <lb/>
Dutchman as long as he finds it necessary, <lb/>
until he can make himself understood. Well, <lb/>
I want to have the privilege allowed to the <lb/>
Dutchman. (Laughter.) As to being
drawn <lb/>
violently into the American Union, if this <lb/>
scheme of Confederation does not take place, <lb/>it seems to me that that might be a very pro<lb break="no"/><pb n="343" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0343.jpg"/><fw type="num">343</fw>bable result of our position. Suppose war
was <lb/>
declared late in autumn, at the close
of navi<lb break="no"/>gation—with the little means we have here of <lb/>
defending ourselves, we would be placed for <lb/>
five months in a very disagreeable and trying <lb/>
position, having no opportunity of obtaining <lb/>
the powerful succour of the Mother Country. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) That must be so easily under<lb break="no"/>stood, that I shall make no further remark <lb/>
upon it. But, my statement about the pro- <lb break="yes"/>
vines being placed upon an inclined plane may <lb/>
require some little comment and explanation. <lb/>
I say that, if we do not cultivate with our <lb/>
sister provinces—the Maritime Provinces—a <lb/>
close commercial, political, and social inter<lb break="no"/>course—being all of us British subjects, all <lb/>
of us monarchists, owing allegiance to the <lb/>
same Crown—if we neglect the cultivation of <lb/>
that intercourse, we run a great danger. We <lb/>
are, in our present position, small, isolated <lb/>
bodies, and it may probably be with us, as <lb/>
in the physical world, where a large body <lb/>
attracts to itself the smaller bodies within the <lb/>
sphere of its influence. If we do not make <lb/>
those alliances with the Lower Provinces—if <lb/>
we do not open with them those communica<lb break="no"/>tions, political, social, and commercial, which <lb/>
are essential for our own
interest, we shall <lb/>
little by little lose some of those principles <lb/>
we now esteem so much; we shall lose little by <lb/>
little our attachment to the Mother Country, <lb/>
and the interesting reminiscences which, with <lb/>
many of us, now give intensity to that attach<lb break="no"/>ment; and we shall become—you
may depend <lb/>
upon it, hon. gentlemen—more and more de<lb break="no"/>mocratised, before we are aware of it. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) And really, hon. gentlemen, if I <lb/>
were to form my opinion by some of the <lb/>
speeches which we have heard in this Honor<lb break="no"/>able House since this debate was opened, I <lb/>
think there are some hon. gentlemen who,
<lb/>
from the way in which they have expressed <lb/>
themselves, might be supposed to be—although <lb/>
I hope in reality they are not—already half <lb/>
way down the inclined plane. (Hear, hear <lb/>
and laughter.) Well, hon. gentlemen, I say <lb/>
that if we want to avoid that, we must have <lb/>
a Federal union with our fellow-subjects of <lb/>
the British Provinces, and that besides we <lb/>
must have easy means of access to the sea<lb break="no"/>board, so that, in case of danger, help can <lb/>
be immediately forwarded to Canada and to all <lb/>
parts of this Federal union, and
that we may <lb/>
have a powerful army of Great Britain coming <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> here as an auxiliary to the defence which I <lb/>
hope we shall be able to make ourselves. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) An honorable gentleman has <lb/>
stated that expressed myself to
the effect <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
         
that, if this Confederation did not take
place, <lb/>
Canada could not become prosperous. I never <lb/>
said anything of the kind. I said expressly <lb/>
the contrary. Perhaps I may not precisely <lb/>
apprehend the meaning of the word "pros<lb break="no"/>perous." But I said this, that Canada had <lb/>
within itself all the means to become popul<lb break="no"/>ous, to become wealthy, to become a great <lb/>people. But on the other hand, I said that <lb/>
Canada and the other British American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, without union, could not become a <lb/>
"powerful," as distinguished from a pros<lb break="no"/>perous people. I said that we in Canada <lb/>
could not become a powerful people unless we <lb/>
had some maritime elements, unless we had <lb/>
the means, by having harbors and ports of <lb/>
our own open at all seasons, of communicating <lb/>
freely with all the nations of the world. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) That is what I said. I never <lb/>
stated that Canada could not become prosper<lb break="no"/>ous, make money, and so forth. No; I think <lb/>
Canada can do that; but Canada, even though <lb/>
its population should reach forty millions<lb break="no"/>which it may in a century hence—can
never <lb/>
be a powerful nation, unless its power is felt <lb/>
all over the world; and how can its power he <lb/>
so felt, unless it has its seaports open all the <lb/>
year round? (Hear, hear.) And I
said-<lb/>
"Point out to me the nation in this world <lb/>
which is powerful, that has not some maritime <lb/>
elements." I say there is no one in the <lb/>
world. Every nation whose power has been <lb/>
felt over the globe, has been a nation that <lb/>
had some maritime outlet. But Canada, <lb/>
situated as it is, is in great want of free ac<lb break="no"/>cess to the sea; and, as long as we are shut <lb/>
up, during five months of the year. without <lb/>
being able to communicate with the rest of <lb/>
the world—for, notwithstanding our fine <lb/>
river, we cannot be said to have a real mari<lb break="no"/>time element—we are in truth a dependent <lb/>
people. (Hear, hear.) I have some notes in <lb/>
French, made with the intention of answering <lb/>
honorable gentlemen who spoke in that lan<lb break="no"/>guage; but I think, having commenced, that <lb/>
will go on in English. It has been asked by <lb/>
several honorable gentlemen how we were to <lb/>
make provision for the protection of the min<lb break="no"/>orities in Upper and Lower Canada respec<lb break="no"/>tively. We have in Upper Canada a Catho<lb break="no"/>lic minority, in Lower Canada a Protestant <lb/>
minority. Well, those minorities are now in <lb/>
possession of certain rights; and,
if we were <lb/>
not to legislate at all upon those rights, my <lb/>
interpretation of the scheme is, that they <lb/>
would still, under the local governments, en<lb break="no"/>joy the rights which they now
possess. But <lb/>
it has been provided that, if necessary, addi<lb break="no"/><pb n="344" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0344.jpg"/><fw type="num">344</fw>tional protection
shall be afforded; and in that <lb/>
case, I say, without hesitation, that what will <lb/>
be done for one portion of the country will <lb/>
also be done for the other
portions—<hi rendition="simple:italic">justice <lb/>
égale distributive</hi>. (Hear, hear.) Honorable <lb/>
gentlemen have said that we have merely <lb/>
submitted the general scheme of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and they have called upon us to <lb/>
give details—details about the School bill, <lb/>
details about the local governments, and <lb/>
the immense string of other details em<lb break="no"/>braced in the amendment moved the other day <lb/>
by my hon. friend from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. <lb/>
LETELLIER DE ST. JUST), which I
am sure was <lb/>
at least a fathom long, and a very long fathom <lb/>
too. ( Laughter.) Now, suppose we had all <lb/>
these matters before us, could we really digest <lb/>
such a mass of information as hon. gentlemen <lb/>
have asked for? It seems to me it would <lb/>
be like introducing liquids into a vessel whose <lb/>
month is very small; if you throw in the <lb/>
liquid rapidly and in two great quantities, the <lb/>
vessel will be overflowed, and the fluid won't <lb/>
be got into it. I think we have enough before <lb/>
us at present, when we have the principal <lb/>
matter, without the accessories. For, what <lb/>
would be the use of the accessories if you reject <lb/>
the principle? (Hear, hear.) Depend upon <lb/>
it, as soon as these resolutions are concurred <lb/>
in, then the details will be given one after the <lb/>
other; and I trust they will be of such a <lb/>
nature as to meet with the approval of the <lb/>
majority of this Honorable House. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Some hon. gentlemen have told us <lb/>
that this was not a Federal union—that the <lb/>
project before you, hon. gentlemen, was in <lb/>
point of fact a project for a Legislative union. <lb/>
One hon. gentleman who took this view read <lb/>
the 29th section, in order to shew that the <lb/>
General Government, if it chose, could repeal <lb/>
any of the local acts of the different local <lb/>
legislatures—that the General Government, <lb/>
for instance, could do away with our religious <lb/>
and benevolent corporations, or deprive them <lb/>
of their property. I think the honorable <lb/>
gentleman must have been rather short-sighted <lb/>
when he read the 29th resolution, for he <lb/>
omitted a very important part of it; and, <lb/>
if he had not omitted that part, I do not <lb/>
think he would have said that this Federal <lb/>
scheme was really a scheme for a Legislative <lb/>
union. I have no doubt my honorable <lb/>
friend acted in good faith; but being rather <lb/>
short-sighted, he did not read the whole clause; <lb/>
otherwise he must have arrived at a different <lb/>
conclusion. The 29th section says: "The <lb/>
General Parliament shall have
power to <lb/>
make laws for the peace, welfare and good <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
          
government of the Federated Provinces
(sav<lb break="no"/>ing the sovereignty of England),
and especial<lb break="no"/>ly laws respecting the following subjects." <lb/>
Then follows a list of all the subjects com<lb break="no"/>mitted to the General Government. But the <lb/>
resolution does not finish there. There is <lb/>
something that comes after all that, and it is <lb/>
this: "And generally respecting all matters <lb/>
of a general character, not specially and ex<lb break="no"/>clusively reserved for the local governments <lb/>
and legislatures." Now I would ask honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen if an act incorporating a re<lb break="no"/>ligious body or benevolent society here in <lb/>
Lower Canada is a subject of a general char<lb break="no"/>acter; is it not a subject purely local? (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Take, for instance, the sisters of <lb/>
charity. Could the General Government, <lb/>
under this clause, interfere with the privileges <lb/>
of those ladies? I say they could not. I <lb/>
suppose the honorable gentleman who used <lb/>
the argument advanced it conscientiously and <lb/>
in good faith. But I think it is quite evident <lb/>
from a reading of the resolution that, if Con<lb break="no"/>federation takes place, the General Government <lb/>
will have no power to interfere with such mat<lb break="no"/>ters. (Hear, hear.) I must say positively, <lb/>
if I am competent to draw any conclusion at <lb/>
all from what I read, that the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment will have no right to meddle at all <lb/>
with those religious and
benevolent corpora<lb break="no"/>tions, none in the world. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
Remarks have also been made about the laws <lb/>
of divorce and marriage, and the honorable <lb/>
member for the division of DeLanaudiére <lb/>
(Hon. Mr. OLIVIER) told us that the Con<lb break="no"/>ference had done well in transferring the <lb/>
power of divorce to the General Government. <lb/>
On his part, I think this was a wise view of <lb/>
the question, and I am glad to have the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of now telling him so. He was, ow- <lb break="yes"/>
ever, very uneasy about the word "marriage." <lb/>
Well, I will try to put him right and at his <lb/>
case on that point; and I will give him the <lb/>
answer as I find it put down in writing, so <lb/>
that no possible misunderstanding may con<lb break="no"/>tinue to exist. If the honorable gentleman <lb/>
will but take his pen, he will be able to note <lb/>
my answer :—"The word 'marriage' has been
<lb/>
inserted to give the General Legislature the <lb/>
right to decide what form of marriage will be <lb/>
legal in all parts of the Confederation, without <lb/>
in any way interfering with the rules and <lb/>
prescriptions of the Church to which the con<lb break="no"/>tracting parties belong." Another honorable <lb/>
gentleman—I think the honorable
member for <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>DeLorimier (Hon. Mr. BUREAU)—asked me <lb/>
if the General Government would be respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the debts contracted by Canada
<lb/>
         
            <pb n="345" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0345.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">345</fw>
        
prior to the Federal union? I replied "
Yes, <lb/>
the General Government would be liable <lb/>
for all the debts contracted before this <lb/>
date." "But," says he, " there are certain <lb/>
sums above the sixty-two and a half mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars which will have to be settled <lb/>
as between Upper and Lower Canada. And <lb/>
what will become of the amount due to the <lb/>
seigniors? It may be that Lower Canada <lb/>
will repudiate that portion of the debt so <lb/>
allotted her." Well, I reply, Lower Canada <lb/>
cannot do that, if she were 'disposed to do so; <lb/>
but I do not believe that Lower Canada would <lb/>
be disposed to repudiate a debt which she has <lb/>
herself contracted—a debt of honor—a debt <lb/>
which is, as it were, sacred. But even if <lb/>
Lower Canada were disposed to do so, the <lb/>
General Government are liable for the amount <lb/>
of that debt, and as the General Government <lb/>
has to give to Lower Canada a subsidy of 80 <lb/>
cents per head, it would, of course, take very <lb/>
good care to substract from the amount allotted <lb/>
to Lower Canada the interest
which is to be <lb/>
paid to the seigniors. (Hear, hear.) So that <lb/>
on that score—I do not know if the hon. <lb/>
gentleman is himself a seignior or not, but <lb/>
he seems to take a great interest in the seig<lb break="no"/>niors—the hon. member need not be uneasy <lb/>
at all. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BURE2">HON. MR. BUREAU</persName>—What I stated was, <lb/>
that under the authority of a public act, <lb/>
special appropriations have been made for the <lb/>
redemption of the debt due to the seigniors, <lb/>
and that the putting aside of that act I consider <lb/>
an act of repudiation. Then, for the sake of <lb/>
argument I stated this, that you are shewing <lb/>
an example of repudiation. But I added that <lb/>
if you were going to pay to Lower Canada <lb/>
what you state, or her Local Government; <lb/>
in the event of her refusing to pay the seig<lb break="no"/>niors, probably the General Government would <lb/>
retain sufficient from the 80 cents per
head <lb/>
apportionment for that purpose. I do not <lb/>
wish to push the argument further; and I <lb/>
may state that it was only for the sake of <lb/>
argument that I advanced the proposition. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON.
SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>— No law has <lb/>
been repealed—no repudiation taken place. <lb/>
The seignors, as it appears to me—I may not <lb/>
have understood the law, for I am no lawyer <lb/>
—will have additional security. That, it <lb/>
seems to me, is a plain fact. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
Then the hon. member from DeLorimier found <lb/>
a great deal of fault with the manner—I must <lb/>
say the able manner in which the
gallant <lb/>
Knight (Hon. Sir N. F. BELLEAU) explained <lb/>
the action of responsible government in this <lb/>
country. The honorable Knight showed
how <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
 responsible government protected the
French <lb/>
Catholics in Lower Canada under Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, saying that if ever an act of flagrant <lb/>
injustice was to be attempted in the Federal <lb/>
Government, the whole of the Lower Canadians <lb/>
would join as one man, and by uniting with <lb/>
the minority against the Government—be<lb break="no"/>cause honorable gentlemen must know that <lb/>
there always will be minorities—by means of <lb/>
thus strengthening the minority any Admin<lb break="no"/>istration could be ousted out of their places in <lb/>
twenty-four hours. My honorable friend <lb/>
stated this, and be state it justly; he said <lb/>
so, well aware of what he was saying . But <lb/>
the honorable gentleman from DeLorimier <lb/>
comes forward and says: " Don't you recol<lb break="no"/>lect that at one time the Upper Canadians <lb/>
with the minority from Lower Canada, united <lb/>
to impose upon Lower Canada their will?" I <lb/>
tell you, honorable gentlemen, that they never <lb/>
did harm to Lower Canada, and that they <lb/>
never could do harm to Lower Canada had <lb/>
the so chosen. And why? The French <lb/>
had the use of their own language conceded <lb/>
to them in order to bring them to support the <lb/>
Government, and much more would have been <lb/>
done to accomplish the same end. I am re<lb break="no"/>ferring now to the Government of the day <lb/>
from 1844 to 1848. That Government would <lb/>
have given you, what was passed afterwards, <lb/>
an act to secure to the sufferers the payment <lb/>
of their losses, the Rebellion Losses Bill-<lb/>They would have given every shilling of those <lb/>
losses, and they would have given you more <lb/>
if you would have consented to become their <lb/>
followers. The honorable gentleman made <lb/>
out no case at all, and he could not have <lb/>
studied parliamentary history since 1841 cor<lb break="no"/>rectly. Had he done so, he would have found <lb/>
that at that period what was called responsi<lb break="no"/>ble government was not worked out. Sir <lb/>
CHARLES BAGOT, it is true, had
lent himself <lb/>
to the views of his advisers, and responsible <lb/>
government had been going on
perfectly un<lb break="no"/>der him; but then he died here, and
honora<lb break="no"/>ble gentlemen must understand that Lord <lb/>
METCALF was opposed to responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BURE2">HON. MR. BUREAU</persName>—Still we had re<lb break="no"/>sponsible government. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—You had it in <lb/>
name only, but not in practice; otherwise Hon. <lb/>
Mr. BALDWIN and on. Mr. LAFONTAINE <lb/>
would never have left the Cabinet. They re<lb break="no"/>signed their seats in Council because they held <lb/>
themselves responsible to Parliament, while <lb/>
Lord METCALF chose to appoint
persons to office <lb/>
without consulting them, as his constitutional <lb/>
          
            <pb n="346" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-20_Page_0346.jpg"/>

advisers. Well, then, I assert that the case <lb/>
the honorable gentleman has cited to show <lb/>
that my honorable friend on the other side <lb/>
was wrong, is no case at all. It is not appli<lb break="no"/>cable in any respect to present circumstances, <lb/>
because, I repeat it again. we had not respon<lb break="no"/>sible government at that time. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BURE2">Hon. MR. BUREAU</persName>—We have not<lb/>
responsible government yet,
then. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">Hon. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—How does the <lb/>
honorable gentleman make that out? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BURE2">HON. MR. BUREAU</persName>—The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has stated that since the death of <lb/>
Lord BAGOT we have not had responsible <lb/>
government. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—The honorable <lb/>
gentleman cannot surely have
understood me. <lb/>
I think I said that under Lord METCALF <lb/>
there was responsible government in name <lb/>
but not in deed. And if the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man will study our parliamentary history a <lb/>
little closer, he will admit that such was the <lb/>
case. The consequence was, as I have already <lb/>
stated, the resignation of Hon. Messrs. LAFON<lb break="no"/>TAINE and BALDWIN. Still the Lower
Cana<lb break="no"/>dian party was unbroken. It is true the new <lb/>
advisers of Lord METCALF coquetted much <lb/>
with that majority to obtain adhesion; but it <lb/>
was in vain. They remained firm to the <lb/>
last, until the general election of 1848 brought <lb/>
back the parties to Parliament in much about <lb/>
their natural strength. I have already stated <lb/>
that I have destroyed my notes, and I am <lb/>
ready to await the verdict of this honorable <lb/>
House. (Applause) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:VIDA1">HON. MR. VIDAL</persName> said—Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, as I consider it my duty to vote for <lb/>
the motion now before the House, I think it <lb/>
desirable to clear myself from the imputation <lb/>
of inconsistency in having supported the <lb/>
amendments which have been proposed. and <lb/>
which the House has rejected. I may state <lb/>
that my views as to the desirableness of sub<lb break="no"/>mitting the question to the people are un<lb break="no"/>changed; the plan has been voted down, but no <lb/>
argument has been adduced to demonstrate that <lb/>
it was wrong in principle, or likely to destroy <lb/>
the scheme. I have previously expressed my <lb/>
general approval of the Confederation, and that <lb/>
my desire was to secure its permanency by <lb/>
having its foundation broad and deep in the <lb/>
expressed approval of the people. Submission <lb/>
of the proposal to them has been refused, and <lb/>
the only question now for me to decide is <lb/>
whether I should accept the scheme as it is, <lb/>
or vote for its rejection altogether. Under <lb/>
these circumstances, I have no difficulty
in<lb/>
        
            <cb/> 
         
 deciding that I must support the motion
for <lb/>
its adoption. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
