     not only deserves, but which I am confident 
     <lb/>
     will receive, the hearty support of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives and of the people of this province, 
     <lb/>
     and to which I, for one, shall feel it my duty 
     <lb/>
     to give my warmest and most cordial sanction.

     <persName ref="pers:BURW1">MR. BURWELL</persName>, in resuming the debate 
     <lb/>
     upon Confederation, said-—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     before allowing a measure of this importance 
     <lb/>
     to go through the House, I feel it my duty 
     <lb/>
     to ofler a few words upon it. The question 
     <lb/>
     of Federation is not a new one to my consti<lb break="no"/>tuents. Ever since the Reform Convention 
     <lb/>
     in Toronto, in 1859, they have been quite 
     <lb/>
     familiar with it. At the general election in 
     <lb/>
     1861, in an address to my constituents, I 
     <lb/>
     stated that in case we should not be able to 
     <lb/>
     get representation by population, I would 
     <lb/>
     be in favor of Federation of the two provin<lb break="no"/>ces of Canada, with a Local Government in 
     <lb/>
     each province and a Central Government to 
     <lb/>
     administer matters common to both, provi<lb break="no"/>sion to be made to admit the Eastern Provin<lb break="no"/>ces and the North-West territory, should they 
     <lb/>
     see fit to enter the union, of course with the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of Great Britain. And at the last 
     <lb/>
     general election in 1863, I addressed them 
     <lb/>
     in precisely the same language. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The agitation for constitutional 
     <lb/>
     changes had been so general and persistent 
     <lb/>
     for a length of time in Upper Canada, that 
     <lb/>
     it was impossible to all appearance to stave 
     <lb/>
     off much longer some action in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the difficulty. Efforts were made at different 
     <lb/>
     times to secure represention by popu<lb break="no"/>lation as a remedy, but without success. 
     <lb/>
     The nearest approach to a remedy for the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty under which Upper Canada labors, 
     <lb/>
     is, in my opinion, the resolutions of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Conference now before the House, 
     <lb/>
     and the question for consideration is whether 
     <lb/>
     they are acceptable to us and our people, or 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     not. The principle of Federation, in my view 
     <lb/>
     has been a great success on this continent 
     <lb/>
     I think that, if we look to the history of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, it cannot be denied that there 
     <lb/>
     as a principle of free government, it has 
     <lb/>
     been successful; and I doubt whether his<lb break="no"/>tory records a like example, under ordinary 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, of such great success and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. The present trouble in that 
     <lb/>
     country—the war now raging there—is not in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion attributable to the federative 
     <lb/>
     form of government adopted there. I at<lb break="no"/>tribute it to different causes altogether 
     <lb/>
     which might have existed, had it been. 
     <lb/>
     monarchical or a despotic government that 
     <lb/>
     prevailed. Slavery existed there and was 
     <lb/>
     the cause of the war. It was opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the age, and had to be eradicated 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There were, no doubt, other 
     <lb/>
     causes which had some inffuence in bringing 
     <lb/>
     it about; such, for instance, as the desire of 
     <lb/>
     the North for a high protective tariff to en 
     <lb/>
     courage its domestic manufactures, and the 
     <lb/>
     opposing interest of the South in favor of 
     <lb/>
     free trade, so that, manufacturing nothing 
     <lb/>
     itself, it might have all the benefit of cheap 
     <lb/>
     importations. These, sir, I conceive were 
     <lb/>
     the two great causes of the difficulty in the 
     <lb/>
     United States. Now, in forming a Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government in these provinces, I think we 
     <lb/>
     should look for an example to a people who 
     <lb/>
     are similar to us in situation, habits and 
     <lb/>
     customs. I find that example in the people 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. (Hear, hear.) My 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Lambton cited the 
     <lb/>
     example of a great many other countries 
     <lb/>
     but they were not not perhaps accus<lb break="no"/>tomed so much to free government as the 
     <lb/>
     United States; for it was not Federation 
     <lb/>
     that first gave them liberty, the old colonies 
     <lb/>
     of New England enjoying a large share of 
     <lb/>
     liberty long before the adoption of Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government by them. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     plan preposed by the Conference at Quebec 
     <lb/>
     is, in my opinion, too restrictive, as regards 
     <lb/>
     the power of the Local Legislatures. It 
     <lb/>
    gives too much power to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I am one of those, sir, who believes 
     <lb/>that the appointment of the deputy or 
     <lb/>lieutenant governors should not be in the 
     <lb/>gift of the General Government, but that 
     <lb/>they should be elected by the people 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I believe, too, that the 
     <lb/>members of the Legislative Council should 
     <lb/>be elected by the people. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>There is no element in this country— no. 
     <lb/>class in this country, nor do I think it 
     <lb/>possible to create a class—the counterpart of 
     <lb/>
           
    
            <pb n="447" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0447.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num"></fw>
          
     the class that composes the House of Lords 
     <lb/>
     in England. The British Government is 
     <lb/>
     undoubtedly the best-balanced government 
     <lb/>
     in the world; but we cannot exactly copy 
     <lb/>
     the system here, because of the absence of 
     <lb/>
     the class to which I have referred. The 
     <lb/>
     nearest approach that we can have to the 
     <lb/>
     House of Lords is, in my opinion, an 
     <lb/>
     elective Legislative Council, the members 
     <lb/>
     of which shall hold office for an extended 
     <lb/>
     period. My hon. friend from Lambton, in 
     <lb/>
     the very excellent speech he made to the 
     <lb/>
     House yesterday, said that if both Houses 
     <lb/>
     were made elective their circumstances and 
     <lb/>
     powers would be so similar that neither 
     <lb/>
     would be a check upon the other; but I 
     <lb/>
     contend that if we had an elective 
     <lb/>
     Upper House, with the members repre<lb break="no"/>senting larger constituencies and elected 
     <lb/>
     for a longer period than the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower House, it would be less liable to be 
     <lb/>
     influenced by every change of public opinion, 
     <lb/>
     and conservative enough in its character to 
     <lb/>
     be a wholesome check upon rash and hasty 
     <lb/>
     legislation. (Hear, hear.) But although 
     <lb/>
     the scheme now proposed does not make 
     <lb/>
     these provisions, there are many things in 
     <lb/>
     it that I can approve of. That the General 
     <lb/>
     Government should have control over many 
     <lb/>
     matters committed to it by the scheme is, I 
     <lb/>
     think, quite right. The customs is a branch 
     <lb/>
     of the administration that has ramifications 
     <lb/>
     throughout the whole country, and it and 
     <lb/>
     the appointments connected with it should 
     <lb/>
     be in the hands of the General Government. 
     <lb/>
     So, too, with regard to the post office, which 
     <lb/>
     affects the whole country, and should be 
     <lb/>
     under the same control. The militia and all 
     <lb/>
     matters connected with the defence of the 
     <lb/>
     country should also be placed under the con<lb break="no"/>trol of the Central Government; and the 
     <lb/>
     scheme would be defective if it were other<lb break="no"/>wise: I think there is no question more 
     <lb/>
     important now to us than that of defence. 
     <lb/>
     A military spirit seems to have seized the 
     <lb/>
     people all over the continent, and promises 
     <lb/>
     to control their action for a long time. I 
     <lb/>
     think it wise, therefore, that provision should 
     <lb/>
     be made by which the General Government 
     <lb/>
     can put the country into a state of prepar<lb break="no"/>ation for whatever may occur. It is well also, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, that the judges should be 
     <lb/>
     appointed by that government. I like to 
     <lb/>
     see an independent judiciary, and believe 
     <lb/>
     that this will be secured to us by the mode 
     <lb/>
     proposed in these resolutions. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>It is hardly necessary for me to make<lb/>allusion to the local governments ; there<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>are so many propositions connected with 
     <lb/>them, and so little is known of what 
     <lb/>their constitution will be, that it is hardly 
     <lb/>possible indeed for me to refer to them. I 
     <lb/>would like to be informed as to their charac— 
     <lb/>ter and authority before speaking of them. 
     <lb/>My opinion is, that they should have certain 
     <lb/>powers defined in written constitutions, so 
     <lb/>that beyond these powers they would have 
     <lb/>no right to legislate, and if they did, that 
     <lb/>their legislation should be set aside and 
     <lb/>rendered null and void by the superior 
     <lb/>courts. I believe that the British Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion is of that elastic character that the 
     <lb/>institutions which exist under it can be made 
     <lb/>most popular and still work well. I think 
     <lb/>history has proved this to be the case. 
     <lb/>Under it we have kept sacred the great 
     <lb/>principle of responsible government which 
     <lb/>we now enjoy, and under which ministers 
     <lb/>of the Crown hold seats in and are responsi<lb break="no"/>ble to the Legislature. Well, we want no 
     <lb/>change in that principle; for I think it is 
     <lb/>the greatest safeguard to liberty, not only in 
     <lb/>England, but the world. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>With regard to the executive head of the 
     <lb/>General Government, appointment by the 
     <lb/>Crown as at present is the only mode that is 
     <lb/>desirable. It will not do to tamper with 
     <lb/>or change this provision of our govern<lb break="no"/>ment ; for if we become detached from and 
     <lb/>cease to be a dependency of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Crown, what do we become? We 
     <lb/>must necessarily become independent, and 
     <lb/>when that state of political existence is 
     <lb/>reached, we know not what will follow. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) The question may be asked, 
     <lb/>is the Constitution foreshadowed in these 
     <lb/>resolutions such as can be accepted by the 
     <lb/>people of this country ? Is there a possibil<lb break="no"/>ity, if it be defective, of bettering or amend<lb break="no"/>ing it? I think that in many of its details 
     <lb/>it has a great deal that is good; and if, in 
     <lb/>portions where it is desirable, it cannot be 
     <lb/>amended, I think, nevertheless, that the 
     <lb/>people of this country would hardly be 
     <lb/>justified in rejecting it. (Hear,hear.) There 
     <lb/>is no doubt that all history shows that 
     <lb/>nothing in the way of government is ever 
     <lb/>considered a finality. Changes are conti<lb break="no"/>nually going on in all forms of government 
     <lb/>The political history of our own country 
     <lb/>even is proof of this fact. At the time of 
     <lb/>the union of these provinces, the members 
     <lb/>of the Legislative Council were appointed 
     <lb/>by the Crown, but since then there has been 
     <lb/>a change, and they are now elected by the 
     <lb/>people. At that time, too, the wardens of 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="448" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0448.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">448</fw>
               
     our district councils were appointed by 
     <lb/>
     the Crown ; that principle was subse<lb break="no"/>quently changed, and they are now elected 
     <lb/>
     by the popular vote. It is impossible, sir, 
     <lb/>
     to take this question of Confederation into 
     <lb/>
     consideration, without also taking into account 
     <lb/>
     the question of the Intercolonial Railway. I 
     <lb/>
     have on several occasions spoken against the 
     <lb/>
     construction of that road at the expense of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I never could see that any advan<lb break="no"/>tage would be derived from it, unless in a 
     <lb/>
     military point of view; and as a military 
     <lb/>
     work I did not think it worth the large sum 
     <lb/>
     it would cost. But if commercial advantages 
     <lb/>
     could be pointed out equivalent to the cost 
     <lb/>
     of it, then I admit its construction might 
     <lb/>
     become a subject of consideration. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I think that free intercourse and free 
     <lb/>
     trade with 800,000 of our fellow-subjects in 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces are not light and unim<lb break="no"/>portant considerations. They are, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, something like an equivalent for the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure—(hear, hear)—and if there are 
     <lb/>
     no graver difficulties than the building of 
     <lb/>
     this road in the scheme of the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference, then they may all be easily sur<lb break="no"/>mounted. (Hear, hear.) That there will 
     <lb/>
     be great expense in the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     road, and in connection with Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     admits scarcely of a doubt. But we have 
     <lb/>
     come to a period in our history when, for 
     <lb/>
     various reasons, expense has become neces<lb break="no"/>sary. We must have some change in our 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, and whether it be attended by 
     <lb/>
     additional expense or not, it is indispensable 
     <lb/>
     in order to remove the evils under which 
     <lb/>
     the country has so long labored. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName> said — Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I approach the discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     subject in no degree of diffidence or temerity, 
     <lb/>
     because I apprehend that it signifies very 
     <lb/>
     little what I or any other hon. member may 
     <lb/>
     say, it will receive but little attention, so far 
     <lb/>
     as tending to change in the slightest degree 
     <lb/>
     the opinions that hon. members may have 
     <lb/>
     in reference to the project of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Nevertheless, though no 
     <lb/>
     weight may attach to anything that I may 
     <lb/>
     say, I feel it my duty to the constituency 
     <lb/>
     that I represent, and to the province at 
     <lb/>
     large, to enter my protest against the passage 
     <lb/>
     of this resolution in its present shape. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I am in favor of a union of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, but it must be such a union 
     <lb/>
     as will benefit and protect the interests of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces at large ; and I feel that those 
     <lb/>
     interests cannot be, protected and benefited 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     if we are going into the extravagances that 
     <lb/>
     must necessarily follow such a union as is 
     <lb/>
     now contemplated. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     question has been considered in its political, 
     <lb/>
     in its commercial, in its defensive or military 
     <lb/>
     aspects, and in its sectional aspects, and very 
     <lb/>
     little that can be said by any hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     now will be considered new; and he who 
     <lb/>
     speaks at this stage of the discussion will 
     <lb/>
     speak at a disadvantage, because he can say 
     <lb/>
     very little that is new. He may speak on 
     <lb/>
     these matters that have been discussed in 
     <lb/>
     new language, and so make some little 
     <lb/>
     change, but as for the material positions, 
     <lb/>
     they have been already discussed, and by 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen very ably discussed, 
     <lb/>
     I understand that the position which the 
     <lb/>
     Government of this country assumes, in 
     <lb/>
     introducing this measure with the haste in 
     <lb/>
     which they are doing it, declining to allow 
     <lb/>
     the people to have anything to say upon it, 
     <lb/>
     except through their representatives, who 
     <lb/>
     were not sent here to vote on any such 
     <lb/>
     measure as this, is that this country had 
     <lb/>
     arrived at such a stage that it was impossible 
     <lb/>
     for the affairs of the Government to be 
     <lb/>
     carried on, unless some change took place, 
     <lb/>
     and that of a radical character. In that 
     <lb/>
     assertion I do not agree. I dissent from it 
     <lb/>
     entirely, and I feel that it was not the 
     <lb/>
     necessities of this country that have brought 
     <lb/>
     about these resolutions, but that it was the 
     <lb/>
     factious conduct of honorable gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the floor of this House. If that factious con<lb break="no"/>duct had not been persevered in, there would 
     <lb/>
     have been no necessity for the consideration 
     <lb/>
     that we are now undertaking. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I feel that I am making a statement the 
     <lb/>
     correctness of which cannot be denied; and 
     <lb/>
     I shall refer to the language of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council, even since this 
     <lb/>
     matter has been under consideration, to 
     <lb/>
     establish it. (Hear, hear.) It has been 
     <lb/>
     stated by him that the affairs of this country 
     <lb/>
     had come to a dead-lock. It has been stated 
     <lb/>
     that we were drifting into inevitable ruin; 
     <lb/>
     that our debt was so fast increasing, that it 
     <lb/>
     was absolutely impossible to stem the torrent, 
     <lb/>
     or close the flood-gates of the treasury that 
     <lb/>
     that had been opened by the mismanage<lb break="no"/>ment of hon. gentlemen sitting alongside of 
     <lb/>
     the President of the Council at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. Understand me: I am not charging 
     <lb/>
     those hon. gentlemen with extravagance; I 
     <lb/>
     am simply referring to the language used 
     <lb/>
     by the Honorable President of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil. But on a recent occasion he spoke 
     <lb/>
     of this union as a matter to be proud of, and 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="449" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0449.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">449</fw>
           
     said that every one of the provinces that 
     <lb/>
     was entering into the union would enter it 
     <lb/>
     with a surplus of revenue, and were, there<lb break="no"/>fore, not obliged to go into it from necessity; 
     <lb/>
     that they did not enter into the partnership 
     <lb/>
     as a bankrupt concern, but, on the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     would commence business in a most 
     <lb/>
     prosperous condition. Now, if that were 
     <lb/>
     the case, what is the necessity for this 
     <lb/>
     change—a change that will render so much 
     <lb/>
     more extravagance necessary to carry on the 
     <lb/>
     government, even under the guidance of the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. the President of the Council? It was 
     <lb/>
     said that the people of the section of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince to which I belong had become satis<lb break="no"/>fied that there was extravagance in the 
     <lb/>
     Government, that the people of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada were absorbing too large a propor<lb break="no"/>tion of the revenue that was paid by the 
     <lb/>
     people of Upper Canada. It was asserted 
     <lb/>
     that the people of Upper Canada were pay<lb break="no"/>ing seven-tenths of the whole revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     country; that we had not sufficient repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in Parliament; and that there was 
     <lb/>
     ruin staring us in the face, because we had 
     <lb/>
     not our proper voice in the Legislature, by 
     <lb/>
     means of which we might resist the extrava<lb break="no"/>gance of Lower Canadians. It was said 
     <lb/>
     that for every appropriation made for Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, a corresponding one had to be 
     <lb/>
     made for Lower Canada, and thereby the 
     <lb/>
     people of Upper Canada were paying more 
     <lb/>
     than their fair share into the common purse 
     <lb/>
     of the country. Taking that view of the 
     <lb/>
     case, I would ask the Honorable President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council, who is so warm in advocating 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions, how much the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada will be called upon to pay 
     <lb/>
     more than Lower Canada in the new scheme? 
     <lb/>
     I understand that Lower is to receive $888,<lb break="no"/>531 from the Federal Government. As 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada has been paying two-thirds, 
     <lb/>
     nay, as much as seven-tenths into the general 
     <lb/>
     revenue, how much are we granting to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada out of the pockets of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada towards paying the expenses 
     <lb/>
     of managing their local affairs—affairs of 
     <lb/>
     which we in the Upper Province will have 
     <lb/>
     not one word to say? By the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     that is to be entered into, suppose that the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces constitute about one-fifth of 
     <lb/>
     the whole—which, I presume, is all that they 
     <lb/>
     will contribute. This would make $177,706. 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, on the principle of paying 
     <lb/>
     two-thirds, would contribute $473,884, and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada only $236,941. For the sup<lb break="no"/>port of the Local Government of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     from the Federal exchequer, Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     would, therefore, have to pay no less a sum 
     <lb/>
     than $473,884, which is nearly double the 
     <lb/>
     amount that Lower Canada itself will pay for 
     <lb/>
     the same purpose. The amount that Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada will have to pay in excess of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, for exclusively Lower Canada pur<lb break="no"/>poses, is $175,859. (Hear, hear.) Now 
     <lb/>
     that is the position in which that branch of 
     <lb/>
     the question stands; but it is said that we are 
     <lb/>
     to become a great people, third, I think, in 
     <lb/>
     rank of the nations of the earth. It is said 
     <lb/>
     that, because we unite with a people who 
     <lb/>
     have less than a million of inhabitants, while 
     <lb/>
     we have nearly two and a half millions, we 
     <lb/>
     are to become this vast nation, and to hold a 
     <lb/>
     position in the world above that of all nations 
     <lb/>
     except three on the face of the globe. Well, 
     <lb/>
     it does not strike me that the mere fact of 
     <lb/>
     our joining the Lower Provinces to this pro<lb break="no"/>vince by the Intercolonial Railway is going 
     <lb/>
     to give us that position. We need a vast 
     <lb/>
     population as well as a vast country to acquire 
     <lb/>
     that greatness. It is said that we will be 
     <lb/>
     stronger by this union; that we will be better 
     <lb/>
     able to protect ourselves in the event of hos<lb break="no"/>tilities breaking out between this country 
     <lb/>
     and the United States. But is that true? 
     <lb/>
     (Cries of "Yes, yes," and "No, no.") Are 
     <lb/>
     we to become at once an independent nation 
     <lb/>
     that will make treaties with foreign nations, 
     <lb/>
     or are we still to be dependent on the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown—a dependency that I hope will never 
     <lb/>
     be done away with? (Hear, hear.) Let it 
     <lb/>
     be understood that I am not to be dazzled 
     <lb/>
     by those ideas of greatness that are being 
     <lb/>
     held out to us. We can never be so great 
     <lb/>
     in any way as we can by remaining a depen<lb break="no"/>dency of the British Crown. Every one 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces is true and faithful 
     <lb/>
     in its allegiance to the British Crown, and 
     <lb/>
     if that power makes war, each will do all 
     <lb/>
     that lies in its power to defend its own ter<lb break="no"/>ritory and assist the Mother Country. But 
     <lb/>
     how do we gain strength from the scheme ? 
     <lb/>
     We obtain many hundreds of miles of addi<lb break="no"/>tional frontier, and we do not get men in 
     <lb/>
     proportion. (Hear, hear.) We shall build 
     <lb/>
     a railway that cannot possibly be of much 
     <lb/>
     use to us, but that will be subject to destruc<lb break="no"/>tion by the enemy, and will be indefensible 
     <lb/>
     and difficult to keep open. The armies that 
     <lb/>
     will be brought against us by the United 
     <lb/>
     States will be too great to be resisted along 
     <lb/>
     the entire frontier, and no ordinary force 
     <lb/>
     will be suficient to protect so long a line of 
     <lb/>
     communication. I therefore argue that the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="450" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0450.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">450</fw>
          
     Confederation will not make us a stronger         
     <lb/>
    or a greater people than before. Then it is 
     <lb/>said that in our present exigencies we must 
     <lb/>look out for other markets for our produce 
     <lb/>than those we have been depending upon; 
     <lb/>that we must endeavor to become a manufac<lb break="no"/>turing country, obtaining minerals from the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces and sending them our pro<lb break="no"/>duce in return. That is all very fine, but 
     <lb/>it can be accomplished without entering into 
     <lb/>an extravagantly expensive arrangement 
     <lb/>such as this is. We could have a legislative 
     <lb/>union with one Legislature or Central Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, that would manage all our affairs 
     <lb/>on a scale as economical as the affairs of the 
     <lb/>province of Canada have been conducted; 
     <lb/>but when you provide for a General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and then for a Local Government in 
     <lb/>each province besides, it stands to reason 
     <lb/>that the expenditure must be far in excess 
     <lb/>of that which would result from having a 
     <lb/>single legislature. The Hon. President 
     <lb/>of the Council has said that he is not, al<lb break="no"/>though all his other colleagues who have 
     <lb/>spoken on the floor of the House have ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that they are, in favor of a legislative 
     <lb/>union, if this union could be accomplished. 
     <lb/>The Hon. President of the Council thinks, 
     <lb/>perhaps, that this wouid be too damaging an 
     <lb/>admission, so he says: "I would not have 
     <lb/>a legislative union if I could. There is 
     <lb/>nothing but a Federal union for me, be<lb break="no"/>cause our country is so extensive that it 
     <lb/>would be impossible to control it with a 
     <lb/>Legislature sitting at Ottawa." Now, is 
     <lb/>this so? Would four or five hundred 
     <lb/>additional miles of territory make all the 
     <lb/>difference ?   
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. Mr. BROWN</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     is mistaken. I never used any such ex<lb break="no"/>pression. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—0f course it is 
     <lb/>
     very unpleasant to have to say it, but my 
     <lb/>
     ears must have deceived me very grossly 
     <lb/>
     indeed, if the hon. gentleman did not assert 
     <lb/>
     in the hearing of persons in this House, 
     <lb/>
     when delivering his address on these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, that he preferred a Federal union, 
     <lb/>
     and assigned as a reason for his preference 
     <lb/>
     the extent of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man will see that this is a very different 
     <lb/>
     thing from the statement he previously 
     <lb/>
     made. What I did say was this, that it 
     <lb/>
     would be exceedingly inconvenient to man<lb break="no"/>age the local affairs of so widely extended a 
     <lb/>
     country. I did not say that we could not 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     exercise a general control over the country.     
     <lb/>I said that it was impossible to attend to the<lb/>
     mere parish affairs of Newfoundland, Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island, New Brunswick and the 
     <lb/>
     North-West. That is what I said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName> ―Well, one reason 
     <lb/>
     assigned by the hon. gentleman for a Federal 
     <lb/>
     union was that in attending to the private 
     <lb/>
     business of the Lower Provinces, under a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union, we would be kept sitting 
     <lb/>
     at Ottawa for nine months of the year. It 
     <lb/>
     is, however, the case that the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     United Canada can be transacted in a period 
     <lb/>
     of three or four months, while according to 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. the President of the Council, the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of the federated provinces would not 
     <lb/>
     be attended to in less than nine months in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of the private business which 
     <lb/>
     would be added to the legislation from a 
     <lb/>
     people numbering only seven or eight hun<lb break="no"/>dred thousand. (Hear, hear.) The business 
     <lb/>
     of two and a half millions can be disposed of 
     <lb/>
     in three months, whilst it is alleged that the 
     <lb/>
     business brought by the addition of seven or 
     <lb/>
     eight hundred thousand more would prolong 
     <lb/>
     the sessions of Parliament by six months. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I think that the position 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. gentleman took in reference 
     <lb/>
     to that, is just as untenable as his position 
     <lb/>
     that a Legislative union in itself would not 
     <lb/>
     be better than a Federal union. Now, it is 
     <lb/>
     said that our commercial affairs will be very 
     <lb/>
     much advanced by this arrangement. It is 
     <lb/>
     said that the Reciprocity treaty is going to 
     <lb/>
     be abrogated. No doubt we have received 
     <lb/>
     notice of it. It is also said that it is 
     <lb/>
     possible — although the Hon. President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council does not think it is so—that 
     <lb/>
     the bonded system is to be done away with 
     <lb/>
     between Canada and the United States, and 
     <lb/>
     that, therefore, we would have no means of 
     <lb/>
     reaching the Atlantic except during the 
     <lb/>
     summer months of the year, in consequence 
     <lb/>
     of which it is very desirable that this great 
     <lb/>
     work of the Intercolonial Railway should 
     <lb/>
     be accomplished, and that this union of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces should take place. I presume it 
     <lb/>
     is a well understood fact that a people will 
     <lb/>
     always find some channel into which to 
     <lb/>
     direct their energies—that there will be a 
     <lb/>
     channel for their commerce—that there 
     <lb/>
     will be a channel for their produce. Now, 
     <lb/>
     if the Reciprocity treaty is abrogated, and if 
     <lb/>
     the bonded system is put an end to, it will 
     <lb/>
     be done long before the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way can be established, and we must then 
     <lb/>
     remain suffering for a number of years until 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="451" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0451.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">451</fw>
     that work is accomplished and before we 
     <lb/>
     get communication with the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, except through the medium of the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence, which is only accessible during 
     <lb/>
     the summer time. Then it would be 
     <lb/>
     absolutely necessary for us to resort to some 
     <lb/>
     other means, to devise some other scheme, 
     <lb/>
     by which we might not allow the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, in the meantime, to be 
     <lb/>
     injured, to lag and to suffer; and when our 
     <lb/>
     commerce flows in such new channel, it will 
     <lb/>
     not be easy to divert it. But is it not the 
     <lb/>
     fact that we have been in existence a number 
     <lb/>
     of years as a colony here? Is it not the 
     <lb/>
     fact, too, that we have been far removed 
     <lb/>
     from the sea? Is it not the fact, that when 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada was subject to duties to 
     <lb/>
    Lower Canada, and when we had no 
     <lb/>connection with the United States except 
     <lb/>by paying high restrictive duties, Upper 
     <lb/>Canada progressed rapidly and became a 
     <lb/>large and prosperous province? Did we 
     <lb/>then complain with all these restrictions 
     <lb/>weighing upon us? For my, part, I have 
     <lb/>yet to see, if the reciprocity treaty is put an 
     <lb/>end to and if the bonding system is dis<lb break="no"/>continued, that we would be unable to find 
     <lb/>means by which the energies of the people 
     <lb/>of this country would find development. 
     <lb/>We would still go on in material prosperity, 
     <lb/>if we found hon. gentlemen forgetting their 
     <lb/>faction, and allowing the wheels of 
     <lb/>government to progress without being' 
     <lb/>unnecessarily impeded. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>In one view of the case, if I were satisfied 
     <lb/>that the people of this country fully approv<lb break="no"/>ed of the scheme, I would give it my sup<lb break="no"/>port, although I disapprove of it in its present 
     <lb/>shape. But I cannot understand why those 
     <lb/>hon. gentlemen who have professed, at all 
     <lb/>events heretofore, to be the advocates of the 
     <lb/>rights and liberties of the people, should so 
     <lb/>far forget those rights and liberties as to set 
     <lb/>them aside, and allow half a dozen gentle<lb break="no"/>men in this province to combine with a 
     <lb/>number of gentlemen from the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to completely ignore and set aside the 
     <lb/>views of those they profess to represent. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) It has been said that the 
     <lb/>people of this country have fully endorsed and 
     <lb/>approved of this measure. But where is the 
     <lb/>evidence of it? It has been asserted that 
     <lb/>this is a matter which was under consider<lb break="no"/>ation in the year 1858, and that it has been 
     <lb/>mooted at different times since. But this 
     <lb/>very fact shews that it has never taken a 
     <lb/>deep hold on the people, and certain it is 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
          
     that it has never been made a question up 
     <lb/>
     to this time at the polls. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, the people have not pronounced 
     <lb/>
     an opinion upon it. And I mean to say this, 
     <lb/>
     that if the people understood it was going to 
     <lb/>
     cost so much more than the present form of 
     <lb/>
     government, they would not be inclined to 
     <lb/>
     approve and to accept it as readily as hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen seem to think. I hold that, if the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen who occupy the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches were really sincere in their views 
     <lb/>
     of the benefits to result from this measure, 
     <lb/>
     they would allow the question to go to the 
     <lb/>
     people for the fullest consideration. In 
     <lb/>
     1841 the people of this country obtained 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, and it was declared 
     <lb/>
     to them then that they should have a con<lb break="no"/>trolling voice in the affairs of the country— 
     <lb/>
     that no important change, in fact, should 
     <lb/>
     take place without their having an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of pronouncing upon it. And yet 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen now disclaim the right of 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people, and arrogate to them<lb break="no"/>selves an amount of wisdom to suppose that 
     <lb/>
     the tens of thousands of people of this pro<lb break="no"/>vince have not the capacity to understand 
     <lb/>
     the meaning or the magnitude of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. They exclude from these men the 
     <lb/>
     right of pronouncing an opinion; and is it 
     <lb/>
     not singular that it is the people of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Canada who are treated in this way ? 
     <lb/>
     It is not so in the Lower Provinces. New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, for instance, dissolves its House, 
     <lb/>
     and goes to the people. And why should New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick do that which is denied to Canada? 
     <lb/>
     Why should the people of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     be treated as more able and more capable 
     <lb/>
     of understanding and pronouncing an intel<lb break="no"/>ligent opinion than the people of Canada? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The people of Canada, I 
     <lb/>
     apprehend, are just as capable of compre<lb break="no"/>hending a measure of this importance as the 
     <lb/>
     people of New Brunswick, and they ought 
     <lb/>
     to have the same opportunity of pronouncing 
     <lb/>
     upon it. (Hear, hear.) The Honorable 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council has said that a hos<lb break="no"/>tile feeling had arisen between both sections 
     <lb/>
     of the province to such a degree, that the 
     <lb/>
     government and legislation of the country 
     <lb/>
     had almost come to a dead stand. Now, was 
     <lb/>
     there such a feeling of hostility existing 
     <lb/>
     between the peeple of the different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces? Was such the fact? Did honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen of French extraction meet 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen of British extraction 
     <lb/>
     upon the floor of this House with any feeling 
     <lb/>
     of hostility whatever? Did we not meet as 
     <lb/>

     friends? They considered that they had 
     <lb/>
     peculiar interests to serve, and we considered 
     <lb/>
     that we had a larger population than they, 
     <lb/>
     and which population had not a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     representation on the floor of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     we sought a change in order to give them 
     <lb/>
     the representation to which they were 
     <lb/>
     entitled. The President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     claims that he has accomplished a great 
     <lb/>
     work in gaining for the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada that representation on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. Now, I beg to join issue with 
     <lb/>
     him on that point. I assert that, instead of 
     <lb/>
     having gained for the Upper Province that 
     <lb/>
     boon, he has arrayed thirty additional votes 
     <lb/>
     against Upper Canada. He makes Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada stand not as she is now, but with 
     <lb/>
     thirty additional voices to contend against. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We shall pay in the same 
     <lb/>
     proportion, in fact, that we paid before to 
     <lb/>
     the whole revenue of the country. Let us 
     <lb/>
     see if I am singular in this view—let us see 
     <lb/>
     whether the gentlemen who compose the 
     <lb/>
     governments in the Lower Provinces do not 
     <lb/>
     entertain the same opinion. Hon. Mr. TILLEY 
     <lb/>
     made this representation in a speech which 
     <lb/>
     he delivered on the 17th November last :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     So close is the contest between parties in the

     Canadian Legislature, that even the five Prince

     <lb/>
     victory on whatever side they chose, and have the 
     <lb/>
     game entirely in their own hands. Suppose that

     Upper Canada should attempt to carry out schemes

     the forty-seven of the Lower Provinces, whose 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—" What has that 
     <lb/>
     to do with representation by population?" 
     <lb/>
     asks the hon. gentleman. Representation 
     <lb/>
     by population was agitated, so far as Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada is concerned, because we are paying 
     <lb/>
     so large a proportion of the revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     country ; and should the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     have a corresponding voice, we should still 
     <lb/>
     pay the same proportion of revenue—instead, 
     <lb/>
     in fact, of standing on an equality, we would 
     <lb/>
     have thirty voices more to contend against. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, let us see whether, in 
     <lb/>
     another point of view, it is going to benefit 
     <lb/>
     us. It is represented by this same gentle<lb break="no"/>man in the Lower Provinces that, when this 
     <lb/>
     change takes place, they will be relieved 
     <lb/>
     from the burdens they now bear ; because, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     as asserted in the speech to which I have 
     <lb/>
     referred, they have paid $3.20 per head of 
     <lb/>
     taxes ; and, when the change was brought 
     <lb/>
     about, they would only pay $2.75—that is, 
     <lb/>
     they would be gainers by the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     by 45 cents a head. Is that so, or is it not 
     <lb/>
     so? If not, then there is dishonesty at the 
     <lb/>
     bottom of this scheme, when it requires 
     <lb/>
     arguments of that kind to further it. If it 
     <lb/>
     is so, then these gentlemen who assert that 
     <lb/>
     they are looking out for the interest and 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of Canada, are proving traitors 
     <lb/>
     to the trust reposed in them, are doing a 
     <lb/>
     wrong to their country, and are doing that 
     <lb/>
     for the sake of their own self-aggrandize<lb break="no"/>ment.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Allow 
     <lb/>
     me to make a remark. A little while ago 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman quoted from a 
     <lb/>
     speech of Hon. Mr. TILLEY, in which that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman supposed the case, that on some 
     <lb/>
     evil day Upper Canada, actuated by selfish 
     <lb/>
     motives, would endeavor to obtain the passing 
     <lb/>
     of some measure that would be conducive to 
     <lb/>
     her exclusive aggrandizement. " In that 
     <lb/>
     event," said Hon. Mr. TILLEY, addressing 
     <lb/>
     himself to his people below, with the view 
     <lb/>
     of meeting that hypothetical case, " you will 
     <lb/>
     have the six-five members from Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the forty-seven from below, to 
     <lb/>
     unite in resisting any attempt of the kind." 
     <lb/>
     On that account the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
    North Ontario has stated that he is opposed 
     <lb/>to this scheme of Federation. He prefers a 
     <lb/>legislative union ; but of course with a 
     <lb/>legislative union there would be the same 
     <lb/>ratio of representation, and his opposition, 
     <lb/>on this particular ground, ought to apply to 
     <lb/>the one system as much as to the other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. CAMERON</persName>—I will give you a 
     <lb/>
     practical illustration of how this may affect 
     <lb/>
     our interest. It is a part of this scheme, or 
     <lb/>
     ought to have been a part of it, that the 
     <lb/>
     opening up of the North-West should he in<lb break="no"/>cluded in it; that improvements should be 
     <lb/>
     made in that direction so that we might have 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of the vast mineral wealth which 
     <lb/>
     exists there, and of the great stretch of 
     <lb/>
     territory available for agricultural purposes 
     <lb/>
     as well. But this is not given to us new. 
     <lb/>
     The Intercolonial Railway is made a portion 
     <lb/>
     of this scheme. It is made, so to speak, a 
     <lb/>
     part of the Constitution—a necessity without 
     <lb/>
     which the scheme cannot go on. Now, 
     <lb/>
     suppose we ask in the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>
     for the improvement of the North-West, 
     <lb/>
     because we consider it— for our interest 
     <lb/>
     have that territory opened up and improved, 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="453" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0453.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">453</fw>
            
     shall we not find a verification of the lan<lb break="no"/>guage of this gentleman—sixty-five mem<lb break="no"/>bers from Lower Canada and forty-seven 
     <lb/>
     from the Lower Provinces, whose interests 
     <lb/>
     are identical, will be united against us, and 
     <lb/>
     we will not be able to accomplish a work of 
     <lb/>
     that kind. (Hear, hear.) In considering 
     <lb/>
     a question of this nature—in considering a 
     <lb/>
     change of the Constitution—I presume 
     <lb/>
     every man ought to have the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     whole at heart, and not the interests merely 
     <lb/>
     of individual parts—that every man from 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces who seeks this union 
     <lb/>
     should desire it, not because it is going to 
     <lb/>
     advantage the Lower Provinces merely, but 
     <lb/>
     because it is going to advantage Canada as 
     <lb/>
     well. The argument should be, that it is to 
     <lb/>
     be for the advantage of the whole. It 
     <lb/>
     should not be an argument that $2.75 is the 
     <lb/>
     sum that will be paid by the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     under the arrangement, when they are pay<lb break="no"/>ing now $3.20 a head to the public revenue. 
     <lb/>
    Arguments of that kind should not be used  
     <lb/>to show that an advantage is gained by one 
     <lb/>portion of the proposed Confederation at the 
     <lb/>expense of another ; for example, that the 
     <lb/>subsidy obtained by the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>from the Federal Government will be so 
     <lb/>great, that it will meet all their expenditures, 
     <lb/>and leave them $34,000 the gainers. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Now, I ask, are we contributing to 
     <lb/>that in the same proportion that we are 
     <lb/>contributing to the subsidy to Lower Canada 
     <lb/>—and is that honorable gentleman who has 
     <lb/>taken the advocacy of Upper Canadian 
     <lb/>interests so peculiarly under his own control, 
     <lb/>acting for the interests of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>when he consents to an arrangement of this 
     <lb/>kind ? (Hear, hear.) The President of the 
     <lb/>Council has used this language with reference 
     <lb/>to the matter. He says :―" It is not a 
     <lb/>question of interest, or mere commercial 
     <lb/>advantage; no, it is an effort to establish 
     <lb/>a new empire in British North America." 
     <lb/>That is the honorable gentleman's state<lb break="no"/>ment. But, for my own part, I think it 
     <lb/>would be better to get out of the debt which 
     <lb/>now burdens us,—to reduce the expenses the 
     <lb/>people are suffering from,―to lighten the 
     <lb/>taxation we are laboring under—than to 
     <lb/>endeavor to establish an empire such as my 
     <lb/>honorable friend the President of the 
     <lb/>Council speaks of. It would be much 
     <lb/>better for us to endeavor to reduce our 
     <lb/>expenditure, and live within our means, than 
     <lb/>to attempt to establish a new empire; be<lb break="no"/>cause, unless he means by that that we are 
     <lb/>going to establish our independence, we are 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     already, as subjects of the British Crown, 
     <lb/>
     sharers in all the glories of the British nation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman also said— 
     <lb/>
     and this was the argument he addressed to the 
     <lb/>
     House as a reason why his friends from 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada should unite with him in 
     <lb/>
     supporting this scheme—" We complained, 
     <lb/>
     that immense sums were taken from the 
     <lb/>
     public chest and applied to local purposes, in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, from which we of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada derived no advantage." Now I ask, 
     <lb/>
     have we ever seen an attempt made by 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada to obtain so great a subsidy as 
     <lb/>
     $175,000 a year in perpetuity? And yet, 
     <lb/>
     that is what the hon. gentleman, by this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, actually concedes to them, apart 
     <lb/>
     from the greater expenditure we will have to 
     <lb/>
     pay in connection with the administration of 
     <lb/>
     the general affairs of the whole Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. Let us see what the seventeen addi<lb break="no"/>tional representatives we of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     are to obtain, will cost us. I make it that 
     <lb/>
     for each representative we will have to pay 
     <lb/>
     only $16,397 per annum. I make that out 
     <lb/>
     in this way. The contribution by the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces to the General Government is 
     <lb/>
     $1,929,272. The contribution of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada is $2,208,035. The contribution of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada is $4,416,072. I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing now of the contributions that go to meet 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure of the Federal Government. 
     <lb/>
     The contribution of Upper Canada is thus in 
     <lb/>
     excess of the Lower Provinces, $2,486,800; 
     <lb/>
     in excess of Lower Canada, $2,208,037; 
     <lb/>
     and in excess of both, $278,765, which, 
     <lb/>
     divided by 17, will give $16,397 as the cost 
     <lb/>
     of each additional member we are getting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. CAMERON</persName>—Well, this matter is 
     <lb/>not left to us either, as the representatives 
     <lb/>of the people, to pronounce an opinion upon 
     <lb/>it. We are to take the scheme as a whole. 
     <lb/>We are not to be allowed to amend it in any 
     <lb/>particular. But the Government come down 
     <lb/>and tell us, that in consequence of the union 
     <lb/>of political parties which has taken place, 
     <lb/>they feel themselves so strong that they can 
     <lb/>say to the representatives of the people : 
     <lb/>" Just take this, or you shall have nothing, 
     <lb/>and revert back to inevitable ruin." That is 
     <lb/>the position in which they put us. Yet, if the 
     <lb/>statement made by the Hon. Finance Minister 
     <lb/>is correct, our revenue has increased, so that 
     <lb/>we have a surplus of $872,000, after making 
     <lb/>up the deficiency of the previous year. He 
     <lb/>tells us the revenue of Canada has increased 
     <lb/>by a million and a half of dollars ; and that 
     <lb/>the revenues of New Brunswick and Nova 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="454" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0454.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">454</fw>
     Scotia have increased $100,000 each—being 
     <lb/>
     an increase for the whole provinces of 
     <lb/>
     $1,700,000. Would we then revert back to 
     <lb/>
     ruin, if these statements be correct? If our 
     <lb/>
     income has really increased so much as has 
     <lb/>
     been represented, would we, if we remain as 
     <lb/>
     we are, go back to ruin ? (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     has been said that there has been a dead<lb break="no"/>lock in the affairs of the country for a con<lb break="no"/>siderable length of time; but I think the 
     <lb/>
     province has not been going to ruin, if it 
     <lb/>
     has been getting an increase of revenue to 
     <lb/>
     the extent of a million and a half, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing that dead-lock. I am not sure but 
     <lb/>
     the province would do better if this House 
     <lb/>
     were closed up for ten years and hon. 
     <lb/>
     members sent about their business. (Ironical 
     <lb/>
     ministerial cheers.) Then it has been said 
     <lb/>
     that we are bound to accept this scheme, if 
     <lb/>
     we cannot show some better means of getting 
     <lb/>
     out of our difficulties. With reference to 
     <lb/>
     that, I would say that if any of those hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen were really the patriots they 
     <lb/>
     represent themselves to be, let them 
     <lb/>
     exemplify the virtue of resignation—let 
     <lb/>
     them leave their places in the front ranks of 
     <lb/>
     the ministerial benches, and let new men be 
     <lb/>
     introduced to take their places—let them do 
     <lb/>
     this, and I have no hesitation in saying that 
     <lb/>
     parties in this country are not so bitterly 
     <lb/>
     hostile but a government or any number of 
     <lb/>
     governments could be formed to carry on 
     <lb/>
     the affairs of the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Hon. gentlemen who have been in the front 
     <lb/>
     of the political affairs of this country for 
     <lb/>
     years back, have fancied that the whole of 
     <lb/>
     the political wisdom of the country was 
     <lb/>
     centred in them, and that this country must 
     <lb/>
     of necessity go to ruin, if they were not at 
     <lb/>
     the helm of affairs. This, I think, is claim<lb break="no"/>ing too much. However, I do not mean to say 
     <lb/>
     that they are not exceedingly able men. But 
     <lb/>
     I would say that the Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     East, and his colleague the Attorney Gene<lb break="no"/>ral for Upper Canada, who have been 
     <lb/>
     so much opposed and vilified by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen who are now as<lb break="no"/>sociated with them in the Government, 
     <lb/>
     must have felt exceedingly gratified when 
     <lb/>
     they found that after all the charges of 
     <lb/>
     corruption which had been brought against 
     <lb/>
     them, these pure patriots from our section 
     <lb/>
     of the country were willing to place them<lb break="no"/>selves side by side with them to carry 
     <lb/>
     on the affairs of the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It was represented by the Honorable Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary in a political contest that he and I 
     <lb/>
     had together—and which ?—when we were 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     in the field, we carried on pretty plea<lb break="no"/>santly, notwithstanding there had been some 
     <lb/>
     rather sharp passages at arms on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     this House between us— that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, in excusing himself before the 
     <lb/>
     electors for the change he had made in his 
     <lb/>
     views on the question of representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, said the financial crisis of the 
     <lb/>
     country had become so much more imminent 
     <lb/>
     than the constitutional, that it was absolutely 
     <lb/>
     necessary to take office—in fact, to join the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen of Lower Canada, who made rep<lb break="no"/>resentation by population a close question. 
     <lb/>
     We must look after the purse-strings, he said, 
     <lb/>
     or the country will go to ruin. It is very 
     <lb/>
     gratifying now to find that honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man now in a position in which he is going to 
     <lb/>
     create so much larger a debt than before. It 
     <lb/>
     is quite gratifying to find him now seated on 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury benches advocating the addition<lb break="no"/>al burdens, to the extent of millions of dollars, 
     <lb/>
     that will be cast upon us by this union and 
     <lb/>
     the construction of the Intercolonial Railway. 
     <lb/>
     At one time, and it was not long since, this 
     <lb/>
     country was agitated from one end to the 
     <lb/>
     other with the statement that the public debt 
     <lb/>
     was so great as to amount to a mortgage of 
     <lb/>
     $25 upon every cleared acre of land in the 
     <lb/>
     province, and now those who made this state<lb break="no"/>ment wish to add millions more to the debt 
     <lb/>
     by this railway, and to add as it were $5 more 
     <lb/>
     to the debt per head of every man in the land. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, if the Honorable Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary was sincere in his argument 
     <lb/>
     that retrenchment was necessary to save us 
     <lb/>
     from ruin, how can he reconcile it with his 
     <lb/>
     sense of duty and propriety that he should 
     <lb/>
     be found advocating this vast extravagance at 
     <lb/>
     this time, when there is no imminent danger 
     <lb/>
     to call for it, but, on the contrary, a degree of 
     <lb/>
     prosperity that should make us exceedingly 
     <lb/>
     careful how we adopt experimental change; 
     <lb/>
     I find honorable gentlemen complaining of 
     <lb/>
     the incapacity of our railways to meet the 
     <lb/>
     commercial requirements made upon them— 
     <lb/>
     to do the business of the country properly. 
     <lb/>
     It is true the crops are not so abundant as 
     <lb/>
     they were; no foresight or management will 
     <lb/>
     ensure us a plentiful harvest, but still, even 
     <lb/>
     according to these honorable gentlemen, the 
     <lb/>
     trade of the province is growing, and their 
     <lb/>
     statements altogether in this respect do not 
     <lb/>
     show that we are going to ruin. A people 
     <lb/>
     who are increasing in population as we are 
     <lb/>
     increasing, who are growing in wealth as we 
     <lb/>
     are, and who, ever and above all our expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, have a million and a half surplus revenue, 
     <lb/>
     are not rushing to ruin in the manner that has 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="455" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0455.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">455</fw>
     been represented by some honorable gentlemen. 
     <lb/>
     I say, then, that we ought not to hasten on a 
     <lb/>
     change that may prove injurious to us, without 
     <lb/>
     asking the people themselves whether they 
     <lb/>
     approve of it or not. (Hear, hear.) So 
     <lb/>
     anxious are the honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches to have it carried, that they 
     <lb/>
     even quarrel amongst themselves as to the 
     <lb/>
     parentage of the scheme; and the House was 
     <lb/>
     amused the other day when the Hon. Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council took the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West to task because that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman presumed to say that it was his 
     <lb/>
     Government that had first brought the matter 
     <lb/>
     up. (Langhter.) They appear to take great 
     <lb/>
     pride in the child, but this country of ours, 
     <lb/>
     the mother of the bantling, is travailing in 
     <lb/>
     agony from fear of the burdens that these 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen are endeavoring to put 
     <lb/>
     upon it. (Hear, hear.) The Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Agriculture the other evening 
     <lb/>
     called our attention to the affairs that are 
     <lb/>
     occurring in the United States, and spoke of 
     <lb/>
     the army of contractors and tax-gatherers 
     <lb/>
     that was springing up there. He said that the 
     <lb/>
     cry of " Tax, tax, tax!" came up perpetually 
     <lb/>
     from the tax-gatherers, and the cry of " Money, 
     <lb/>
     money, money !" from the hordes of contrac<lb break="no"/>tors who are fattening upon the miseries of 
     <lb/>
     the people; and while he was talking of the 
     <lb/>
     message conveyed to us in the sound 
     <lb/>
     of every gun fired in the United States, 
     <lb/>
     he may have thought perhaps that in the 
     <lb/>
     formation of this union and the building of 
     <lb/>
     this Intercolonial Railway, we too shall hear 
     <lb/>
     the cries of " Tax, tax, tax! money, money, 
     <lb/>
     money !" in the same way. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     is said again, in reference to this scheme, that 
     <lb/>
     every line of it shows a compromise. The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Minister of Agriculture, if I remember 
     <lb/>
     right, used an expression of that kind. But 
     <lb/>
     I would ask the President of the Council and 
     <lb/>
     those who with him have been advocating the 
     <lb/>
     interests of Upper Canada, where is there any 
     <lb/>
     concession to Upper Canada in it? If they 
     <lb/>
     can point out one solitary instance, with the 
     <lb/>
     exception of the seventeen additional mem<lb break="no"/>bers given to the west, where anything has 
     <lb/>
     been conceded to that section, then I will say 
     <lb/>
     the scheme is deserving of my support. But 
     <lb/>
     l hold that the additional number of repre— 
     <lb/>
     sentatives given to Upper Canada is no boon 
     <lb/>
     or concession. The differences between the 
     <lb/>
     two provinces of Canada were not merely na<lb break="no"/>tional differences, but were of a sectional 
     <lb/>
     character. It was the West arrayed against 
     <lb/>
     the east, rather than nationality against na<lb break="no"/>tionality, for was it not a fact that the sixteen 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     English-speaking members from Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da united themselves with the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dian majority, and not with the majority of 
     <lb/>
     their own race in Upper Canada? The Eng<lb break="no"/>lish members from Central Canada did the 
     <lb/>
     same ; and I contend, therefore, that the dif<lb break="no"/>ferences we had were sectional in their nature, 
     <lb/>
     and that we had no national differences that 
     <lb/>
     rendered a change at this time necessary. 
     <lb/>
     Are we going to get rid of these sectional dif<lb break="no"/>ferences by this scheme ? Will not the thirty 
     <lb/>
     additional members called into this legislature 
     <lb/>
     from the east unite with the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     majority, and will not the same preponderance 
     <lb/>
     of influence be cast against Upper Canada as 
     <lb/>
     before? (Hear, hear.) Now, if a union of 
     <lb/>
     free people is to be brought about, it should 
     <lb/>
     be because the people desire it and feel that it 
     <lb/>
     is advantageous on the whole; and I am quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that if, in these provinces, we are to 
     <lb/>
     have a union that will confer any advantage 
     <lb/>
     upon us, it ought to be a Legislative and not 
     <lb/>
     a Federal union. We should feel that if we 
     <lb/>
     are to be united, it ought to be in fact as well 
     <lb/>
     as in name; that we ought to be one people, 
     <lb/>
     and not separated from each other by sec<lb break="no"/>tions; that if we go into a union, it ought to 
     <lb/>
     be such a union as would make us one people; 
     <lb/>
     and that when a state of things arises favor<lb break="no"/>able to such a union, we will have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of forming a union that will give us 
     <lb/>
     strength and protect our interests in all time 
     <lb/>
     to come. The Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council thinks that we should enter the union 
     <lb/>
     proposed for the purpose of protecting and 
     <lb/>
     defending ourselves. I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     of that honorable gentleman if he thinks that 
     <lb/>
     we, with a population of two millions and a 
     <lb/>
     half, can create a sufficient armament, and raise 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient number of men to repel the mil<lb break="no"/>lions of the United States, should they choose 
     <lb/>
     to attack us? (Hear, hear.) I do not sup<lb break="no"/>pose, Mr. SPEAKER, that there would be any 
     <lb/>
     more ready to defend the honor and integrity 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain in this country than those 
     <lb/>
     who feel as I do in reference to this matter; 
     <lb/>
     and I am satisfied that, even with the know<lb break="no"/>ledge of certain destruction before us, if at<lb break="no"/>tacked by the United States, we would have 
     <lb/>
     defenders springing up at any moment—de<lb break="no"/>fenders to sell their lives as dearly as possible, 
     <lb/>
     and to fight inch by inch before they would 
     <lb/>
     be compelled to surrender the honor of the 
     <lb/>
     British Crown. But still, sir, we cannot help 
     <lb/>
     feeling the vast disparity of numbers between 
     <lb/>
     us and the United States; we can form no ar<lb break="no"/>mament that could repel them from every por<lb break="no"/>tion of our territory, and spending millions now 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="456" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0456.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">456</fw>
     in that direction is but crippling our resources 
     <lb/>
     and weakening us for the time of need. If 
     <lb/>
     these moneys we now propose to spend in that 
     <lb/>
     way were carefully husbanded, we will have 
     <lb/>
     them when the necessity arises, and be able to 
     <lb/>
     use them to better purpose than in defending 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. (Hear, hear.) Some say that 
     <lb/>
     Canada is defensible, and others say that it is 
     <lb/>
     entirely defenceless; but I apprehend that 
     <lb/>
     there are certain points in the country which 
     <lb/>
     could be so fortified that they could be held 
     <lb/>
     against any foe. While so held, the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the country would probably be under the con<lb break="no"/>trol of the enemy, and would remain so until 
     <lb/>
     the fate of war decided whether we were to 
     <lb/>
     remain as we were or be absorbed in the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring union. Now, it was said by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Minister of Agriculture that we are to 
     <lb/>
     have fortifications at St. John, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick; and if this union is to be brought 
     <lb/>
     about in order that we may be taxed for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of constructing fortifications in New 
     <lb/>
    Brunswick, it will certainly be of little service 
     <lb/>to the people of Canada in preventing their 
     <lb/>country being invaded and overrun by an 
     <lb/>enemy. Fortifications in St. John, New 
     <lb/>Brunswick, would not protect us from the foe, 
     <lb/>if the foe were to come here. They, of course, 
     <lb/>would be an advantage to the country at large 
     <lb/>and aid in sustaining the British dominion in 
     <lb/>this part of the continent, and so far we would 
     <lb/>not object to contribute to a reasonable ex<lb break="no"/>tent to an expenditure of that kind; but I do 
     <lb/>say that it would be quite impossible by for<lb break="no"/>tifications to make the country so defensible 
     <lb/>that we could resist aggression on the part of 
     <lb/>the United States at every point. To endea<lb break="no"/>vor to make it so would be a waste of money.

     <lb/>
     overwhelming numbers, without fortifications, 
     <lb/>
     such as it is here proposed to put up. (Hear,

     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—It is something new 
     <lb/>
     that a country can be defended without forti<lb break="no"/>fications. (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. CAMERON</persName>—I do not know whether 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen mean that this country 
     <lb/>
     is capable of undertaking the expenses that 
     <lb/>
     would be necessary to put it in such a state of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     defence as to enable it to resist the aggression 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. I want to know whe<lb break="no"/>ther with two and a half millions of people, 
     <lb/>
     we could cope with an army of millions—be<lb break="no"/>cause the United States have shown that they 
     <lb/>
     are capable of raising such an army—or make 
     <lb/>
     fortifications that could resist it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The Hon. Provincial Secretary has 
     <lb/>
     spoken on the floor of Parliament as well as 
     <lb/>
     to the electors in the country, to the effect 
     <lb/>
     that it was retrenchment we needed more than 
     <lb/>
     constitutional changes; and yet now he says 
     <lb/>
     that the people are not to have one word to 
     <lb/>
     say in reference to these vital changes that are 
     <lb/>
     proposed, and the vastly increased expenditure 
     <lb/>
     that is to take place. In addressing this 
     <lb/>
     House in 1862, he said—" The finances of the 
     <lb/>
     country are growing worse and worse, and a 
     <lb/>
     check must be applied. It was chiefly for this 
     <lb/>
     cause that the people of Upper Canada desired 
     <lb/>
     a change in the representation." Now, I 
     <lb/>
     should like to understand how a union with 
     <lb/>
     800,000 people, with immense expenditure, is 
     <lb/>
     going to improve our finances, which, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the honorable gentleman, are " growing 
     <lb/>
     worse and worse." (Hear, hear.) I have not 
     <lb/>
     heard in what has been yet said on the subject 
     <lb/>
     of these resolutions, anything to show me how 
     <lb/>
     this great increase and improvement is going 
     <lb/>
     to take place by a union with less than a mil<lb break="no"/>lion of people; but arguments for the union, 
     <lb/>
     when directed merely to the material interests 
     <lb/>
     that will be served by it, are arguments ten-fold 
     <lb/>
     stronger in favor of union with the United 
     <lb/>
     States. (Hear, hear.) The arguments of 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen all point that way, because 
     <lb/>
     they say it is to our interest to be joined with 
     <lb/>
     the 800,000 people of the provinces, who will 
     <lb/>
     furnish us with a market for our produce, 
     <lb/>
     when we have on the other side of the line 
     <lb/>
     thirty millions of people to furnish us a mar<lb break="no"/>ket. Arguments of this kind, urging the 
     <lb/>
     measure because our material interests will be 
     <lb/>
     promoted by it, are, therefore, arguments for 
     <lb/>
     union with the United States rather than with 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces; but union with the 
     <lb/>
     United States, I hope, will never take place. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Still I cannot help believing 
     <lb/>
     that this is the tendency of the measure ; for 
     <lb/>
     when we have a legislature in each province, 
     <lb/>
     with powers coördinate with those of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Legislature—or if not possessing co<lb break="no"/>ördinate powers, having the same right at least 
     <lb/>
     to legislate upon some subjects as the General 
     <lb/>
     Legislature—there are certain to arise disagree<lb break="no"/>ments between the Local and the General 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, which will lead the people to de<lb break="no"/>mand changes that may destroy our connection 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="457" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0457.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">457</fw>
     with the Mother Country. The Federal cha<lb break="no"/>racter of the United States Government has 
     <lb/>
     been referred to to prove that it has increased 
     <lb/>
     the prosperity of the people living under it; 
     <lb/>
     but in point of fact the great and relentless 
     <lb/>
     war that is now raging there—that fratricidal 
     <lb/>
     war in which brother is arrayed against bro<lb break="no"/>ther, filled with hatred toward each other, 
     <lb/>
     and which has plunged the country into all 
     <lb/>
     the horrors of the deadliest strife—is the 
     <lb/>
     comment upon the working of 
     <lb/>
     the Federal principle—the strongest argu<lb break="no"/>ment against its application to these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. (Hear, hear.) The French element 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada will be separated from us 
     <lb/>
     in its Local Legislature and become less united 
     <lb/>
     with us than it is now; and therefore there 
     <lb/>
     is likely to be disagreement between us. Still 
     <lb/>
     more likely is there to be disagreement 
     <lb/>
     when the people of Upper Canada find that 
     <lb/>
     this scheme will not relieve them of the bur<lb break="no"/>dens cast upon them, but, on the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     will subject them to a legislature that will have 
     <lb/>
     the power of imposing direct taxation in addi<lb break="no"/>tion to the burdens imposed by the General 
     <lb/>
     Government. When they find that this 
     <lb/>
     power is exercised, and they are called upon 
     <lb/>
     to contribute as much as before to the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government, while taxed to maintain a sep 
     <lb/>
     arate Local Legislature—when they find that 
     <lb/>
     the material question is to weigh with them, 
     <lb/>
     they will look to the other side of the line for 
     <lb/>
     union. I feel that we are going to do that 
     <lb/>
     which will weaken our connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, because if you give power to 
     <lb/>
     legislate upon the same subjects to both the 
     <lb/>
     local and the federal legislatures, and allow 
     <lb/>
     both to impose taxation upon the people, dis<lb break="no"/>agreements will spring up which must neces<lb break="no"/>sarily have that effect. (Hear, hear.) Then 
     <lb/>
     again, by this scheme that is laid before us, 
     <lb/>
     certain things are to be legislated upon by 
     <lb/>
     both the general and the local legislatures, 
     <lb/>
     and yet the local legislation is to be subor<lb break="no"/>dinate to the legislation of the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. For instance, emigration and agricul<lb break="no"/>ture are to be subject to the control of both 
     <lb/>
     bodies. Now suppose that the Federal Legis<lb break="no"/>lature chooses to decide in favor of having 
     <lb/>
     emigration flow to a particular locality, so as 
     <lb/>
     to benefit one province alone—I do not mean 
     <lb/>
     this expression to be understood in its entire 
     <lb/>
     sense, because I think that emigration in any 
     <lb/>
     one portion will benefit the whole, but it will 
     <lb/>
     benefit the particular locality much more at 
     <lb/>
     the time—and if provision is made by the 
     <lb/>
     General Legislature for emigration of that 
     <lb/>
    kind, and grants are made from the public 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     funds to carry it out, it will cause much com<lb break="no"/>plaint, as the people who are paying the great<lb break="no"/>est proportion of the revenue will be subject 
     <lb/>
     to the drafts upon them as before. Suppose 
     <lb/>
     again, for instance, that arrangements are 
     <lb/>
     made for emigration to a particular part of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada or New Brunswick, and a 
     <lb/>
     grant is made for the purpose, who is to say 
     <lb/>
     whether it is for the local or general good? 
     <lb/>
     It is the Federal Legislature that has to pro<lb break="no"/>nounce upon it. The expenditure and the 
     <lb/>
     benefit would be received by a portion of the 
     <lb/>
     province lying remote from that which pays 
     <lb/>
     the largest proportion of the money, and so 
     <lb/>
     we would not be relieved from the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     that have existed between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. This being the case, the reasoning 
     <lb/>
     on which this whole scheme is based falls to 
     <lb/>
     the ground. (Hear, hear.) But this question 
     <lb/>
     has been of some service. It has enabled us to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain what our debt is. This we have never 
     <lb/>
     previously been enabled with certainty to find 
     <lb/>
     out. Our highest authorities have widely dif<lb break="no"/>fered in footing it up. I recollect the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council asserting that our 
     <lb/>
     debt was eighty-five millions of dollars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—When did you hear 
     <lb/>
     that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I heard it in 
     <lb/>
     one of the speeches which you made on the 
     <lb/>
     floor of this House. You remarked that you 
     <lb/>
     had gone to the Auditor that very morning 
     <lb/>
     and found the debt to be eighty-five millions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is mistaken in the first figure. It was 
     <lb/>
     seventy-five millions that I stated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I think the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman has made a mistake. I will 
     <lb/>
     show him that his memory is short on this 
     <lb/>
     occasion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Very good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>— You said the 
     <lb/>
     debt was $85,000,000, but that there was 
     <lb/>
     the Sinking fund and the Municipal Loan in<lb break="no"/>debtedness which together would amount to 
     <lb/>
     some fourteen or fifteen millions of dollars, 
     <lb/>
     which would reduce the amount to about 
     <lb/>
    $70,000,000 of direct debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—(Hear, hear.) Why 
     <lb/>
     did you not say that at first? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">Mr. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—Well, I did not 
     <lb/>
     design to catch the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council in the trap that he had laid for him<lb break="no"/>self. (Hear, hear.) We have now found 
     <lb/>
     that our debt is not so much as that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman led us to suppose it was. The 
     <lb/>
     fourteen or fifteen millions did not belong to 
     <lb/>
     us at all. But the honorable gentleman, since 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="458" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0458.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">458</fw>
     he has been so closely connected with those 
     <lb/>
     old corruptionists, has discovered that it is 
     <lb/>
     only sixty-seven and a half millions. Well, 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. President of the Council has also 
     <lb/>
     said, and has acknowledged it too, that he 
     <lb/>
     was very much opposed to the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway , and when the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral West made the observation that he 
     <lb/>
     learned from a brief paragraph in a paper 
     <lb/>
     called the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, that Messrs. SICOTTE and 
     <lb/>
     HOWLAND were about to return, having ac<lb break="no"/>complished the object of their mission, viz: 
     <lb/>
     to throw overboard the Intercolonial Railway, 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. President of the Council remarked, 
     <lb/>
     that that was "a very sensible thing—the 
     <lb/>
     most sensible thing they ever did." But now 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman goes so heartily into 
     <lb/>
     this matter, that he will build this vast rail<lb break="no"/>way which it was so sensible to throw over<lb break="no"/>board at that time, and I think he went so 
     <lb/>
     far as to say he would build five intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     railways rather than that the scheme should 
     <lb/>
     fail. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     SEVERAL HON. MEMBERS—Six; he 
     <lb/>
     said six. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—Well, we will 
     <lb/>
     give him the benefit of one, and yet I have 
     <lb/>
     not been able to hear him express in pounds, 
     <lb/>
     shillings and pence the practical benefit there 
     <lb/>
     is to be derived by this country as compensa<lb break="no"/>tion for the expense of building that useless 
     <lb/>
     thing that it was so sensible to throw over<lb break="no"/>board two years ago ; sensible even though the 
     <lb/>
     persons who went home were charged with act<lb break="no"/>ing falsely by the people of the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and the honorable gentleman commended their 
     <lb/>
     throwing it overboard at the risk of our being 
     <lb/>
     charged with a breach of good faith. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Now, looking at this scheme politi<lb break="no"/>cally, I do not see that we gain any advantage 
     <lb/>
     from it. I do not see that it secures to us 
     <lb/>
     peace for the future. I do not think that it 
     <lb/>
     secures us against the Honorable President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council coming forward again as the 
     <lb/>
     member for South Oxford or for some other 
     <lb/>
     constituency, and shaking our whole political 
     <lb/>
     fabric by his violent agitations. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it prevents our having political fire<lb break="no"/>brands in this country such as we have had. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think it prevents our having the 
     <lb/>
     same difficulties on the floor of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislature as we have had on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House. (Hear, hear.) We may have, with 
     <lb/>
     all the additional expense we shall have gone 
     <lb/>
     to in order to obviate it, the same thing 
     <lb/>
     enacted over again. (Hear, hear.) Com<lb break="no"/>mercially, it does not promise to give us an 
     <lb/>
     advantage that will warrant the expenditure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     We are only to supply 800,000 people with 
     <lb/>
     our products. But it is said the Lower Pro 
     <lb/>
     vinces will have lands of a fertile character, 
     <lb/>
     and that when the railway is built they will 
     <lb/>
     be able to grow enough produce to support 
     <lb/>
     themselves, and we must find a market far 
     <lb/>
     beyond the market that the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     could possibly give us. And it is said that it 
     <lb/>
     would be desirable to create a trade with the 
     <lb/>
     West Indies; but that may be done just as 
     <lb/>
     well without going to the expense of a union 
     <lb/>
     with the Lower Provinces and a double set of 
     <lb/>
     parliaments. Let us have a union in which 
     <lb/>
     we are each looking out for the common inter<lb break="no"/>est, and not each for his own individual benefit. 
     <lb/>
     Commercially, then, it does not hold out such 
     <lb/>
     inducements that we need to have all this 
     <lb/>
     haste in pushing it through and preventing 
     <lb/>
     the people from pronouncing upon it. In a 
     <lb/>
     military sense it does not hold out the induce<lb break="no"/>ment that we will get by it from the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces either such assistance in men or 
     <lb/>
     money as to make it an object to unite 
     <lb/>
     with them. (Hear, hear.) In a sectional 
     <lb/>
     point of view the people of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     can see what they are to get. I cannot see 
     <lb/>
     that the people of Lower Canada are to be 
     <lb/>
     any better protected from the means that hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman has made use of to create 
     <lb/>
     all the dificulty between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada that has existed so long, and to get 
     <lb/>
     rid of which this expensive scheme is pro<lb break="no"/>posed. Upper Canada, it is said, will have 
     <lb/>
     the control of the expenditure, because they 
     <lb/>
     will have seventeen members more in the Fed— 
     <lb/>
     eral Legislature than Lower Canada; but how 
     <lb/>
     easily their influence can be checked and com<lb break="no"/>pletely swamped by the addition of forty-seven 
     <lb/>
     members from the Lower Provinces! (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Looking at it in all these aspects, I 
     <lb/>
     am at a loss to understand what great benefit 
     <lb/>
     there is in the Confederation scheme to call 
     <lb/>
     for its being put through in such a hurried 
     <lb/>
     manner. Hon. Mr. GREY said in the Low<lb break="no"/>er Provinces that it might be years be<lb break="no"/>fore the change would come into effect; that it 
     <lb/>
     would take years to think about it. He said, 
     <lb/>
     "It is not intended to hurry the proposed 
     <lb/>
     scheme into actual life and operation; it is 
     <lb/>
     not to be carried out today, but years may 
     <lb/>
     roll by before it is carried into effect." This 
     <lb/>
     quotation occurs in a speech made by Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. GREY at St. John, on the 17th Novem<lb break="no"/>ber last. Now that honorable gentleman also 
     <lb/>
     takes a very different view of what is being 
     <lb/>
     boasted of here, the imposing of direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion for the support of the local governments, 
     <lb/>
     of which he disapproved. Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="459" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0459.jpg"/>
         <fw type="num">459</fw>
      men here, however, have said that they were 
     <lb/>
     in favor of direct taxation for the support of 
     <lb/>
     the local governments, because it would lead 
     <lb/>
     those who have to pay the taxes to look more 
     <lb/>
     closely into what was going on, and the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which their money was expended. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There seems also to have been 
     <lb/>
     a feeling in the Lower Provinces in favor of 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union, and the Hon. Mr. GREY 
     <lb/>
     seems to be combatting that idea. He says 
     <lb/>
     that with a legislative union, municipal insti<lb break="no"/>tutions, and direct taxation in every province, 
     <lb/>
     would be the only means of getting along. 
     <lb/>
     He expressed himself opposed to that and 
     <lb/>
     in favor of a Federal union, which he thought 
     <lb/>
     would afford them all the advantage that could 
     <lb/>
     be attained, commercially, by union, and 
     <lb/>
     would allow each province to retain control 
     <lb/>
     over its own local affairs. The local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures, he said, were to be deprived of no power 
     <lb/>
     over their own affairs that they formerly 
     <lb/>
     posessed. But in Canada it was represented 
     <lb/>
     that the local legislatures were to be only the 
     <lb/>
     shadow of the General Legislature—that they 
     <lb/>
     were to have merely a shadow of power, as 
     <lb/>
     their proceedings were to be controlled by 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government. That is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion taken by the advocates of the measure 
     <lb/>
     on this floor. So it seems that those gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have represented to us that they 
     <lb/>
     acted in great harmony, and came to a com<lb break="no"/>mon decision when they were in conference, 
     <lb/>
     take a widely different view of the questions 
     <lb/>
     supposed to have been agreed upon, and give 
     <lb/>
     Very different accounts of what were the 
     <lb/>
     news of parties to the conference on the 
     <lb/>
     various subjects. (Hear, hear.) In the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces they were strongly opposed 
     <lb/>
     to direct taxation, while here it was present<lb break="no"/>ed as one of the advantages to accrue from 
     <lb/>
     the Federation. (Cries of No, no.) Well, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, I say yes. That view of the 
     <lb/>
     case has been taken. If the amount allowed 
     <lb/>
     for the expenses of local legislation—the 80 
     <lb/>
     cents per head—was found insufficient, the 
     <lb/>
     local parliaments must resort to direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion to make up the deficiency, while in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, it seems, nothing of that 
     <lb/>
     kind was to follow. Now, all the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who have spoken on the Government side of 
     <lb/>
     the House have declared that this scheme 
     <lb/>
     was a great scheme ; but they have declined 
     <lb/>
     to allow us to understand what sort of a local 
     <lb/>
     legislature we are to have. They will not 
     <lb/>
     tell us how our Executive is to be formed. 
     <lb/>
     They will not tell us whether we are to have 
     <lb/>
     legislative councils in Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and whether or not they will be 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     elected councils. They will not tell us what 
     <lb/>
     number of members will constitute the 
     <lb/>
     Executive Council of the Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     nor what influence each individual province 
     <lb/>
     will have in that government. They will not 
     <lb/>
     bring down the scheme for the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures. They tell us that it is better to with<lb break="no"/>hold those details—that we are dealing with 
     <lb/>
     Federation alone, and have no business dis<lb break="no"/>cussing local governments. What is the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of all this vagueness? Is it politic 
     <lb/>
     or statesmanlike to tell us that we, the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of a free people, are not to 
     <lb/>
     know anything about these things, but 
     <lb/>
    vote with our eyes shut? I hold that we 
     <lb/>ought to have the whole scheme before us, 
     <lb/>but they say we shall know nothing about 
     <lb/>it. And yet they continue to say it is a 
     <lb/>great scheme. Well, if it is a great scheme, 
     <lb/>and they continue to deal with it and with 
     <lb/>this House in this way, are not they, the 
     <lb/>architects and fabricators of this great 
     <lb/>scheme, fairly entitled to be called great 
     <lb/>schemers? (Laughter.) Are they not treating 
     <lb/>us as a lot of school-boys ? As an evidence 
     <lb/>of the excellence and popularity of their 
     <lb/>scheme, they point to the circumstance that 
     <lb/>they have formed a strong government upon 
     <lb/>the question, with a majority of seventy in 
     <lb/>this House, while two governments preced<lb break="no"/>ing them could each only muster a majority 
     <lb/>of two. And because they are so strong 
     <lb/>they feel themselves at liberty to deny to 
     <lb/>the people's representatives the right to 
     <lb/>have information on a most important mat<lb break="no"/>ter of this kind—information they would 
     <lb/>not have dared to withhold if they were 
     <lb/>weak. (Hear, hear.) When a motion is 
     <lb/>placed on the notice paper of this House for 
     <lb/>several days, requiring a statement of the 
     <lb/>portion of the debt which Lower Canada and 
     <lb/>Upper Canada respectively will have to pay, 
     <lb/>they tell us that they cannot submit to the 
     <lb/>House any information of that kind. Is it 
     <lb/>possible that the hon. gentlemen composing 
     <lb/>the Government have not determined that 
     <lb/>question at this stage of the proceeding, 
     <lb/>and that they have not yet made up their 
     <lb/>minds respecting it? If they have not, 
     <lb/>it shows that they have been trifling 
     <lb/>with their position, and have not been dis<lb break="no"/>charging the duties devolving upon them. 
     <lb/>It has also been represented that this matter 
     <lb/>has been so fully before the country for a 
     <lb/>great length of time, that it is not necessary 
     <lb/>to submit it to a vote. I would ask in what 
     <lb/>way has it been before the counter Why, 
     <lb/>it was declared, in the fist instance, by the 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="460" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0460.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">460</fw>
            
     press, that it was not possible the measure 
     <lb/>
     could be passed until it had been submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the people; it was looked upon as a thing 
     <lb/>
     which was quite impossible. There is no 
     <lb/>
     doubt the organ of the Ministry in Toronto 
     <lb/>
     —the organ more particularly of the Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council—did declare from the 
     <lb/>
     First, as if throwing out a feeler, that it 
     <lb/>
     would not be necessary to submit it to the 
     <lb/>
     people. But the press generally took a 
     <lb/>
     different view of the question, when out came 
     <lb/>
     that remarkable circular from the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary's office—(hear, hear)—which had 
     <lb/>
     such a magical effect, that at once the story 
     <lb/>
     was changed, and the advocacy was begun of 
     <lb/>
     disposing of the question without submitting 
     <lb/>
     it to the people, although the people them<lb break="no"/>selves never dreamt that it could be carried 
     <lb/>
     through this House and become a fixed fact 
     <lb/>
     until that step was taken. I do not see how 
     <lb/>
     any man, who does not desire to make him<lb break="no"/>self amenable to the charge of a breach of 
     <lb/>
     the trust reposed in him, can come here, and 
     <lb/>
     without consulting those who sent him, 
     <lb/>
     change a Constitution affecting the well-being 
     <lb/>
     of millions. (Hear, hear.) Those who 
     <lb/>
     have to pay for all this—who provide the 
     <lb/>
     revenue for carrying on the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     country—are not at liberty to express their 
     <lb/>
     views on the subject in the legitimate way 
     <lb/>
     known to the Constitution. It is argued 
     <lb/>
     that there have been no petitions presented 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation ; but where, I ask, has 
     <lb/>
     there been any agitation in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     question? Where has it been contested at 
     <lb/>
     the polls? I stand here an elected member, 
     <lb/>
     who ran against the Provincial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     when, as a member of the government 
     <lb/>
     formed for the purpose of carrying out this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, he returned to his constituents for 
     <lb/>
     reëlection, and I succeeded in defeating him. 
     <lb/>
     So far, therefore, as the people of North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario have spoken at all, their pronounc<lb break="no"/>ing, in one way, has been against it.

     dates who appeared before them were also 
     <lb/>
     under the impression, that this thing would 
     <lb/>
     never become law—that this Constitution of 
     <lb/>
     ours would never be changed, without the 
     <lb/>
     constituencies having an opportunity of pro<lb break="no"/>nouncing upon it. It was never supposed 
     <lb/>
     that the people's representatives, sent here 
     <lb/>
     for an entirely different purpose, would pre<lb break="no"/>sume or assume to set aside the Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     to make a complete revolution in the affairs 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="461" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0461.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">461</fw>
            
     of the country, to involve them in a much 
     <lb/>
     larger expenditure, to change the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Upper House completely, to bring 
     <lb/>
     in an additional number of representatives 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada, and to add a new 
     <lb/>
     element of forty-seven members altogether 
     <lb/>
     to the Lower House. I say I am persuaded 
     <lb/>
     the people did not understand that this was 
     <lb/>
     to be done without their having an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of speaking upon it, and of saying 
     <lb/>
     whether they approved of it or not. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And I scarcely can believe that we 
     <lb/>
     will be able to find, at this late day of the 
     <lb/>
     world's history, in a free country such as 
     <lb/>
     Canada, among a people who understand 
     <lb/>
     what are their rights and liberties, a govern<lb break="no"/>ment prepared to act in so unconstitutional 
     <lb/>
     a manner—a government ready to tyrannize 
     <lb/>
     and to assume the part of an oligarchy. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But this Government is pre<lb break="no"/>pared to act thus. They tell their followers 
     <lb/>
     that they are at their peril to accept the 
     <lb/>
     scheme just as it is, that they are not at 
     <lb/>
     liberty to change a single word of it, and if 
     <lb/>
     they do so they will defeat the whole project. 
     <lb/>
     That, however, is not the way in which hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen in the Lower Provinces deal with 
     <lb/>
     this question. Hon. Mr. TILLEY, in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, only two or three days ago, made the de<lb break="no"/>claration that if the people's representatives 
     <lb/>
     choose to alter the resolutions, they were at 
     <lb/>
     liberty to do so. (Hear, hear.) And yet 
     <lb/>
     we in Canada are gravely told that we are 
     <lb/>
     not to be allowed to exercise any judgment 
     <lb/>
     or to pronounce any opinion upon it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I regard the scheme itself as having 
     <lb/>
     been got up hastily, for it bears upon its face 
     <lb/>
     the evidence of haste and of compromise. 
     <lb/>
     Indeed, it is a complete piece of patchwork, 
     <lb/>
     and as we are all aware, it is a piece of patch<lb break="no"/>work in which we are not to be at liberty to 
     <lb/>
     change the patches in any respect so as to 
     <lb/>
     make it look better to the eye or more en<lb break="no"/>during to those who will have to wear it. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) On the subject 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Council, it does strike me 
     <lb/>
     that the language is not such as to convey 
     <lb/>
     the idea that hon. members of this House 
     <lb/>
     have said it ought to convey. The 14th 
     <lb/>
     section reads thus :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     The first selection of the members of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council shall be made, except as regards 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, from the legislative coun<lb break="no"/>cils of the various provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </quote></p>
   
            <p>
     You will observe the language—" From the 
     <lb/>
     legislative councils of the various provin<lb break="no"/>ces." That is, from the legislative councils 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     now in existence. " So far," the clause goes 
     <lb/>
     on to say, " as a suficient number be found 
     <lb/>
     qualified and willing to serve ; such members 
     <lb/>
     shall be appointed by the Crown at the 
     <lb/>
     recommendation of the General Executive 
     <lb/>
     Government, upon the nomination of the 
     <lb/>
     respective local governments." Honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen say that means, upon the nomina<lb break="no"/>tion, so far as Canada is concerned, of the 
     <lb/>
     present Government. I presume that in the 
     <lb/>
     nature of things, the hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     are at present administering our affairs anti<lb break="no"/>cipate that they will be the controllers of our 
     <lb/>
     destiny, for some time at all events, in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government. So that they are going 
     <lb/>
     themselves to nominate to themselves. Is 
     <lb/>
     that the object of the clause? In in point of 
     <lb/>
     fact, would it be such in its operation, because 
     <lb/>
     before these nominations can take place, I 
     <lb/>
     assume that the Executive Government 
     <lb/>
     must be in existence, and that when the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government comes into existence, 
     <lb/>
     the present Government will cease <hi rendition="simple:italic">co-in- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     stanti</hi>. I take it that so soon as the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Act passed, there would be an 
     <lb/>
     end to the present arrangements, and that 
     <lb/>
     the local legislatures and the General Le<lb break="no"/>gislature would be brought into existence at 
     <lb/>
     the same moment. The present Government 
     <lb/>
     of United Canada would cease to exist. And 
     <lb/>
     how then would the nominations to the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council take place, from this 
     <lb/>
     Government to the Executive Government 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederation? (Hear, hear) In 
     <lb/>
     one way, these resolutions may be considered 
     <lb/>
     as only an outline of the Constitution. But 
     <lb/>
     they seem to have descended to very small 
     <lb/>
     details. For instance, they say that a mem<lb break="no"/>ber who is absent from the Council for two 
     <lb/>
     sessions shall vacate his seat. This is a very 
     <lb/>
     small piece of detail, and I regard it also as 
     <lb/>
     a very unjust piece of detail, because the 
     <lb/>
     cause of a member's absence may be sickness, 
     <lb/>
     and it may be the case that a member would 
     <lb/>
     be sick during the period of two sittings 
     <lb/>
     of Parliament and well immediately after<lb break="no"/>wards. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     An HON. MEMBER—In that case he 
     <lb/>
     might be excused. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another HON. MEMBER—Or he could 
     <lb/>
     be re-appointed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—There is no 
     <lb/>
     provision for any such thing; and I hold 
     <lb/>
     that when they went into detail such as this, 
     <lb/>
     the details ought to be full enough to prove 
     <lb/>
     what is meant. But if it is not detail—if it 
     <lb/>
     is mere skeleton—why did they introduce 
     <lb/>
     this at all? Why not simply say that the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="462" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0462.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">462</fw>
           
     Legislative Council should be nominated for 
     <lb/>
     life ? We are also told that we are to have 
     <lb/>
     under the control of the federal and local 
     <lb/>
     governments the sea-coast and inland fish<lb break="no"/>eries. Of course it is impossible for me to 
     <lb/>
     say what they mean to do with these things, 
     <lb/>
     but this is a clause out of which, at all 
     <lb/>
     events, disagreements might arise. To shew 
     <lb/>
     what little care has been exercised in the 
     <lb/>
     wording of these resolutions, in one place 
     <lb/>
     they speak of the seal of the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and in another place they speak of 
     <lb/>
     the seal of the " Federated Provinces." I 
     <lb/>
     presume there is no such thing as a seal of 
     <lb/>
     a general government. It is the seal of the 
     <lb/>
     nation— of the country in its entirety; the 
     <lb/>
     same as we speak of our own seal as the 
     <lb/>
     Great Seal of the province. There may not 
     <lb/>
     be much in this; but it shews, at any rate, 
     <lb/>
     a want of care in the compilation of this 
     <lb/>
     document; it shews that they have not 
     <lb/>
    studied each resolution with a desire to 
     <lb/>make it a perfect thing. Then it is said :— 
     <lb/>" The Local Government and Legislature of 
     <lb/>each province shall be constructed in such 
     <lb/>manner as the existing legislature of each 
     <lb/>such province shall provide." I do not 
     <lb/>understand from this whether it is com<lb break="no"/>petent or not for us in this Legislature, 
     <lb/>before there is a Federal union, to make 
     <lb/>provision for the Local Government and 
     <lb/>Legislature, or whether we are to await the 
     <lb/>action upon the subject of Federation of the 
     <lb/>Imperial Government. Our action, one 
     <lb/>should suppose, ought to be taken after the 
     <lb/>Imperial Government has pronounced. Per<lb break="no"/>haps this is the intention. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>they refuse to tell us anything about it. It 
     <lb/>may be that, as soon as these resolutions 
     <lb/>are carried, we will be sent about our 
     <lb/>business; that the Imperial Legislature will 
     <lb/>be invited to pass an act, and that they will 
     <lb/>convene us again, provision being made for 
     <lb/>that course, and so in point of fact, having 
     <lb/>once affirmed the principle of Federation, 
     <lb/>we will have to accept such local legisla<lb break="no"/>latures as they choose to give us. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) I find the Finance Minister, in 
     <lb/>speaking of the construction of the local le<lb break="no"/>gislatures, saying: "It was known, at all 
     <lb/>events in the Lower Canada section or the 
     <lb/>province, that there would a Legislative 
     <lb/>Council as well as a Legislative Assembly," 
     <lb/>constituting thereby a very expensive ma<lb break="no"/>chinery of government for the local adminis<lb break="no"/>tration. I do not understand that this is 
     <lb/>the view Upper Canadians take of this matter. 
     <lb/>If we are really to have a Local Legislature, we 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     want it to be as inexpensive in its character 
     <lb/>
     as possible—we want to construct it as much 
     <lb/>
     as possible with a view to economy, in order 
     <lb/>
     to the public burdens being lessened to the 
     <lb/>
     lowest practical point. (Hear.) Giving this 
     <lb/>
     question the best attention in my power, 
     <lb/>
     desirous if possible of seeing something ac<lb break="no"/>complished by which the semblance of a 
     <lb/>
     cause for faction may be done away 
     <lb/>
     with, I would have been willing to sup<lb break="no"/>port this scheme had I seen that the 
     <lb/>
     Government in forming it had an eye to 
     <lb/>
     the true interests of the country, and not an 
     <lb/>
     eye to the creating of a number of legisla<lb break="no"/>tures, and the carrying on of works most 
     <lb/>
     expensive and burdensome in their character 
     <lb/>
     —works which will be of but little value as 
     <lb/>
     a commercial undertaking, and of very little 
     <lb/>
     value for military purposes, but which, no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, are absolutely necessary for bringing 
     <lb/>
     us into contact with the people of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. It seems to me that it would be 
     <lb/>
     much better had this Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>
     been built without forming this union at all. 
     <lb/>
     (Opposition cheers.) Had we gone on 
     <lb/>
     building the railway without a union, it 
     <lb/>
     would have been less expensive in its char<lb break="no"/>acter to us ; we would have gained more by 
     <lb/>
     it, and we would have had the control of 
     <lb/>
     our aflairs, without being swamped, so far as 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada is concerned. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     As it is, we shall get no more benefit from 
     <lb/>
     it, commercially, than if it had been built 
     <lb/>
     without a union of the provinces.

     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I do not know 
     <lb/>
     what will be done under the new arrange<lb break="no"/>ment. But under the old arrangement we 
     <lb/>
     were to have paid five-twelfths of the cost, 
     <lb/>
     and the charge upon us now will be at least 
     <lb/>
     double that sum. So that in whatever way 
     <lb/>
     this matter is looked at, it will be seen that 
     <lb/>
     there has been no design for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     advantaging Upper Canada, whose people are 
     <lb/>
     to find the means by which all this extrava<lb break="no"/>gance is to be carried on. In the formation 
     <lb/>
     of this scheme, it has been truly admitted 
     <lb/>
     that compromises have been made. The Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces have laws which are not in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with our own in Upper Canada, and it 
     <lb/>
     has been thought very desirable that they 
     <lb/>
     should be brought into unison and, if pos<lb break="no"/>sible, consolidated. Well, provision has been 
     <lb/>
     made for the consolidation of these laws; but 
     <lb/>
     observe how religiously the laws of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada are guarded from interference. The 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">463</fw>
     33rd sub-section gives to the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment the power of "rendering uniform 
     <lb/>
     all or any of the laws relative to property 
     <lb/>
     and civil rights in Upper Canada, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, and rendering uniform 
     <lb/>
     the procedure of all or any of the courts in 
     <lb/>
     these provinces ; but any statute for this 
     <lb/>
     purpose shall have no force or authority in 
     <lb/>
     any province until sanctioned by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature thereof." So that in reality no such 
     <lb/>
     law will be binding until it has the sanction 
     <lb/>
     of the Local Legislature of the province 
     <lb/>
     particularly affected thereby. Such being 
     <lb/>
     the guarded terms of the resolution, why is 
     <lb/>
     it not made applicable to Lower Canada as 
     <lb/>
     well as to the other provinces? Nothing could 
     <lb/>
     be done respecting its peculiar laws without 
     <lb/>
     the consent of its Local Legislature, and it 
     <lb/>
     is quite possible to my mind, that there are 
     <lb/>
     some laws which it would be advantageous 
     <lb/>
     to all parts of the Confederation to assimilate. 
     <lb/>
     But they emphatically declare in these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions that there shall be no interference 
     <lb/>
     with the laws of Lower Canada. So that 
     <lb/>
     while it is proposed to assimilate the laws of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, there is a large section 
     <lb/>
     of intervening country which is to have, for 
     <lb/>
     all time to come, laws separate and distinct 
     <lb/>
     from the rest. (Hear, hear.) There is a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of difference in making a provision 
     <lb/>
     of this kind, which is to give the people the 
     <lb/>
     option, and which is not to be binding for all 
     <lb/>
     time to come unless sanctioned by them, and 
     <lb/>
     declaring that a law shall be forced upon the 
     <lb/>
     peeple whether they liked it or not. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
    I can easily understand the feeling of the 
     <lb/>French people, and can admire it—that they 
     <lb/>do not want to have anything forced upon 
     <lb/>them whether they will or not. But that they 
     <lb/>will not allow you to contemplate even the 
     <lb/>possibility of any change taking place for 
     <lb/>the general weal, and with their own consent, 
     <lb/>in their laws —that they will not allow any<lb break="no"/>thing to be introduced into this measure by 
     <lb/>which, under any circumstances whatever, 
     <lb/>we can meddle with the laws of this particu<lb break="no"/>lar section of the country—I do not under<lb break="no"/>stand. And having feelings of this kind, and 
     <lb/>manifesting them so strongly as they do in 
     <lb/>this document, it appears to me that in 
     <lb/>going into this union, we do not go into it 
     <lb/>with the proper elements. We go into it 
     <lb/>With elements of strife and dissension, rather 
     <lb/>than of union and strength. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>That is to be regretted ; for if a change is to 
     <lb/>be made affecting the destinies of the people 
     <lb/>0f this country, it is lamentable that we do 
     <lb/>
            
    
            <cb/>
            
     not find patriotism enough among the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people to be willing to give 
     <lb/>
     and take, so that we may have such a union 
     <lb/>
     as will be beneficial to the whole, and not 
     <lb/>
     one burdensome to the whole, because one 
     <lb/>
     portion of the country says, " We have pecu<lb break="no"/>liar institutions which we dare not entrust to 
     <lb/>
     the care of you, gentleman, who are to be 
     <lb/>
     united with us." Having given this whole 
     <lb/>
     matter the best attention I could, with the 
     <lb/>
     most earnest desire that any man could have 
     <lb/>
     to come to a just conclusion, I have not been 
     <lb/>
     able to satisfy myself that there are not the 
     <lb/>
     elements of ruin rather than of safety and 
     <lb/>
     strength in this scheme; that there are not 
     <lb/>
     the elements of the dismemberment of this 
     <lb/>
     country from the Empire to which we belong, 
     <lb/>
     and have pride in belonging; that there is 
     <lb/>
     not the means here of causing us to drift right 
     <lb/>
     into the vortex of annexation to the United 
     <lb/>
     States, whether we will or not. So far as I 
     <lb/>
     am concerned, I should sooner see perish 
     <lb/>
     root and branch everything belonging to 
     <lb/>
     me, than I would become a party to a union 
     <lb/>
     with that power. Feeling no hostility to the 
     <lb/>
     people there—feeling as friendly to them as to 
     <lb/>
     any other people, still I have that attachment 
     <lb/>
     to British institutions—I have within me 
     <lb/>
     that feeling of allegiance to the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown, which would not allow me to throw 
     <lb/>
     off British connection under any circum<lb break="no"/>stances whatever, or even to accept the 
     <lb/>
     disruption of that connection, if it were 
     <lb/>
     off'ered to us by Great Britain. I feel it 
     <lb/>
     would be a curse to this country, if we were 
     <lb/>
     forced into that union—forced to adopt the 
     <lb/>
     licentiousness of conduct which we find 
     <lb/>
     there, and habits and manners totally dis<lb break="no"/>tasteful to us. To be brought into that 
     <lb/>
     union would seem to me the greatest injury 
     <lb/>
     which by possibility could happen to us. In 
     <lb/>
     adapting the scheme before us, I feel we 
     <lb/>
     would be sowing the seeds of discord and 
     <lb/>
     strife, which would destroy our union, instead 
     <lb/>
     of its being cemented by this measure. I 
     <lb/>
     am therefore opposed to the scheme, because 
     <lb/>
     I believe that politically, commercially, and 
     <lb/>
     defensively, as a matter of economy or of 
     <lb/>
     sectional benefit, it will not be one tittle of 
     <lb/>
     service to this country, but on the contrary 
     <lb/>
     will inflict on it a vast and lasting injury. 
     <lb/>

     on this subject which have not already been

     which I propose to take with reference to this

     important one, and, from the momentous 
     <lb/>
     character of the interests involved in this 
     <lb/>
     proposed change of our Constitution, deserves 
     <lb/>
     the earnest attention of every true Canadian. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In the first place, I feel some 
     <lb/>
     explanation should be given of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     which have induced myself, in common with 
     <lb/>
     a large number of the liberal members of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, to take the course we have 
     <lb/>
     seen fit to take with reference to the present 
     <lb/>
     Government, and the policy they have laid 
     <lb/>
     before the country. In Upper Canada—I 
     <lb/>
     believe in almost every constituency—there 
     <lb/>
     has long been an agitation having reference 
     <lb/>
     to the sectional difficulties between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. This agitation, instead of 
     <lb/>
     diminishing, has continued to gather strength. 
     <lb/>
     Ever since the union of 1841, Western Can<lb break="no"/>ada has felt—and I think justly felt—that it 
     <lb/>
     did not receive that justice to which its wealth 
     <lb/>
     and population entitled it. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, the French population of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     believed, or professed to believe, that an in<lb break="no"/>creased representation of Upper Canada in 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature would tend to destroy their 
     <lb/>
     language, their laws, and their religion. The 
     <lb/>
     difficult position into which we were brought 
     <lb/>
     by this antagonism was such, that when the 
     <lb/>
     proposition came from the Government that 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable the President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. BROWN) should unite with them 
     <lb/>
     to see if some means could not be devised by 
     <lb/>
     which these unfortunate sectional difficulties 
     <lb/>
     might be arranged, I felt it my duty—how<lb break="no"/>ever unpleasant, however strange it may have 
     <lb/>
     seemed that we should alienate ourselves from 
     <lb/>
     the liberal section of Lower Canada—yet, 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that some change was necessary in 
     <lb/>
     the management of the public affairs of this 
     <lb/>
     country, l felt it my duty, as an Upper Can<lb break="no"/>adian—I may say as a Canadian—to do, as 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
            
     far as I possibly could, what might tend to 
     <lb/>
     remove from our country the unfortunate 
     <lb/>
    difficulties under which we have labored 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I believe that the people of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada at least—I may say of Canada 
     <lb/>generally—have become tired of the strife in 
     <lb/>which we have been involved for many years, 
     <lb/>and which has put a step to that practical 
     <lb/>and useful legislation which the country re<lb break="no"/>quired for the development of its resources. 
     <lb/>believe the people of this country, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the position in which we found our<lb break="no"/>selves, had become earnestly desirous of a 
     <lb/>change; but the change they looked to was 
     <lb/>not in the direction of a union with the United 
     <lb/>States. (Hear, hear.) The change they 
     <lb/>looked for was in the direction of a union 
     <lb/>with the other British provinces ; one which 
     <lb/>should embrace—I hope at no distant day— 
     <lb/>the British colonies on the far Pacific coast, 
     <lb/>as well as those to the east of us, bordering 
     <lb/>on the Atlantic. (Hear, hear.) I believe 
     <lb/>that this scheme of union now proposed— 
     <lb/>though I feel that it has many imperfections 
     <lb/>—is still a step in the right direction. It is 
     <lb/>perfectly impossible that the people of this 
     <lb/>country should be satisfied to remain in the 
     <lb/>agitated state, politically, in which they have 
     <lb/>hitherto been, and which might ultimately 
     <lb/>land them in difficulties, for which no other 
     <lb/>solution could be found than that to which 
     <lb/>our neighbors on the other side of the line 
     <lb/>have unfortunately been compelled to resort. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) The honorable member for 
     <lb/>Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION) truly said, so 
     <lb/>long ago as 1858, that the country was then 
     <lb/>almost verging on revolution, and that a 
     <lb/>change was necessary. The necessity for such 
     <lb/>a change, instead of diminishing since, has 
     <lb/>increased. (Hear, hear.) As far as I have 
     <lb/>been able to ascertain the feelings of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, I have not as yet under<lb break="no"/>stood one honorable gentleman to state that 
     <lb/>he was opposed to a union with the other 
     <lb/>provinces. Even the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>who has preceded me has stated that he advo<lb break="no"/>cates such a union, and believes it would be 
     <lb/>beneficial to this country; only he did not like 
     <lb/>the manner and the details of the present 
     <lb/>scheme. But, while he and other honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen have condemned that scheme of 
     <lb/>union which is now submitted to the House, 
     <lb/>While professing to be in favor of union in the 
     <lb/>abstract, I have as yet failed to find one of 
     <lb/>them offering anything as an improvement 
     <lb/>upon it. (Hear, hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:MCGI1">MR. MCGIVERIN</persName>—The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAM<lb break="no"/>ERON) has stated, that while he is an ad<lb break="no"/>vocate of union, he believed that a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     would be preferable to a Federal union. It is 
     <lb/>
     easy for honorable members to make that as<lb break="no"/>sertion. There are few, at least, of the 
     <lb/>
     English-speaking of this country who would 
     <lb/>
     not also be favorable to the principle of a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union. But can we get it? We 
     <lb/>
     have tried year after year to obtain represent<lb break="no"/>ation by population, with a view to bettering 
     <lb/>
     our condition in the western section of the 
     <lb/>
     province, by getting a fair and equal distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of the public moneys of the country, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to our wealth and population, and the 
     <lb/>
     measure in which we contribute to the public 
     <lb/>
     revenue. Few, I think, will deny that the 
     <lb/>
     western section—for whatever reason, whether 
     <lb/>
     because of its being more favorably situated, 
     <lb/>
     md having a better climate and more fertile 
     <lb/>
     soil, or from whatever other cause—the fact is 
     <lb/>
     indisputable that the western section of this 
     <lb/>
     province produces more and consumes more 
     <lb/>
     than the eastern section. And this formed 
     <lb/>
     the ground of complaint, the reason of the 
     <lb/>
     agitation, that notwithstanding this fact, we 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada were not placed on an equal 
     <lb/>
     footing with the Lower Canadians in the le<lb break="no"/>gislature of the country, and in the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of its affairs. Hence it is that popu<lb break="no"/>lar opinion in Upper Canada has declared so 
     <lb/>
     emphatically that a change is necessary. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario favors a kind of union which, 
     <lb/>
     though desirable in many respects, most 
     <lb/>
     people believe to be impracticable. Are the 
     <lb/>
     French population, who are entitled to claim 
     <lb/>
     just and equal rights, willing to concede it ? 
     <lb/>
     I believe not. Even the liberal section of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada refused to concede to us a fair 
     <lb/>
     legislative union. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Hochelaga—a gentleman for whom I en<lb break="no"/>tertain the highest respect—I believe a more 
     <lb/>
     liberal or high-minded man does not sit in this 
     <lb/>
     House—even he, whilst we were acting with 
     <lb/>
     him politically, when appealed to time after 
     <lb/>
     time to join with the Liberal section of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada in some policy that would remove 
     <lb/>
    these unfortunate difficulties, constantly re<lb break="no"/>fused to do so, and told us it was impossible for 
     <lb/>him and his friends to meet us on that ground. 
     <lb/>Therefore, when at the cloœ of last session, the 
     <lb/>people of Upper Canada were met, as they 
     <lb/>were met, by the other political party of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, telling us— "Here, we are 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     willing to yield you what you desire, only in<lb break="no"/>stead of conceding representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion pure and simple, we believe a Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of the whole British American Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     with that principle recognised in the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, would be preferable; or, failing 
     <lb/>
     that, we are willing to have a Federation of 
     <lb/>
     the two provinces of Canada,"— when that 
     <lb/>
     was offered us, would we have been justified 
     <lb/>
     in rejecting it, simply because in accepting it 
     <lb/>
     we were compelled for the time to allow party 
     <lb/>
     feelings to remain in abeyance, or because we 
     <lb/>
     had to work in harmony for a time with the 
     <lb/>
     men to whom we had been opposed political<lb break="no"/>ly, whom perhaps in time past we had strong<lb break="no"/>1y denounced ? Should we, when offered that 
     <lb/>
     for which we, as a party and as a people, had 
     <lb/>
     worked and agitated year after year, have re<lb break="no"/>fused it, simply because it was not offered by 
     <lb/>
     those with whom we had hitherto acted poli<lb break="no"/>tically ? (Hear, hear.) I for one felt—what<lb break="no"/>ever opinions any might entertain of my con<lb break="no"/>duct—I felt that, as an Upper Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     in justice to my country, 1 was bound to set 
     <lb/>
     aside party feeling and take that course which 
     <lb/>
     was for the best interests of our common 
     <lb/>
     country. (Hear, hear.) The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Ontario has stated with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to this Confederation—and similar lan<lb break="no"/>guage was held by the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga—that commercially, politically and 
     <lb/>
     defensively the union of these provinces, con<lb break="no"/>stituted in the way proposed, would be a fail<lb break="no"/>ure. It was also stated by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for North Ontario, that instead of 
     <lb/>
     our preparing ourselves for the contingency of 
     <lb/>
     difficulties arising with our neighbors, we 
     <lb/>
     should remain quiet; we should, in other 
     <lb/>
     words, lie down and allow them to ride over 
     <lb/>
     us and trample us in the dust. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, that was not the 
     <lb/>
     sentiment, those were not the feelings which 
     <lb/>
     actuated the noble veterans of 1812—(hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear)—who, though few in number, with a 
     <lb/>
     country sparsely settled and an immense ex<lb break="no"/>tent of frontier, bravely did all that lay in 
     <lb/>
     their power to resist the foe; and they not 
     <lb/>
     only resisted but repelled him. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Though we are still comparatively few in 
     <lb/>
     number, we have nevertheless increased since 
     <lb/>
     that period in wealth and in population in 
     <lb/>
     an equal ratio with the United States. _ And 
     <lb/>
     though this war has developed great military 
     <lb/>
     resources on their part, I think shall be able 
     <lb/>
     to show that with the resources we have— 
     <lb/>
     with the force we can bring into the field of 
     <lb/>
     at least six hundred thousand armed men if 
     <lb/>
     needed — (hear, hear)—and with the aid 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="466" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0466.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">466</fw>
           
     Great Britain will always extend to us, if we 
     <lb/>
     show that we on our part are prepared to do 
     <lb/>
     our duty—I believe that we are in quite as 
     <lb/>
     good a position to hold our own as those who 
     <lb/>
     successfully resisted the invader in the war 
     <lb/>
     of 1812. (Hear, hear.) On this point we 
     <lb/>
     can take an encouraging lesson from history. 
     <lb/>
     When the American colonies which now form 
     <lb/>
     the United States rebelled against Great Brit<lb break="no"/>ain, their population was not over one or two 
     <lb/>
     hundred thousand in excess of the population 
     <lb/>
     of the five colonies that are to form our pro<lb break="no"/>posed Confederation. (Hear, hear.) At 
     <lb/>
     that time they had certainly fewer resources 
     <lb/>
     in every respect than the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try now possess, and yet they resisted, and 
     <lb/>
     successfully resisted, one of the greatest 
     <lb/>
     powers in the world, and wrested from it 
     <lb/>
     their independence. Here, in the event of 
     <lb/>
     an attack, we are placed in a precisely similar 
     <lb/>
     position. One man in this country is equal 
     <lb/>
     to three invaders. (Hear, hear.) It has been 
     <lb/>
     demonstrated in the struggle now pending 
     <lb/>
     between the North and the South, that on 
     <lb/>
     account of the difficulties the country attacked 
     <lb/>
     presents to the enemy, and the advantages it 
     <lb/>
     gives to those defending it, one man is equal 
     <lb/>
     to three in resisting an invading army. The 
     <lb/>
     South—although they have been blockaded 
     <lb/>
     on the sea-cost—although they have had an 
     <lb/>
     immense extent of frontier to defend—al<lb break="no"/>though the have had the internal weakness 
     <lb/>
     of four millions of slaves to contend with— 
     <lb/>
     and although the white population is little 
     <lb/>
     more than that now possessed by the provin<lb break="no"/>ces which are to form this Confederation; 
     <lb/>
     have nevertheless resisted for four years—I 
     <lb/>
     may say successfully—all the power and 
     <lb/>
     infiuence and available resources which the 
     <lb/>
     United States have been able to bring against 
     <lb/>
     them. Hear, hear.) I sincerely trust and 
     <lb/>
     pray, an it should be the desire of every true 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, that we may continue in peace; but 
     <lb/>
     to say that it is impossible for us to contend 
     <lb/>
     against a force that may be brought against 
     <lb/>
     us, is to say that from which I for one must 
     <lb/>
     dissent. (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, I believe 
     <lb/>
     that in a commercial, agricultural, and defen<lb break="no"/>sive point of view, the union would be desir<lb break="no"/>able. Placed as we are now, with the   
     <lb/>
     of the Reciprocity treaty threatened, 
     <lb/>
     does it not become our duty, I ask, to make 
     <lb/>
     some effort to change and improve our condi<lb break="no"/>dition? As I stated, sir, the subject has 
     <lb/>
     been so able placed before this House by hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen who have preceded me, and 
     <lb/>
    who are so much more capable of dealing with 
     <lb/>it than I am, that I will not attempt to re<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
            peat the arguments in favor of this scheme, 
     <lb/>
     commercially, financially, and politically, 
     <lb/>
     which have already been adduced. But there 
     <lb/>
     are one or two instances as to the resourses of 
     <lb/>
     the whole of British North America, to which 
     <lb/>
     I would for a moment invite the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House. The union is desirable with a 
     <lb/>
     view to the development of our mineral re<lb break="no"/>sources. In British Columbia and Vancou<lb break="no"/>ver's Island the gold fields equal, if they do 
     <lb/>
     not exceed in value, these of any other 
     <lb/>
     part of the world. Iron we have in that 
     <lb/>
     vast extent of country lying between the 
     <lb/>
     Rocky Mountains and Lake Superior, a 
     <lb/>
     country equal if not superior, for the purposes 
     <lb/>
     of settlement and cultivation to any we 
     <lb/>
     have in Canada, and whose area is esti<lb break="no"/>mated at from eighty to one hundred million 
     <lb/>
     acres. Then, again, we have magnificent iron 
     <lb/>
     and copper mines in Canada, while the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces possess vast mineral resources, ex<lb break="no"/>tensive coal fields, and valuable fisheries. We 
     <lb/>
     have all the natural wealth to make us a great 
     <lb/>
     peeple if we pursue a course to develope it. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) To illustrate my argument. I 
     <lb/>
     will mention some of the figures showing the 
     <lb/>
     resources of the different countries adjacent 
     <lb/>
     to and forming part of that great district, with 
     <lb/>
     an identity of interest. (Hear, hear.) In 
     <lb/>
     Nevada, in 1860, the pepu ation was 6,857, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1863, 60,000. About eleven millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars have been invested in the opening 
     <lb/>
     up of roads and in other improvements, and 
     <lb/>
    the resources of the country in 1863 amounted 
     <lb/>to $15,000,000. Victoria, in Australia, in 
     <lb/>1861, had a population of 540,322, and they 
     <lb/>have constructed 350 miles of railway. The 
     <lb/>revenue was $15,000,000, and they have their 
     <lb/>magnificent cities and splendid homesteads, 
     <lb/>with every comfort and luxury. In Utah, 
     <lb/>where perhaps there are many difficulties to 
     <lb/>retard the growth of the country, we find 
     <lb/>that in 1860 the population was 41,000—an 
     <lb/>increase in ten years of 254 per cent. The 
     <lb/>value of property in 1850 was $986,000, and 
     <lb/>ten years afterwards, in 1860, it was five and 
     <lb/>a half millions—an increase in this period of 
     <lb/>468 per cent. Iron and copper mines have 
     <lb/>been more developed in that territory than 
     <lb/>gold, although they possess gold as well. In 
     <lb/>186} the population was estimated at 75,000. 
     <lb/>Colorado has a population of 60,000, and the 
     <lb/>production of gold in 1864 was fifteen 
     <lb/>millions of dollars. Agriculture also is 
     <lb/>being rapidly developed. I wished to men<lb break="no"/>tion these facts to show what we may look 
     <lb/>forward to if we carry out this union 
     <lb/>honestly and fairly, as I believe the Gov<lb break="no"/> 
     
           

    
            <pb n="467" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0467.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">467</fw>
           
     ernment intend to carry it out; not sim<lb break="no"/>ply a union with the Maritime Provinces, but 
     <lb/>
     a union of all the British colonies in America 
     <lb/>
     from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If I felt that honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who have now the control of the public af<lb break="no"/>fairs of this country did not intend honestly 
     <lb/>
     and faithfully to carry out the union in this 
     <lb/>
     sense, and to take measures for the opening- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     up of the great North-West territory, for the 
     <lb/>
     enlargement of our canals, and for the general 
     <lb/>
     improvement of our internal water communi<lb break="no"/>cations, I for one would not hesitate to give 
     <lb/>
     my voice, and whatever influence I possess, to 
     <lb/>
     oppose them. (Hear, hear.) I wish to be 
     <lb/>
     understood that I mention these gold-hearing 
     <lb/>
     countries, and countries possessing mineral 
     <lb/>
     wealth, to illustrate that we have all that 
     <lb/>
     wealth in our own possession if we only de<lb break="no"/>velop it. The gold produced from Australia, 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia and California during the 
     <lb/>
     last six years has been estimated at nearly 
     <lb/>
     two thousand millions of dollars. The polit<lb break="no"/>ical divisions of British North America are as 
     <lb/>
     follows: Upper Canada, Lower Canada, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, Newfoundland, Vancouver's Island, Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Columbia, Red River Settlement, and the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay Territory. The combined ter<lb break="no"/>ritory is equal to a square of 1,770 miles, or 
     <lb/>
     more than three millions of square miles. 
     <lb/>
     This vast area is peopled by about four mil<lb break="no"/>lions of inhabitants, of whom nearly three 
     <lb/>
     millions are contained in the Canadas. That, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, is what I understand to be the 
     <lb/>
     contemplated union; that is the union which 
     <lb/>
     I understand the Government are pledged to 
     <lb/>
     this House and to the count to carry out, 
     <lb/>
     and I say that if I did not believe it was their 
     <lb/>
     honest intention to carry that union into ef<lb break="no"/>fect, I would not have the slightest hesitation 
     <lb/>
     in giving my vote against them. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Now, sir, I would allude to British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     and its resources. British Columbia embraces 
     <lb/>
     an area of 213,500 square miles. Its exports 
     <lb/>
     in 1862 amounted to $9,257,875, chiefly in 
     <lb/>
     gold and furs, and its imports were valued at 
     <lb/>
     $2,200,000. Vancouver's Island embraces 
     <lb/>
     an area of 16,000 square miles, with a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 11,463. In 1862 its imports amount<lb break="no"/>ed to $3,555,000. The Hudson Bay Terri<lb break="no"/>tory embraces an area of 1,800,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles, with a population of 200,000. Now we 
     <lb/>
     come to the Lake Superior region, which has 
     <lb/>
     been entirely or almost entirely neglected by 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada, whilst our neighbors on 
     <lb/>
     the American side, more energetic and more 
     <lb/>
     enterprising I must confess than we have been, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     have built up an immense trade. In 1863 the 
     <lb/>
     amount of capital employed to work the mines 
     <lb/>
     on the American side was $6,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     The amount of copper produced in 1863 was 
     <lb/>
     nine thousand tons, and of iron a hundred 
     <lb/>
     and eighty-five thousand tons. The total 
     <lb/>
     exports were $10,000,000, and the imports 
     <lb/>
     $12,000,000. But whilst this vast trade has 
     <lb/>
     been produced on the American side, little or 
     <lb/>
     no attention has been given by the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to the mineral section on our side, 
     <lb/>
     and I mention these figures to show what 
     <lb/>
     wealth we possess still in an undeveloped 
     <lb/>
     state. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I regret 
     <lb/>
     that I am not able to place my views so clear<lb break="no"/>ly before the House as other honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who have addressed it. I regret that 
     <lb/>
     on this occasion, not having intended to 
     <lb/>
     speak to-night, I have not been able to in<lb break="no"/>terest the House more than I have done. 
     <lb/>
     (Cries of "Go on.") But I think that 
     <lb/>
     what should occupy the attention of this 
     <lb/>
     House, and of the people of the country, is 
     <lb/>
     the practical consideration of the question 
     <lb/>
     now under discussion. (Hear, hear.) Sir, 
     <lb/>
     the resources of Canada it is unnecessary for 
     <lb/>
     me to allude to. They are well known to 
     <lb/>
     every member of this House. But it has 
     <lb/>
     been said, in reference to those of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, that the people will not bring into 
     <lb/>
     the union a reasonable proportion of wealth. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, it has been stated that the 
     <lb/>
    have nothing to bring us but fish and coal. I 
     <lb/>believe that their resources will compare favor<lb break="no"/>ably with those of this province or of the 
     <lb/>United States. (Hear, hear.) The revenue 
     <lb/>of New Brunswick in 1850 was $416,348; 
     <lb/>in 1860, $833,324; and in 1862, $692,230. 
     <lb/>New, sir, I think that these figures will show 
     <lb/>that New Brunswick was increasing in an 
     <lb/>equal, if not greater, ratio than this country. 
     <lb/>Being isolated from this province, being al<lb break="no"/>most entire strangers, and having little or no 
     <lb/>intercourse with each other, we find that 
     <lb/>nearly all the trade has gone to a foreign 
     <lb/>country. The trade in 1862 was, with Ca<lb break="no"/>nada—imports, $191,522; exports, 848.090. 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia—imports, $861,652; exports, 
     <lb/>$341,027. Prince Edward Island—imports, 
     <lb/>$82,240; exports, $80,932. Newfoundland— 
     <lb/>exports, 811,855. United States —imports, 
     <lb/>$3,960,703; exports, $889,416. Under the 
     <lb/>union, Canada might expect to get the trade 
     <lb/>of all these provinces. The trade with 
     <lb/>Canada is almost entirely in flour, shipped 
     <lb/>through the United States to these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The agricultural products of New 
     <lb/>Brunswick in 1851 and 1861 were as fol<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
     tons; 1861, 326,429. I merely allude to 
     <lb/>
     these figures to show hon. gentlemen that 
     <lb/>
     these colonies have other and very valuable 
     <lb/>
     resources besides those which have been 
     <lb/>
     stated by some members, namely, fish 
     <lb/>
     and coal. (Hear, hear.) It was stated 
     <lb/>
     by the honorable member for North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON)—and I 
     <lb/>
     think ingeniously stated—that this union 
     <lb/>
     would produce an enormous increase of tax<lb break="no"/>ation on the people of Canada; that the 
     <lb/>
     partnership would be a very unprofitable 
     <lb/>
     one to us. Now I think he failed to make 
     <lb/>
     a point on that. It has been shown that we 
     <lb/>
     enter into this union with a debt of twenty 
     <lb/>
     five dollars a head, and that the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, instead of bringing a load upon us 
     <lb/>
     by coming into the partnership, occupy a de<lb break="no"/>cidedly favorable position with regard to this 
     <lb/>
     country. (Hear, hear.) The hon member 
     <lb/>
     for North Ontario also stated that the union 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces would involve this country 
     <lb/>
     in a great local debt, a statement which I 
     <lb/>
     think is also erroneous. He is favorable to 
     <lb/>
     a union, but would prefer a legislative one. 
     <lb/>
     But does he pretend to say that such a 
     <lb/>
     union would tend less to the swamping of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, which he fears under the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation? His financial argument, 
     <lb/>
     that our debt and our taxation would in<lb break="no"/>crease, has failed, except thus far, that the 
     <lb/>
     machinery of the Government may be too 
     <lb/>
     expensive. If the present Government fail 
     <lb/>
     to discharge their duty and adopt an unduly 
     <lb/>
     expensive machinery, it is by that means 
     <lb/>
     alone that an increased expenditure can 
     <lb/>
     arise. It does not depend on the fact of the 
     <lb/>
     union ; it rests entirely on this, whether this 
     <lb/>
     union is carried out fairly and properly. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The next point is the construc<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="469" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0469.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">469</fw>
          
     tion of the Intercolonial Railway, and to that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Ontario is favor<lb break="no"/>able, except that he would rather see it built 
     <lb/>
     without the union than with it, because the 
     <lb/>
     union will add so much to the expenses of 
     <lb/>
     the country. In reference to that, the increase 
     <lb/>
     of the expenditure will depend entirely on 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentlemen who have now the charge 
     <lb/>
     of the government of the country. If they 
     <lb/>
     are extravagant; if they have a governor 
     <lb/>
     with a retinue, and for each of the provin<lb break="no"/>ces an expensive staff, and all the appliances 
     <lb/>
     of royalty, then I believe that the union would 
     <lb/>
     add greatly to the expenses of the country. 
     <lb/>
     But I do not understand that such is their 
     <lb/>
     opinion. I believe their desire is—and I 
     <lb/>
     am satisfied that if they have not this desire 
     <lb/>
     the peeple will require it of them—that it 
     <lb/>
     shall be conducted on principles of economy, 
     <lb/>
     and in such a manner that increased taxation 
     <lb/>
     will not necessarily be the result. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Now, sir, in reference to this great 
     <lb/>
     country which I have briefly adverted to, I 
     <lb/>
     wish it to be distinctly understood by the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Government that I for one 
     <lb/>
     support them on this understanding, and on 
     <lb/>
     this understanding only—that the union of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces and the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway, the opening up of the 
     <lb/>
     North-West and the enlargement of our 
     <lb/>
     canals, shall be considered part of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, with a view to developing our great 
     <lb/>
     natural resources and placing this country in 
     <lb/>
     a prominent position, not only as a colony 
     <lb/>
     but as a community, that will command the 
     <lb/>
     respect of nations. (Hear, hear.) We must 
     <lb/>
     have these promises respecting the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     West and the canals fairly carried out, and 
     <lb/>
     not be placed in such a position that after 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway shall have been 
     <lb/>
     constructed, there will be a combination of 
     <lb/>
     eastern interests to prevent the accomplish<lb break="no"/>ment of these other works and swamp the 
     <lb/>
     great North-West. If there is to be a doubt 
     <lb/>
     upon that point, I for one, without any 
     <lb/>
     hesitation, will state that I will not support 
     <lb/>
     a scheme that will admit of it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am most decidedly opposed to the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway as a commercial under<lb break="no"/>taking. I believe it never can be made a 
     <lb/>
     profitable commercial work. But this I do 
     <lb/>
     believe, that situated as we are, with the 
     <lb/>
     probability of being shut out from the mar<lb break="no"/>kets of the United States by the abrogation 
     <lb/>
     of the Reciprocity treaty-of being restricted 
     <lb/>
     in our commercial intercourse with the world 
     <lb/>
     by the repeal of the bonding system—of being 
     <lb/>
     crippled by every step the Americans may 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     take with the view of forcing us into closer 
     <lb/>
     political relations with them, it is our duty 
     <lb/>
     for purposes of self-defence, and with a view 
     <lb/>
     of placing ourselves in an independent posi<lb break="no"/>tion and having our resources developed, 
     <lb/>
     fairly, properly and honestly to carry out 
     <lb/>
     this scheme with the construction of the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway as part of it. As a commer<lb break="no"/>cial work, I have looked into it in all its 
     <lb/>
     bearings, and have failed to see the advan<lb break="no"/>tages it will confer. The farmers of the 
     <lb/>
     grain-producing districts of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     have the same market to sell their surplus 
     <lb/>
     products as the farmers of the States, that 
     <lb/>
     is, the English market. Now. I think it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to show that the produce of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada can be conveyed by this 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway to the seaboard, and 
     <lb/>
     thence to Liverpool, as profitably as the 
     <lb/>
     Americans can carry it to the seaboard at 
     <lb/>
     New York and thence to the English mar<lb break="no"/>ket. If by the one route the grain cannot 
     <lb/>
     be carried as cheaply as by the other, it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible for the Canadian farmer or mer<lb break="no"/>chant to be placed in as good a position as 
     <lb/>
     the American. But if, having constructed 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway, our Government 
     <lb/>
     says, " We will compete with the Americans; 
     <lb/>
     we will put the rates of transportation so low 
     <lb/>
     as to offer our farmers as cheap a route by it 
     <lb/>
     as by the States," then the cost of this will 
     <lb/>
     have to be borne by the people in another 
     <lb/>
     way, for the road failing to pay even expenses, 
     <lb/>
     the excess of expenditure will become 
     <lb/>
     a charge upon the country for years. View 
     <lb/>
     it then in any light, and the proposed 
     <lb/>
     road cannot be made profitable. But for 
     <lb/>
     purposes of defence, and as a means of com<lb break="no"/>munication, if we desire to be united with 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces and retain our connec<lb break="no"/>tion with Great Britain, the construction of 
     <lb/>
     the road is a necessity. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     desire, Mr. SPEAKER, to state what in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion will be some of the commercial 
     <lb/>
     results of this union. If the North-West 
     <lb/>
     contains land, as I believe it does, equal to 
     <lb/>
     almost any on this continent, it should be 
     <lb/>
     placed in precisely the same position as 
     <lb/>
     regards Canada that the Western States 
     <lb/>
     occupy in relation to the Eastern. I believe 
     <lb/>
     we should endeavor to develope a great 
     <lb/>
     grain producing district; for whatever 
     <lb/>
     may be said, there is not any appreciable 
     <lb/>
     quantity of grain-producing land in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Government not now under 
     <lb/>
     cultivation in Canada, for the benefit 
     <lb/>
     of our increasing population. It is a 
     <lb/>
    melancholy fact that for the want of 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="470" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0470.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">470</fw>
            
     such a country, our youth seek homes in 
     <lb/>
     a foreign land, who would remain under the 
     <lb/>
     British flag if homes were open to them 
     <lb/>
     there. (Hear, hear.) If we had that 
     <lb/>
     country open to them, to say nothing of 
     <lb/>
     the foreign immigration it would attract, it 
     <lb/>
     would afford homes for a large population 
     <lb/>
     from amongst ourselves now absorbed in the 
     <lb/>
     Western States. Again, we shall have the 
     <lb/>
     trade of that country carried through our 
     <lb/>
     midst, and profit by the transportation to the 
     <lb/>
     seaboard of the produce of a land which I 
     <lb/>
     look upon as one of the greatest grain- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     producing countries on the continent, equal 
     <lb/>
     in this respect to any of the fertile states of 
     <lb/>
     the west. (Hear, hear.) If we look at the 
     <lb/>
     marvellous growth of those states, we may 
     <lb/>
     form some idea of what our North-West 
     <lb/>
     territory may become, if properly de<lb break="no"/>veloped. In 1830 the whole of that vast 
     <lb/>
     country was a wilderness. Now we find 
     <lb/>
     its exportation of grain, in addition to the 
     <lb/>
     quantities consumed, amounting to 120,000,<lb break="no"/>000 annually. The population within a 
     <lb/>
     short period has increased from 1,500,000 
     <lb/>
     to upwards of 9,000,000. We find it now, 
     <lb/>
     in fact, an empire of itself, possessing all the 
     <lb/>
     resources of wealth that any country could 
     <lb/>
     desire. What then may we not expect our 
     <lb/>
     great North-West to become? If we had it 
     <lb/>
     opened up, Canada would be the carriers of 
     <lb/>
     its produce, as the Middle States are the 
     <lb/>
     carriers of the Western States, and the manu<lb break="no"/>facturers of its goods as the Eastern States 
     <lb/>
     are now the manufacturers of the goods con<lb break="no"/>sumed by the west. We would occupy 
     <lb/>
     towards it precisely the same position as the 
     <lb/>
     Eastern States occupy towards the Western ; 
     <lb/>
     the produce of the North-West would find a 
     <lb/>
     profitable market amongst us, while our 
     <lb/>
     manufactories would increase and prosper, 
     <lb/>
     and we would be placed entirely independent 
     <lb/>
     of the United States in our commercial rela<lb break="no"/>tions. (Hear, hear.) As we are now si<lb break="no"/>tuated, the United States afford us a market, 
     <lb/>
     especially for our coarser grains, which 
     <lb/>
     will not bear the expense of long trans<lb break="no"/>portation. They have taken of our pro<lb break="no"/>duce twenty millions annually since the 
     <lb/>
     Reciprocity treaty was negotiated. That 
     <lb/>
     trade must necessarily seek other channels. 
     <lb/>
     If we can open up the North-West ; if 
     <lb/>
     we enlarge and improve our inland water 
     <lb/>
     communication—if we can build up a fleet 
     <lb/>
     of vessels to ply on our inland waters and 
     <lb/>
     owned by this great empire of provinces, 
     <lb/>then, instead of being dependent upon the<lb/>United States, we would be in a position of<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     entire independenee ; we would then have in 
     <lb/>
     ourselves the substantial elements of pro<lb break="no"/>gress ; and we would have the advantage of 
     <lb/>
     loading our vessels at any of our own ports, 
     <lb/>
     and sending them direct to the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, the West Indies, and Europe. Then 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces would have a profit<lb break="no"/>able trade with us in oil, fish and other pro<lb break="no"/>ducts, and a large fleet of vessels which 
     <lb/>
     would be employed in valuable commerce 
     <lb/>
     and increase the common prosperity of the 
     <lb/>
     whole country. (Hear, hear.) The union, if 
     <lb/>
     based on correct principles and carried out 
     <lb/>
     in honesty of purpose, will be for the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of all ; and if our statesmen approach 
     <lb/>
    and finally consummate the work as en<lb break="no"/>lightened and patriotic statesmen should do, 
     <lb/>their names will be handed down in the his<lb break="no"/>tory of the Confederation with honor. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) If, on the other hand, they fail to 
     <lb/>carry it out in this spirit ; if by the union 
     <lb/>they entail an enormously increased expen<lb break="no"/>diture, with extravagance and wild specula<lb break="no"/>tion, then they will do much to injure the 
     <lb/>country and check its prosperity. There is 
     <lb/>doubtless room for extravagance and specu<lb break="no"/>lation in connection with this scheme. The 
     <lb/>history of our railways shews beyond a 
     <lb/>doubt, that a large portion of the immense 
     <lb/>sum expended was spent in a very unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory manner—(hear, hear)— and that 
     <lb/>they might have been constructed without 
     <lb/>entailing such a large indebtedness upon the 
     <lb/>country ; and if, guided by the experience of 
     <lb/>the past, the work now proposed is carried out 
     <lb/>in a proper manner, they will deserve 
     <lb/>the gratitude of the people. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>In looking over the life of FRANKLIN, I 
     <lb/>found this passage, which occurs to me as 
     <lb/>illustrating a position very similar to that in 
     <lb/>which we are now placed :—

     to the best means of resisting the attack. The 
     <lb/>
     French power in North America was wielded by 
     <lb/>
     a single hand, and all their measures were part 
     <lb/>
     of one scheme. The power of England, on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, was dissipated among many govern<lb break="no"/>ments, always independent of one another,  often 
     <lb/>
     a little jealous, and never too cordial or neigh<lb break="no"/>borly. " We must unite or be overcome," said 
     <lb/>
     FRANKLIN in May, 1734. Just before leaving 
     <lb/>
     home to attend Congress at Albany, he published 
     <lb/>
     an article to this effect, and appended to it one of 
     <lb/>
     those allegorical wood-cuts. It was a picture of 
     <lb/>
     a snake cut into as many pieces as there were 
     <lb/>
     colonies ; each piece having upon it the first letter 
     <lb/>
     of the name of a colony, and under the whole, 
     <lb/>in large letters— " Join or die."<lb/>

     is similar at the present time. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that it is really the desire, the object and 
     <lb/>
     the aim of our neighbors ultimately, whether 
     <lb/>
     by force of arms or by the course they have 
     <lb/>
     recently adopted, to bring us into the Amer<lb break="no"/>ican union. By crippling our resources, by 
     <lb/>
     destroying our trade and by threatening us 
     <lb/>
     with invasion, they hope to bring about, soon<lb break="no"/>er or later, a feeling of dissatisfaction among 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada and a desire for union. 
     <lb/>
     There is no question that, unless we take 
     <lb/>
     proper steps, the people of Canada will be<lb break="no"/>come dissatisfied. By union with the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, it is evident that we will be en<lb break="no"/>abled to increase our trade to the amount of 
     <lb/>
     five or six millions of dollars, which is of 
     <lb/>
     itself a very strong inducement, aside from 
     <lb/>
     the other considerations that I have alluded 
     <lb/>
     to. I believe there are many members of 
     <lb/>
     this House in favor of the scheme, but 
     <lb/>
     who look upon it as so large a question that it 
     <lb/>
     ought, they say, to be submitted to a vote of 
     <lb/>
     the people. (Hear, hear.) It has been said by 
     <lb/>
     several members, and by the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man who preceded me—" Shall we take away 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the people ? Shall we enter 
     <lb/>
     upon a scheme of this importance without 
     <lb/>
     allowing them a voice ? Have there been any 
     <lb/>
     petitions in favor of this scheme?" (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) That would certainly appear an argu<lb break="no"/>ment that had great force ; but if we take 
     <lb/>
     into consideration the effect of the agitation 
     <lb/>
     of any question in this House upon which the 
     <lb/>
     people feel strongly, we have a right to ask 
     <lb/>
     why has not a single petition been presented 
     <lb/>
     against it ? We have the effect of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion well illustrated in the introduction, by 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for West Brant, of a 
     <lb/>
     railway bill. That question the people of 
     <lb/>
     Western Canada have very strong feelings 
     <lb/>
     upon, and I think they have good reasons for 
     <lb/>
     it. We scarcely find that measure placed on 
     <lb/>
     the records of this House before we have 
     <lb/>
     petitions from all sections of the west, de<lb break="no"/>nouncing the bill as an attack upon the liber<lb break="no"/>ties of the people. They fear the power that 
     <lb/>
     it proposes to place in the hands of the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Railway Company. Now, if the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada object to this great scheme—and it 
     <lb/>
     has been placed before them in almost every 
     <lb/>
     light—the resolutions have been printed in 
     <lb/>
     almost every paper in Canada—months have 
     <lb/>
     been given for their consideration, and the 
     <lb/>
     whole subject has been placed before them in 
     <lb/>
     an eloquent manner by several of the honor<lb break="no"/>able members of the Government—why have 
     <lb/>
     they not petitioned against it ? The fact that 
     <lb/>
     they have not done so shows that they almost 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     unanimously acquiesce in what is being done. 
     <lb/>
     Since the Government pledged themselves to 
     <lb/>
     bring down a scheme for Confederation, the 
     <lb/>
     subject has been brought before nearly fifty 
     <lb/>
     constituencies in Canada, either by elections 
     <lb/>
     or by its being submitted to the consideration 
     <lb/>
     of the people by honorable members of this 
     <lb/>
     House, and the people of Upper Canada, at 
     <lb/>
     least, have in no instance voted disapproval of 
     <lb/>
     it. (Cries of " No, no.")

     <lb/>
     question. There have been no fewer than 
     <lb/>
     fifty-one constituencies, or portions of consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies, appealed to since our policy was

     <persName ref="pers:MCGI1">MR. MCGIVERIN</persName>—I feel that I am at 
     <lb/>
     perfect liberty to support this measure. Per<lb break="no"/>haps I was the first to agitate and to lay the 
     <lb/>
     question before the people of the west in my 
     <lb/>
     own county. I stated to the people that I 
     <lb/>
     was in favor of representation according to 
     <lb/>
     population as a principle of justice, but that I 
     <lb/>
     believed that that question could be settled, 
     <lb/>
     and with it all our difficulties could be ar<lb break="no"/>ranged by means of the larger project of the 
     <lb/>
     union of all the provinces. Many honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who oppose this scheme freely 
     <lb/>
     admit the importance of some change, but 
     <lb/>
     they have not proposed any substitute that 
     <lb/>
     would improve the scheme. I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that if the question were brought before the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada, side issues, political and 
     <lb/>
     personal feeling and party questions would 
     <lb/>
     enter more largely into its consideration than 
     <lb/>
     Federation itself, and that therefore a correct 
     <lb/>
     verdict might not be obtained. I have en<lb break="no"/>deavored to inform myself as to the prece<lb break="no"/>dents for submitting such a question to the 
     <lb/>
     people, and I have failed to find one precedent 
     <lb/>
     in its favor, while I have found several in 
     <lb/>
     favor of the method of dealin with it as pro<lb break="no"/>posed by the Government. The first I shall

     <lb/>
     to deal with the question. Sir R. PEEL took 
     <lb/>
     high grounds against the doctrine, declaring that 
     <lb/>
     whatever may have been the circumstances that 
     <lb/>
     may have taken place at the election, he never

     He cited in proof of the soundness of this prin<lb break="no"/>ciple Mr. PITT'S observations when a similar doc<lb break="no"/>tine was proposed at the time of the union of

     England and Ireland, as it had been at the time

     of the union with Scotland. This view had been

     not held by Mr. FOX, and only slightly hinted at

     by SHERIDAN, in reply to whom Mr. PITT de<lb break="no"/>fended the constitutional system that Parliament,

     without any previous appeal to the people, had a

     right to alter the succession to the throne, to dis<lb break="no"/>franchise its constituents or associate others with

     them. "There could not," observed Sir R. FEEL,

     " be a more dangerous example, a more purely

     democratic precedent, if I may so say, than that

     Sir, I think that these are pretty strong pre<lb break="no"/>cedents on the subject, especially as I find not 
     <lb/>
     one precedent for submitting the question to 
     <lb/>
     the people. I do think that we owe and 
     <lb/>
     ought to pay to the wishes of the people every 
     <lb/>
     deference ; and if I believed that any large 
     <lb/>
     portion of the people of Western Canada, or 
     <lb/>
     of the constituency which I represent, were in 
     <lb/>
     favor of having it submitted to the electors, I 
     <lb/>
     would feel it my duty to bow to their will 
     <lb/>
     and vote for its submission. But I am safe 
     <lb/>
     in saying that I have not conversed with one 
     <lb/>
     prominent individual in my county who was 
     <lb/>
     not strongly in favor of the preposed union. 
     <lb/>
     I will admit that the political ties that bind 
     <lb/>
     men together are strong ties, and approach to 
     <lb/>
     a great extent to the feeling of friendship, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps there is no one values them more 
     <lb/>
     than I do ; but when 1 aided, at the meeting of 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party, a year ago, in bringing about 
     <lb/>
     the present movement, I did so believing that it 
     <lb/>
     was for the best interests of the country, and 
     <lb/>
     if properly carried out many of us will live 
     <lb/>
     to see this country become one of the great<lb break="no"/>est, happiest and freeest on earth, because it 
     <lb/>
     possesses all the resources and all the material

     for wealth and prosperity that is found in any

     country. Nature has bountifully given us all 
     <lb/>
     she could well give towards making us a great 
     <lb/>
     and prosperous people. (Hear, hear.) Hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen must admit that it is time 
     <lb/>
     a change should be brought about by some 
     <lb/>
     means, for it was a most melancholy sight to 
     <lb/>
     see the two sides of this House so evenly bal<lb break="no"/>anced against each other as they were during 
     <lb/>
     the two last sessions, the members spending 
     <lb/>

     legislation. Mr. SPEAKER, I fear if this

     course were continued for any length of time 
     <lb/>
     it would lead to serious results. There are

     certain bounds and limits, both to individuals,

            <p>most arrived at that point in this country. 
     <lb/>
    Who would have thought, a month before the 
     <lb/>attack on Fort Sumter, that a devastating 
     <lb/>civil war would have resulted from the angry 
     <lb/>discussions which took place in the Congress 
     <lb/>of the United States ? Up to that time 
     <lb/>everyone professed to believe that the hard 
     <lb/>words bandied to and fro between the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the North and South were mere 
     <lb/>characteristics of the people. And who knows 
     <lb/>but that the fearful scourge which has over<lb break="no"/>taken them might not have befallen us, had 
     <lb/>our sectional discussions continued with in<lb break="no"/>creasing bitterness and acrimony ? These 
     <lb/>dreadful consequences are happily averted by 
     <lb/>the scheme now before us for reconciling our 
     <lb/>differences. (Hear, hear.) I am one of those 
     <lb/>alluded to by the honorable member for Ho<lb break="no"/>chelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION) as being an Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada liberal who joined in supporting 
     <lb/>the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government, and 
     <lb/>who, in so doing, gave up the demand for 
     <lb/>representation by population, which had for 
     <lb/>years agitated the western section of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince. For my part the feeling I had at the 
     <lb/>time was this : the MACDONALD-CARTIER 
     <lb/>and the CARTIER-MACDONALD Governments, 
     <lb/>which had for years, in different forms, ruled 
     <lb/>the country, had refused to give us represent<lb break="no"/>ation by population. Our natural allies also, 
     <lb/>the Liberal party in Lower Canada—who, I 
     <lb/>believe, desired, and honestly desired, to do 
     <lb/>the best they could to meet our wishes—in 
     <lb/>like manner declared the impossibility of con<lb break="no"/>ceding to us this principle. Meanwhile the 
     <lb/>Liberal party from Upper Canada felt that the 
     <lb/>country was in a state of financial embarrass<lb break="no"/>ment, and that an amelioration of her con<lb break="no"/>dition was urgently needed. A change was 
     <lb/>absolutely necessary. It was wisely thought 
     <lb/>that it was better to have half a loaf than no 
     <lb/>bread. But I have failed to see, and I yet 
     <lb/>fail to see, that the Liberal party of Upper 
     <lb/>Canada have ever given up the advocacy of re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population. We found all par<lb break="no"/>ties in Lower Canada—both the English-speak<lb break="no"/>ing population and French-speaking population 
     <lb/>—refusing to concede to us what we conceived 
     <lb/>to be this just and proper principle ; and when 
     <lb/>the opportunity was offered to us of relieving 
     <lb/>the country from its difficulties, we felt that 
     <lb/>no party considerations or party ties should 
     <lb/>be allowed to interfere with what we con<lb break="no"/>ceived to be our sacred duty to our constitu<lb break="no"/>ents and our country. (Hear, hear.) Not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the high personal feeling I en<lb break="no"/>tertain for the liberal members from Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, I cannot help saying that I think it 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     was wrong of them to have refused us the 
     <lb/>
     concession of the principle for which we had 
     <lb/>
     so long contended, and I feel now that we 
     <lb/>
     have higher aims and motives than those of a 
     <lb/>
     mere partisan character, that we owe a duty 
     <lb/>
     to our constituents and the country which 
     <lb/>
     should carry greater weight with it than party 
     <lb/>
     ties and party feelings. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for North Ontario (Mr. M. 
     <lb/>
     C. CAMERON) has made an attack on the 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council for having hitherto 
     <lb/>
     denounced the construction of the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway ; and there is no doubt, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that if honorable members now in 
     <lb/>
     opposition were desirous of entertaining this 
     <lb/>
    House for a few hours, they could do so with 
     <lb/>a good deal of effect by reading the past 
     <lb/>speeches of that honorable gentleman and the 
     <lb/>articles that have appeared from time to time 
     <lb/>in his influential paper, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>, not only 
     <lb/>upon this question, but upon many others 
     <lb/>which have engaged the attention of the public 
     <lb/>mind. But I believe there is no man who 
     <lb/>felt more strongly than he did on account of 
     <lb/>the difficulties with which the country was 
     <lb/>surrounded, and all honorable gentlemen will 
     <lb/>agree with me when I say that I am persuaded 
     <lb/>that the Hon. President of the Council did 
     <lb/>not feign the feeling he manifested in this 
     <lb/>House when he arose and avowed his in<lb break="no"/>tention, for the good of his country, of join<lb break="no"/>ing with the men whom he had previously de<lb break="no"/>nounced. (Hear, hear.) But did he so act 
     <lb/>without a purpose, without receiving any<lb break="no"/>thing in return ? No. The principle advo<lb break="no"/>cated by him and his party for years was con<lb break="no"/>ceded; and in addition to that, in my opinion,  
     <lb/>whatever may be the opinion of others—and 
     <lb/>it is an opinion I have held for years—by 
     <lb/>adopting the larger scheme we attain the same 
     <lb/>result. I ask, then, should the Hon. 
     <lb/>President of the Council be denounced now 
     <lb/>for the position he has felt it his duty to take ; 
     <lb/>and, especially, should he be denounced by 
     <lb/>the Liberal party—by those with whom he has 
     <lb/>worked all his political life—both in Upper 
     <lb/>Canada and in Lowcr Canada, for taking the 
     <lb/>course he has taken in common with others, 
     <lb/>when by so doing he has attained that for 
     <lb/>which he has been struggling for years ? 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I believe that no man 
     <lb/>can leave his political party,—can leave 
     <lb/>that party with which all his political 
     <lb/>sympathies are identified and with which 
     <lb/>he has been working for years,—and step 
     <lb/>across to the other side of the House 
     <lb/>without deep feeling. And I do believe that 
     <lb/>the President of the Council experienced 
     <lb/>
    
            <pb n="474" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0474.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">474</fw>
        
     acutely the position he felt it his duty to 
     <lb/>
     take at that time. And I can safely say for 
     <lb/>
     myself that such is my own  feeling in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the question now before the House. If 
     <lb/>
     this were a question which could have been 
     <lb/>
     carried by the Liberal party of Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada without their coalescing with 
     <lb/>
     the conservatives, I should feel more happy 
     <lb/>
     in my position than I do now. But to re<lb break="no"/>vive the old feeling and associations, to return 
     <lb/>
     to the criminations and recriminations, to re<lb break="no"/>vert once more to the bitter attacks we have 
     <lb/>
     heard in this chamber, could not be justified 
     <lb/>
     for a moment. And the Liberal party wisely 
     <lb/>
     came to the understanding that, pending the 
     <lb/>
     settlement of this question, they would let 
     <lb/>
     by-gones be by-gones. I earnestly hope that 
     <lb/>
     this scheme will be carried out without poli<lb break="no"/>tical acrimony or personal feeling. What<lb break="no"/>ever may be its result hereafter, time alone 
     <lb/>
     will determine. But as a Canadian, I feel 
     <lb/>
     —and the views I have entertained for many 
     <lb/>
     years only strengthen that feeling—that 
     <lb/>
     whatever my personal feelings may be, it is 
     <lb/>
     my duty to aid to the extent of my ability in 
     <lb/>
     the consummation of this great project. 
     <lb/>
      (Cheers.) It has been said that information 
     <lb/>
     will be brought down relative to the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the local legislatures. Well, per<lb break="no"/>haps, that may accord with the views of this 
     <lb/>
     House. But it would have been more satis<lb break="no"/>factory to me could the scheme have been 
     <lb/>
     brought down while we are discussing the re<lb break="no"/>solutions now before the House. If, how<lb break="no"/>ever, the Government have not matured that 
     <lb/>
     scheme, or if they feel it is to the public in<lb break="no"/>terest that it should not be submitted at this 
     <lb/>time, on them must rest the responsibility. 
     <lb/>In voting for these resolutions, I am simply 
     <lb/>voting to affirm the principle of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of the provinces ; and if the propositions 
     <lb/>which shall hereafter be brought down for 
     <lb/>the formation of the local  governments and 
     <lb/>Legislatures are not satisfactory to me ; if I 
     <lb/>conceive them to be unjust in principle or op<lb break="no"/>posed to public interest and policy, I shall 
     <lb/>feel myself at perfect liberty to vote against 
     <lb/>them. (Hear, hear.) I look upon the two 
     <lb/>as distinct propositions.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
         HON. MR. BROWN—Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
        <persName ref="pers:MCGI1">MR. MCGIVERIN</persName> — There are many 
     <lb/>
     things in these resolutions I would like to see 
     <lb/>
     eliminated ; but where there were so many 
     <lb/>
     parties to the contract or partnership, and 
     <lb/>
     where there were so many contending views 
     <lb/>
     to harmonise and interests to serve, I believe 
     <lb/>
     it was utterly impossible for each province to 
     <lb/>
     get just what it wanted. We have the best 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     evidence of this fact from the peculiar views 
     <lb/>
     taken by the non-contents in the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces at this time. They say they are 
     <lb/>
     going into this union with Canada, which is a 
     <lb/>
     bankrupt province, and that they will be 
     <lb/>
     ruined by the connection. And we heard 
     <lb/>
     only a day or two ago the strange idea ex<lb break="no"/>pressed that the Intercolonial Railway was 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the true  interests of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, but from an Upper Canadian stand point 
     <lb/>
     it was just the thing that is wanted. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) We find a section of the people in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada opposing the work on the 
     <lb/>
     ground that it will tend to destroy their lan<lb break="no"/>guage and nationality ; and we find also the 
     <lb/>
     British element in Lower Canada complain 
     <lb/>
     that in the arrangement for the Local Le<lb break="no"/>gislature their rights and privileges will be 
     <lb/>
     swept away. (Hear, hear.) On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, Upper Canadians are opposing the 
     <lb/>
     scheme as injurious to their true interests, 
     <lb/>
     and asserting that the financial difficulties  
     <lb/>
     likely to arise under it will be detrimental to 
     <lb/>
     the welfare of the west ; so that where there  
     <lb/>
     is such great diversity of opinion, it was im<lb break="no"/>possible to mature a scheme which should be 
     <lb/>
     in all  respects perfect and satisfactory. No 
     <lb/>
     doubt Upper  Canada has some cause to com<lb break="no"/>plain.  For instance, the eighty cents per 
     <lb/>
     head for carrying on the local governments 
     <lb/>
     appears unfair in principle to Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and as such they have reason to feel dissatis<lb break="no"/>fied. This apportionment is on the present 
     <lb/>
     basis of population, and whatever may be the 
     <lb/>
     increase in numbers of the western section of 
     <lb/>
     the province, if even we increase during the 
     <lb/>
     next ten years in the same ratio that we have 
     <lb/>
     been increasing for the past ten years ; if we 
     <lb/>
     double our population we shall still only get 
     <lb/>
     the eighty cents per head for the present pop<lb break="no"/>ulation. There is no doubt this is an object<lb break="no"/>ionable feature. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. BROWN—Will my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend allow me to assure him that he is 
     <lb/>
     slightly in error, and to show him how he is 
     <lb/>
      so ? Supposing we increase in population,  the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces will increase also, and the 
     <lb/>
     only unfairness that could possibly exist in 
     <lb/>
     the case supposed would be in so far as the 
     <lb/>
     population of Upper Canada was relatively  
     <lb/>
     greater than that of the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. BOLTON—Yes, it is simply a  matter of 
     <lb/>
     ratio.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         HON. MR. BROWN—Yes, it is simply a 
     <lb/>
     question of ratio. My  honorable friend will 
     <lb/>
     see how the principle works. At the rate we  
     <lb/>
     are proceeding now, some  2½, 3, or 4 per<lb break="no"/>cent, it would take a great many years before   
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="475" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0475.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">475</fw>
          
     any injustice to Upper Canada could arise. 
     <lb/>
     And then my honorable friend will see how it 
     <lb/>
     is to be distributed afterwards in the way of 
     <lb/>
     population,so that though there might be a 
     <lb/>
     little less in the first instance, there would be 
     <lb/>
     an immense gain in the end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGI1">MR. MCGIVERIN</persName>—I am glad to hear 
     <lb/>
     all these explanations. As I said before, I 
     <lb/>
     wish for the fullest and <choice><sic>freeest</sic><corr>freest</corr></choice> discussion. 
     <lb/>
     I may not have made myself acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     all the details of the scheme, and a question 
     <lb/>
     of this importance to be discussed in 
     <lb/>
     all its bearings. This is a point, however, 
     <lb/>
     which did occur to me. as objectionable. Then 
     <lb/>
     the imposition of an export duty in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the productions of some of the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     appears to me to be contrary to the true 
     <lb/>
     principles of government. But it is said 
     <lb/>
     that this has been imposed simply in the 
     <lb/>
     way of a stumpage. (Hear, hear.) There 
     <lb/>
     are, no doubt, various objections which may 
     <lb/>
     be brought against these resolutions. There 
     <lb/>
     are grounds enough for honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men in the opposition to make excellent 
     <lb/>
     speeches against them. But what I would 
     <lb/>
     wish to impress upon the House is this, that 
     <lb/>
     we should approach this subject in a spirit of 
     <lb/>
     candor, honestly desiring to meet the question 
     <lb/>
     fairly in all its bearings. The question is 
     <lb/>
     simply this, Shall we vote for these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, notwithstanding their imperfections? 
     <lb/>
     I freely admit that, in my view, there are 
     <lb/>
     imperfections in the scheme. But shall we, 
     <lb/>
     on that account, take the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     throwing out the resolutions ? That, I think, 
     <lb/>
     is the question we have to consider. Honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen may differ from me, but I feel 
     <lb/>
     that the advantages of the contemplated union 
     <lb/>
     are such, that notwithstanding the objection<lb break="no"/>able features in the scheme, I would not be 
     <lb/>
     doing my duty to my constituents, I would 
     <lb/>
     not be discharging the duty I owe to my 
     <lb/>
     country, were I to vote against it, and thus 
     <lb/>
     lend my influence to ent the consummation 
     <lb/>
     of that union. ( Hear, hear.) I thank the 
     <lb/>
     House for the indulgence accorded to me, and 
     <lb/>
     I only add this, in conclusion, that I would 
     <lb/>
     ask every honorable gentleman, in consider<lb break="no"/>ing this scheme, to look at it in all its possible 
     <lb/>
     bearings, free from personal or party preju<lb break="no"/>dices; to look at the position we occupy and 
     <lb/>
     have occupied for years past in this country ; 
     <lb/>
     to look at the wretched spectacle we presented 
     <lb/>
     here, night after night, when placed in antag<lb break="no"/>onism to each other by our sectional feelings 
     <lb/>
     and jealousies ; and to say whether it is pos<lb break="no"/>sible that we can be placed in a worse or more 
     <lb/>
     humiliating position than that which we have 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
            
     occupied hitherto on account of those sectional 
     <lb/>
     antagonism. Let honorable gentlemen con<lb break="no"/>sider the matter in a proper spirit, desiring to 
     <lb/>
     take that course which is for the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country. If the principle of this union 
     <lb/>
     is wrong, the scheme should be rejected; if, 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, it is right, it deserves our 
     <lb/>
     support. And as yet I have not heard one 
     <lb/>
     honorable member of this House declare him<lb break="no"/>self opposed to the principle of union. The 
     <lb/>
     objections have been onl to details. And I 
     <lb/>
     do say that when honorable gentlemen oppose 
     <lb/>
     a scheme of this sort, while admitting that 
     <lb/>
     they are favorable to a union of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, they ought to propose their own 
     <lb/>
     scheme, and submit it to the House for its 
     <lb/>
     approval or rejection. (Cheers)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName> then moved that the de<lb break="no"/>bate be adjourned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>, in seconding the 
     <lb/>
     motion for the adjournment of the debate, 
     <lb/>
     said—I am sure the House has listened with 
     <lb/>
     very great pleasure to the speech of my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend the member for Lincoln (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McGIVERIN). I certainly did. It is true 
     <lb/>
     that, towards its conclusion, be halted some<lb break="no"/>what in his logic. Still, on the whole, it was 
     <lb/>
     an able and spirited speech. ( Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But there is one point to which I desire to 
     <lb/>
     call the attention of honorable gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite, as arising out of the speech of my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend, and, as hearing on the future 
     <lb/>
     course of this debate, it is a matter of ve 
     <lb/>
     great importance. He said that he should 
     <lb/>
     oppose this scheme—that he should vote 
     <lb/>
     against this proposition—unless he had the 
     <lb/>
     distinct assurance of the Government that the 
     <lb/>
     enlargement of our canals and the opening of 
     <lb/>
     the North-West territory should proceed 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">pari pauu</hi> with the construction of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railroad. I ask him whether I have 
     <lb/>
     stated his position correctly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGI1">MR. MCGIVERIN</persName>—I will explain—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I want no explana<lb break="no"/>tions. I want him merely to say whether I

     have rendered him correctly or not. If I

     have incorrectly represented him, he will say 
     <lb/>
     so. I am quite sure I have not. While he 
     <lb/>
     was making that statement I emphasized it in 
     <lb/>
     the usual parliamentary way, and the Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN) em<lb break="no"/>phasized it also, giving his assent to it, as I 
     <lb/>
     understood. Now, I think it is of the last 
     <lb/>
     importance that we should understand dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly whether the Government do really take 
     <lb/>
     that view of the matter; whether my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend correctly stated the position of the

     the opening up of the North-West, as well as

     <persName ref="pers:BELL1">Mr. BELLEROSE</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, be<lb break="no"/>fore I give my vote on the great question 
     <lb/>
     which now engages the attention of this hon<lb break="no"/>orable House, I consider it a duty to my 
     <lb/>
     constituents and also to myself that I should 
     <lb/>
     say a few words on this important measure, 
     <lb/>
     and reply to some of the arguments put forth 
     <lb/>
     by the honorable members of the opposition— 
     <lb/>
     arguments specious in appearance, but in 
     <lb/>
     reality futile and unworthy of consideration. 
     <lb/>
     Were I to particularize all the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     which have threatened for some years past to 
     <lb/>
     bring. the wheels of government to a dead<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
       lock, to relate the history of all the crises 
     <lb/>
    through which the various administrations 
     <lb/>which have succeeded each other have passed, 
     <lb/>to recall to your minds the state of anarchy 
     <lb/>which has for some time threatened to render 
     <lb/>all legislation impossible, it would be a waste 
     <lb/>of time and trouble, as on all sides there is 
     <lb/>but one opinion, acknowledging the lamentable 
     <lb/>position of the province, and the urgent neces<lb break="no"/>sity of finding a remedy for the evils which 
     <lb/>beset the future of our country. It was, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, in obedience to the voice of a whole 
     <lb/>people calling on the patriotism of their states<lb break="no"/>men, conjuring them to seek out some remedy 
     <lb/>for the cruel distemper which pervades the 
     <lb/>body politic and threatens it with dissolution, 
     <lb/>that-the members of the administration, for<lb break="no"/>getting the past, burying in oblivion all for<lb break="no"/>mer disagreements, united together to search 
     <lb/>for the grand remedy, the value of which we 
     <lb/>are now to discuss. Those honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men have deserved well of their country, and 
     <lb/>I am glad that I can avail myself of the 
     <lb/>present occasion to offer them my thanks and 
     <lb/>my congratulations for the admirable and 
     <lb/>noble sentiments of patriotism of which they 
     <lb/>have given proofs—proofs well understood by 
     <lb/>the people, and certain to be repaid by their 
     <lb/>applause. I have already taken occasion, at 
     <lb/>the commencement of the session, to express 
     <lb/>my views of the general scheme of Confede<lb break="no"/>ation which the Government has presented 
     <lb/>for the consideration of this House. I de<lb break="no"/>clared, Mr. SPEAKER, that I felt not the least 
     <lb/>hesitation in declaring myself favorable to the 
     <lb/>union, but that I could have wished, were it 
     <lb/>practicable, that certain of the resolutions 
     <lb/>might be amended. It would be useless, 
     <lb/>therefore, to repeat what I said on this head, 
     <lb/>and I proceed to examine the arguments of 
     <lb/>the opponents of the plan. It has been said 
     <lb/>—the honorable member for Hochelaga has 
     <lb/>said, I believe—that the people had had no 
     <lb/>opportunity of expressing their opinions on 
     <lb/>this important measure. If we look back at 
     <lb/>the occurrences of the last six months, when 
     <lb/>we look at all that has been said and done in 
     <lb/>that time, and recollect all the falsehoods and 
     <lb/>deceptions uttered and attempted to be im 
     <lb/>posed on the people by the enemies of the 
     <lb/>measure, we must arrive at a very different 
     <lb/>conclusion from that of the honorable member 
     <lb/>for Hochelaga and his friends. The last 
     <lb/>session was hardly well concluded when the 
     <lb/>opponents of the present Government took the 
     <lb/>field, not to discuss in a frank and loyal spirit 
     <lb/>the promise made by the Administration that 
     <lb/>they intended to seek in the Federation of the 
     <lb/>

     Canadas, or all the provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     North America, a remedy for all our sectional 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, but, on the contrary, with a stead<lb break="no"/>fast resoltuion to labor with all their might to 
     <lb/>
     crush the Coalition. Such was their design, 
     <lb/>
     and their works have been consistent. What 
     <lb/>
     indeed have we since beheld? Men who for 
     <lb/>
     years past have devoted their pen to the unhal<lb break="no"/>lowed work of undermining the Catholic reli<lb break="no"/>gion and vilifying its ministers, who have 
     <lb/>
     long aimed at destroying in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians all love for their peculiar 
     <lb/>
     institutions—the safeguards of our nation<lb break="no"/>ality ; men who more recently promulgated 
     <lb/>
     dissertations on rationalism which our pre<lb break="no"/>lates have condemned ; these men we have 
     <lb/>
     seen, prefencing to be suddenly struck and 
     <lb/>
     animated with flowing zeal in favor of our 
     <lb/>
     institutions, our religion and our clergy, take 
     <lb/>
     the field, and, uninvited by any, canvas 
     <lb/>
     the country, descending to entreat all who 
     <lb/>
     loved their nationality to join them in their 
     <lb/>
     crusade, and representing to them that those 
     <lb/>
     who gave in to the plans of the Government 
     <lb/>
     would be accessories to the annihilation of 
     <lb/>
     their religion, the murder of their good pas<lb break="no"/>tors, and the ruin of the people themselves by 
     <lb/>
     the load of taxes which would be laid on them. 
     <lb/>
     They conjured them to lose no time in pro<lb break="no"/>testing against this dreadful scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, which was sure to ruin and destroy 
     <lb/>
     them. Have we not seen, moreover, a press, 
     <lb/>
     conducted by a spirit of unbridled license, 
     <lb/>
     calling itself the protector of the people, scat<lb break="no"/>tering insults and abuse on the heads of the 
     <lb/>
     members of the existing Government, calum<lb break="no"/>nisting some and holding up all as objects of 
     <lb/>
     contempt, representing the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members of it as ready to sell their country 
     <lb/>
     for filthy lucre, for the fruits of office, pub<lb break="no"/>lishing violent diatribes condemnatory of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, falsely purporting to be written by 
     <lb/>
     members of the clergy, &amp;c., employing, in short, 
     <lb/>
     all means to excite the prejudices of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple against the scheme of the Government ; 
     <lb/>
     and what has been the result ? The people 
     <lb/>
     1istened to them, but were so far from answer<lb break="no"/>ing to the appeal made to them, that up to 
     <lb/>
     this time hardly any petitions have been pre<lb break="no"/>sented to this House against the plan of Con<lb break="no"/>federation. Now, if the Opposition have not 
     <lb/>
     been able to convince the people that these 
     <lb/>
     constitutional changes are prejudicial to Low<lb break="no"/>er Canada, when they discussed the subject 
     <lb/>
     without contradiction in their own way, will 
     <lb/>
     they find better success when the friends of 
     <lb/>
     the cause are at hand to refute their argu<lb break="no"/>ments and to show up what kind of patriot<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
    ism is theirs ? I think not. I may then safely 
     <lb/>
     assume that the people have had the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of pronouncing against the project, but 
     <lb/>
     have refused to do so; and the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga is mistaken when he 
     <lb/>
     declares that an appeal to the country is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary in order to ascertain the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the public concerning it. Year by year that 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman complains that our elec<lb break="no"/>tion laws are defective ; that money prevails 
     <lb/>
     to the prejudice of merit in our election con<lb break="no"/>tests. How can he then demand that so mo<lb break="no"/>mentous a question as this of the union of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces should undergo the ordeal of a pop<lb break="no"/>ular vote, without any other view than that of 
     <lb/>
     involving the country in trouble and expense 
     <lb/>
     to the extent of several hundred thousand dol<lb break="no"/>lars ? I, for my part, Mr. Speaker, am op<lb break="no"/>posed to an appeal to the people. Every 
     <lb/>
     member has had time to consult the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of his constituents at leisure, and aloof from 
     <lb/>
     the turmoil and agitation incidental to an 
     <lb/>
     election. In this way, when the project sub<lb break="no"/>mitted by the Government shall have under<lb break="no"/>gone the ordeal of a vote of this Honorable 
     <lb/>
     House, we shall have the satisfaction of say<lb break="no"/>ing with truth —" So would public opinion 
     <lb/>
     have it to be." It is true the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Hochelaga tells us that in all the 
     <lb/>
     counties in which meetings have been held, 
     <lb/>
     the people have given their voices against 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. To this assertion I have no 
     <lb/>
     need to make any answer. All the honorable 
     <lb/>
     members of this House are well aware of the 
     <lb/>
     means used by the opponents of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     to procure the passing of resolutions to their 
     <lb/>
     liking at meetings generally representing 
     <lb/>
     small, nay very small, minorities of the elect<lb break="no"/>ors ; and to cite only one example, I shall take 
     <lb/>
     the case of the county of Hochelaga, in 
     <lb/>
     which the votes are about 2,400 in number. 
     <lb/>
     The friends of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     that county, without any previous notice, 
     <lb/>
     proceeded on a certain Sunday in the month 
     <lb/>
     of January last to one of the parishes of that 
     <lb/>
     county, being that of Sault-au-Récollet, 
     <lb/>
     which contains about three hundred voters. 
     <lb/>
     There they thundered out their anathemas 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation, as being subversive of 
     <lb/>
     religion, intended to crush the clergy, and 
     <lb/>
     ruin the people, finishing with an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the patriotism of their audience and entrea<lb break="no"/>ties that the would raise their voices against 
     <lb/>
     so objectionable a measure. Next day we read 
     <lb/>
     in the opposition papers : " In the county of 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga, Confederation was unanimously 
     <lb/>
     condemned by both parties on Sunday last, 
     <lb/>
     at Sault-au-Recollet. " The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="num">478</fw>
      tleman (Hon. Mr. DORION) has told us that 
     <lb/>
     the meeting of the county of Laval, which 
     <lb/>
     was held before the session, had been scarcely 
     <lb/>
     advertised, and that I had not ventured to 
     <lb/>
    put the question of Confederation on its trial. 
     <lb/>I beg to remark, sir, that the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber is not candid in making this assertion, 
     <lb/>and is ignorant of what did really occur. 
     <lb/>The meeting of the county of Laval was an<lb break="no"/>nounced at the doors of the several churches 
     <lb/>in the county ; afterwards an influential per<lb break="no"/>son in each parish, after mass on the feast of 
     <lb/>the Epiphany, urged the electors, one and all, 
     <lb/>to attend the important meeting at which the 
     <lb/>question of Confederation was to be taken 
     <lb/>into consideration. The opponents of the 
     <lb/>measure were invited to meet me, as I can 
     <lb/>sufficiently prove in due time and place, but 
     <lb/>their hearts failed them—none came. At that 
     <lb/>meeting, composed of a majority of my con<lb break="no"/>stituents, I stated at great length all that the 
     <lb/>opponents of the project had to say against 
     <lb/>it, and the reasons which its friends and ad<lb break="no"/>vocates had to advance in its favor. I then 
     <lb/>asked to be informed of the views of the 
     <lb/>electors. They desired me to give my own 
     <lb/>on the subject. I declared that unless the 
     <lb/>sense of the county was opposed to the mea<lb break="no"/>sure, I was inclined to give it my support. 
     <lb/>This declaration was followed by an unani<lb break="no"/>mous vote, approving of my conduct in Par<lb break="no"/>liament, and declaring that having full confi<lb break="no"/>dence in me, they left me at full liberty to 
     <lb/>vote according to my conscience on this great 
     <lb/>measure. Let the hon. member deny this if he 
     <lb/>can. The hon. member (Hon. Mr. DORION) 
     <lb/>has stated " that it was not right to change the 
     <lb/>Constitution without an appeal to the decision 
     <lb/>of the people." As a complete answer to that 
     <lb/>assertion, I shall quote the words spoken by 
     <lb/>the honorable gentleman on the 2nd February, 
     <lb/>1859—" If he (HON. MR. DORION) had re<lb break="no"/>mained in power, he would have proposed a 
     <lb/>measure for the settlement of the representa<lb break="no"/>tion question, and would have submitted it to 
     <lb/>the decision of the House," &amp;c., &amp;c. Has not 
     <lb/>the honorable member changed his opinions ? 
     <lb/>When a member of the Government in 1858, 
     <lb/>he did not admit that the people had the right 
     <lb/>to be consulted on the constitutional changes 
     <lb/>he wished to propose ; but as a Leader of the 
     <lb/>Opposition, in 1865, he refuses to the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature the right of effecting such changes 
     <lb/>without an appeal to the people : <hi rendition="simple:italic">Tempora 
     <lb/>mutantur et nos mutamur in illis</hi>. What a 
     <lb/>contradiction ! Such is the effect of 
     <lb/>spirit. The honorable member for Hochelaga 
     <lb/>says, "that he had been accused of having 
     <lb/>
              
            <cb/>
           
     been in favor of a Confederation of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of British North America, but be 
     <lb/>
     peremptorily denied the truth of that state<lb break="no"/>ment ; on the contrary, he had always opposed 
     <lb/>
     that union as a measure calculated to bring us 
     <lb/>
     into trouble and to create embarrassment." 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, either the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man's logic or else his sincerity is at fault. 
     <lb/>
     Let us examine. On reading over the 
     <lb/>
     speeches cited b himself in support of his 
     <lb/>
     denial, what do I find ? " A time will per<lb break="no"/>haps come when the Confederation of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces will be necessary, but I am not in 
     <lb/>
     favor of it at this moment." Further on I 
     <lb/>
     find: " I trust the time will come when it 
     <lb/>
     will be desirable for the Canadas to unite 
     <lb/>
     federatively with the Lower Provinœs, but 
     <lb/>
     the time has not yet arrived for such a mea<lb break="no"/>sure."—(Speech of 3rd May, 1860.) Now 
     <lb/>
     what is the conclusion, the only logical con 
     <lb/>
     clusion to be deduced from the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member's words ? None other than the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing : that in all these instances he declared 
     <lb/>
     himself in favor of a Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, sooner or later. The honor<lb break="no"/>able member therefore deceived his electors 
     <lb/>
     when he said to them in his manifesto of the 
     <lb/>
     7th November last : " Every time I have had 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity I have invariably expressed 
     <lb/>
     myself opposed to any union, whether Legis<lb break="no"/>lative or Federal, with the Maritime Provin<lb break="no"/>ces." He wished, therefore, to mislead this 
     <lb/>
     House, when in his speech at the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of this debate he attempted to show 
     <lb/>
     that he had been wrongfully accused on that 
     <lb/>
     point, and that the expressions he had used 
     <lb/>
     had been tortured into every shape in order 
     <lb/>
     to establish the attacks made upon him. In 
     <lb/>
     the political letter of the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     to his constituents, to which I alluded a mo<lb break="no"/>ment ago, I find the following words : " The 
     <lb/>
     proposed union appears to me to be prema<lb break="no"/>ture." If the words have any meaning at 
     <lb/>
     all, do they not prove that the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member admitted the necessity of such a 
     <lb/>
     union sooner or later ? The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber was therefore not sincere when he wrote 
     <lb/>
     to his electors that he was always opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation of the provinces of Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America. (Hear.) The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman stated " that he could not under<lb break="no"/>stand how Confederation could increase our 
     <lb/>
     means of defence, * * * * * that if the 
     <lb/>
     union brought an advantage in that respect, 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces and not Canada would 
     <lb/>
     reap the benefit." If the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     had taken the trouble to study the question, 
     <lb/>
     I think he would have arrived at a different 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">479</fw>
           
     conclusion. Suppose that peace were estab<lb break="no"/>lished amongst our neighbors, and that the 
     <lb/>government of the United States decided to 
     <lb/>effect the conquest of the British colonies, 
     <lb/>does the honorable member think it would be 
     <lb/>difficult for the armies of the great republic 
     <lb/>to enter the Province of New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>conquer it, and to continue their triumphal 
     <lb/>march through Nova Scotia, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>Island and Newfoundland ? And what would 
     <lb/>the honorable member think of our position 
     <lb/>if, in order to find means of communicating 
     <lb/>with the rest of the world, we were compelled 
     <lb/>to solicit the permission of our powerful 
     <lb/>neighbors ? I ask him whether, if these con<lb break="no"/>quests were made, Canada would not find 
     <lb/>herself in a more critical position than she is 
     <lb/>to-day ? Our position would no longer be 
     <lb/>tenable, and despite our repugnance for a 
     <lb/>union with the neighboring States, we should 
     <lb/>find ourselves so placed that there would re<lb break="no"/>main to us no alternative but union with the 
     <lb/>United States. To defend the Maritime 
     <lb/>Provinces, therefore, is to defend Canada ; 
     <lb/>to protect them against invasion is, therefore, 
     <lb/>to protect Canada, to increase our own power 
     <lb/>and strength, and to augment our means of 
     <lb/>defence ; viewing things in this light, what 
     <lb/>matters it that in proportion to our population 
     <lb/>the greater share of the expenditure to be 
     <lb/>undergone by the Federal Government for 
     <lb/>general defence must be met by Canada, 
     <lb/>since all that expenditure will benefit us, 
     <lb/>and since it is essentially necessary for our 
     <lb/>defence. (Applause.) The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber will, perhaps, reply that all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces might come to an understanding 
     <lb/>and bind themselves towards one another 
     <lb/>for these critical times, and that there would 
     <lb/>then be no necessity for the proposed 
     <lb/>union. Mr. SPEAKER, the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber knows, and every one acquainted, I do 
     <lb/>not say with the art of defence, but with the 
     <lb/>mere elements of that art which common 
     <lb/>sense itself suggests, knows that the first prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, the fundamental principle of that art is 
     <lb/>unity of authority, unity of action ; and if any 
     <lb/>honorable member doubt the necessity of this, 
     <lb/>let him peruse the history of the neighboring 
     <lb/>republic and he will there see the sad evils re<lb break="no"/>sulting from want of unity. " The proposed 
     <lb/>changes are not at all necessary," says the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Hochelaga. I admit that it was 
     <lb/>with no little surprise I heard the honorable 
     <lb/>member express himself thus, remembering as 
     <lb/>I did that in every instance he had expressed 
     <lb/>the contrary opinion, as I shall now prove. 
     <lb/>ln 1858, on the 7th July, he said :—

     <lb/>for the protection of the French Canadians. The 
     <lb/>repeal of the union, Federal union, representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population, or some other great change 
     <lb/>must absolutely be carried out, and for my part I 
     <lb/>am prepared to examine the question of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by pepulation, &amp;c. I am ready, in like 
     <lb/>manner, to take into consideration the project of 
     <lb/>a Confederation of the provinces, which would 
     <lb/>leave to each section the administration of its 
     <lb/>local affairs, &amp;c.,and to the General Government 
     <lb/>the administration of the public lands.

            <p>
     On the 10th August, 1858, addressing the 
     <lb/>
     citizens of Montreal, he said : "We (the 
     <lb/>
     BROWN-DORION Government) found that 
     <lb/>
     these difficulties might be smoothed away 
     <lb/>
     either by adopting a Federal union or some 
     <lb/>
     other modification of our Constitution based 
     <lb/>
     upon representation by population." In his 
     <lb/>
     election address of the 13th August of the 
     <lb/>
     same year, he adds : " There was no room for 
     <lb/>
     hesitation and the discussion soon suggested 
     <lb/>
     that by means of constitutional changes, ac<lb break="no"/>companied by proper checks and guarantees, 
     <lb/>
     &amp;c., or by the application of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     principle, it was possible to prepare a measure 
     <lb/>
     which would meet the approval of the major<lb break="no"/>ity of Upper and of Lower Canada, while 
     <lb/>
    adopting population as the basis of representa<lb break="no"/>tion." On the 2nd February, 1859, in his 
     <lb/>speech on the address, &amp;c., the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman said : " That if he had remained in 
     <lb/>power he would have proposed a measure for 
     <lb/>the settlement of the representation question, 
     <lb/>&amp;c., admitting the principle of representation 
     <lb/>by numbers." On the 3rd May, 1860, 
     <lb/>the honorable member declared in the House : 
     <lb/>"A year ago the whole Cabinet admitted that 
     <lb/>constitutional changes were absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary, &amp;c. But if Upper Canada desires re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population, I am ready to 
     <lb/>grant it, for I am convinced that an ever- 
     <lb break="yes"/>increasing number of representatives of the 
     <lb/>people will come here to claim it, after each 
     <lb/>election, as a measure of justice. I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced that there will be a collision between 
     <lb/>Upper and Lower Canada." These extracts 
     <lb/>prove undeniably the truth of the statement 
     <lb/>I advanced a moment ago. How then is the 
     <lb/>conduct of the honorable gentleman to be ex<lb break="no"/>plained ? How can any one put faith in the 
     <lb/>sincerity of the opposition he now offers to the 
     <lb/>project under consideration ? Clearly, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, party spirit is the motive of his 
     <lb/>opposition to the measure. When a minis<lb break="no"/>ter, the Hon. Mr. DORION admitted the diffi<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="480" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0480.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">480</fw>
        
     culty of the position ; he acknowledged that a 
     <lb/>
     speedy remedy was required in order to pre<lb break="no"/>vent a collision between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; he was prepared to seek out means 
     <lb/>
     of remedying these evils ; but now that he is 
     <lb/>
     in opposition he no longer sees the difficulties ; 
     <lb/>
     the position is a good one, the proposed 
     <lb/>
     changes are no longer necessary ; and, in or<lb break="no"/>der to oppose them, to what length is he not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to go ? The honorable member uses 
     <lb/>
     his influences over a respectable old man, who 
     <lb/>
     heretofore had remained apart from political 
     <lb/>
     struggles ; he persuades him that his country 
     <lb/>
     is on the brink of an abyss ; he tells him how 
     <lb/>
     necessary and what an imperative duty it is 
     <lb/>
     for all good citizens to unite for the defence of 
     <lb/>
     our institutions, our language, our usages, in 
     <lb/>
     fact our very national existence. And the 
     <lb/>
     good old gentleman tears himself from his 
     <lb/>
     beloved retirement and becomes the will<lb break="no"/>ing instrument of a factious opposition. 
     <lb/>
     I might have believed in the sincerity of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman (Hon. Mr. DORION) if I 
     <lb/>
     had heard him admit that he had changed his 
     <lb/>
     opinions and say that he had formerly enter<lb break="no"/>tained certain views ou the difficulty of our 
     <lb/>
     position and the necessity of providing a reme<lb break="no"/>dy. But no, he comes to us with the assurance 
     <lb/>
     to declare that he has never changed his 
     <lb/>
     opinions, and yet the journals and debates of 
     <lb/>
     the House are before him to convince him of 
     <lb/>
     the contrary. What a position. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman added—" The peo<lb break="no"/>ple are satisfied with their present position." 
     <lb/>
     Since last session more than twenty counties 
     <lb/>
     have been called upon to elect new represent<lb break="no"/>atives, and they have all, one perhaps except<lb break="no"/>ed, elected supporters of the Government and 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme which is now under discussion. 
     <lb/>
     And yet the honorable member tells us, with 
     <lb/>
     an appearance of good faith which I shall not 
     <lb/>
     animadvert on now, that the people are satis<lb break="no"/>fied with their position ; and lastly, the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Hochelaga says—" Confed<lb break="no"/>eration is direct taxation." The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is the very last who ought to have 
     <lb/>
     raised this objection. Does he forget that, in 
     <lb/>
     1863, one of the members of his Government, 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable Minister of Finance, when he 
     <lb/>
     brought down his budget, declared to this 
     <lb/>
     House that the time had arrived when it had 
     <lb/>
     become necessary to accustom the people to 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation. What possible effect,then, can 
     <lb/>
     this objection have in the mouth of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman, other than to afford a still 
     <lb/>
     further proof of the absence of good faith 
     <lb/>
     which he has displayed in the discussion of 
     <lb/>
    this important measure of the Federal union? 
     <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
           
     Besides, the present Honorable Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance, in his learned speech on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, has given a most lucid explanation of the 
     <lb/>
     question of the finances, and has made it clear 
     <lb/>
     to us that the local governments will receive 
     <lb/>
     more than they will require to meet their ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. Lower Canada, whose expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, including the interest on her share of 
     <lb/>
     the debt remaining charged to Canada, will 
     <lb/>
     amount to $1,237,000, will receive from the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government eighty cents a-head, 
     <lb/>
     making $900,000, which, added to its other 
     <lb/>
     revenues, will make its annual receipts  amount 
     <lb/>
     to $1,440,000, shewing an annual excess of 
     <lb/>
     revenue over expenditure amounting to $200,<lb break="no"/>000. The objection of the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     is only a pretext, which ought not to shake 
     <lb/>
     the confidence of the most timid. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman denies the correctness of the 
     <lb/>
     calculations of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Sherbrooke, it is true, but in a matter of 
     <lb/>
     such vast importance, the House and the 
     <lb/>
     country have a right to something more than 
     <lb/>
     a mere denial. Let honorable gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House prove the error 
     <lb/>
     of the Honorable Minister of Finance, and 
     <lb/>
     then, and not before, they may hope to bring 
     <lb/>
     conviction home to the friends of the scheme. 
     <lb/>
     I now come to the arguments of the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Lotbinière. Since I first 
     <lb/>
     took my seat in Parliament, I had learned to 
     <lb/>
     esteem that honorable gentleman ; his conduct, 
     <lb/>
     always so honorable, and the good faith which 
     <lb/>
     appeared to govern his whole conduct as a 
     <lb/>
     legislator, had inspired me with the highest 
     <lb/>
     respect for him. But what was my surprise 
     <lb/>
     to see him condescend to the part which we 
     <lb/>
     have seen him play on the occasion of his 
     <lb/>
     speech on the great question now before the 
     <lb/>
    House ! To act a comic part, to make a buf<lb break="no"/>foon of one's self, and, at the same time, dis<lb break="no"/>cussing a scheme for a new Constitution 
     <lb/>which, it is alleged, will obliterate a whole 
     <lb/>people, and reciting from history all the evils 
     <lb/>which democratic doctrines have brought 
     <lb/>upon the human race. What a contrast ! 
    <lb/>How courageous ! And the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Montagne</hi> ap<lb break="no"/>plauded the recital by the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man of all the scenes of horror, discord, revo<lb break="no"/>lution and civil war which democratic princi<lb break="no"/>ples had brought about in all those parts 
     <lb/>of the world in which these notions had 
     <lb/>prevailed. What impudence ? May the 
     <lb/>people, Mr. SPEAKER, profit by the lesson. 
     <lb/>The honorable member for Lotbinière has 
     <lb/>told us that the Federal system carried in 
     <lb/>itself a principle fatal to its existence, and that 
     <lb/>all confederation died of consumption. Then 
     <lb/>
       
    
            <pb n="481" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0481.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">481</fw>
         
     opening the volume of history, the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has depicted to us all the republics 
     <lb/>
     of ancient and modern times gradually suc<lb break="no"/>cumbing under the pressure of the discord, 
     <lb/>
    civil wars and revolutions to which that form 
     <lb/>of government had given birth. The argu<lb break="no"/>ment was specious. It is only to be regretted, 
     <lb/>as regards the honorable gentleman, that the 
     <lb/>honorable members of the Quebec Conference, 
     <lb/>convinced that, to make sure of the future, it 
     <lb/>was advisable to consult and to study the past, 
     <lb/>adopted monarchical principles as the basis of 
     <lb/>the new Confederation, instead of founding it 
     <lb/>on those democratic doctrines which proved so 
     <lb/>fatal to all the confederacies referred to by 
     <lb/>the honorable gentleman. Confederation is 
     <lb/>the obliteration of Lower Canada, the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Lotbinière has further told 
     <lb/>us. I am far from being of that opinion. 
     <lb/>Lower Canada has since the union beheld, for 
     <lb/>a period of twenty-four ears, her institutions 
     <lb/>at the mercy of a majority different in origin, 
     <lb/>in religion, and in language. Under Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, on the other hand, Lower Canada will 
     <lb/>have the administration of all she holds most 
     <lb/>dear—her nationality, and I am rejoiced to 
     <lb/>find in the speech of the honorable member 
     <lb/>for Hochelaga some few words which abun<lb break="no"/>dantly prove my proposition. "It will be 
     <lb/>impossible," says that honorable gentleman, 
     <lb/>"for the Federal Government ever to inter<lb break="no"/>fere in any legislation relating to the institu<lb break="no"/>tions or laws of Lower Canada. If they at<lb break="no"/>tempted, the fifty or sixty members of French 
     <lb/>origin, uniting as one man, would very soon 
     <lb/>put a stop to any legislation, thus compelling 
     <lb/>the majority to afford them justice." (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Lower Canada, it is true, will be in a 
     <lb/>minority in the Central Legislature, but we 
     <lb/>must not lose sight of the fact that the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the Lower Provinces are less identical 
     <lb/>with the interests of Upper Canada than they 
     <lb/>are with those of Lower Canada ; and, more<lb break="no"/>over, our position in the centre of the state 
     <lb/>also adds to our influence. On the other 
     <lb/>hand, responsible government is essentially a 
     <lb/>government of parties ; the national French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Canadian representation will have all that 
     <lb/>influence which fifty or sixty votes given to 
     <lb/>one side of the House or the other can exer<lb break="no"/>cise ; the one party or the other will count 
     <lb/>upon the votes of the French-Canadian section, 
     <lb/>just as in England the Protestant majority 
     <lb/>in Parliament is not made up without the 
     <lb/>votes of the Catholic minority. Thus the 
     <lb/>position of Lower Canada will be a strong 
     <lb/>one, and much to be preferred to that which 
     <lb/>it holds under the existing union. Other 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     honorable members have assigned as reasons 
     <lb/>
     of their opposition "the increased expenditure 
     <lb/>
     entailed by the proposed union." To this 
     <lb/>
     objection I have only, Mr. SPEAKER, to make 
     <lb/>
     the same reply which I have already given on 
     <lb/>
     another occasion. Will not Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     whilst remedying our sectional difficulties, 
     <lb/>
     contribute to the progress and advancement of 
     <lb/>
     these colonies ? Will it not increase our means 
     <lb/>
     of defence, securing at the same time to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada the exclusive control of its institutions, 
     <lb/>
     its laws and its nationality ? If to this propo<lb break="no"/>sition we are compelled, after careful consider<lb break="no"/>ation, to reply in the negative, then, un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly, we ought to reject the scheme ; 
     <lb/>
     but if, on the contrary, our answer is in the 
     <lb/>
     affirmative, we ought to accept it, even al<lb break="no"/>though our expenditure should be increased, 
     <lb/>
    for it becomes the means of safety—<hi rendition="simple:italic">Salus 
     <lb/>
     populi suprema lex.</hi> Certain other members 
     <lb/>
     object "that the Legislative Council is to be 
     <lb/>
     subject to the nomination of the Crown." 
     <lb/>
     For my part, I see no ground of objection in 
     <lb/>
     this ; on the contrary, I look upon it as an 
     <lb/>
     argument in favor of the scheme. I have 
     <lb/>
     always been opposed to the elective system in 
     <lb/>
     that branch of our Legislature. We have but 
     <lb/>
     one class in our society, we have no aristo<lb break="no"/>cracy. Why, then, should we have two popu<lb break="no"/>lar chambers ? In my opinion, it would have 
     <lb/>
     been wiser to abolish the Council than to 
     <lb/>
     make it elective. In the spirit of the English 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, the Legislative Council ts a 
     <lb/>
     tribunal for purifying the legislation of the 
     <lb/>
     Commons, for weighing in the balance of 
     <lb/>
     experience the probable consequences of their 
     <lb/>
     legislation. These advantages, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     will soon disappear under the elective system, 
     <lb/>
     which will cause the members of that body to 
     <lb/>
     lose that perfect independence requisite for the 
     <lb/>
     proper fulfilment of the high mission entrusted 
     <lb/>
     to them by the Constitution. In addition to 
     <lb/>
     this, the trouble of elections, the expenses 
     <lb/>
     which they entail, and the other difficulties 
     <lb/>
     inseparable from those great struggles, will 
     <lb/>
     very often prevent the entrance into that hon<lb break="no"/>orable body of the most competent men, whom 
     <lb/>
     the disgust inspired by all the difficulties I 
     <lb/>
     have just referred to, will induce to avoid 
     <lb/>
     public life and to remain in private life. For 
     <lb/>
     these reasons and in the public interest, I re<lb break="no"/>joice to see the return to the nominative prin<lb break="no"/>ciple. (Hear, hear.) I should have liked to 
     <lb/>
     have replied to some of the other arguments 
     <lb/>
     urged by honorable members of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>
     but I perceive, Mr. SPEAKER, that I have 
     <lb/>
     already taken up a good deal of time, and I 
     <lb/>
     consider that in view of the lateness of the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="482" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-24_Page_0482.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">482</fw>
           
     hour, it is my duty to conclude. In con<lb break="no"/>clusion I may be permitted to add that I am 
     <lb/>
     now more strongly in favor of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation that we are now considering, 
     <lb/>
     than I was at the time of the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions in reply to the Speech from the 
     <lb/>
     Throne. Then I had some doubts, but the 
     <lb/>
     position taken by the opponents of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure has sufficed to dissipate them. A cause 
     <lb/>
     must indeed be a bad one, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     when such men as those whom I see on the 
     <lb/>
     other side cannot find arguments to support 
     <lb/>
     their views, which are worthy of being dis<lb break="no"/>cusssed, and who, in order to maintain their 
     <lb/>
     position, are obliged to resort to such means 
     <lb/>
     as honorable gentlemen opposite, with their 
     <lb/>
     friends, have been compelled to have recourse 
     <lb/>
     to since it has been under consideration to 
     <lb/>
     establish a Federal union of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces. (Cheers.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, almost 
     <lb/>
     every one who has yet spoken in this debate 
     <lb/>
     has begun with some expression of his feeling 
     <lb/>
     of embarrassment. For my own part, I should 
     <lb/>
     be glad if I could begin in some other way, 
     <lb/>
     but I confess that I cannot. For I certainly 
     <lb/>
     never did rise to address this House, or any 
     <lb/>
     other public body, under a feeling of such 
     <lb/>
     oppressive embarrassment as I experience at 
     <lb/>
     this moment. It is impossible for me, occu<lb break="no"/>pying the position in which I now stand, not 
     <lb/>
     to feel that I am opposed to powerful odds, 
     <lb/>
     and that there is a sort of foregone conclu<lb break="no"/>sion, here, against the views I desire to 
     <lb/>
     impress upon the House. It is impossible 
     <lb/>
     for me not to feel that the considerations to 
     <lb/>
     which I have to ask the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House, are so many and so complex, that no 
     <lb/>
     sort of justice can possibly be done them 
     <lb/>
     within the limits of my capacity to speak, or 
     <lb/>
     of yours to listen. The interests at stake, 
     <lb/>
     too, are so large—so much larger than ever 
     <lb/>
     were at stake in any question which has yet 
     <lb/>
     been brought under the notice of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and the difficulties arising out of the question 
     <lb/>
      are so formidable, owing in no small mea<lb break="no"/>sure to what I must call the many reticences 
     <lb/>with which this scheme has been laid before 
     <lb/>us, and the ambiguities of expression which 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     everywhere characterise it, as to tax 
     <lb/>
     seriously the courage of those who may 
     <lb/>
     attempt to discuss it. I feel, besides, that 
     <lb/>
     I am entirely cut off from that description 
     <lb/>
     of remark which most of all tends to make 
     <lb/>
     one's speech pleasant to listen to ; for I can<lb break="no"/>not prophecy smooth things, or dilate on 
     <lb/>
     the marvels of progress to result from Con<lb break="no"/>federation in the future. There is a charac<lb break="no"/>ter of hurry, too, impressed on the whole 
     <lb/>
     style of this debate ; everybody feels so 
     <lb/>
     impatient, that one can scarcely hope to 
     <lb/>
     express his views fully, as he would wish 
     <lb/>
     and ought, on this vast scheme. I have even 
     <lb/>
     the feeling that my capacity for exertion is 
     <lb/>
     not up to its ordinary standard. I address 
     <lb/>
     the House in a state of health that renders 
     <lb/>
     me less capable than usual of physical 
     <lb/>
     exertions. I must, therefore, beg honorable 
     <lb/>
     members to make allowance for these circum<lb break="no"/>stances surrounding my position ; believing 
     <lb/>
     me that what I wish to do is to present as 
     <lb/>
     briefly as I can, and as truthfully as I can, 
     <lb/>
     my own deep seated convictions on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion now before the House. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     So strongly, Mr. SPEAKER, do I feel my 
     <lb/>
     inability to discuss this scheme as I could 
     <lb/>
     wish, that I almost must throw myself on 
     <lb/>
     the forbearance of Hon. members—that I 
     <lb/>
     hardly can help saying I should be in danger 
     <lb/>
     of shrinking from the duty of addressing 
     <lb/>
     you, but for the recollection that time and 
     <lb/>
     again, I have known, in cases of contest 
     <lb/>
     almost or quite as discouraging as this, that 
     <lb/>
     " the race has not been to the swift nor the 
     <lb/>
     battle to the strong"—that time and again I 
     <lb/>
     have known those who went into such con<lb break="no"/>tests with the best hopes of success, disap<lb break="no"/>pointed in their expectations. I do know, 
     <lb/>
     and I know that others know—I believe it 
     <lb/>
     to be the general conviction of those whom 
     <lb/>
     I address to-night, as regards this question, 
     <lb/>
     that whatever of popular feeling there may 
     <lb/>
     seem to be in favor of the views I have 
     <lb/>
     to combat, is anything but the deliberate 
     <lb/>
     result of a well-considered examination of 
     <lb/>
     the whole subject—is a feeling of most 
     <lb/>
     sudden growth, and of most passing char<lb break="no"/>acter. (Hear, hear.) Before I go further, 
     <lb/>
     I may be permitted distinctly to accept the 
     <lb/>
     challenge which has been more than once 
     <lb/>
     thrown out on the other side as to the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which this question ought to be 
     <lb/>
     discussed. I freely admit and sincerely 
     <lb/>
     maintain that it ought not to be discussed 
     <lb/>
     otherwise than as a great question, to be 
     <lb/>
     considered entirely on a large view of its 
     <lb/>
