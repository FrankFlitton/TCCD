<!-- TY, 2017-07-20, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->              
         <!--   <p> if they are true to themselves, to fear
the fate <lb/>
of Louisiana, which had not as many inhabi- <lb break="maybe"/>
tants, when it was sold by NAPOLEON to the <lb/>
United States, as Canada had in 1761. A <lb/>
people numbering a million does not vanish <lb/>
easily, especially when they are the owners of <lb/>
the soil. Their number is rapidly increasing. <lb/>
New townships are being opened in every <lb/>
direction, and being peopled with industrious <lb/>
settlers. In the Eastern Townships, which it <lb/>
was thought were destined to be peopled en- <lb break="maybe"/>
tirely by English settlers, these latter are <lb/>
slowly giving way to the French-Canadians. <lb/>
There is a friendly rivalry between the two <lb/>
races, a struggle of labor and energy ; contact <lb/>
with our fellow-countrymen of English origin <lb/>
has at last opened our eyes ; we have at last <lb/>
comprehended that in order to succeed, not <lb/>
only labor is needed, but well-directed and <lb/>
skilled labor, and we profit by their example <lb/>
and by the experience they have acquired in <lb/>
the old countries of Europe. Agriculture <lb/>
with us is now becoming an honorable pursuit ; <lb/>
the man of education is no longer ashamed to <lb/>
devote himself to it. Our farmers feel the ne- <lb break="maybe"/>
cessity and desire of attaining perfection
in the <lb/>
art. We possess magnificent model farms, in <lb/>
which we can learn the science of agriculture. <lb/>
We are entering a new era of prosperity. <lb/>
The French-Canadians hold a distinguished <lb/>
position in the commerce of the country ; <lb/>
they have founded banks and savings banks ; <lb/>
on the St. Lawrence between Quebec and <lb/>
Montreal, they own one of the finest lines of <lb/>
steamboats in America ; there is not a parish <lb/>
on the great river which has not its steamboat ; <lb/>
the communications with the great towns are <lb/>
easy ; we have railways, and we now measure <lb/>
by hours the duration of a journey which for- <lb break="maybe"/>
merly we measured by days ; we have foun- <lb break="maybe"/>
dries and manufactories, and our shipbuild- <lb break="maybe"/>
ers have obtained a European renown. We <lb/>
have a literature peculiarly our own ; we have <lb/>
authors, of whom we are justly proud ; to them <lb/>
we entrust our language and our history ; they <lb/>
are the pillars of our nationality. Nothing de- <lb break="maybe"/>
notes our existence as a people so much as our lit- <lb break="maybe"/>
erature ; education has penetrated everywhere ; <lb/>
we have several excellent colleges, and an uni-<lb break="maybe"/>
versity in which all the sciences may be studied <lb/>
under excellent professors. Our young men <lb/>
learn in the military schools how to defend <lb/>
their country. We possess all the elements <lb/>
of a nationality. But a few months ago, we <lb/>
were steadily advancing towards prosperity, <lb/>
satisfied with the present and confident in the <lb/>
future of the French-Canadian people. Sud- <lb break="maybe"/>
denly discouragement, which had never over- <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>

&lt; hr/&gt; 
   
<p> come us in our adversity, takes
possession of<lb/>
us ; our aspirations are now only empty <lb/>
dreams ; the labors of a century must be <lb/>
wasted ; we must give up our nationality, <lb/>
adopt a new one, greater and nobler, we are <lb/>
told, than our own, but then it will no longer <lb/>
be our own. And why? Because it is our <lb/>
inevitable fate, against which it is of no use <lb/>
to struggle. But have we not already strug- <lb break="maybe"/>
gled against destiny when we were more feeble <lb/>
than we are now, and have we not triumphed ? <lb/>
Let us not give to the world the sad spectacle <lb/>
of a people voluntarily resigning its nation- <lb break="maybe"/>
ality. Nor do we intend to do so.
Let the <lb/>
people have time given them to understand <lb/>
the question ; let their opinion on the subject <lb/>
be obtained at the polls. It is but their right, <lb/>
unless our form of government is a delusion <lb/>
and a snare. If the measure is a good one, <lb/>
what danger is there in discussing it ? If the <lb/>
new Constitution it is proposed to give us is <lb/>
to last for centuries, why should we not at <lb/>
least endeavor to make it as perfect as possi- <lb break="maybe"/>
ble ? Why press its adoption before it is <lb/>
understood ? In conclusion, I object to the <lb/>
proposed Confederation, first, as a Canadian, <lb/>
without reference to origin, and secondly, as <lb/>
a French-Canadian. From either point of <lb/>
view, I look upon the measure as a fatal error ; <lb/>
and, as a French-Canadian, I once more appeal <lb/>
to my fellow-countrymen, reminding them of the <lb/>
precious inheritance confided to their keeping <lb/>
—an inheritance sanctified by the blood of <lb/>
their fathers, and which it is their duty to <lb/>
hand down to their children as unimpaired as <lb/>
the received it. (Cheers.) <lb/>
The debate
was then adjourned. <lb/>

<!-- GL Comment, this is NOT italicized -->
            <hi rendition="simple:italic">our decision</hi>, both to ourselves and our
pos<lb break="no"/>terity. The measure is so vast in its bear<lb break="no"/>ings, the interests affected by it are so con<lb break="no"/>siderable, that no one can be surprised at my <lb/>
diffidence and hesitation. This question of <lb/>
Confederation is bound up with the common <lb/>
interests of empires and the general policy <lb/>
of nations, for it is no unimportant matter <lb/>
for the great nations who bear sway among <lb/>
mankind, to know into what hands the Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of British North America
may fall. <lb/>
We need only look back into the pages of <lb/>
history to learn how greatly nations are <lb/>
moved by the creation of a new people ; <lb/>
and on the present occasion, the thousand <lb/>
voices of the press proclaim the
interest <lb/>
which the question of
Confederation excites <lb/>
both in America and in Europe
itself, and <lb/>
how closely the governments observe our <lb/>
proceedings ; and this interest which
they <lb/>
feel and proclaim is legitimate and natural, <lb/>
for the measure is destined to make us rank <lb/>
among the nations of the earth.
More than <lb/>
all, this question particularly concerns Eng<lb break="no"/>land and the United States, and in an equal <lb/>
degree with ourselves. England is
interest<lb break="no"/>ed in seeing these provinces well governed, <lb/>
prosperous, free, contented and happy.  She <lb/>
is interested in their having a good govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that it should be so administered <lb/>
as to be no burthen to her as the
Mother <lb/>
Country ; that, on the contrary, they <lb/>
should become powerful and in a position to <lb/>
assist her in certain eventualities. On the <lb/>
other hand, the United States must feel a <lb/>
degree of satisfaction in seeing the Provinces <lb/>
of British North America become a powerful <lb/>
nation. They will see it without a feeling <lb/>
allied to jealousy. They must wish us to be <lb/>
strong enough to maintain our
neutrality, <lb/>
our good understanding with
them, and those <lb/>
friendly relations which should ever subsist <lb/>
between neighboring  nations.
But if this <lb/>
question is interesting to England and the <lb/>
United States, it is still more
so to ourselves— <lb/>
to us, whose destiny is at
stake, to us whose <lb/>
position is a lofty one as
compared with the <lb/>
ordinary lot of nations ; for the faculty is <lb/>
not granted to all nations to choose their own <lb/>
lot in the full leisure of a time of peace, with<lb break="no"/>out the taint of a single drop
of blood shed—<lb/>
to fix upon a Constitution which will set them <lb/>
at once on the high road of progress, and <lb/>
enable them to take such ground for their <lb/>
career as may seem good in their
own eyes. <lb/>
In 18l0, when the union of the two Canadas <lb/>
was under consideration,
we occupied no such <lb/>
position, for that union was imposed upon us <lb/>
            
            <cb/> 

            in our own despite, and we were never
con<lb break="no"/>sulted on the subject. It will be re<lb break="no"/>membered that for a certain time our <lb/>
very language was proscribed, and our <lb/>position rendered as unfortunate as it could <lb/>
be made. True, we had an equal num<lb break="no"/>ber of representatives in this House, but <lb/>
as a people we were manifestly held to <lb/>
be inferior. I grant that the attempt to fix <lb/>
the yoke permanently on our necks proved <lb/>
a failure, but this was no fault of those who <lb/>
imposed the union on us. We have won <lb/>
the position which we now occupy by our <lb/>
own energy and perseverance, assisted by <lb/>
some of the representatives of Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. At this day things are
greatly changed. <lb/>
We are in the midst of a great revolution, <lb/>
but a revolution of which peace is the guid<lb break="no"/>ing spirit ; we are free to deliberate whether <lb/>
we will change our position, and
to dictate <lb/>
the terms on which the change is
to be <lb/>
made. We are invited to shape out our <lb/>
future destiny, and we should not be true to <lb/>ourselves, or to our constituents, if we refused <lb/>
this day to avail ourselves of
the resolutions <lb/>
adopted at the Conference of Quebec. The <lb/>
hon. member for Hochelaga (Hon
Mr. DO<lb break="no"/>RION), whom I regret not to see in his place— <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—He will be here in <lb/>
a moment. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LANG1"><persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName></persName>—The hon. <lb/>
member for Hochelaga told us the other <lb/>
day that the plan of a
Confederation was <lb/>
adopted and moved by the present Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration for the mere purpose of stifling
the <lb/>
cry of representation by
population. Well, <lb/>
and if it really were so, where does the hon. <lb/>
member find the harm in it ? Is it not most <lb/>
important that we should stop that cry for
<lb/>
representation based on
population, in our <lb/>
present condition ? Representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation would have left us, Lower Canadians, <lb/>
in an inferior position relatively to that of <lb/>
Upper Canada—would have conferred on the <lb/>
latter the privilege of legislating
for us, not <lb/>
only in general, but in local matters.  The <lb/>
hon. member for Hochelaga ought to have <lb/>
been the last to reproach the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with having, by this measure of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, stopped the cry for
representation <lb/>
based on population. In 1854, the hon. <lb/>
member admitted, as he himself acknow<lb break="no"/>ledges, that representation based on popula<lb break="no"/>tion was just in principle, and the consequence <lb/>
of that admission was fatal. The consequence <lb/>
was that the hon. member was
compelled to <lb/>
keep in the same track until
the formation <lb/>of the BROWN-DORION
Administration in <lb/>
            
            <pb n="364" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0364.jpg"/>

Administration had no very long existence, <lb/>
and I rejoice that I did my part in upsetting <lb/>
it, for it is probable that, if it had stood, <lb/>
representation based on
population would <lb/>
have been forced upon us, and we should <lb/>
not be now in our present position—in a <lb/>
position to make our own terms as freely as <lb/>
Upper Canada, and take part, on a footing of <lb/>
equality, in negotiating a treaty with the <lb/>
Lower Provinces. This is why I rejoice <lb/>
that I contributed to overthrow that govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon. member for Hochelaga <lb/>
told us the other evening that in 1856 he <lb/>
spoke as follows :— <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> In 1856, when Parliament was sitting at
To<lb break="no"/>ronto, I first suggested that one means of sur<lb break="no"/>mounting our difficulties would be the substitution <lb/>
of a Confederation of the two
Canadas in place of a <lb/>
Legislative union. By that arrangement local <lb/>
questions would be debated in the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures, and the Central Government would have<lb/>
the control of commercial and other questions<lb/>
of general interest. I said that considering the <lb/>
differences of race, religion and laws now exist<lb break="no"/>ing between the two sections of the country, it <lb/>
would be the best means of surmounting them. <lb/>
That is to say, I would leave to
a central govern<lb break="no"/>ment questions regarding commerce, banking, <lb/>
the currency, public works of a
general character, <lb/>
&amp;c., and to the local legislatures all local ques<lb break="no"/>tions. At the same time I said that if these views<lb/>
were not accepted, I should certainly be in favor <lb/>
of representation based on population, with con<lb break="no"/>ditions and guarantees which would secure the <lb/>
interests of Lower Canada, and preserve
to <lb/>
Lower Canada the institutions which
are so dear <lb/>
to her. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Well, we see that in 1856, the hon.
member <lb/>
for Hochelaga was desirous of forming a <lb/>
new Constitution for the express purpose of <lb/>
stifling the cry for representation based on <lb/>
population. In 1858 he formed, together <lb/>
with the present Hon. President of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil (Hon. Mr. BROWN), the BROWN—DORION <lb/>
Government ; and again, he stipulated that <lb/>
the question of representation
based on <lb/>
population should be taken into
considera<lb break="no"/>tion, and that the Government should con<lb break="no"/>sider the means of settling the difficulties <lb/>
which it involved. In 1859 he signed a <lb/>
document, which also bore the signatures of <lb/>
Hon. Mr. DRUMMOND, Hon. Mr. DES<lb break="no"/>SAULLES, and Hon. Mr. MCGEE, in
which he <lb/>
said with his colleagues, that a
change in <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
             the Constitution of the country was
neces<lb break="no"/>sary :— <lb/>
            </p>


            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> If Lower Canada insists on maintaining
the<lb/>
union intact ; if she will neither consent to a<lb/>
dissolution of the union, nor consider the project <lb/>
of a Federation, it is difficult to conceive on what <lb/>
reasonable grounds the demand for representation <lb/>
according to population can be resisted. The <lb/>
plea for such resistance has hitherto been that <lb/>
danger might arise to some of her peculiar and <lb/>
most cherished institutions ; but that ground will <lb/>
be no longer tenable if she rejects a proposition, <lb/>
the effect of which would be to leave to her
own<lb/>
people the sole and absolute custody of
those <lb/>
institutions, and to surround them by the most<lb/>
stringent of all possible safeguards, the provisions <lb/>
of the fundamental law of the land, unalterable <lb/>
save by the action of the people affected by them. <lb/>
The logical alternative now presented to the <lb/>
people of Lower Canada would, therefore, seem <lb/>
to be dissolution or federation on the one hand,<lb/>
and representation according to
population on the <lb/>
other. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Here, again, he intended to stifle the cry <lb/>
of representation based on population, and <lb/>
intended to do it by founding a new Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. In 1861 it was just the same ; he <lb/>
declared that he was desirous of settling <lb/>
that question of the representation ; that it <lb/>
was not expedient that it should remain an<lb/>
open question ; that it was a difficulty to be <lb/>
got rid of one way or another. In 1862,<lb/>
also, he went into the Government with the<lb/>
same object in view. But how did he set <lb/>
about carrying it out? He made it a close <lb/>
question, and adopted, with his colleagues, <lb/>
the plan of the double majority. The hon.<lb/>
member doubtless had forgotten that in 1859, <lb/>
when he penned the manifesto which I have<lb/>
just quoted, he had condemned the double<lb/>
majority. Here is, in fact, what he said in <lb/>
that document :— <lb/>
            </p>
            

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> In each section there would still be
minority <lb/>
and majority parties, and unless the principle of<lb/>
the double majority could be enacted as a funda<lb break="no"/>mental law, we should be exposed to an endless <lb/>
round of the same complaints that we now hear,<lb/>
of one section ruling the other contrary to its well <lb/>
known public opinion, and to see reproduced in <lb/>
our politics the same passions, the same intrigues, <lb/>
the same corruption and insincerity. The enact<lb break="no"/>ment of the double majority is not advocated in<lb/>
any quarter. The impossibility
of clearly defining<lb/>
the cases to which it should apply, and of distin<lb break="no"/>guishing them from those to which it should not, <lb/>
is felt by all ; but were it
even possible, it would<lb/>
only lead to new phases of difliculty, by compelling <lb/>
majorities professing opinions and principles<lb/>
diametrically opposed to each other, to unite, <lb/>
and, thereby effectually to
extinguish the influence <lb/>
            
            <pb n="365" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0365.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">365</fw> 
            of one or the other minority, or of both.
It is <lb/>
difficult to conceive one single legislature com<lb break="no"/>posed of two majorities and two minorities ; these <lb/>
two majorities without any identity of principle,<lb/>
acting nevertheless together by common consent, <lb/>
so as to never trespass the one on the other, and <lb/>
so that each section of the province would always <lb/>
be governed by a majority of its representatives. <lb/>
On many questions this course could not be car<lb break="no"/>ried out without alternately forcing the majority <lb/>
of the representatives of each section of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince to abstain from voting, or to declare them<lb break="no"/>selves in favor of measures which
their judgment <lb/>
and their conscience would disavow. The com <lb/>
plications of such a system amounting to nothing <lb/>
short of an application of the Federal principle to <lb/>
a single legislature, would render it impracticable.<lb/>
            </p></quote>
            
            <p>Then the honorable member had changed <lb/>
his opinion on this subject ! I do not say<lb/>
this as a reproach ; but it proves that he <lb/>
always acted with the same object in view—<lb/>
that is to say, to stifle the cry for representation<lb/>
based on population. How, then, does it<lb/>
happen that he finds fault with the present<lb/>
Ministry for bringing forward a measure to<lb/>
put an end to these difliculties, and to pre<lb break="no"/>vent our being placed in a position of infe<lb break="no"/>riority ? But the object of the Confederation<lb/>
is not merely to do away with existing diffi<lb break="no"/>culties. It has become a necessity, because<lb/>
we have become suficiently great,—because<lb/>
we have become strong, rich, and powerful <lb/>
enough,—because our products are
numerous <lb/>
enough and considerable enough,—because<lb/>
our population has become large enough to <lb/>
allow of our aspiring to another position, and<lb/>
of our seeking to obtain an outlet through <lb/>
some seaport for our products. At the pre<lb break="no"/>sent day we stand in a position of vassalage <lb/>
to the United States, with respect to the <lb/>
exportation of our products to Europe ; we <lb/>
are at their mercy. If we should have any <lb/>
difficulty with our neighbors to-morrow, they <lb/>
would close the Portland route to us, and we<lb/>
should find ourselves, during nearly seven<lb/>
months in the year, cut off from all commu<lb break="no"/>nication with the seaboard, save by means <lb/>
of the usual long and difficult land journey.<lb/>
This is not a tenable position, nor one worthy<lb/>
of a people such as that which inhabits the<lb/>
Provinces of British North America. It is <lb/>
a position which must be emerged from, for<lb/>
such is the interest of Canada, of the Lower<lb/>
Provinces, and of the Western States. The<lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga told us that <lb/>
he was in favor of a plan which would
settle<lb/>
existing difficulties, and would place Lower<lb/>
Canada in a suitable position ; but he never<lb/>
told us what that plan was. The only thing <lb/>
he ever proposed was his plan of
1859 for <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            the Confederation of the two Canadas ; but<lb/>
that plan would only have settled one diffi<lb break="no"/>culty, and would have allowed others of the<lb/>
greatest importance to arise—and among<lb/>
others, that respecting our communication <lb/>
with the seaboard. That plan, for instance, <lb/>
would not have allowed us to construct the <lb/>
Intercolonial Railway ; for it is almost im<lb break="no"/>possible that so great an enterprise
should <lb/>
succeed unless it is in the hands of a great <lb/>
central power, and if it is
necessary to consult<lb/>
five or six governments before commencing <lb/>
it. But the question of the Confederation of<lb/>
the two Canadas is not the only one which<lb/>
is presented as a means of escaping from our<lb/>
difficulties ; there are different
plans which I<lb/>
shall enumerate. Some propose, for instance, <lb/>
that we should remain in the position in <lb/>
which we now are ; others wish for annexa<lb break="no"/>tion to the United States ; some would, per<lb break="no"/>haps, be in favor of complete independence ; <lb/>
others would favor a Confederation of the two<lb/>
Canadas ; and, lastly, the Confederation of all<lb/>
the British North American Provinces is <lb/>
proposed. Well, let us cursorily examine<lb/>
these various propositions. It may be that<lb/>
there are some members who are desirous <lb/>
that we should remain as we are. The <lb/>
honorable members for Hochelaga and <lb/>
Lotbinière (Hon. Mr. DORION and Mr. JOLY)<lb/>
consider our position an excellent one,<lb/>
and so, in their speeches, they have<lb/>
told us. They consider that we are ex<lb break="no"/>tremely prosperous, and that we have<lb/>
nothing to wish for. For my part, I consider<lb/>
that in our present position we are under a<lb/>
great disadvantage ; it is that if we remain<lb/>
isolated and alone, we cannot communicate <lb/>
with the metropolis, except through the <lb/>
United States ; if we remain alone we can<lb/>
aspire to no position, we can give rein to no <lb/>
ambition as a people. Again, we have at <lb/>
the present time as many systems of judica<lb break="no"/>ture as we have provinces ; with Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, on the contrary, this defect will be<lb/>
removed, and there will be but two systems:<lb/>
one for Lower Canada, because our laws are<lb/>
different from those of the other provinces,<lb/>because we are a separate
people, and because <lb/>
we do not choose to have the laws of the <lb/>
other populations—and the other for the<lb/>
remainder of the Confederation. All the <lb/>
other provinces having the same laws, or <lb/>
their system of law being derived from one <lb/>
and the same source, may have one and the<lb/>
same system of judicature ; and, in fact, a <lb/>
resolution of the Conference allows them to<lb/>
resolve that they will have one code and one <lb/>
            

            <pb n="366" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0366.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">366</fw> 
            judicial system : but an exception is
made in <lb/>
favor of Lower Canada and our laws. There <lb/>
are also as many different tariffs as
there are <lb/>
different provinces, as many commercial and <lb/>
customs regulations as provinces. It is true <lb/>
that there are now many free goods, but it <lb/>
is also correct to say that there as many cus<lb break="no"/>toms systems as there are provinces. And <lb/>
with respect to great colonial works, is it not <lb/>
true that it is impossible at the present day <lb/>
to undertake them, because the interests in<lb break="no"/>volved are too considerable, and because it is <lb/>
necessary to consult three or four legisla<lb break="no"/>tures ? By this it will be understood that it is <lb/>
almost impossible to reconcile so many differ<lb break="no"/>ent interests, except by uniting in one and the <lb/>
same legislature the representatives of those <lb/>
interests and of the people affected
by them, <lb/>
and this object we cannot attain by remaining<lb/>
by ourselves. Currency and the
interest of <lb/>
money are also regulated by different systems <lb/>
in the several provinces. There is one cur<lb break="no"/>rency here, another in Newfoundland, an<lb break="no"/>other in Prince Edward Island, and so on. <lb/>
The shilling and pound of this province are <lb/>
different from the shilling and pound of <lb/>
Newfoundland and those of the other Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces. But, with Confederation, <lb/>
all these matters would be placed under the <lb/>
control of one central legislature ; the cur<lb break="no"/>rency would become uniform throughout, <lb/>
and capital might be everywhere
invested <lb/>
without obstacle. So also it will be with <lb/>
respect to the rights of authors, patents for <lb/>
mechanical inventions, &amp;c. When speaking <lb/>
of the Intercolonial Railway, I made no men<lb break="no"/>tion of the Pacific Railway, because I con<lb break="no"/>sider that we ought to devote our attention to <lb/>
accomplishing the works of which we at <lb/>
present stand in need. At a later period, <lb/>
when our resources and our population shall <lb/>
have sufliciently increased, we may direct our <lb/>
attention to the Pacific Railway. And should <lb/>
it become necessary, we can, with Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, hope to build it in less than ten <lb/>
years, whereas by remaining by ourselves as <lb/>
we are, we could not hope to have it for per <lb/>
haps one hundred years. I think that I have <lb/>
now held up in a salient point of view the <lb/>
disadvantages of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi>.
The neces<lb break="no"/>sary consequence of what I have just demon<lb break="no"/>strated is that we cannot remain in the po<lb break="no"/>sition in which we now are, whether we will <lb/>
or not. The question of representation <lb/>
based on population must be met ; that <lb/>
question must be settled. To say that we <lb/>
will grant it is to wish to place us in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion of inferiority, and I, for my part, will <lb/>
            
            <cb/>  
             never consent to place my section of the
<lb/>
province in that position. Then there is <lb/>
another alternative that is proposed—annex<lb break="no"/>ation to the United States. I do not believe <lb/>
there is a single member in the House or out<lb/>
of the House who would consent to the<lb/>
annexation of Canada to the United States. <lb/>
But it is a question which must be examined
<lb/>
when discussing that of Confederation, be<lb break="no"/>cause it is one of' the alternatives offered to <lb/>
us, and out of which we have to make a <lb/>
selection. What then would be our position <lb/>
in case we were annexed to the United <lb/>
States? It is true that we should become <lb/>
an independent State in the American Con<lb break="no"/>federation, but with the advantages accruing <lb/>
from such a state of affairs, we
should like<lb break="no"/>wise have the disadvantages. We should <lb/>
have to contribute towards the liquidation <lb/>
of the enormous debt which the United <lb/>
States have contracted in consequence of the <lb/>
war which is desolating one of the finest <lb/>
portions of the land ; we should have to pay <lb/>
the interest, and subsequently the principal <lb/>
itself, for I do not suppose that the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans have the slightest intention of repudiat<lb break="no"/>ing their debt. The debt would have to be <lb/>
paid, and to effect that, heavy
imposts would <lb/>
have to be paid for a great number of years<lb/>
to provide the interest and sinking fund. <lb/>
Those who talk of the debt which is going <lb/>
to result from the Confederation should <lb/>
remember that it will be but a mere trifle <lb/>
compared with that for which we should <lb/>
become responsible under
annexation. For <lb/>
one dollar that we shall have to pay under
<lb/>
Confederation, we should have to pay six. <lb/>
under annexation. It is said that the debt <lb/>
will be enormous, but it will only be as one <lb/>
dollar to four dollars in England, and six
<lb/>
dollars in the United States. That is the <lb/>
financial aspeet of annexation. But what <lb/>
would be the fate of the French-Canadians <lb/>
in the case of annexation to the United <lb/>
States ? Let us profit by the example of the
<lb/>
French race in the United States, and enquire <lb/>
what has been the fate of the
French in <lb/>
Louisiana ? What has become of them ?
<lb/>
What has become of their language, their <lb/>
customs, their manners and their institutions ? <lb/>
After the war, hardly a trace will remain to <lb/>
show that the French race has
passed that <lb/>
way. So far as religion is concerned, we <lb/>
might not find ourselves so badly off ;
but <lb/>
we live in peace at the present day and are <lb/>
perfectly comfortable ; Catholics and Protest<lb break="no"/>ants have the same rights and religious <lb/>
liberty, and they live as peacefully together <lb/>

<persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. DUFRESNE</persName>
(Iberville)—We are <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:LANG1"><persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName></persName>—Yes, but <lb/>
we cannot remain in the position in which <lb/>
we are. The hon. member for Hochelaga has<lb/>
said so for ten years past, and undertook to <lb/>
change it. He said the position was
no <lb/>
longer tenable in 1854, and if it was not <lb/>
tenable then, it is still less so in 1865. I <lb/>
now come to the other alternative proposed <lb/>
to us—that of independence  Men may be <lb/>
found, both in the House and out
of the <lb/>
House, who would be disposed to say that <lb/>
we had better have independence than Con<lb break="no"/>federation.  For my part, I believe that the <lb/>
independence of the British North American <lb/>
Provinces would be the greatest misfortune <lb/>
which could happen to them ; it would be to<lb/>
leave us at the mercy of our neighbors, and<lb/>
to throw us into their arms.
Independence <lb/>
would make us masters of our position, but <lb/>
at the same time we should be deprived of <lb/>
the protection of England and without that <lb/>
it is by no means difficult to
foresee what <lb/>
would become of us. The hon. member for <lb/>
Hochelaga may think it to our advantage to <lb/>
be weak, but in that opinion I do not coin<lb break="no"/>side ; I consider that it is better to be in a<lb/>
position to meet the enemy in case of his<lb/>
attacking us. Let it be well understood<lb/>
that without the protection of England we<lb/>
can do nothing. And besides the outlay <lb/>
which would be entailed by our providing <lb/>
for our defence, there would also be enor<lb break="no"/>mous expenditure in order to keep up in a <lb/>
suitable manner our relations with foreign <lb/>
powers. With independence, and without <lb/>
the support and assistance of' England, we <lb/>
should have to maintain an army and a very <lb/>
expensive government, we should have to <lb/>
keep up diplomatic relations with other <lb/>
countries, and provide means to
defray a host <lb/>
of other expenses which we should not have <lb/>
to do under Confederation.
Independence <lb/>
is, therefore, out of the question for the pre<lb break="no"/>sent. Lastly, we have the fourth alter<lb break="no"/>native—the Confederation of the two Ca<lb break="no"/>nadas, proposed by the honorable member <lb/>
for Hochelaga. In his manifesto of 1864
he <lb/>
told us in what position we should then be. <lb/>
The following passage is from the manifesto<lb/>
is question :— <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> It would have been easy at any time to
satisfy <lb/>
Upper Canada by giving her four or five members <lb/>
more than Lower Canada,
preserving at the same <lb/>
time equality in the Legislative Council.
To <lb/>
avoid the danger which this
increase of members <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            might entail, it is proposed to give Upper
Canada <lb/>
seventeen members more than Lower Canada, <lb/>
and there are added besides forty-seven members <lb/>
more for the Maritime Provinces ; in all sixty-four<lb/>
members are added to the British element besides<lb/>
the twenty-eight additional members which are <lb/>
given to the Legislative Council ;
and this is the <lb/>
way in which it is pretended that the rights of <lb/>
Lower Canada are to be protected. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> The hon. member for Hochelaga according
to <lb/>
his own plan would have preferred— 
</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORlON</persName>—It is not a plan, it <lb/>
is an argument. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON.
SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—Then it <lb/>
is a very bad argument—an argument by no <lb/>
means advantageous to Lower Canada. The <lb/>
hon. member says in that manifesto that it <lb/>
would be quite an easy matter to secure the <lb/>
silence of Upper Canada, by granting it four<lb/>
or five more members than Lower Canada. <lb/>
But the hon. member very well knows that <lb/>
if we were to grant representation
based on <lb/>
population, it would not be four or five <lb/>
members we should have to give to Upper <lb/>
Canada, but the seventeen members which<lb/>
it is now proposed to give Upper Canada by <lb/>
the plan of Confederation. The increase<lb/>
would not be based on an imaginary number. <lb/>
But even with four or five members more in <lb/>
the present union, Upper Canada could <lb/>
impose its decision on all questions
which <lb/>
might come before the House. The hon. <lb/>
member for Hochelaga has told us
that under <lb/>
the proposed system. Upper Canada will have<lb/>
seventeen members more than
Lower Canada, <lb/>
and that the English element will be in<lb break="no"/>creased by the addition of all
the members <lb/>
from the Lower Provinces, and that they <lb/>
will enter into a league against us Lower <lb/>
Canadians. I must say, I do not think the <lb/>
hon. member pays a very high
compliment <lb/>
to his ex-colleague the Hon. Mr. HOLTON,
<lb/>
when he says that because the members will <lb/>
be English, they will be against us French- <lb break="yes"/>
Canadians. So great was his confidence in <lb/>
the hon. member for Chateauguay, that he <lb/>
took him into his Government, and would <lb/>
take him again to-day if he had
the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity ; and yet the hon. member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga speaks of the English as though they <lb/>
were our natural enemies. For my part, I <lb/>
do not think they are ; moreover, the <lb/>
question before us is not the formation of a <lb/>
Local Government only. We are considering <lb/>
the establishment of a Confederacy—with <lb/>
a Central Parliament and local parlia<lb break="no"/>ments. The Central or Federal Parliament <lb/>
will have the control of all measures <lb/>
            
            <pb n="368" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0368.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">368</fw>
            of a general character, as provided by <lb/>
the Quebec Conference ; but all matters <lb/>
of local interest, all that relates to the <lb/>
affairs and rights of the different sections of <lb/>
the Confederacy, will be reserved for the <lb/>
control of the local parliaments.
The posi<lb break="no"/>tion in which Confederation will place us is <lb/>
very different from that which we should <lb/>
have occupied under the system proposed by <lb/>
the honorable member, inasmuch as the <lb/>
seventeen members, which Upper Canada <lb/>
will have more than Lower Canada, will <lb/>
have nothing to do with our local affairs,
<lb/>
our religious questions or particular institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and the hon. member for Hochelaga,
<lb/>
by his scheme, would have entrusted all <lb/>
that to the good-will of the Upper Canadian <lb/>
majority ; but for my part, I would rather <lb/>
entrust the management of these matters to <lb/>
my own people than to them. As regards <lb/>
the seventeen additional members which <lb/>
Upper Canada will have in the Federal Par<lb break="no"/>liament, I am not alarmed at their presence <lb/>
any more than at that of the members from <lb/>
the Lower Provinces, because in Parliament <lb/>
there will be no questions of race, nation<lb break="no"/>ality, religion or locality, as this Legislature <lb/>
will only be charged with the settlement of <lb/>
the great general questions which will <lb/>
interest alike the whole Confederacy and <lb/>
not one locality only. Our position <lb/>
then is excellent, and all those who <lb/>
frankly give expression to their opinions <lb/>
must admit that the representatives of Lower <lb/>
Canada at the Quebec Conference have care<lb break="no"/>fully guarded her interests. I may say that <lb/>
the basis of action adopted by the delegates, <lb/>
in preparing the resolutions, was to do jus<lb break="no"/>tice to all—justice to all races, to all reli<lb break="no"/>gions, to all nationalities, and to all interests. <lb/>
For this reason the Confederation will be <lb/>
accepted by all, in the Lower Provinces as <lb/>
well as here. Under Confederation there <lb/>
will no longer be domination of one race over <lb/>
another, and if one section should be desirous <lb/>
of committing an act of injustice against <lb/>
another section, all the others would unite <lb/>
together to prevent it. But, supposing that <lb/>
an unjust measure was passed in the House <lb/>
of Commons of the Federal Legislature, it <lb/>
would be stopped in the Legislative Council ; <lb/>
for there we shall be represented equally <lb/>
with the other sections, and that is a guar<lb break="no"/>antee that our interests will be amply pro<lb break="no"/>tected. In the Legislative Council we shall <lb/>
have 24 members like Upper Canada and <lb/>
the Lower Provinces. I assert, then, that <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            there is a vast difference between the
argu<lb break="no"/>ments of the hon. member for Hochelaga <lb/>
and the measure of the Government ; our <lb/>
interests will be protected by the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council, and the measures of general <lb/>
interest will come under the jurisdiction of <lb/>
the Federal Parliament. When the matter <lb/>
under consideration is a great public enter<lb break="no"/>prise, such as a railway, a canal or a tele<lb break="no"/>graph line, our religious and national in<lb break="no"/>terests will not be endangered. It will be the <lb/>
duty of the Central Government to see that <lb/>
the country prospers, but it will not be its <lb/>
duty to attack our religion, our institutions or <lb/>
our nationality, which, moreover, as I have <lb/>
just proved, will be amply protected. While <lb/>
on this point, I will draw the attention of the <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga to the fact, <lb/>
that in 1859 he expressed himself
as fol<lb break="no"/>ows :— <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> Whatever may be the number of provinces
or <lb/>
of subdivisions which it may hereafter be deemed <lb/>
necessary to adopt, the separating line between <lb/>
Upper and Lower Canada must be maintained. <lb/>
In defining the powers of the local and federal <lb/>
governments, those only must be
delegated to <lb/>
the latter which would be absolutely necessary
<lb/>
for the purposes of Confederation, and, as a neces<lb break="no"/>sary consequence, reserve to the subdivisions <lb/>
powers as ample and as varied as possible. The <lb/>
customs, the mail service, the laws respecting the <lb/>
currency, patents and copy-rights, the public <lb/>
lands, and such of the public works as possess
<lb/>
an interest common to all parts of the country, <lb/>
ought to be the principal, if not the only objects <lb/>
which would be placed under the control of the <lb/>
Federal Government, whilst all that would relate <lb/>
to improvements purely local—to education, the <lb/>
administration of justice, the militia, the laws of <lb/>
preperty, and of internal police—would be under <lb/>
the control of the local governments, whose <lb/>
powers, in a word, would extend to all matters not <lb/>
specially delegated to the General Government. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Thus we see that the honorable member <lb/>
was willing to give up the control of the <lb/>
public lands to the Federal Government. <lb/>
He considered that it would be better to <lb/>
leave the control of colonization
and the <lb/>
public lands to the Federal Government, in <lb/>
which, nevertheless, he was prepared to give <lb/>
a preponderance to Upper Canada. By the <lb/>
plan of Confederation brought down by the <lb/>
present Government, the control of these <lb/>
matters is given up to the local legislatures,
<lb/>
and I earnestly hope that the honorable <lb/>
member will not endeavor to take them away
<lb/>
and transfer them to the control of the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Government. If his plan or his argu<lb break="no"/>ment had ever been put into Operation, he <lb/>
            
            <pb n="369" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0369.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">369</fw>
            would have abandoned the control of our <lb/>
public lands to the British element, of which <lb/>
he now pretends to stand in mortal fear. I <lb/>
repeat the declaration that it is impossible <lb/>
for us to continue in our present position ; that <lb/>
annexation to the United States would be <lb/>
the greatest disaster that could befal us ; and <lb/>
that it is impossible, that it would be dis<lb break="no"/>astrous to think of the independence of the <lb/>
country ; that the project for the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the two Canadas as
proposed by the <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga is not de<lb break="no"/>sirable, and would not offer any
guarantee <lb/>
for the institutions of Lower Canada, but <lb/>
that the Confederation of all the Provinces of <lb/>
British North America would be preferable, <lb/>
and is our only remedy. The Confederation <lb/>
would have the effect of giving us more <lb/>
strength than we now possess ; we should <lb/>
form but one nation, one country, for all <lb/>
general matters affecting our
interests as a <lb/>
people. But when I speak of a great and <lb/>
powerful nation, far be it from me to wish <lb/>
that we should form an independent nation, <lb/>
and that we should abandon the protection <lb/>
of the British flag ; on the contrary, I ear<lb break="no"/>nestly hope that we shall long remain under <lb/>
the protection of that flag. What I would <lb/>
say is, that with Confederation we shall be <lb/>
in a better position for self-defence, and to <lb/>
aid the Mother Country under certain exi<lb break="no"/>gencies, than we are at the present time. <lb/>
Having Confederation, the
Central Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be in a position to have its orders <lb/>
carried out over its whole territory ; and when <lb/>
the question of defence comes up, it will not <lb/>
be obliged to consult four or five different <lb/>
legislatures, but it will be able
to organize <lb/>
our defences immediately and without ob<lb break="no"/>struction. Besides, we shall have acquired <lb/>
a standing which we have not hitherto <lb/>
attained in our relations with other countries <lb/>
with which we have dealings. It is of no <lb/>
small importance for the inhabitants of <lb/>
a country to have a standing in foreign <lb/>
countries, and not to be treated as men <lb/>
of inferior position. When Canadians go <lb/>
to London or elsewhere out of their own <lb/>
country, they have no recognized
posi<lb break="no"/>tion, because we are only a simple colony. <lb/>
But under the Confederation we shall be <lb/>
protected by England, and besides we shall <lb/>
have a position in foreign lands, the position <lb/>
which every man enjoys who belongs to a <lb/>
great nation. On this very point a public <lb/>
writer wrote some few years ago in a London <lb/>
newspaper an article from which I will <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
             ask permission to read an extract to the <lb/>
House. The matter under consideration was <lb/>
the cession of the right of fishery on the <lb/>
Banks of Newfoundland by England to
<lb/>
France. He says :— <lb/>
            </p>
 

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> Now, see the effect of this want of association <lb/>
and representation here. The basis of a treaty is <lb/>
agreed upon between Great Britain and France, <lb/>
by which Great Britain agreed to
give to <lb/>
France the exclusive right of fishing upon a great<lb/>
portion of the coast of Newfoundland,
a thing <lb/>
unjustified by any former treaty. Newfoundland
<lb/>
no sooner heard of it than she remonstrated, and <lb/>
denied the right of Great Britain to sign away to <lb/>
a foreign nation the property of the people of <lb/>
Newfoundland ; and, in fact, set at defiance the <lb/>
action of the Imperial Government. Now, this is <lb/>
not only derogatory to us as a nation, but it illus<lb break="no"/>trates the danger which may arise to the colonies <lb/>
from the Imperial Government not being properly <lb/>
informed on such subjects. For, from a careful
<lb/>
perusal of all the treaties on the subject in <lb/>
question, we cannot but believe that Newfound<lb break="no"/>land was right. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> It is evident that, if the Confederation had <lb/>
existed at that period, England would not <lb/>
have acted without consulting us ; but in those <lb/>
days they used to say, " They are Canadians, <lb/>
mere colonists, &amp;c.;" and as we
were then <lb/>
separated, of course we had to submit ; our <lb/>
rights were not protected as they will be <lb/>
when we are united. Under Confederation, <lb/>
England will consult us in all matters which <lb/>
affect our interests, and we shall be able to <lb/>
make ourselves effectually heard in London. <lb/>
In proof of this I cite from the same <lb/>
writer :— <lb/>
            </p>
           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> <p> Here is another question which especially affects <lb/>
Canada. In the course of last year, the subsidy <lb/>
of £176,340 per annum, paid to the Cunard <lb/>
vessels plying between Liverpool and the United <lb/>
States. was renewed for a period of six years by <lb/>
the Imperial Government. Another postal subsidy <lb/>
of £78,000 was just being granted by the Imperial <lb/>
Government to a new line of steamers between <lb/>
Galway and the United States, in this case also <lb/>
without consulting the interests of British North <lb/>
America. This is a great injustice, particularly
<lb/>
to Canada, for that province has expended large <lb/>
sums in the opening of water communication in <lb/>
the valley of the River St. Lawrence, canals which <lb/>
have become valueless from having to compete <lb/>
with the United States routes, encouraged by a <lb/>
subsidy from the Imperial Government of nearly <lb/>
£300, 00 per annum , while Canada on the other <lb/>
hand receives no aid whatever from the Imperial <lb/>
Government, but is compelled to subsidize a line <lb/>
of its own (to attract a feeble share of the trade) <lb/>
to the extent of £50,000 per annum." <lb/>

            <p> If all the Provinces of British North <lb/>

            <fw type="num">370</fw>
            single government, we should have been <lb/>
informed that the Imperial Government <lb/>
intended to make that treaty, and our rights <lb/>
would have been respected ; but as we were <lb/>
but a simple colony, and as there were many <lb/>
interests brought to bear, we could do nothing <lb/>
to protect ourselves. I do not desire to <lb/>
weary the House with quotations, but I trust <lb/>
I shall be allowed to cite another author, who <lb/>
in addition to showing how limited are the <lb/>
objects of ambition presented to the inhabit<lb break="no"/>ants of a colony, demonstrates that, though <lb/>
British subjects, we are almost on the footing <lb/>
of foreigners in England :— <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> Here again the contiguity of the colonies
to <lb/>
the United States suggests
disagreeable compari <lb/>
sons. In that great republic, the scope for indi<lb break="no"/>vidual exertion is immense ; and although the <lb/>
rewards of success in the higher walks of life are <lb/>
not generally so great as under most monarchical <lb/>
governments, some of the " prizes open to all," <lb/>
in that country, are of a very high order. Many a <lb/>
British North American has seen individuals upon <lb/>
the United States side of our boundary, whom he <lb/>
knew from personal acquaintance to be inferior <lb/>
to him in natural abilities, education, wealth, and <lb/>
social standing, raised in a
short time to the pre <lb/>
sidency of that republic, a position which would <lb/>
entitle him to rank with the proudest monarchs of <lb/>
Europe. At the same time that British American <lb/>
could not reasonably aspire even to become the <lb/>
governor of his native province ; and if he were <lb/>
to go to England, all the influence which he could <lb/>
command would probably not procure him a pre<lb break="no"/>sentation to his Sovereign. <lb/>
            </p>
</quote>
            <p> Does not that show that the position of a
<lb/>
Canadian, or of any other inhabitant of the <lb/>
colonies, in England is a position of infe<lb break="no"/>riority ? We desire to remove that infe<lb break="no"/>riority by adopting the plan of Confederation <lb/>
now submitted to the House. The honorable <lb/>
member for Hochelaga stated that Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation had not been asked for by the people, <lb/>
but that it was adopted as the last resource <lb/>
of a falling party. He referred, of course, <lb/>
when he expressed that opinion, to the vote <lb/>
of censure he had proposed last year against <lb/>
the TACHE—MACDONALD Ministry. After <lb/>
all his efforts against that ministry, the <lb/>
honorable gentleman could do no more than <lb/>
reproach them with an act committed, or <lb/>
supposed to have been committed, five years <lb/>
before by another government ; and by that <lb/>
means he had succeeded in overthrowing the <lb/>
ministry. The result of the vote, brought <lb/>
about by the honorable member, was very <lb/>
different from what he expected ; it resulted <lb/>
in the Coalition, and the project of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation now before the House. The honorable <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
             gentleman says that the people have not <lb/>
asked for it, but when the Government <lb/>
announced to the House that the basis upon <lb/>
which the new ministry had been formed <lb/>
was the Confederation of the provinces, the <lb/>
opposition did not declare that the measure <lb/>
was a bad one. On the contrary, the great <lb/>
majority of the members from Upper and <lb/>
from Lower Canada pronounced themselves <lb/>
in favor of the plan, and promised their <lb/>
support to the Government. The honorable <lb/>
gentleman also asks, who empowered the <lb/>
delegates to meet and prepare a plan of <lb/>
Contederation, and submit it to this House ? <lb/>
I answer, that the power was derived from <lb/>
the expressed sentiments of the House when <lb/>
it consented to the formation of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment on that basis. The Government felt <lb/>
that they had a perfect right not only to <lb/>
assist at the Quebec Conference, but to bring <lb/>
it about. And even though there had been <lb/>
no other reason but the difficulties which had <lb/>
arisen in Canada some years before ; even <lb/>
though there had been no other reason than <lb/>
the care of the interests of the country, we <lb/>
should have been justified thereby in assist<lb break="no"/>ing at the Charlottetown Conference, and in <lb/>
calling the Quebec Conference, at which the <lb/>
measure was adopted by the thirty-three <lb/>
delegates. The honorable gentleman let fall <lb/>
the accusation that we consented that <lb/>
Canada should have but one vote in the <lb/>
Conference. In making a charge against <lb/>
the Government, as leader of the Opposition,
<lb/>
the honorable gentleman ought to have <lb/>
sought to base it on more correct information. <lb/>

upon others ; we desired to come to an under<lb break="no"/>standing with the Lower Provinces. It was <lb/>
not our object to frame a feeble and unjust <lb/>
Constitution, destined, from the very fact, to <lb/>
last but a day. Hence it would not have <lb/>
been right, and we did not desire to take <lb/>
advantage of our position, but we treated <lb/>

            with the provinces on a footing of
equality, <lb/>
not wishing to force our views upon them, <lb/>
but anxious to come to an understanding, <lb/>
and to extend justice to all. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—The statement I <lb/>
made is not denied, that the votes were given <lb/>
by provinces. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOLICITOR GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—It <lb/>
is true ; the Lower Provinces had each one <lb/>
vote, as had Upper and Lower Canada, and <lb/>
it is for us a matter for congratulation. I <lb/>
may be permitted to remind the House, in <lb/>
connection with this matter, of the saying of <lb/>
the first NAPOLEON to one of his ambassa<lb break="no"/>dors, whom he sent to a prince who was <lb/>
feeble, poor, and without an army—that <lb/>
prince was the Pope : "Treat with him as if <lb/>
he had an army of two hundred thousand <lb/>
men at his back ! " Now, that is what we <lb/>
did ; we treated Nova Scotia, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and the other provinces as we desired <lb/>
to be treated ourselves, that is to say, with <lb/>
justice and consideration, and the result <lb/>
shews that we were right. The honorable <lb/>
gentleman ought to have confined himself to <lb/>
publishing, in his own way, the secrets of <lb/>
the Conference, and refrain from
divulging <lb/>
those of the committee appointed last year <lb/>
with respect to constitutional difficulties. I <lb/>
understood that everything was
to have <lb/>
remained secret in that committee, except <lb/>
the report made to the House. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Does the hon. <lb/>
gentleman accuse me of divulging the secrets <lb/>
of that committee ? <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LANG1"><persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName></persName>—The <lb/>
hon. gentleman stated that the Hon. Attorney
<lb/>
General (Hon. J. A. MACDONALD) had <lb/>
constantly acted and voted in that committee <lb/>
against the Confederation project, and that <lb/>
now he presents one himself ; and I maintain <lb/>
that he ought not to have said that, for the <lb/>
action of the members of the committee <lb/>
was to have remained secret. If the deliber<lb break="no"/>ations of the committee were to
have <lb/>
remained secret, the hon. gentleman must <lb/>
see that he is in a difficult position. The <lb/>
object of that secrecy is evident ; it was the <lb/>
same object we had in view in preserving
<lb/>
secrecy in the proceedings of the Quebec <lb/>
Conference ; to give increased freedom of <lb/>
opinion to each member, and not, as has been <lb/>
said, to deprive the people of information to <lb/>
which they were entitled. We knew that if <lb/>
our proceedings were presented day by day <lb/>
to the people, through the press, we should <lb/>
not have enjoyed that liberty of action and <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
             of discussion which we required. It is
easy <lb/>
to understand, that during the deliberations, <lb/>
a member might one day pronounce against <lb/>
a resolution or some important point, and <lb/>
that the arguments of another member in a <lb/>
contrary sense might make him change his <lb/>
opinion ; but that this might be, it was neces<lb break="no"/>sary to be free from all outside influence, and <lb/>
therefore it was that the Conference sat with <lb/>
closed doors. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Will the hon. <lb/>
member allow me to say a few words? He <lb/>
has stated that I divulged the secrets of the <lb/>
committee on sectional difficulties. I assert <lb/>
that I never attended the sittings of that <lb/>
committee, that I merely went there on the <lb/>
first day to state that I would not take part <lb/>
in its proceedings, and that I then withdrew <lb/>
and did not again attend. I was opposed to <lb/>
the proceedings of that committee, and I did <lb/>
not attend it ; but I learned that the Hon. <lb/>
Attorney General voted, on the last day the <lb/>
committee sat, against Confederation ; and <lb/>
that was all I stated. So that if the secrets <lb/>
of the committee have been revealed, it has <lb/>
not been done by me. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>.-—The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Hochelaga has quite forgotten what <lb/>
passed in the committee. He was
present, <lb/>
with the hon. member for Chateauguay ( Hon. <lb/>
Mr. HOLTON), at the commencement
of the <lb/>
proceedings of the committee, when it was <lb/>
stated and agreed that everything that passed <lb/>
in the committee was to be kept secret. I <lb/>
admit that the hon. gentleman refused to <lb/>
take part in the proceedings of the commit<lb break="no"/>tee, but at the same time he knew perfectly <lb/>
well that they were to be secret, and he was <lb/>
bound to respect that secrecy. He was aware <lb/>
that the representatives of the press had <lb/>
been excluded. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>.—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is entirely mistaken, for I was not<lb/>

fled
in saying what I said ; but after the <lb/>
explanations which the hon. gentleman has <lb/>
just given, I cannot accuse him of
having <lb/>
done it otherwise than inadvertently. The <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga stated that <lb/>
the memorial submitted by the Government <lb/>
at the time of its formation spoke of a Con<lb break="no"/>federation other than the one which it now <lb/>
proposes. It will be well to refer to the docu<lb break="no"/>ment in question in order to ascertain its <lb/>
contents. The memorial consists of two <lb/>
parts, of which the following is the first :— <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> The Government are prepared to state that
<lb/>
immediately after the prorogation, they will <lb/>
address themselves, in the most earnest manner, <lb/>
to the negotiation for a
Confederation of all the <lb/>
British North American Provinces. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> That failing a successful issue to such negoti<lb break="no"/>ations, they are prepared to pledge themselves to <lb/>
legislation,during the next session of Parliament, <lb/>
for the purpose of remedying existing difficulties <lb/>
by introducing the Federal principle for Canada <lb/>
alone, coupled with such
provisions as will permit <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces and the North-Western<lb/>
territory to be hereafter
incorporated into the <lb/>
Canadian system. </p></quote>
<p>In other words, the Government promises, <lb/>
in the first part of the memorial in question, <lb/>
to direct its attention to a Confederation of <lb/>
all the British North American Provinces ; <lb/>
and, in the event of its not succeeding in <lb/>
carrying out that object, to turn its attention <lb/>
to a Confederation of the two Canadas. And <lb/>
now here are the contents of the second <lb/>
part :— <lb/>
            
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> The Government are prepared to pledge
them<lb break="no"/>selves to bring in a measure, next session, for the <lb/>
purpose of removing existing difficulties, by intro<lb break="no"/>ducing the Federal principle into Canada, coupled<lb/>
with such provision as will permit the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces and the North-West
territory to be in<lb break="no"/>corporated into the same system of government.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And the Government will seek, by sending <lb/>
representatives to the Lower Provinces and to <lb/>
England, to secure the assent of
those interests <lb/>
which are beyond the control of our own legis<lb break="no"/>lation, to such a measure as may
enable all <lb/>
British North America to be united under a <lb/>
General Legislature based upon the Federal <lb/>
principle. <lb/>
            </p></quote> </p>
          <p>  Well,
where is the contradiction between <lb/>
these promises and the present action of the <lb/>
Government ? We begin with a plan of <lb/>
Confederation for the two Canadas, and sub<lb break="no"/>sequently, finding that the
Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are ready to enter upon
the considera<lb break="no"/>tion of a more extensive union, we have <lb/>
made arrangements to bring them
at once <lb/>
into the Confederation. There is no contra<lb break="no"/>
            
               <cb/>
             diction
in that, but it is the same measure <lb/>
and the same plan ; the only difference
is,<lb/>
that, instead of admitting them into the <lb/>
union some six or nine months hence, we<lb/>
have admitted them at once. When <lb/>
we approached the question, we found <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces in process of de<lb break="no"/>liberating upon a union amongst them<lb break="no"/>selves ; but the Charlottetown delegates<lb/>
perceived that the Confederation which we<lb/>
proposed to them would be much more <lb/>
advantageous to all the provinces than that <lb/>
upon which they were engaged, and they at <lb/>
once consented to accept our proposition.<lb/>
Accordingly they came to Quebec, and the <lb/>
result of their visit was the plan which
has <lb/>
been submitted to this House. The hon. <lb/>
member for Hochelaga has, therefore, no<lb/>
right to reproach us with having altered the <lb/>
plan promised to the House, since it is word<lb/>
for word that which we promised. This<lb/>
measure, as I observed a short time ago, <lb/>
cannot last, unless it protects the interests<lb/>
of all. Now, we have different
interests in <lb/>
Lower Canada, in which reside two popula<lb break="no"/>tions differing in origin, differing in religion, <lb/>
and speaking different
languages. On the <lb/>
other hand, Upper Canada has a homogeneous<lb/>
population, but one professing different <lb/>
religions, and so it is with respect to the<lb/>
several Maritime Provinces. In these latter <lb/>
provinces, also, we have more than one hun<lb break="no"/>dred thousand fellow countrymen of French <lb/>
origin. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, we have taken <lb/>
care to protect these different interests,
and <lb/>
to preserve the rights of this population, by <lb/>
uniting them in the Confederation to a peo<lb break="no"/>ple numbering a million souls of the same <lb/>
origin as themselves. But we are told:
<lb/>
" You wish to form a new nationality." Let <lb/>
us come to an understanding on this word, <lb/>
Mr. SPEAKER. What we desire and wish, <lb/>
is to defend the general interests of a great <lb/>
country and of a powerful nation, by means <lb/>
of a central power. On the other hand,we <lb/>
do not wish to do away with our different <lb/>
customs, manners and laws ; on the contrary, <lb/>
those are precisely what we are
desirous of <lb/>
protecting in the most complete manner <lb/>
by means of Confederation. Under the <lb/>
new system there will be no more reason <lb/>
than at present to lose our character as <lb/>
French or English, under the pretext that
<lb/>
we should all have the same general in<lb break="no"/>terests ; and our interests in relation to race,<lb/>
religion and nationality will remain as
they <lb/>
            

 

            <pb n="878" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0373.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">373</fw>
            are at the present time. But they will be <lb/>
better protected under the proposed system, <lb/>
and that again is one of the strongest reasons <lb/>
in favor of Confederation. Not only indeed <lb/>
did we assure ourselves of that protection, <lb/>
but the provinces who were parties to the <lb/>
Confederation desired it also. All local <lb/>
interests will be submitted and left to the de<lb break="no"/>cision of the local legislatures. There will <lb/>
be other exceptions with respect to Lower <lb/>
Canada, and, in fact, all the exceptions in <lb/>
the scheme of Confederation are in favor of <lb/>
Lower Canada. These restrictions in favor <lb/>
of Lower Canada were obtained by the <lb/>
delegates from that province ; but they seek <lb/>
no thanks for their conduct, as they con<lb break="no"/>sider that in so doing they only performed <lb/>
a duty—a duty incumbent on all true patriots <lb/>
and good citizens. All that they now come <lb/>
to this House and ask for, is its sanction <lb/>
to the measure which ensures these privi<lb break="no"/>leges to the populations which they repre<lb break="no"/>sent. I may add that, under Confederation, <lb/>
all questions relating to the colonization
of our <lb/>
wild lands, and the disposition and sale of <lb/>
those same lands, our civil laws and all <lb/>
measures of a local nature—in fact
every<lb break="no"/>thing which concerns and affects
those in<lb break="no"/>terests which are most dear to us as a <lb/>
people, will be reserved for the action of <lb/>
our local legislature ; all our charitable and <lb/>
other institutions will be protected by the <lb/>
same authority. There is also the question <lb/>
of education. Upon this question,
as upon all <lb/>
others, the Lower Canadian delegates have <lb/>
seen to the preservation of certain privileges, <lb/>
and that question has been left to our Local <lb/>
Legislature, so that the Federal Legislature <lb/>
shall not be able to interfere with it. It has <lb/>
been said that with respect to agriculture the <lb/>
power of legislation would be exercised con<lb break="no"/>currently by the Federal Legislature and the <lb/>
local legislatures. But the House is perfectly <lb/>
well aware for what reason that concurrent <lb/>
power was allowed. Every one,
indeed, is <lb/>
aware that certain general interests may arise <lb/>
respecting, which the
intervention of the <lb/>
Central Legislature may be
necessary ; but, <lb/>
Mr. SPEAKER, all interests relating to local <lb/>
agriculture, everything connected with our <lb/>
land will be left under the control of our <lb/>
Lower Canadian Legislature, and this is a <lb/>
point upon which we invariably insisted, and <lb/>
which was never denied us in the
Conference. <lb/>
It is thus clear that under Confederation as <lb/>
proposed, the inhabitants of distant
parts of <lb/>
the Confederacy, having the privilege of <lb/>
laying their claims before their
respective <lb/>
            
            <cb/> 
             local legislatures, will not be put to the great <lb/>
trouble of betaking themselves to the central  <lb/>
seat of government, when, for instance,
they <lb/>
wish to obtain authority to build a bridge or <lb/>
open a road. I now come, Mr. SPEAKER, to <lb/>
the subject of the details of the measure, and <lb/>
I shall reply to the observation of the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Hochelaga on that subject. <lb/>
That honorable gentleman objects to the <lb/>
appointment of the legislative councillors <lb/>
by the Central Government, and adds that <lb/>
those councillors will be appointed by a Tory <lb/>
government, and will necessarily be selected <lb/>
from among the tories. In making that <lb/>
assertion the honorable member did not act <lb/>
with that frankness which we are entitled to <lb/>
expect from him. (Hear, hear.) He hardly <lb/>
alluded, if he did so at all, to the clause <lb/>
in the resolutions by which the opposition, <lb/>
in the different parts of the Confederation,
<lb/>
are protected. In that clause it is provided <lb/>
that the Central Parliament, in making <lb/>
the appointments in question, shall be <lb/>
careful to watch over the interests of the Op<lb break="no"/>position, as well as over those of the Ministerial <lb/>
party. Now, Mr. SPEAKER, when a govern<lb break="no"/>ment binds itself in this way, is it reasonable <lb/>
and fair to believe or to suppose that it will <lb/>
break its word which has been so solemnly <lb/>
pledged ? For my part, I am convinced that <lb/>
the members of the present Government, <lb/>
should they form part of the Central Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, would fulfil what has been promised, <lb/>
and would watch over the rights of the Opp<lb break="no"/>sition as over those of the other party. The <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga also pre<lb break="no"/>tended that the Maritime Provinces had <lb/>
forced upon us the clause which provides <lb/>
that the legislative councillors in the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Parliament shall be a appointed
by the <lb/>
Crown. Yet, the honorable member right <lb/>
well knows that the elective principle in <lb/>
our existing Legislative Council was mere<lb break="no"/>ly an experiment, and that in Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada we have become tired of the system, <lb/>
not because the councillors who have been <lb/>
elected by the people are unworthy of the <lb/>
position which they occupy, or because their <lb/>
selection was an unfortunate selection, but <lb/>
because the very nature of the system
prevents <lb/>
a large number of men of talent, of men <lb/>
qualified in every respect and worthy to sit in <lb/>
the Legislative Council, from
presenting them-  <lb/>
selves for the suffrages of the electors, in con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the trouble, the fatigue and enor<lb break="no"/>mous expense resulting from
these electoral <lb/>
contests in enormous divisions. We know <lb/>
that the system has wearied Lower Canada, <lb/>
            
            <pb n="374" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0374.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">374</fw> 
            
            and that that province will approve of
our <lb/>
having inserted the clause in question in <lb/>
the resolutions. The vote which
took place <lb/>
last night in another place, shows that I am <lb/>
not mistaken in what I assert on this subject. <lb/>
One of the greatest objections which the <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga raises to the <lb/>
appointment of the legislative
councillors by <lb/>
the Crown, is that their number will be fixed, <lb/>
and that, by consequence, it will prove an <lb/>
obstacle to the decisions and legislation of the <lb/>
Commons House of the Federal Parliament. <lb/>
In a word, the honorable member declares that<lb/>
the Legislative Council, so constituted, will <lb/>
be, to use an English expression, a nuisance. <lb/>
The honorable member should glance back at <lb/>
the past to consider how many councillors ap<lb break="no"/>pointed for life there were in the Legislative <lb/>
Council at the time of the concession of the <lb/>
elective principle, and how many of those said <lb/>
councillors remain at the present day. He <lb/>
would have ascertained that in eight years the <lb/>
number had diminished by one-half. Of the <lb/>
forty-two or forty-three members which there <lb/>
were then, there now remain but twenty-one <lb/>
or twenty-two. (Hear, hear.) The honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Hochelaga should also have <lb/>
admitted that in those eight years there had <lb/>
been such considerable changes among the <lb/>
elected councillors, that there was no danger <lb/>
of the Legislative Council not being at least <lb/>
accessible to the people. This diminution <lb/>
gives an average of three members a-year, <lb/>
and if we take the proportion between this <lb/>
diminution and that which would necessarily <lb/>
prevail among a larger number of councillors, <lb/>
we shall find that there will be at least five <lb/>
vacancies in each year. The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber must then perceive that, if it should hap<lb break="no"/>pen that the Legislative Council should be so <lb/>
opposed to the views of the Lower House as <lb/>
systematically to reject the measures of the <lb/>
popular branch of the Legislature, at the end <lb/>
of a year or perhaps less, such changes would <lb/>
be effected by death or otherwise, that we <lb/>
should immediately have such an infusion of <lb/>
new blood, that any attempt of this kind <lb/>
could not be repeated for a long time. <lb/>
Besides, the Legislative Council will not con<lb break="no"/>stitute a separate class like the House of <lb/>
Lords in England. The councillors will come <lb/>
from among the people, with whom they will <lb/>
have interests in common, and it is absurd to <lb/>
suppose that they will be induced to oppose <lb/>
systematically and constantly the measures <lb/>
which the Lower House may enact in favor <lb/>
of the people and at their instance. The hon. <lb/>
member for Hochelaga, when on
this subject, <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            reproached the Attorney General for Upper<lb/>
Canada with having stated in his opening <lb/>
speech, that if he had to preside over the <lb/>
selection of the legislative councillors, he <lb/>
would see that the best qualified men were ap<lb break="no"/>pointed. Now, Mr. SPEAKER, I see
nothing <lb/>
in that declaration which is not in the most <lb/>
perfect accordance with the interests of the <lb/>
country, and it is important that the best men <lb/>
from each section of the Confederacy should <lb/>
be called to sit in this important branch of <lb/>
our General Legislature. The honorable <lb/>
member has taken occasion to find fault with <lb/>
the clause of the resolutions which provides <lb/>
that the lieutenant-governors
shall be appoint<lb break="no"/>ed by the Central Government, and sees in it <lb/>
great danger, especially to Lower Canada. <lb/>
Mr. SPEAKER, I should very much like to <lb/>
know what protection the population of the
<lb/>
different provinces derive from the fact that <lb/>
the governors of the British North American <lb/>
Provinces are sent out to us from England. <lb/>
Under the existing system, our governor is <lb/>
responsible neither to the people nor to the <lb/>
House ; he depends entirely upon the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish Government, to which he is responsible. <lb/>
Under the system proposed the lieutenant- <lb break="yes"/>
governors will be appointed by
the Central <lb/>Government, to which they will necessarily be <lb/>
responsible for their actions. And in that <lb/>
Government we shall have more than one vote ; <lb/>
we shall be represented in it by our ministers, <lb/>
who will be there to cause every encroachment <lb/>
or arbitrary act which the lieutenant-governor
<lb/>
may allow himself to commit, to be condemn<lb break="no"/>ed. If the Central Government should refuse <lb/>
to do us this justice, and should persist in not <lb/>
recalling any lieutenant-governor who should <lb/>
have so failed in his duty to the population <lb/>
which he governed, we should have our sixty- <lb break="yes"/>
five representatives to protest and to vote at <lb/>
need against a government which should dare <lb/>
to act in such away. In that respect we
<lb/>
should have much better guarantees than at <lb/>
present ; and in very truth this is a new privi<lb break="no"/>lege that we have obtained, as the people will <lb/>
have a voice in these appointments, from the <lb/>
fact that we shall have our responsible minis<lb break="no"/>ters in the Central Government, who will be <lb/>
sustained and supported by the members from <lb/>
our section. In allusion to the appointment <lb/>
of the lieutenant-governors, the honorable <lb/>
member for Hochelaga thought proper to <lb/>
make a violent attack upon the Conservative <lb/>
party. He asserted that that party continu<lb break="no"/>ally sought to diminish the liberties and the <lb/>
privileges of the people, whilst
the Liberal <lb/>
party labored to extend and ensure those same <lb/>
            
            <pb n="375" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0375.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">375</fw>
            
            liberties. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I believe
the <lb/>
people know their interests as well as the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Hochelaga, and that they <lb/>
will not heap reproaches upon us for having <lb/>
given them a Constitution, the object of which <lb/>
is to protect their local and general rights in a <lb/>
much more effectual manner than
they are <lb/>
protected under the present system. While <lb/>
thus attacking the Conservative party, the <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga did not <lb/>
neglect also to make a slight insinuation against <lb/>
the delegates to the Conference. In fact, he <lb/>
says :— <lb/>
            
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> The Speaker of the Legislative Council
will <lb/>
also be appointed by the Crown. This is another <lb/>
retrograde step, and a bit of patronage more for <lb/>
the Government. We have all heard talk of a<lb/>
speech delivered lately in the Island of Prince <lb/>
Edward or in New Brunswick—I forget which—in <lb/>
which the speaker enumerated the advantages <lb/>
which had been flashed in the eyes of the delegates, <lb/>
while they were here, in the shape of appointments <lb/>
which were to be looked for, as those of judges <lb/>
in the Court of Appeals, of Speaker of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council, of local governorships, as one of <lb/>
the causes of the unanimity which prevailed <lb/>
among the members of the Conference. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            The honorable member must have a very
mean <lb/>
opinion of human nature, to suppose that pub<lb break="no"/>lic men, having such great interests entrusted <lb/>
to them, and their own and their country's <lb/>
honor to guard and to keep pure and unsullied <lb/>
in the eyes of the world, would agree to betray <lb/>
and deliver up their country for the love of a <lb/>
poor appointment, even if it were the post of <lb/>
lieutenant-governor or of chief justice. I am <lb/>
willing to believe that that insinuation was a <lb/>
slip of the tongue, and that he is already sorry <lb/>
that it ever escaped from his
lips. Another <lb/>
point on which the honorable member for <lb/>
Hochelaga enlarged, is the militia question and <lb/>
the defence of the country. On this head, <lb/>
the honorable member declares that he cannot <lb/>
understand how the union of the provinces is <lb/>
to increase our strength. The experience of <lb/>
the honorable member for Hochelaga and the <lb/>
teachings of history ought, however, to have <lb/>
taught him that a disunited people, scattered <lb/>
over a vast extent of territory, must be an <lb/>
easier conquest than one which is united under <lb/>
a single strong and respected government. <lb/>
This brings me to speak of another observation <lb/>
made by the honorable member, who declared <lb/>
that our best policy, in order to avoid all diffi<lb break="no"/>culty with our neighbors, and escape the evils <lb/>
of a war, would be to remain quiet and sit <lb/>
with our arms across. The House will permit <lb/>
me to quote the very expressions
of the honor<lb break="no"/>able member on this subject :— <lb/>
            
            <cb/> 
               
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">It would be a piece of folly for us to
raise a <lb/>
standing army, by way of keeping off an invasion <lb/>
of our frontier. Our best plan is to remain quiet, <lb/>
and to give no pretext to our neighbors for <lb/>
making war on us. Let a healthy state of public <lb/>
opinion be our shield ; let not the press violently <lb/>
assail the northern authorities ; then if war comes <lb/>
without any fault of ours, it will be our duty to do <lb/>
our best to assist the Mother
Country in the <lb/>
struggle which would ensue. <lb/></quote>
            </p>


            <p> I think, as the honorable member does,
that <lb/>
we ought not to give any just cause of dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction to our neighbors, and still less attack <lb/>
their frontier ; and the present Government <lb/>
have given proof, on all occasions, that they <lb/>
are disposed to respect the rights and opinions <lb/>
of the American people. But, on the other <lb/>
hand, the honorable member is the first to <lb/>
inform us that the best means of defending <lb/>
ourselves is, not to be ready and accustomed <lb/>
to the use of arms, but to remain unarmed, <lb/>
with our arms across like men of peace—in <lb/>
plain terms, to give ourselves up, bound hand <lb/>
and foot. Now, I will ask him a plain ques<lb break="no"/>tion. If he were apprehensive of an attack <lb/>
from a neighbor of his, would he go to him <lb/>
and say, " Here I am, do what you please with <lb/>
me," or would he not rather be prepared to <lb/>
meet an attack ? I rather think that the <lb/>
honorable member would not be long in making<lb/>
up his mind as to which course he would<lb/>
take. Now, that which is wise and politic
in <lb/>
an individual is equally wise and politic in <lb/>
the case of a nation. We are not desirous of <lb/>
assuming a threatening attitude towards our <lb/>
neighbors. On the contrary, our wish is to <lb/>
live with them in peace and quietness. We <lb/>
are anxious not to do the least act which can <lb/>
be construed into a threat ; but we should be <lb/>
lamentably blind if, with the enormous mili<lb break="no"/>tary armament of our neighbors before our <lb/>
eyes, we looked at this formidable military <lb/>
display with our arms across, and a careless <lb/>
disregard of its greatness in our hearts. Such <lb/>
an attitude would neither be patriotic nor <lb/>
worthy of a nation of free men. The most <lb/>
certain way to avoid an attack and subjugation <lb/>
by our neighbors, to have our independence <lb/>
and our privileges respected, is to shew them <lb/>
that we are prepared to defend them at any <lb/>
cost. The honorable member for Hochelaga <lb/>
has declared that he is prepared to make some <lb/>
sacrifices to defend the country, but he has <lb/>
not told us how much he is ready to do in <lb/>
that behalf. Perhaps he will let us know at <lb/>
a future time, if we are called upon to spend <lb/>
money for the purpose. However that may <lb/>
be, I must animadvert on the remarks which <lb/>
he has made with regard to the volunteers. <lb/>
            
            <pb n="376" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0376.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">376</fw>   
            Speaking of the expense which the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were incurring for the defence of the <lb/>
frontier, he said that 30,000 militiamen would <lb/>
cost thirty millions of dollars ! The honorable <lb/>
member has a singular way of calculating. <lb/>
The fact is, if we were under the necessity of <lb/>
raising an army of 30,000 men, we should not <lb/>
pay them at the rate of a dollar, nor even <lb/>
three-quarters of a dollar, a head. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Hochelaga knows as well <lb/>
as I do that the militia force now on foot and <lb/>
doing duty at the frontier, or in garrison in <lb/>
the interior, was called out in circumstances <lb/>
altogether exceptional, and that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were quite unable to control, to the <lb/>
extent they would perhaps have desired, the <lb/>
rate of pay which was to be allowed. The <lb/>
honorable member must likewise be aware <lb/>
that those brave militiamen gave the greatest <lb/>
proof of their love of country, and in many <lb/>
cases made very great sacrifices to the detri<lb break="no"/>ment of their own interest and that of their <lb/>
families. Many of them were employes in <lb/>
commercial houses, some in counting-houses, <lb/>
others in workshops, which gave them much <lb/>
higher remuneration than they are now re<lb break="no"/>ceiving from the Government, and I consider <lb/>
it very bad taste indeed that any should <lb/>
grudge them their paltry pay, under the pre<lb break="no"/>tence that it will be a heavy item on the <lb/>
budget. (Hear, hear.) They did not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate, when the country claimed their services, <lb/>
to risk their health and to give
up the comforts <lb/>
and delights of home, and I am well assured <lb/>
that the people will not grudge them the mis<lb break="no"/>erable half crown which they receive in ex<lb break="no"/>change, and will approve of what the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has done under the circumstances. The <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga reproaches <lb/>
the Government with another misdeed. <lb/>
The truth is that he finds something wrong, <lb/>
some short-coming, in every action of the<lb/>
present Administration. Accordingly, allud<lb break="no"/>ing to the right of veto permitted to the <lb/>
General Government, the honorable member <lb/>
expresses himself in this manner : " Thus, if <lb/>
a measure were passed by a majority of a <lb/>
local legislature, and if, nevertheless, the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the section of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment representing that particular province <lb/>
were opposed to it, would not that section use <lb/>
all their influence in the General Government <lb/>
to throw out that measure ?" Before answer<lb break="no"/>ing the honorable member, Mr. SPEAKER, I <lb/>
think it will be well to refer to the two clauses <lb/>
which relate to that matter. In these clauses <lb/>
we find :— <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> 1. Any bill of the General Parliament may
be <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            reserved in the usual manner for Her Majesty's <lb/>
assent, and any bill of the local legislatures may, <lb/>
in like manner, be reserved for the consideration <lb/>
of the Governor General. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> 2. Any bill passed by the General
Parliament <lb/>
shall be subject to disallowance by Her Majesty <lb/>
within two years, as in the case of bills passed<lb/>
by the legislatures of the said provinces hitherto ; <lb/>
and, in like manner, any bill
passed by a local <lb/>
legislature shall be subject to disallowance by the <lb/>
Governor General within one year after the pass<lb break="no"/>ing thereof. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Well, I ask the House, what is wrong in <lb/>
those two clauses ? At present, what is our <lb/>
position when a bill has passed the two Houses <lb/>
of our Legislature ? It is this : the bill is
<lb/>
submitted for the sanction of the Governor <lb/>
General, and in nearly all cases is sanctioned <lb/>
without being referred to the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. But if, for instance, the bill relates <lb/>
to a divorce, or to any question which con<lb break="no"/>cerns the Imperial Government, or if again <lb/>
it is a measure affecting our relations with
<lb/>
our neighbors or any other nation, it is then <lb/>
reserved for Her Majesty's sanction. When <lb/>
a measure is thus reserved, does the honorable <lb/>
member for Hochelaga suppose that the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the English Government meet to take <lb/>
it into consideration ? Not at all ; there is <lb/>
in the Colonial Office a second or a third class <lb/>
clerk whose particular business it is, and who <lb/>
makes his report to the minister. This report <lb/>
decides either the sanction or the disallowance <lb/>
of the measure in question. If the measure <lb/>
is highly interesting to the country and is <lb/>
disallowed, we cannot blame any one and must <lb/>
submit, as the English ministry are not res<lb break="no"/>ponsible to us. Under the Confederation
<lb/>
this danger and inconvenience will no longer <lb/>
exist. In a case wherein the Local Government <lb/>
of Lower Canada should pass a law which the <lb/>
Lieutenant-Governor might think fit to re<lb break="no"/>serve for the sanction of the Central Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, if the latter refused their sanction, al<lb break="no"/>though it was demanded by the people of the <lb/>
section, and there were no reason for this re<lb break="no"/>fusal, we should have our sixty-five members <lb/>
in the Central Parliament to protest against <lb/>
it, and who would unite and make combina<lb break="no"/>tions to turn out the ministry who should set <lb/>
in that manner. And you are not to say that
<lb/>
those sixty-five members would be powerless <lb/>
against the rest of the House. United in a <lb/>
compact phalanx, they would, without doubt, <lb/>
find support among the members of the other <lb/>
provinces, who would have every reason <lb/>
not to allow our rights and privileges to <lb/>
be infringed, lest they should one day ex<lb break="no"/>perience the same treatment themselves
in <lb/>
            
            <pb n="377" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0377.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">377</fw>
            regard to their own. On the other hand, <lb/>
Mr. SPEAKER, the disallowance of
a measure <lb/>
sanctioned by the local governments is limited <lb/>
as to time, and must be declared within twelve <lb/>
months, whereas, under the present system, <lb/>
it can be done within two years. This is a <lb/>
restriction which has been
granted in favor of <lb/>
Lower Canada and of all the other provinces <lb/>
of the Confederation ; it is a restriction fa<lb break="no"/>vorable to the people, but the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber will refuse, no doubt, to acknowledge that <lb/>
this concession to the people is our work. <lb/>
Moreover, why should we be afraid of this <lb/>
veto? In our Local Legislature we assuredly <lb/>
have no intention to be unjust towards a por<lb break="no"/>tion of the population, but propose to act <lb/>
towards them, as in times past, as towards <lb/>
equals ; we intend, in short, to be as just to <lb/>
that part of the population as we were when <lb/>
they were a feeble element in it. This has <lb/>
not prevented the honorable member for Ho<lb break="no"/>chelaga from telling the English members <lb/>
from Lower Canada that they must be on <lb/>
their guard and take care of themselves. <lb/>
Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I shall not offer such an <lb/>
insult to the race to which I belong. The <lb/>
French-Canadians have always acted honor<lb break="no"/>ably towards the other races who live among <lb/>
them, and they will certainly not take advan<lb break="no"/>tage now, any more than they have done in <lb/>
times past, of the majority they may have in <lb/>
the Local Legislature to molest or persecute the <lb/>
minority. This is the reason why we have <lb/>
no fear nor misgiving relative to the right of <lb/>
veto. Moreover, we are not to suppose that <lb/>
the intention of the two clauses which I have <lb/>
already quoted, is that every bill passed in the <lb/>
local legislatures will be reserved for the sanc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Central Government. That re<lb break="no"/>servation will take place only in respect of <lb/>
such measures as are now reserved for Her <lb/>
Majesty's sanction. So that the honorable <lb/>
member for Hochelaga is widely mistaken <lb/>
when he reproaches the present Government for <lb/>
having agreed to those two clauses. Another <lb/>
question on which the hon. member has also <lb/>
called us to account, relates to
the export <lb/>
duties on timber and coals. In clause 29, <lb/>
which relates to the powers of the Federal <lb/>
Parliament, the third section reads as follows : <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> The imposition or regulation of duties of
cus<lb break="no"/>toms on imports or exports,
except on exports <lb/>
of timber, logs, masts, spars, deals, and sawn <lb/>
lumber from New Brunswick, and of coal and <lb/>
other minerals from Nova Scotia. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> The fact that this power has been
conferred<lb/>
on the Government does not imply that it <lb/>
will be exercised. The power was granted <lb/>
            
            <cb/>  

            simply because it might be
necessary in certain <lb/>
cases mentioned. Now this is the reason for <lb/>
the second part of the clause which I have <lb/>just read to the House, and which I cannot <lb/>better explain than by citing some expressions <lb/>
of a speech by the Hon. the Minister of <lb/>
Finance on the subject. Nevertheless, as there <lb/>
are several honorable members in the House <lb/>
who do not understand English, I think it <lb/>
will perhaps be better to explain them in <lb/>
French. Here then was the thought of the <lb/>
Convention : as in New Brunswick the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had found that it was a great disad<lb break="no"/>vantage to collect the duties on timber ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the system formerly adopted, and <lb/>
they had substituted an export duty which <lb/>
superseded all other dues on that product, <lb/>
it was no more than right that this source of <lb/>
revenue should remain in New Brunswick, to <lb/>
which province it was an object of absolute <lb/>
necessity to defray its local expenses. In <lb/>
Canada we retain, under the new Constitution, <lb/>
our own method of collecting similar duties. <lb/>
As to New Brunswick, the duty on the article <lb/>
in question is their principal revenue, as coal <lb/>
is almost the sole revenue of Nova Scotia ; <lb/>
and if they had been deprived of them, they <lb/>
would have peremptorily refused to join the <lb/>
Confederation. (Hear, hear.)
Their demand <lb/>
was perfectly just, and could not therefore be <lb/>
refused. Moreover, we have no right to com<lb break="no"/>plain, for they leave us all our mines and our <lb/>
lands, and we shall now, as heretofore, collect <lb/>
the proceeds for our own use and profit. The <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga says that it <lb/>
will be impossible to administer the affairs of <lb/>
the local legislatures without having recourse <lb/>
to direct taxation ; but a man of his expe<lb break="no"/>rience ought not to have made that assertion. <lb/>
Instead of attempting to trade on popular <lb/>
prejudice, he ought to have admitted at once <lb/>
that the right granted by the new Constitution <lb/>
of levying direct taxes, is the same that <lb/>
already exists in the present Constitution ; <lb/>
it is the same right that all our municipalities <lb/>possess. It does not follow that the right will<lb/>
be
exercised. But the honorable member <lb/>
knows well that the people are not in favor <lb/>
of direct taxation, and that they would be <lb/>
unwilling to adopt it as a system, in place of <lb/>
indirect taxes ; hence his attempt to use it as <lb/>
a bug-bear in order to alarm the people of <lb/>
Lower Canada. We must bear in mind that <lb/>
the proceeds of the local revenue of Lower <lb/>
Canada will be employed in
defrayiug local <lb/>
expenses. The Hon. Minister of Finance has <lb/>
stated that in Lower Canada the local revenue <lb/>
will be $557,000, besides the 80
cents per <lb/>
            
            <pb n="378" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0378.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">378</fw>
            
            head of the population to be paid each
year, <lb/>
in half-yearly payments in advance, by the <lb/>
Federal Government. This subsidy will, <lb/>
therefore, amount to $888,000, making a total <lb/>
of $1,446,000 for the local requirements of <lb/>
Lower Canada. I am aware that the honor<lb break="no"/>able member has cast a doubt upon the <lb/>
accuracy of the figures set down by the Hon. <lb/>
Minister of Finance, and attempted to show <lb/>
that the local revenue would not be as large ; <lb/>
but the figures I shall give are taken from <lb/>
the Public Accounts, and I think it will be ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that they must be considered to be <lb/>
correct. At all events, here are the figures I <lb/>
have gathered from an examination of the <lb/>
official documents :— <lb/>

            <p> Now it is evident that these figures agree
<lb/>
with the calculations of the Honorable Fi<lb break="no"/>nance Minister, less a difference of $20,000 <lb/>
to $25,000. Lower Canada will have a reve<lb break="no"/>nue of nearly $1,500,000, and the excess of <lb/>
its revenue over expenditure, according to the <lb/>
calculations of the Honorable the Finance <lb/>
Minister, will be $209,000. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—Why do you deduct <lb/>
the revenue from the Municipal Loan Fund ? <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            Is it because Lower Canada is to be
charged <lb/>
with the payment of the Municipal Loan Fund <lb/>
debt ? <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LANG1"><persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName></persName>—I strike <lb/>
out the item of revenue from the com<lb break="no"/>mon school lands, because in the course of <lb/>
time the lands will become exhausted, and the <lb/>
revenue cannot be considered as permanent. <lb/>
Besides, the amount must be added to the <lb/>
Common School Fund, and cannot really be <lb/>
considered as an ordinary source of revenue. <lb/>
It is the same as regards the Municipal Loan <lb/>
Fund, which cannot be considered as per<lb break="no"/>manent revenue, and I wish to count only the <lb/>
ordinary items of revenue. But, on the other <lb/>
hand, it must be seen that many of the items <lb/>
of revenue will increase in course of
time, so <lb/>
that the surplus of revenue over expenditure <lb/>
in Lower Canada will always be considerable. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName> — The honorable <lb/>
member did not understand my question. I <lb/>
asked him whether Lower Canada will be <lb/>
compelled to pay the municipal
debt, and he <lb/>
has not answered. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LANG1"><persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName></persName>—I un<lb break="no"/>derstood the honorable gentleman perfectly <lb/>
well, but I make it a rule never to allow my<lb break="no"/>self to be turned aside by interruptions, and <lb/>
I shall not depart from that rule now. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) The figures I have given are highly <lb/>
important, for they demonstrate that Lower <lb/>
Canada will have a real revenue under the <lb/>
new Constitution—a revenue which is not <lb/>
calculated upon the probable increase and <lb/>
prosperity of the country, but upon the pre<lb break="no"/>sent revenue—of nearly $1,500,000, to meet <lb/>
local expenses. And yet, in the face
of these<lb/>
figures, which are based upon the most evi<lb break="no"/>dent facts, honorable members talk of
direct <lb/>
taxes. They simply want to frighten the <lb/>
country. But the people will see that there <lb/>
is no danger of direct taxation with the sur<lb break="no"/>plus revenue we shall have. Direct taxation <lb/>
must be resorted to if Lower Canada should <lb/>
give way to extravagance and
spend more <lb/>
than her means, but not otherwise. Lower <lb/>
Canada will have a revenue sufficient to meet <lb/>
all its expenses, unless it follow the example <lb/>of a person with an income of £400,

should expend £1,000. The total expenses <lb/>
of Lower Canada for all purposes, less the <lb/>
cost of legislation and the payment of interest <lb/>
on the local debt, will be $997,000,
calculating <lb/>
the expenditure upon the present basis. But <lb/>
it is evident that Lower Canada will reduce <lb/>
its expenditure, such for instance as the <lb/>
expenditure connected with the Crown Lands <lb/>
department, and that economy will be prac<lb break="no"/>

             tised in order, at a future period, to
meet the <lb/>
of local works, without rendering it <lb/>
necessary to defer other necessary items of <lb/>
expenditure. The expenses of the local le<lb break="no"/>gislation of Lower Canada may be set down <lb/>
at $150,000, and that is a reasonable estimate <lb/>
if we remember that all questions of general <lb/>
interest are to be discussed and regulated by <lb/>
the Federal Parliament, and that the local <lb/>
legislatures will only have to deal with ques<lb break="no"/>tions of local interest. It is clear that the <lb/>
sessions will be far shorter than they are at <lb/>
present, and far less expensive. Every one <lb/>
will admit that under the present system long <lb/>
discussions do not take place in
the House on <lb/>
private bills and measures of local interest, <lb/>
which are discussed in committees, but that <lb/>
such discussions occur on questions of a gen<lb break="no"/>eral interest, such as railways,
taxation, the <lb/>
tariff, Confederation, and that these are the <lb/>
discussions which prolong the session. I say, <lb/>
moreover, that the interest on the portion of <lb/>
the public debt to be assigned to us will be <lb/>
about $90,000, and that our total yearly ex<lb break="no"/>penditure will reach $1,237,000, leaving us a <lb/>
surplus revenue of $209,000. I
trust Lower <lb/>
Canada will have the prudence to set apart a <lb/>
large portion of the $209,000,
in order to <lb/>
carry out hereafter local works and improve<lb break="no"/>ments without being compelled to touch its <lb/>
yearly revenue. <lb/>

LANGEVIN</persName> — The <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga feigns great <lb/>
uneasiness as to the position of
Lower Canada <lb/>
in the Confederation, as well as to the matter <lb/>
of direct taxes. He spoke at great length as <lb/>
to the prosperous financial
position of Lower <lb/>
Canada when she entered the union in 1841 ; <lb/>
but we must remember that before the union <lb/>
the revenue of Lower Canada was
but $580,<lb break="no"/>000, and that, nevertheless, she was compelled <lb/>
to provide for all local expenses and many <lb/>
items of general expense which, under the <lb/>
Confederation,will fall within the domain of <lb/>
the Federal Government, such, for instance, <lb/>
as the payment of the salaries of the judges, <lb/>
etc. Under the Confederation Lower Canada <lb/>
will have a surplus of over $200,000 on its <lb/>
local expenditure, even though the present ex<lb break="no"/>penditure should not be reduced. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Hochelaga also said that <lb/>
the share of the debt apportioned to Lower <lb/>
Canada, apart from the general debt, would <lb/>
be $4,500,000. He must have made
serious <lb/>
errors in his calculations in order to arrive at <lb/>
such a result. The debt of the two Canadas <lb/>
at the present moment, deducting
the Sinking <lb/>
                        <cb/>
            Fund, is $67,263,000 ; comparing the
calcula<lb break="no"/>tion of the honorable member with that put <lb/>
forth by him in his address to his electors in <lb/>
1863, I find he has arrived at a perfectly differ<lb break="no"/>ent result, and he has no right to accuse others <lb/>
of being in error. Thus, in his address he <lb/>
states that apart from the then debt, $16,<lb break="no"/>000,000 would be required for the Interco<lb break="no"/>lonial Railway, and yet he now asserts that <lb/>
it would take twenty millions. <lb/>

honorable member should not trust to the cal<lb break="no"/>culations of the President of the Council, <lb/>
since he himself has stated that nothing good <lb/>
can come from this side of the House. But <lb/>
the fact is the honorable member was anxious <lb/>
not to frighten the people at that time, and <lb/>
therefore it was that he spoke of sixteen mil<lb break="no"/>lions, whereas now he speaks of twenty. <lb/>
With regard to the amount of the public <lb/>
debt, the Hon. Minister of Finance has given <lb/>
us figures taken from the most reliable sources, <lb/>
and I prefer adopting his figures to following <lb/>
those of the honorable member for Hochelaga. <lb/>
The Hon. Minister of Finance told us that <lb/>
the total debt of the two Canadas, without <lb/>
counting the Sinking Fund, was $67,263,000, <lb/>
and that the Federal Government would un<lb break="no"/>dertake $62,500,000. There will therefore <lb/>
remain about $4,763,000 to be divided be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada, and if Lower <lb/>
Canada takes for its share $4,500,000 as the <lb/>
honorable member stated, there will only re<lb break="no"/>main about $263,000 for Upper Canada ! I <lb/>
do not see how the honorable gentleman has <lb/>
managed to arrive at such a result, for it is <lb/>
clearly erroneous. <lb/>

—It is evident that the honorable member for <lb/>
Hochelaga, in his calculation of the apportion<lb break="no"/>ment of the residue of the debt between Upper <lb/>
and Lower Canada, has put a 4 in place of a <lb/>
1 or 2, in the same way that he put 20 in <lb/>
place of 16 in the matter of the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway. In his anxiety to find fault he sees <lb/>
double, and instead of seeing five millions to <lb/>
be divided, he sees nine. The
debt devolving <lb/>
upon Lower Canada will not be $4,500,000.
<lb/>
Lower Canada will have only its just share of <lb/>
the five millions to be divided. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOLICITOR GENERAL LANGEVIN</persName> <lb/>
—The Minister of Finance stated the whole <lb/>
debt, in his speech at Sherbrooke, at $67,<lb break="no"/>263,994. The amount of the debt is $75,<lb break="no"/>578,000 ; but it is necessary to deduct the <lb/>
Sinking Fund and cash in bank, $7,132,068, <lb/>
reducing it to $68,445,953 ; the
Minister of <lb/>
Finance also deducted the Common School <lb/>
Fund, which amounts to $1,181,958,
and he <lb/>
arrived at the result I have just given, that is <lb/>
to say, that the real debt of Canada is $67,<lb break="no"/>263,994. I do not give all the items of the <lb/>
public debt, for I do not think it devolves <lb/>
upon me to prove that the calculations of the <lb/>
Finance Minister are not correct ; that is the <lb/>
task of those who accuse him of error ; and <lb/>
the Public Accounts are there to shew that <lb/>
the Finance Minister has stated nothing but <lb/>
the truth. The honorable member for Ho<lb break="no"/>chelaga has manifested excessive anxiety re<lb break="no"/>specting the financial position of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration ; but in this case also we have the <lb/>
same guarantees as for that of
the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments. He asserted, for instance, that <lb/>
Newfoundland was too poor to contribute to <lb/>
the revenue of the Confederation, and that, in <lb/>
place of receiving anything from that province, <lb/>
we shall be compelled to send down money to <lb/>
prevent the people of the island from perish<lb break="no"/>ing by cold. The honorable gentleman is, <lb/>
nevertheless, well aware that Newfoundland <lb/>
has a large revenue, a revenue of $480,000,
<lb/>
and that its expenses are less than its income. <lb/>
Newfoundland will receive its share from the <lb/>
Federal chest, but it will also contribute to the <lb/>
general revenue. While I am considering this <lb/>
portion of the honorable gentleman's speech, <lb/>
I must admit that it is the strongest argument <lb/>
in behalf of Confederation, from the stand<lb break="no"/>point of the Lower Provinces, that could be<lb/>
brought forward ; and, for my part, I desire <lb/>
to see thousands of copies of
his speech sent <lb/>
to those provinces, for his object clearly is to <lb/>
shew that the measure would be entirely to <lb/>
their advantage. He has attempted to shew <lb/>
that they will have a larger revenue than they <lb/>
have at present ; but be omitted to state that <lb/>
Lower Canada would have $200,000 over and <lb/>
above her expenses. He knows perfectly well <lb/>
that the total revenue of the
provinces forms a <lb/>
sum of $14,223,320, for 1864, and that the <lb/>
total expenditure amounted only to $13,350,<lb break="no"/>832, so that there is a surplus of $872,488, <lb/>
apart from the revenue from increase of im<lb break="no"/>
               
            <cb/>
             ports in 1864. The financial position is there<lb break="no"/>fore highly favorable for the formation of a<lb/>
Confederation. The honorable member for <lb/>
Hochelaga stated that New Brunswick would<lb/>
have a surplus of $34,000 over its
expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, and he complains, upon that ground, of <lb/>
the subsidy of $63,000 it is
proposed to pay <lb/>
that province during ten years. But every <lb/>
one is aware that the subsidy is
to be paid <lb/>
because that province gives up all its revenues <lb/>
to the Federal Government, except that derived <lb/>
from its export duty on timber ; that was the <lb/>
reason its delegates insisted on
the payment <lb/>
of the subsidy during ten years, and they <lb/>
were right. The honorable member also <lb/>
stated that Prince Edward Island was to <lb/>
receive $48,000 more than its expenses. But <lb/>
how comes it then that Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land has hitherto exhibited reluctance ? It <lb/>
must be that that province takes a different  <lb/>
view from the honorable member. The <lb/>
truth, however, is that Prince Edward <lb/>
Island, like the other provinces, was treated <lb/>
with justice and equity by the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference, that its local requirements were con<lb break="no"/>sidered, and that a suflicient revenue to pro<lb break="no"/>vide for them was awarded to it. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Hochelaga, who spoke in <lb/>
English, took that opportunity to make a <lb/>
violent appeal to the members from Upper <lb/>
Canada, and told them that there would be <lb/>
enormous imposts, and that two-thirds of the <lb/>
revenue and of the taxes would be paid by <lb/>
them. He did well to speak in English, for <lb/>
I am certain that he would not make the <lb/>
same assertion in French in the
presence of <lb/>
the members from Lower Canada ; he would <lb/>
make no appeal of that nature, and I regret <lb/>
it, for that would give us the best of reasons <lb/>
for entering into the Confederation ; but I <lb/>
must acknowledge that that statement of the <lb/>
honorable member is not exactly correct, for <lb/>
the basis of the Confederation is justice to <lb/>
all. The honorable member for Hochelaga <lb/>
also said, in order to produce an effect upon <lb/>
the members from Upper Canada, that the <lb/>
extension of the Confederation westward was <lb/>
a farce, " an absurd affair," because the
wes<lb break="no"/>tern provinces do not even think of it, and <lb/>
because we have no communication with that <lb/>
territory. <lb/>

            advantage to unite themselves with the
pro<lb break="no"/>vinces for all general business, reserving to <lb/>
themselves the management of their local af<lb break="no"/>fairs. I quote as follows from one of the <lb/>
journals in question :— <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> Whatever may be the result of the present
at<lb break="no"/>tempts to form a Confederation
of the North <lb/>
American Colonies, we may be certain of one <lb/>
thing, and that is, that but few years will pass <lb/>
away before the accomplishment of a plan of this <lb/>
nature. Half a dozen provinces lying adjacent <lb/>
to each other, and subject to one and the same <lb/>
power, having different tariffs, exhibit a state of <lb/>
affairs which, from its very nature, cannot con<lb break="no"/>tinue long. However, setting aside this ano<lb break="no"/>maly, we find North American Colonies for which <lb/>
a more vast political career must be provided. <lb/>
The people have too long labored under the <lb/>
weight of disabilities which, by
wounding their<lb/>
pride, have placed them in a humiliating position<lb/>
before the eyes of the whole world. With all the <lb/>
advantages of responsible government granted <lb/>
to him by the Imperial authorities, after years <lb/>
of strife and trials, the colonist hardly possesses<lb/>
one half the national privileges enjoyed by an <lb/>
Englishman. He is deprived of his share of<lb/>
patronage even in cases in which he is entitled to <lb/>
it and is eminently worthy of it. The position of <lb/>
Colonial Governor is seldom or never granted to <lb/>
him, and in many parts of Her Majesty 's <lb/>
dominions he is forbidden to practise his profes<lb break="no"/>sion in the courts of justice. We therefore hail <lb/>
this initiative taken by the Canadian
Government <lb/>
as the commencement of the regeneration of the <lb/>
colonists, who have hitherto remained in pupilage. <lb/>
With a confederation of colonies extending from <lb/>
one ocean to the other, what limits shall we <lb/>
assign to our greatness, our
material progress <lb/>
and our political aspirations ? Instead of seeing <lb/>
the talent of our statesmen fettered, harassed
and <lb/>
restrained within the narrow
limits of local poli<lb break="no"/>tics, we shall find its scope extended to a whole <lb/>
continent, while a more vast and natural field <lb/>
will be thrown open to the active and enterprising <lb/>
spirit of the North American Provinces. Want <lb/>
of space prevents our entering upon this question <lb/>
at greater lenth to-day ; but we hope that the <lb/>
movement will succeed and will
allow us at no <lb/>
distant day to emerge from the isolated and feeble<lb/>
position in which we now are, to become a part<lb/>
of the great British North American Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. <lb/>
            </p></quote>
            <p> That is the language of one of the news<lb break="no"/>papers of those colonies. What has the <lb/>
hon. member to say to it ? I hope I shall <lb/>
be forgiven for reading some
more extracts <lb/>
from these journals, which we do not read <lb/>
here as much as we ought to do, although <lb/>
they are of a nature to give us
information <lb/>
respecting that part of British North <lb/>
America. Another paper says :— <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> There is then but one course left for the
Eng<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
             lish colonies, and more especially the North <lb/>
American and Australian colonies. Before ten <lb/>
years have passed over our heads, the population <lb/>
of the colonies comprised between Vancouver's <lb/>
Island and Newfoundland will be
hardly less than <lb/>
six millions of souls, occupying a territory as <lb/>
large as that of the United States before the civil <lb/>
war, and in extent greater than three-fourths of <lb/>
the continent of Europe. With telegraphic com<lb break="no"/>munication and railways from one ocean to the <lb/>
other, with a Federal union, in which will be <lb/>
combined and concentrated all the talent of the <lb/>
colonies, and the object of which will be to re<lb break="no"/>present the various interests of those colonies, <lb/>
what country has before it a more splendid future <lb/>
than this immense Confederation, with its in<lb break="no"/>numerable and inexhaustible resources ? <lb/>

            <p> I shall not occupy any further time in <lb/>
quoting from these journals, but
I wished to<lb/>
demonstrate that the plan of Confederation
<lb/>
is not only a plan of political men in <lb/>
their extremity, as was said by the hon. <lb/>
member for Hochelaga, but that the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces give in their adherence to it, because <lb/>
they perceive that it will be advantageous to <lb/>
them. As to the facilities for communication, <lb/>
I shall quote an excellent authority—Pro<lb break="no"/>fessor HIND—to show that they are not so <lb/>
limited as the hon. member declares them to <lb/>
be. The following is from an essay by Pro<lb break="no"/>fessor HIND on the subject of the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territory : —
</p>


            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> The Canadian emigrant party assembled at
Fort <lb/>
Garry, in June, 1862, travelling thither by Detroit, <lb/>
La Crosse, St. Paul, and Fort Abercrombie, by <lb/>
rail, stage and steamer. At Fort Garry they <lb/>
separated into two parties ; the first division con<lb break="no"/>tained about one hundred emigrants, the second <lb/>
division, sixty-five persons. The first party took <lb/>
the northern route, by Carlton to Edmonton ; the <lb/>
second, the southern trail. At Edmonton they all <lb/>
changed their carts for horses and oxen, and <lb/>
went thence in a straight line to the Leather Pass <lb/>
(lat. 54° ), through which they took 130 oxen, <lb/>
and about 70 horses. They suddenly found them<lb break="no"/>selves on the head waters of the Fraser river, and <lb/>
so gentle was the ascent that the only means they<lb/>
had of knowing that they had passed the dividing <lb/>
ridge of the Rocky Mountains was by
unex<lb break="no"/>pectedly observing the waters of the rivers flow<lb break="no"/>ing to the westward. When in the mountains they <lb/>
killed a few oxen for provisions ; others were sold <lb/>
to the Indians at Tête Jaune Cache, on the Fraser <lb/>
river, and others were rafted down the Fraser to <lb/>
the forks of the Quesnelle.
At Tête Jaune Cache <lb/>
a portion of the party separated from the rest, <lb/>
and, with fourteen horses, went across the country <lb/>
by an old well-worn trail, to Thompson's river, <lb/>
and thus succeeded in taking their horses from <lb/>
Fort Garry through the Rocky Mountains— <lb/>
through a supposed impassable part of British <lb/>
Columbia—to the wintering station on Thomp<lb break="no"/>

             son's river for the pack animals of the
British <lb/>
Columbia gold-seekers. With this party of more <lb/>
than 150 people were a woman and three <lb/>
little children. The little children were well <lb/>
cared for, for the emigrants took a cow with <lb/>
them, and these infant travellers
were supplied <lb/>
with milk all the way on their long journey to the <lb/>
Leather Pass in the Rocky Mountains. I look <lb/>
upon the successful journey of the Canadian emi<lb break="no"/>grants in 1862, across the continent, as an event <lb/>
in the history of Central British America of unex<lb break="no"/>ampled importance. It cannot fail to open the <lb/>
eyes of all thinking men to the singular natural <lb/>
features of the country which formed the scene of <lb/>
this remarkable journey. Probably there is no <lb/>
other continuous stretch of country in the world, <lb/>
exceeding 1,000 miles in length, and wholly in a <lb/>
state of nature, which it would be possible for 100 <lb/>
people, including a woman and three children, to <lb/>
traverse during a single short season, and success<lb break="no"/>fully, and indeed easily overcome such apparent<lb break="no"/>ly formidable obstacles as the Rocky Mountains <lb/>
have been supposed to present. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> On a review of what is now known of
Central <lb/>
British America, the following facts cannot fail <lb/>
to arrest the attention and occupy the thoughts <lb/>
of those who think it worth while to consider its <lb/>
future, and its possible relation to ourselves during <lb/>
the next and succeeding generations. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> We find in the great basin of Lake
Winnipeg <lb/>
an area of cultivable land equal to three times <lb/>
the area of this province, and equal to the avail<lb break="no"/>able land for agricultural settlement in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Canada. It is watered by great lakes, as <lb/>
large as Lake Ontario ; and by a vast river, which <lb/>
in summer is navigable to within sight of the <lb/>
Rocky Mountains. It contains inexhaustible sup<lb break="no"/>plies of iron, lignite, coal, salt, and much gold. <lb/>
It has a seaport within 350 miles, via the Nelson <lb/>
River, of Hudson Bay, which is accessible for three <lb/>
months in the year for steamers. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> This great basin contains the only area
left on <lb/>
the American continent where a new nation can <lb/>
spring into existence. <lb/>
            </p></quote>
            <p> This is a complete refutation of the
statement <lb/>
made by the hon. member for Hochelaga, <lb/>
that communication with those colonies is <lb/>
impossible. In a part of the lecture from <lb/>
which I have just quoted, Professor HIND <lb/>
says that, between Lake Superior and the <lb/>
Lake of the Woods, the distance is only about <lb/>
200 miles, and when once that is got over, <lb/>
an immense valley more than a thousand <lb/>
miles in length is attained—a magnificent <lb/>
valley, which may form part of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy and provide an outlet for our popula<lb break="no"/>tion. The hon. member for Hochelaga also <lb/>
told us, that if we accepted Confederation <lb/>
we should subsequently be drawn into a <lb/>
legislative union ; but he well knows that <lb/>
by the Constitution which is submitted <lb/>
to this House, the question of a
Federal <lb/>
union only is mooted. If at a subsequent <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            period our 
descendants should choose to <lb/>
have a legislative union, that will ; be their <lb/>
affair and not ours ; if they do choose to <lb/>
have it, it will be because they will
then be <lb/>
strong enough to have nothing to fear. <lb/>
Further, without entering into all the details <lb/>
relating to the position, as to
religion, of <lb/>
Lower Canada in the Confederation, I must <lb/>
call attention to the fact that the total popu<lb break="no"/>lation of all the provinces, in 1861, was <lb/>
3,300,000 souls, and of these the total num<lb break="no"/>ber of Catholics amounted to 1,494,000. <lb/>
Thus they will be numerous enough to <lb/>
protect their religious and other interests ; <lb/>
and those interests will be in a position of <lb/>
safety in the local legislatures. We do not <lb/>
seek to be allowed privileges which others <lb/>
have not ; we only wish that our rights may <lb/>
be respected as we respect those of others. <lb/>
French-Canadians are not, have never been, <lb/>
and will not become persecutors either in <lb/>
political or religious matters
under the Con<lb break="no"/>federation. I appeal to men belonging to <lb/>
other religions to say whether we have ever <lb/>
proved unjust or persecutors to
them. That <lb/>
part of the population of Lower Canada <lb/>
which is of foreign origin will have nothing <lb/>
to fear under the Local Government, any <lb/>
more than we shall have anything to fear <lb/>
under the Federal Government. But in <lb/>
consideration of what has been said by the <lb/>
honorable members for Hochelaga and Lot<lb break="no"/>biuière, and of the mistrust which they have <lb/>
endeavored to create in the minds of the <lb/>
French-Canadian and Catholic population of <lb/>
Lower Canada, I think the House will allow <lb/>
me to read an extract from a letter written
<lb/>
by His Grace the Archbishop of Halifax, <lb/>
who is likely to understand the interests of <lb/>
the Catholic population quite as well as the <lb/>
two honorable members in question. This <lb/>
is the reply which he makes to those who <lb/>
pretended that we had reason to fear inva<lb break="no"/>sion of the country by the Fenians : —

           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> <p> If there be fifty thousand men already
pre<lb break="no"/>pared to invade this country, as you admit, instead <lb/>
of laboring to keep us in our present disjointed <lb/>
and defenceless position, you should rather call <lb/>
on all to unite where a single man cannot be <lb/>
dispensed with, and gird on our armor for the <lb/>
rencontre. If responsible government, which the <lb/>
great and good men of this country won for us, be <lb/>
a precious heirloom on the lilliputian scale on <lb/>
which we now find it, instead of bartering it away <lb/>
for nothing by Confederation, as you say, we shall <lb/>
rather, in my opinion, add to its lustre and value, <lb/>
and ennoble and enrich it, and make it bound<lb break="no"/>lessly grander and more secure for ourselves and <lb/>
those who are to come after us. We obtained <lb/>

            responsible government from the Mother Country, <lb/>
in whose legislative halls we had not a single <lb/>
member to represent us. We are now, on the <lb/>
contrary, asking to transfer the rich and prized <lb/>
deposit to a place which will be a part only of our <lb/>
common country, where our voice must be heard, <lb/>
and where we will have a fuller and fairer repre<lb break="no"/>sentation than the city of London or Liverpool, <lb/>
or Bristol, can boast of in their English House of <lb/>
Commons ; and this is the great difference between <lb/>
obtaining from England what we had not, and <lb/>
transferring what we now have, in order to make <lb/>
it more valuable and more available for our own <lb/>
purposes, and by far more secure. Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, therefore, instead of depriving us of the <lb/>
privileges of self-government, is the only practical <lb/>
and reliable guarantee for its continuance. We <lb/>
are too small to be warranted in the hope of being <lb/>
able to hold it always on the strength of our own <lb/>
resources ; and England, if not too weak, is cer<lb break="no"/>tainly too prudent and too cautious to risk her <lb/>
last shilling and her last man in a country where, <lb/>
instead of a population of four millions, she will <lb/>
have scarcely one-tenth of that number to help her <lb/>
against the united power of a whole continent. <lb/>
To deny, therefore, the obvious advantages of <lb/>
Confederation, you must first
prove that union is <lb/>
not strength — at England under
the heptarchy, <lb/>
and France under the feudal
chief and barons, <lb/>
were greater and stronger and happier than they <lb/>
now are as the two greatest nations of the <lb/>
world. <lb/>

            <p> Here, again, is what he says in answer to
<lb/>
those who will have nothing to do with <lb/>

nothing to fear from our neighbors :— <lb/>

            <p> All
that is said of the magnanimity and for<lb break="no"/>bearance of mighty nations, can
be explained on <lb/>
the principle of sheer expediency, as the world <lb/>
knows. The whole face of Europe has been <lb/>
changed, and the dynasties of many hundred years <lb/>
have been swept away within our own time, on <lb/>
the principle of might alone—the oldest,
the <lb/>
strongest, and, as some would have it, the most <lb/>
sacred of all titles. The thirteen states of <lb/>
America, with all their professions of self-denial, <lb/>
have been all the time, by money-power, and by <lb/>
war, and by negotiation extending their frontier, <lb/>
until they more than quadrupled their territory <lb/>
within sixty years ; and believe it who may, are <lb/>
they now, of their own accord, to come to a full <lb/>
stop? No ; as long as they have
the power they <lb/>
must go onward, or it is the very nature of <lb/>
power to grip whatever is within its reach. It is <lb/>
not their hostile feelings, therefore, but it is <lb/>
their power, and only their power I dread. <lb/>

            </p>


            <p> MY DEAR
SIR,—In reply to your communication <lb/>
of this date, I beg to state that I took no notes of <lb/>
the observations I made at the last examination <lb/>
of the youth of St. Bonaventure's College. I <lb/>
distinctly remember, however, that among other <lb/>
arguments I used to impress on parents and <lb/>
scholars the necessity of education, one was, that <lb/>
according to the tendency of the age, a union of all <lb/>
the British North American Provinces would take <lb/>
place, if not immediately, by the force of circum<lb break="no"/>stances in a few years ; and that such a union <lb/>
would have an extraordinary influence on the <lb/>
rising generation in Newfoundland. People were <lb/>
in the habit of saying that education of a high <lb/>
class was useless in this country, as the field was <lb/>
too limited. I repudiated that idea altogether. <lb/>
Newfoundlanders were not confined to this island, <lb/>
the British Empire and the States were open to <lb/>
them. Wherever the English language was <lb/>
spoken, there was an opening for an educated<lb/>
Newfoundlander. But independently of that,
the <lb/>
Confederation of the Provinces would open up a <lb/>
home-market for education and talent—a market <lb/>
increasing every year, and of which at present we <lb/>
can form no conception. The bar, for example, <lb/>
would be open to all ; the Central Legislature <lb/>
would open up a great field for political ability ; <lb/>
the highest offices of the law and the government <lb/>
would be open to Newfoundlanders as well as to <lb/>
Canadians or Nova Scotians ; and I hope that they <lb/>
would be found perfectly qualified by education to <lb/>
take their places, side by side, with their fellow<lb break="no"/>confederates, and compete for the prizes the <lb/>
Confederation would hold out to them, on terms <lb/>
of perfect equality. I sincerely believe that they <lb/>
could do so, as, from my experience, I considered <lb/>
that the youth of this country have as fine talents, <lb/>
            
            <pb n="384" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0384.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">384</fw>
            
            and as
great an adaptability for learning, as I have <lb/>
seen in any part of the world ; and that I never <lb/>
saw, in any part of Europe, boys acquitting them<lb break="no"/>selves better (and in many cases not so well) than <lb/>
they did at the preparatory
examinations and the <lb/>
present exhibition. This, so far as I recollect, <lb/>
was the substance of the remarks I made on the <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">fact</hi>, immediate or
prospective, of the Provincial <lb/>
Confederation. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Thus, whilst some honorable members seek <lb/>
to alarm Lower Canada by asserting that our <lb/>
religion and our nationality are in danger, <lb/>
here we have an Archbishop and a Bishop <lb/>
declaring themselves strongly in favor of <lb/>
Confederation, and who do not see in it any <lb/>
danger for their flocks. And it is well <lb/>
known, even here, that the whole of the <lb/>
estimable and most respected body of the <lb/>
clergy, from those of the highest rank down to <lb/>
the very humblest of their followers, are in <lb/>
favor of Confederation. But the honorable <lb/>
member for Hochelaga, for the purpose of <lb/>
frightening Lower Canada, has told us that <lb/>
we should very soon have a legislative union, <lb/>
and that in that case the fifty French- <lb break="yes"/>
Canadian members from Lower Canada <lb/>
would coalesce with the minority of the <lb/>
Federal Parliament, with the view of <lb/>
obstructing the working of the Government. <lb/>
Well, what better proof could we have that <lb/>
we have nothing to fear, and that we shall <lb/>
not be exposed to danger under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ? History is before us to prove that <lb/>
there will always be an opposition, and <lb/>
that if an attempt is made to oppress <lb/>
any one section of the Confederation, <lb/>
its representatives would unite in a body <lb/>
with the minority, and having thereby con<lb break="no"/>stituted a majority, would prevent any injus<lb break="no"/>tice on the part of the Federal Government. <lb/>
I beg to thank the hon. member for having, <lb/>
against his will, furnished me with so strong <lb/>
an argument in favor of Confederation. The <lb/>
hon. member then appealed to the national <lb/>
passions and the prejudices of race. He told <lb/>
us that the Protestant minority in Lower <lb/>
Canada would have to seek protection <lb/>
against the majority of that section. I re<lb break="no"/>peat it, he made that assertion in English, <lb/>
and would not repeat it in French. But <lb/>
what treatment did the minority receive in <lb/>
Lower Canada when she had a separate Par<lb break="no"/>liament? Did not the French-Canadian <lb/>
majority always exercise liberality towards <lb/>
our fellow-countrymen whose origin and re<lb break="no"/>ligion was different from ours ? Thank <lb/>
God, our race is not a persecuting race ; it <lb/>
has ever been liberal and tolerant. The hon. <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            member for Lotbinière (Mr. JOLY) has
also <lb/>
appealed to the religious and national preju<lb break="no"/>dices of the English minority of Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, but he ought to remember that there <lb/>
is no more danger for the English race in <lb/>
Lower Canada than for any other, and that <lb/>
he was the very last member of the House <lb/>
who ought to appeal to religious or national <lb/>
prejudices. <lb/>

then that the hon. member for Lotbinière <lb/>
has appealed to the passions, seeking to have <lb/>
it believed on the one hand that French Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian nationality and the Catholic religion <lb/>
would be endangered by
Confederation, and <lb/>
on the other hand that English nationality <lb/>
and the Protestant religion would be exposed <lb/>
to danger in Lower Canada under the local <lb/>
government. He cited in the English lan<lb break="no"/>guage the report of Lord DURHAM, to induce <lb/>
the belief that the English of Lower Canada <lb/>
would never consent to submit to a legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, the majority of which would be French- <lb break="yes"/>Canadian ; but for my part I am not of that <lb/>
opinion, and I think that they will submit <lb/>
to it, because they are sure that they will <lb/>
be treated with justice. It ill became <lb/>

that hon. gentleman to make this statement, <lb/>

when he is himself elected for a county ex<lb break="no"/>clusively Catholic, which has not hesitated <lb/>

to entrust him with its interests. He ought <lb/>

not to have made this appeal, as he himself <lb/>

is a living proof of the religious tolerance <lb/>

and liberality of our compatriots. Neither <lb/>

did it become the hon. member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga to speak as he did to the same effect, <lb/>

when we have seen a large and important <lb/>

electoral division—the division of Lauren<lb break="no"/>tides—reject a venerable gentleman who <lb/>

presented himself for reelection to the<lb/>

Legislative Council, a man who had been in <lb/>

political life for more than twenty-five years, <lb/>

to elect in his place an English Protestant, <lb/>

Mr. PRICE, although there were not 1,500 <lb/>

Protestants in the whole division, out of a <lb/>

population of 50,000 souls. The election of <lb/>

the member for the county of Megantic (Mr. <lb/>

IRVINE) is yet another evidence
of the <lb/>

liberality of our fellow-countrymen, the <lb/>

majority of the residents in that county <lb/>

being French-Canadians and Catholics. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI3">MR. J. B. E. DORION</persName>—It
was not they <lb/>
who sent him here. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—On the <lb/>
contrary, but for their votes he would not <lb/>
have been returned to Parliament for that <lb/>
county. I may further say, Mr. SPEAKER, <lb/>
that the presence here of the hon. member <lb/>
for Shefford (Hon. Mr. HUNTINGTON), that  <lb/>
            
            <cb/> 

            of the member for Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
HOLTON), and the presence of several other <lb/>
members afford abundant proof of the <lb/>
liberality of our fellow-countrymen, because <lb/>
those honorable members, although English <lb/>
and Protestant, represent counties the great <lb/>
majority of the population in each of which <lb/>
is French-Canadian and Catholic. The <lb/>
English have always been dealt with more <lb/>
liberally than the hon. member for Hochelaga <lb/>
himself would, perhaps, treat us were he in <lb/>
power. We did not require the aid of the<lb/>
hon. members for Hochelaga and Lotbinière <lb/>
for the protection of the minorities in the <lb/>
Conference. We were the first to demand <lb/>
that justice should be extended to the <lb/>
Catholics of Upper Canada and the Protest<lb break="no"/>ants of Lower Canada, because we desired <lb/>
to establish a solid work, and not to build <lb/>
on the sand an edifice which would crumble <lb/>
to dust the next day. The English
of Lower <lb/>
Canada will not be excited by the appeals <lb/>
of the hon. members, because they know <lb/>
that whatever they can justly
claim will be <lb/>
conceded to them without difficulty and <lb/>
with all good will. Mr. SPEAKER, although <lb/>
it is with great regret that I have to ask the <lb/>
continued attention of the House, at this late <lb/>
period of the evening, yet such is the great<lb/>
importance of the question before us, that I <lb/>
venture to hope that the House will pardon <lb/>
me for presenting at such length my views <lb/>
on this matter. I may be permitted, I hope, <lb/>
to refute another assertion made by the <lb/>
honorable member for Hochelaga. That <lb/>
honorable member, who has found something <lb/>
to censure in every article of the scheme of <lb/>
Confederation, conceived that he produced <lb/>
an argument that would be
irresistible by <lb/>
asserting that the distribution of the debt <lb/>
was unfair and burdensome to Lower Canada. <lb/>
To give a greater force to this argument, <lb/>
he stated that Lower Canada entered into the <lb/>
union with a debt of $400,000, and that <lb/>
she would leave it with a burden of $30,000,<lb break="no"/>000, after having only expended in the <lb/>
interval the sum of $12,000,000
for public <lb/>
works within her limits. This argument is <lb/>
most specious. Supposing that our debt was <lb/>
$400,000, and that to-day it is
$30,000,000, <lb/>
the honorable member must at all events <lb/>
admit that the circumstances also have very <lb/>
much changed. At the time of the union <lb/>
our population was only 630,000, and to-day
<lb/>
it is 1,250,000. The honorable member, <lb/>
too, must not forget that at the time of the <lb/>
union our territory only produced 21,000,000 <lb/>
            
            <pb n="386" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0386.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">386</fw>  
            
            bushels of grain, whilst to-day it produces <lb/>
more than 50,000,000 bushels. At the time <lb/>
of the union we had only 1,298 schools, and <lb/>
to-day we have 3,600. At the time of the <lb/>
union these schools were attended only by <lb/>
39,000 children, whilst to-day they are <lb/>
attended by more than 200,000. At the <lb/>
union the exportations from the ports of <lb/>
Quebec and Montreal amounted to $9,000,<lb break="no"/>000 ; to-day they exceed $18,000,000.
At <lb/>
the union the number of vessels
built <lb/>
annually in our shipyards was 48 only ; now <lb/>
we have 88, and the tonnage is quadrupled. <lb/>
At the time of the union our importations <lb/>
amounted to $10,000,000, and to-day they <lb/>
reach $45,000,000. At the time of the <lb/>
union our exportations and importations <lb/>
amounted to $16,000,000 ; to-day they reach <lb/>
the enormous sum of $87,000,000. And <lb/>
it is with such figures as these before us <lb/>
that we are to be told that we are leaving <lb/>
the union with a debt of $30,000,000 ! At <lb/>
the time of the union the revenue arising <lb/>
from the tax on bank-notes, which affords a <lb/>
fair indication of the extent of business <lb/>
done, amounted to $2 200 ; to-day
it amounts <lb/>
to $15,800. At the time of the union <lb/>
the number of merchantmen arriving in <lb/>
Quebec every year was 1,000 ; now it <lb/>
is 1,660, and the number of vessels ar<lb break="no"/>riving at all the ports in Lower Canada <lb/>
is 2,463. At the time of the union the <lb/>
tonnage of these vessels was
295,000 tons, <lb/>
and now in the port of Quebec it is 897,000
<lb/>
tons, and for the whole of Lower Canada <lb/>
1,041,000 tons. At the time of the union <lb/>
25,000 sailors arrived heve annually ; now we <lb/>
have 35,000. In 1839 the revenue
of <lb/>
Lower Canada was $588 000 ; when
we <lb/>
enter the Confederacy, although we are not <lb/>
called upon to pay any of the expenditure <lb/>
for general purposes, our
revenue will be <lb/>
$1,446,000, that is to say that
we shall have, <lb/>
under the Confederation, a revenue three <lb/>
times as large as it was at the time of the <lb/>
union ; and instead of having, as we then <lb/>
had, an excess of expenditure
amounting to <lb/>
about $80,000, the total expenditure of <lb/>
Lower Canada, under the
Confederation, will <lb/>
be about $1,200,000, leaving a surplus of <lb/>
more than $200,000! If then our debt has <lb/>
increased we have made most rapid pro<lb break="no"/>gress, and we have received the full value <lb/>
for our money. Nor must it be forgotten
<lb/>
that at the time of the union of Upper and <lb/>
Lower Canada the country had not a single <lb/>
railway, and now it is traversed
from end to <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            end by
one of the finest railways on this <lb/>
continent ; and are long, let us hope in <lb/>
the interest of our commerce and our <lb/>
safety, that this iron band will connect the <lb/>
extreme west with the Atlantic ocean. <lb/>(Hear, hear.) We entered the union when <lb/>
the Welland canal had hardly been begun ; <lb/>
we leave it with one of the most magnificent <lb/>
canal systems the world has ever seen. And <lb/>
then the telegraph lines. At the
time of the <lb/>
union the only telegraph we had was that one <lb/>
with balls, which so many of us
remember, <lb/>
and which used to connect the citadel with <lb/>
the Island of Orleans, and thence communi<lb break="no"/>cated with Grosse Isle by a telegraph of the <lb/>
same kind ; now an immense network of <lb/>
telegraph wires places us in daily and <lb/>
immediate communication with the most <lb/>
remote districts in the different provinces. <lb/>
We leave the union with a debt greater <lb/>
than that with which we entered it, <lb/>
but we leave it with a most perfect system
<lb/>
of lighthouses, wharves, piers, slides, in fact <lb/>
with a large number of other public works, <lb/>
which have mainly contributed to the settle<lb break="no"/>ment and the prosperity of the country, and <lb/>
which have more than doubled its resources <lb/>
since the union. The Grand Trunk Railway <lb/>
alone, for the sixteen millions which it has <lb/>
cost us, has contributed to increase the <lb/>
value of our lands by millions and millions <lb/>
of dollars, by enhancing the value of our <lb/>
agricultural productions, which are by its <lb/>
means brought with greater ease to
the <lb/>
different markets, and has moreover entailed <lb/>
an expenditure in our midst of more than <lb/>
seventy millions of dollars for its construction <lb/>
alone. Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, if we
entered the <lb/>
union with a debt of four hundred thousand <lb/>
dollars, and if to-day we leave it with a debt <lb/>
of thirty millions of dollars, we can at all <lb/>
events show what we have done with the <lb/>
money, by the immense extent of territory, <lb/>
then uncleared, which is now covered with <lb/>
abundant crops, and which have
served to <lb/>
keep in the country, not indeed all the child<lb break="no"/>ren of our farmers, but at least a very great <lb/>
number of them, who but for these impro<lb break="no"/>vements would have emigrated <hi rendition="simple:italic">en masse</hi>
to the <lb/>
neighboring country. Under the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion we shall have the control of our lands, and <lb/>
we can settle them so as to retain in our <lb/>
midst all those of the rising generation of <lb/>
both origins who too often take to a foreign <lb/>
land their strong right arms, their energy <lb/>
and devotion. Our mineral lands, so rich and<lb/>
so productive, the opening up of which
has <lb/>
            



            <pb n="387" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0387.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">387</fw> 
            hardly
been begun, will also be a source of <lb/>
enormous revenue to the country, and will <lb/>
largely contribute to increase the sum of our <lb/>
population, by keeping in Canada many <lb/>
men who would have gone in search <lb/>
of fortune elsewhere, and it inspires
me <lb/>
with still greater confidence that Provid<lb break="no"/>ence has been pleased to ioin to His other <lb/>
blessings conferred upon us, the possession <lb/>
of mines the richest and perhaps the <lb/>
most abundant in the world. As
regards <lb/>
our fisheries, they were hardly opened up at <lb/>
the time of the union ; and now, although <lb/>
much more may be done with them, it is. <lb/>
nevertheless, undeniable that every year they <lb/>
are more and more developed, and
that they <lb/>
are destined, at no distant
period, to be a <lb/>
source of immense revenue to the country. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) There are many other points <lb/>
of view, Mr. SPEAKER, from which
we might <lb/>
examine the advantages we have derived <lb/>
from the union of the Canadas, in return <lb/>
for the sacrifice we have imposed upon our<lb break="no"/>selves. We might look at the
political <lb/>
position we occupied at that period. We <lb/>
should see that we had just come out
of a <lb/>
terrible crisis, during which blood had been <lb/>
spilt on battle-fields and
elsewhere ; our Con<lb break="no"/>stitution had been suspended, and the whole <lb/>
country had witnessed scenes such as its <lb/>
inhabitants, hitherto happy and prosperous, <lb/>
had never seen before. Now we enjoy <lb/>
responsible government, one of the most <lb/>
glorious of England's institutions, and one <lb/>
that has stood the test of ages.
This great <lb/>
constitutional guarantee we take with us into <lb/>
the Confederation, into which we are about <lb/>
to enter in a state of peace and prosperity, <lb/>
with happiness in our midst, and
with the <lb/>
conviction that this peace, this prosperity <lb/>
and this happiness will be made more lasting <lb/>
than ever. We enter it with the legitimate <lb/>
and patriotic aim of placing our country in <lb/>
a position more worthy of our population <lb/>
and of greater importance, and meriting <lb/>
higher consideration from foreign nations. <lb/>
The hon. member for Hochelaga, not content <lb/>
with calling up past events, has also <lb/>
alluded to the constitution of the courts <lb/>
of law in Lower Canada under the Con<lb break="no"/>federacy. He declared that he did not under<lb break="no"/>stand the meaning of that article of the <lb/>
resolutions which leaves to the Central Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment the appointment of the judges, <lb/>
whilst by another article it is
provided that the <lb/>
constitution and maintenance of the courts <lb/>
was entrusted to the Local Parliament. The <lb/>
honorable member should have observed that <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
             by the powers conferred on the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, Lower Canada retains all her civil <lb/>
rights, as prescribed by the 17th paragraph of <lb/>
article 43, as follows :— <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> The administration of justice, including
the <lb/>
constitution, maintenance and organization
of the <lb/>
courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and <lb/>
including also the procedure in civil matters. <lb/>
            </p></quote>
            <p>
This is a privilege which has been granted to us <lb/>
and which we shall retain, because our civil laws <lb/>
differ from those of the other provinces of <lb/>
the Confederation. This exception, like many <lb/>
others, has been expressly made for the pro<lb break="no"/>tection of us Lower Canadians. It was our <lb/>
desire, as the representatives of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>da at the Conference, that we should have <lb/>
under the control of our Local Legislature the <lb/>
constitution and organization of our courts of <lb/>justice, both civil and criminal, so that our <lb/>
legislature might possess full power over our <lb/>
courts, and the right to establish or modify <lb/>
them if it thought expedient. But, on the <lb/>
other hand, the appointment of the judges of <lb/>
these courts had to be given, as it has been,<lb/>
to the Central Government, and the reason of <lb/>
this provision is at once simple, natural and <lb/>
just. In the Confederacy we shall have a <lb/>
Central Parliament and local legislatures.— <lb/>
Well, I ask any reasonable man, any man of <lb/>
experience, does he think that, with the am<lb break="no"/>bition which must naturally stimulate men of <lb/>
mark and talent to display their powers on <lb/>
the theatre most worthy of their talents, <lb/>
these men will consent to enter the local legis<lb break="no"/>latures rather than the Federal Parliament ? <lb/>
Is it not more likely and more reasonable to <lb/>
suppose that they would rather appear and <lb/>
shine on the largest stage, on that in which <lb/>
they can render the greatest service to their <lb/>
country, and where the rewards of their ser<lb break="no"/>vices will be the highest? Yes, these men <lb/>
will prefer to go to the Central Parliament, <lb/>
and among them there will be doubtless many <lb/>
of our most distinguished members of the <lb/>
legal profession. The members of this pro<lb break="no"/>fession are often accused of going into Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment for the purpose of monopolizing the <lb/>
representation. If this be the case at the pres<lb break="no"/>ent time, is it not to be supposed that they will <lb/>
do the same thing under Confederation ? <lb/>
Were the appointment of the judges left to <lb/>
the local legislatures, the local governments <lb/>
would be subjected to a pressure which might <lb/>
be brought to bear upon them by the first ad<lb break="no"/>vocate who would attain influence in the Local  <lb/>
Legislature. To get rid of an inconvenient <lb/>
member who might have three or four follow<lb break="no"/>ers, the Local Government would have to take <lb/>
            

            <pb n="388" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0388.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">388</fw> 
            this troublesome advocate of the second,
third <lb/>
or fourth order of talent, and place him on <lb/>
the bench, whilst by leaving these appoint<lb break="no"/>ments to the Central Government, we are sat<lb break="no"/>isfied that the selection will be made from <lb/>
men of the highest order of qualifications, <lb/>
that the external and local pressure will not be <lb/>
so great, and that the Government will be in a <lb/>
position to act more freely. It may be re<lb break="no"/>marked, in passing, that in the proposed Con<lb break="no"/>stitution there is an article which provides <lb/>
that the judges of the courts of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada shall be appointed from the members of <lb/>
the bar of that section. This exception was <lb/>
only made in favor of Lower Canada, and it <lb/>
is a substantial guarantee for those who fear <lb/>
the proposed system. Besides, the honorable <lb/>
member for Hochelaga, who fancies that he <lb/>
sees danger in the powers given to the Central <lb/>
Government, knows by experience, as having <lb/>
himself been a minister of the Crown, that in <lb/>
respect of every appointment of a
judge the <lb/>
Cabinet always consults the ministers for the <lb/>
section in which the appointment is to be <lb/>
made, and accepts their choice. The same <lb/>
practice would necessarily be followed by the <lb/>
Central Government, who would be forced to <lb/>
respect it, because behind the ministers from <lb/>
each section would be found the members from <lb/>
that section, and behind our ministers for <lb/>
Lower Canada will be found the sixty-five <lb/>
members whom we shall have sent to repre<lb break="no"/>sent and protect our interests in the Federal <lb/>
Parliament. It is then advantageous, and <lb/>
there could be no danger in the provision that <lb/>
the judges should be appointed by the Central <lb/>
Government ; indeed, it is for our interest, <lb/>
and the interest of all, that it should be so. <lb/>
And although it may be looked upon as a <lb/>
secondary consideration, yet it may as well be <lb/>
mentioned now, that by leaving the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of our judges to the Central Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, we are the gainers by one hundred <lb/>
thousand dollars, which will have to be paid <lb/>
for their services by the central power. This <lb/>
consideration will perhaps have some weight <lb/>
with the honorable member for Hochelaga, <lb/>
who makes such an outcry to alarm the peo<lb break="no"/>ple that we shall be obliged to have recourse <lb/>
to direct taxation to defray the expenses of <lb/>
our Local Legislature. Notwithstanding the <lb/>
advanced hour of the evening, I cannot pass <lb/>
over in silence another observation made by <lb/>
the honorable member, and I beg he will ac<lb break="no"/>cord me his undivided attention
at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent moment. The honorable gentleman has <lb/>
asked the Government what meaning was to <lb/>
be attached to the word " marriage," where <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
             it occurred in the Constitution. He
desired <lb/>
to know whether the Government proposed <lb/>
to leave to the Central Government the right <lb/>
of deciding at what age, for example, mar<lb break="no"/>riage might be contracted I will now an<lb break="no"/>swer the honorable gentleman as categorically <lb/>
as possible, for I am anxious to be under<lb break="no"/>stood, not only in this House, but also by all <lb/>
those who may hereafter read the report of <lb/>
our proceedings. And first of all I will <lb/>
prove that civil rights form part of those <lb/>
which, by article 43 (paragraph 15) of the <lb/>
resolutions, are guaranteed to Lower Canada. <lb/>
This paragraph reads as follows :— <lb/>
            </p>



           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> <p> 15. Property and civil rights, excepting
those <lb/>
portions thereof assigned to the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Well, amongst these rights are all the <lb/>
civil laws of Lower Canada, and among <lb/>
these latter those which relate to marriage ; <lb/>
now it was of the highest importance <lb/>
that it should be so under the proposed sys<lb break="no"/>tem, and therefore the members from Lower <lb/>
Canada at the Conference took great care to <lb/>
obtain the reservation to the Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of this important right, and in consent<lb break="no"/>ing to allow the word " marriage " after the <lb/>
word "divorce," the delegates have not pro<lb break="no"/>posed to take away with one hand from the <lb/>
Local Legislature what they had reserved to it <lb/>
by the other. So that the word " marriage," <lb/>
placed where it is among the
powers of the <lb/>
Central Parliament, has not the extended signi<lb break="no"/>fication which was sought to be given to it by the <lb/>
honorable member. With the view
of being <lb/>
more explicit, I now propose to read how the <lb/>
word marriage is proposed to be understood :— <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p> The word marriage has been placed in the
draft <lb/>
of the proposed Constitution to invest the Feder<lb break="no"/>al Parliament with the right of declaring what <lb/>
marriages shall be held and deemed to be valid <lb/>
throughout the whole extent of the Confederacy, <lb/>
without, however, interfering in any particular <lb/>
with the doctrines or rites of the religious creeds <lb/>
to which the contracting parties may belong. <lb/>
            </p></quote>
            
            <p> This is a point of great importance, and
the <lb/>
French Canadian members ought to rejoice <lb/>
to see that their fellow—countrymen in the <lb/>
Government have not failed in their duty on <lb/>
a question of so serious a nature. On many <lb/>
other points many of them will doubtless <lb/>
claim that we have not thoroughly fufilled <lb/>
our duty, but as regards the matter in ques<lb break="no"/>tion there can be no difference of opinion, as <lb/>
we have all a common rule to guide us ; and <lb/>
I repeat that they ought to rejoice that their <lb/>
co-religionists in the Conference have not been <lb/>
found wanting on this occasion. The whole <lb/>

     may be summed up as follows :—The Central 
     <lb/>
     Parliament may decide that any marriage 
     <lb/>
     contracted in Upper Canada, or in any other 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederated Provinces, in accordance 
     <lb/>
     with the laws of the country in which it was 
     <lb/>
     contracted, although that law might be differ<lb break="no"/>ent from ours, should be deemed valid in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada in case the parties should 
     <lb/>
     come to reside there, and <hi rendition="simple:italic">vice versa</hi>.

     <persName ref="pers:ARCH1">MR. ARCHAMBEAULT</persName>—I would ask 
     <lb/>
     of the Hon. Solicitor General if a marriage

     contracted in the United States, before a ma<lb break="no"/>gistrate, and not according to canonical laws, 
     <lb/>
     would be deemed valid in Lower Canada ?

     <persName ref="pers:LANG1"><persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName></persName>—It would

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—If a marriage con<lb break="no"/>tracted in the United States is valid here, as

     a British colony in conformity with the laws

     explanation of the Hon. Solicitor General is

     inadmissible, or the resolution is useless.

     <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—I beg your 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>will be valid in Lower Canada, if contracted 
     <lb/>according to the laws of the country in which 
     <lb/>it takes place ; but also, when a marriage is con<lb break="no"/>tracted in any province contrary to its laws, al<lb break="no"/>though in conformity with the laws of another 
     <lb/>province, it will not be considered valid. 
     <lb/>Let us now examine the question of divorce. 
     <lb/>We do not intend either to establish or to 
     <lb/>recognize a new right; we do not mean to 
     <lb/>admit a thing to which we have constantly re<lb break="no"/>fused to assent, but at the Conference the ques<lb break="no"/>tion arose, which legislature should exercise 
     <lb/>the different powers which already exist in the 
     <lb/>constitutions of the different provinces. Now, 
     <lb/>among these powers which have been already 
     <lb/>and requently exercised <hi rendition="simple:italic">de facto</hi>, is this 
     <lb/>of divorce. As a member of the Conference, 
     <lb/>without admitting or creating any new right 
     <lb/>in this behalf, and while declaring, as I now 
     <lb/>
            

    

    
            <cb/>
            
     do, that as - Catholics we acknowledge no 
     <lb/>
     power of divorce, I found that we were to 
     <lb/>
     decide in what legislative body the authority 
     <lb/>
     should be lodged which we found in our Con<lb break="no"/>stitutlons. After mature consideration, we 
     <lb/>
     resolved to leave it in the Central Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     thinking thereby to increase the difficulties of 
     <lb/>
     a procedure which is at present so easy. We 
     <lb/>
     thought then, as we still think, that in this 
     <lb/>
     we took the most prudent course. The fol<lb break="no"/>lowing illustration will prove this still more 
     <lb/>
     forcibly. It is known to the House how 
     <lb/>
     zealous a partisan the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Brome (Mr. DUNKIN) is of the cause of tem<lb break="no"/>perance. Well, we will suppose that the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman were present as a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of a municipal council in which it was to 
     <lb/>
     be decided whether all the taverns in a very 
     <lb/>
     populous part of the parish, which could not 
     <lb/>
     be suppressed, should be banished to a remote 
     <lb/>
     corner of the parish, where they would no 
     <lb/>
     longer be a temptation and a stumbling-block; 
     <lb/>
     would he not vote for such a measure ? 
     <lb/>
     Would he not send them to a place where 
     <lb/>
     they would be least accessible to the popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and would he not think he had done a 
     <lb/>
     meritorious act, an act worthy of a good 
     <lb/>
     friend of the temperance cause? Just so 
     <lb/>
     in a question of divorce; the case is exactly 
     <lb/>
     analogous. We found this power existing 
     <lb/>
     in the constitutions of the different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and not being able to get rid of it, 
     <lb/>
     we wished to banish it as far from us as pos<lb break="no"/>sible. One thing it would be vain to deny, 
     <lb/>
     namely, that although we, as Catholics, do not 
     <lb/>
     admit the liberty of divorce, although we hold 
     <lb/>
     the marriage bond to be indissoluble, yet there 
     <lb/>
     are cases in which we both admit and require 
     <lb/>
     the annulling of the marriage tie—in cases, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, where a marriage has been con<lb break="no"/>tracted within the prohibited degrees without 
     <lb/>
     the necessary dispensations. An instance of 
     <lb/>
     this occurred very recently. A few months 
     <lb/>
     since, an individual belonging to my county, 
     <lb/>
     who had married a young girl of a neighboring 
     <lb/>
     parish, without being aware at the timc of his 
     <lb/>
     marriage of the relationship which existed 
     <lb/>
     between him and his wife, found out several 
     <lb/>
     months afterwards that they were related in 
     <lb/>
     such a degree that they required a dispensa<lb break="no"/>tion from the bishop. That dispensation had 
     <lb/>
     not been obtained. He spoke of it to his wife, 
     <lb/>
     who refused to apply for a dispensation, as a 
     <lb/>
     step towards the legal celebration of their 
     <lb/>
     marriage. It became necessary, therefore, to 
     <lb/>
     have the marriage annulled. The affair was 
     <lb/>
     brought before the Ecclesiastical Court, and, 
     <lb/>
     after a minute investigation, the diocesan 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="390" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0390.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">390</fw>
            
            
     bishop gave judgment, declaring the marriage 
     <lb/>
     null in a canonical sense. Regarded in a civil 
     <lb/>
     point of view, the marriage was still valid 
     <lb/>
     until it should have been declared null by a 
     <lb/>
     civil tribunal. It became necessary, there<lb break="no"/>fore, to carry the cause before the Superior 
     <lb/>
     Court, and my honorable friend, the member 
     <lb/>
     for Beauce, who took the case in hand with 
     <lb/>
     his usual zeal and legal address, obtained from 
     <lb/>
     the court, after a suitable inquiry, a judgment 
     <lb/>
     declaring the marriage null in a civil sense, 
     <lb/>
     and ordering that it should be registered as 
     <lb/>
     such in all places where it should be needful. 
     <lb/>
     If this aflair had occurred in Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     what recourse would the parties have had? 
     <lb/>
     The parties being Catholics, the case would 
     <lb/>
     have been brought before the bishop, who 
     <lb/>
     would also have declared the marriage null 
     <lb/>
     after suitable inquiry; but the cause would 
     <lb/>
     not have had the same conclusion in the civil 
     <lb/>
     court, particularly had it depended on certain 
     <lb/>
     impediments which have force in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, but none in Upper Canada. It would 
     <lb/>
     have become necessary to go to Parliament to 
     <lb/>
     pray for an act, which, in a Catholic point of 
     <lb/>
     view, would be a mere decree of separation, 
     <lb/>
     but which the Parliament would have termed 
     <lb/>
     an act of divorce. This power to grant a 
     <lb/>
     separation is therefore necessarily vested in 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament, by whatever name such separ<lb break="no"/>ation may be designated, and we are not to 
     <lb/>
     be reproached for the interpretation which 
     <lb/>
     others may give to such name, different from 
     <lb/>
     that which we assign to it. I thought it 
     <lb/>
     right to make myself understood on this 
     <lb/>
     point, because I do not choose that people 
     <lb/>
     should be able to say we are afraid of explain<lb break="no"/>ing our position with regard to the question 
     <lb/>
     of divorce and marriage, and I believe that I 
     <lb/>
     have shown that our position is consistent 
     <lb/>
     with our religious laws and our principles as 
     <lb/>
     Catholics. I regret that I have dwelt so long 
     <lb/>
     on the matters touched upon by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga; but after his speech, 
     <lb/>
     and considering the position he assumed, he 
     <lb/>
     must have expected an answer. And, hav<lb break="no"/>ing done with him, I come to the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Lotbiniere (Mr. JOLY). That 
     <lb/>
     honorable member has endeavored to prove 
     <lb/>
     that all confederations die of consumption, 
     <lb/>
     and has cited, in support of his argument, the 
     <lb/>
     political condition of the Spanish republics of 
     <lb/>
    South America. Why did he say nothing of 
     <lb/>the Germanic Confederation ? he had men<lb break="no"/>tioned that, he would have had to confess that 
     <lb/>it had proved a success. He would have said 
     <lb/>also that it is a monarchical confederation 
     <lb/>consisting of thirty-one states, the chiefs of 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     which are almost all kings, princes, or electors.  
     <lb/>
     There are not more than four or five states 
     <lb/>
     which are not monarchical, and, nevertheless, 
     <lb/>
     that confederation works well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—Are they sovereign 
     <lb/>states ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—Yes, but 
     <lb/>
     they have done what we are now about to do. 
     <lb/>
     In order to hold their own among the great pow<lb break="no"/>ers, and not to be at the mercy of the first 
     <lb/>
     who might choose to assail their rights, they 
     <lb/>
     have united their strength because they con<lb break="no"/>ceived that " union is strength." When the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Lotbiniere was talking 
     <lb/>
     about the weakness inherent in confedera<lb break="no"/>tions, he ought to have recollected late events 
     <lb/>
     in Italy, as they happened a few years ago. 
     <lb/>
     He should have calle to mind the conquests 
     <lb/>
     of Garibaldi, and reflected that if he had suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in overcoming a number of petty states 
     <lb/>
     and even the kingdom of Naples for the beno<lb break="no"/>fit of the king of Sardinia, it was because the 
     <lb/>
     Italian States, being divided as he found 
     <lb/>
     them, were too weak to resist an invasion, and 
     <lb/>
     that, had they been confederated, neither Gari<lb break="no"/>baldi nor Victor Emmanuel would ever have 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in getting the upper hand of them. 
     <lb/>
     And what happened when the little states of 
     <lb/>
     Italy were banded together with Piedmont ? 
     <lb/>
     This happened—when Garibaldi aimed at 
     <lb/>
     making conquests on his own account, he soon 
     <lb/>
     found out that the small states no longer ex<lb break="no"/>isted, and that a large state had been formed 
     <lb/>
     out of their fragments, the consequence of 
     <lb/>
     which was that he was beaten at Aspramonte. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member says that our connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Mother Country, under the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, would be one of paper, and that the Up<lb break="no"/>per Canadians would detest the Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>dians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—He did not say that 
     <lb/>
     such things would be, but that such might be 
     <lb/>
     the effect of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>— Why 
     <lb/>
     should such be the effect of Confederation ? 
     <lb/>
     No questions will be decided in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Parliament but such as relate to general mat<lb break="no"/>ters. Local matters will not be treated of, 
     <lb/>
     nor questions of race, of religion, or of insti<lb break="no"/>tutions peculiar to the provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     consequently there can be no collision of 
     <lb/>
     opinions on such questions. Such a fear, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, is quite unfounded. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member says, moreover, that the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion would lead rather to divide than to unite 
     <lb/>
     us, that civil war would be the result, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Upper Canadians would rather be annexed 
     <lb/>
     to the United States than subjected to Lower 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="391" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0391.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">391</fw>
     Canadian rule. For my part, I believe no 
     <lb/>
     such thing. I believe that the Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>dians are too loyal to wish to be annexed to 
     <lb/>
     the United States. They are quite disposed 
     <lb/>
     to trade with their neighbors, to keep up a 
     <lb/>
     good understanding with them, but they do 
     <lb/>
     not wish to be annexed. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Lotbinière, getting over his fears 
     <lb/>
     and predictions and speaking of the sixty-five 
     <lb/>
     members from Lower Canada, put the fol<lb break="no"/>following question—" Suppose the population in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada should in ten years increase 
     <lb/>
     thirty-four per cent., while that of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces increases only thirty per cent., 
     <lb/>
     would it not be unjust to Lower Canada that 
     <lb/>
     the number of its representatives should 
     <lb/>
     remain the same, should still be sixty-five, 
     <lb/>
     while that of the other provinces will be in<lb break="no"/>creased ; while in any case the number of re<lb break="no"/>presentatives from the other provinces is not 
     <lb/>
     to be diminished unless their population in 
     <lb/>
     should diminish five per cent ?" This point 
     <lb/>
     is very important, but we must observe that 
     <lb/>
     whatever the increase of the population in 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, the part from Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada is fixed and known. Thus, for 
     <lb/>
     instance, if the population of Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada should increase more than that of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, the latter will always have 
     <lb/>
     sixty-five members, the other provinces re<lb break="no"/>ceiving such increased number of repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives as their increased population 
     <lb/>
     would entitle them to. But the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     do not prevent Lower Canada from having 
     <lb/>
     more than sixty-five representatives, if its 
     <lb/>
     population' should increase faster than that of 
     <lb/>
    the other provinces. The French translation 
     <lb/>of these resolutions is erroneous, for it says 
     <lb/>that "for the purpose of determining the 
     <lb/>number of representatives from each province 
     <lb/>at the end of every decennial census, Lower 
     <lb/>Canada shall never have either more or less 
     <lb/>than sixty-five representatives," whereas the 
     <lb/>English version of the resolutions, which is 
     <lb/>the official version, says: " Lower Canada 
     <lb/>shall always be assigned sixty-five members." 
     <lb/>This does not mean that Lower Canada can 
     <lb/>never have more than sixty-five members, but 
     <lb/>that it can not have less than sixty-five mem<lb break="no"/>bers. That is, I think, a categorical answer 
     <lb/>to the honorable member's objection. If the 
     <lb/>honorable member for Lotbiniere were here, I 
     <lb/>would answer him on other points; but 1 will 
     <lb/>not attack him as he last night attacked the 
     <lb/>Honorable Attorney General. The honorable 
     <lb/>member compared the conduct of the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Attorney General, in moving the scheme 
     <lb/>of Confederation , to that of a man who, pre<lb break="no"/>

    
            <cb/>
            
     siding over a savings bank in which every one 
     <lb/>
     came to deposit his savings, having confidence 
     <lb/>
     in his honesty, should some fine day turn de<lb break="no"/>faulter, betray their confidence and ruin 
     <lb/>
     them. He said that the honesty of the Hon<lb break="no"/>orable Attorney General for Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     had yielded to the temptation of honors, titles 
     <lb/>
     and places, and that he had forgotten all his 
     <lb/>
     obligations and duties and sold his fellow citi<lb break="no"/>zens. I shall not retort on the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member, but I shall take upon me to continue 
     <lb/>
     the comparison made by him and tell him 
     <lb/>
     that the Honorable Attorney General has in 
     <lb/>
     fact opened a saving bank and has invited 
     <lb/>
     every one to deposit in it his title deeds and 
     <lb/>
     his savings. Accordingly we find one day the 
     <lb/>
     seigniors and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">censitaires</hi> coming and de<lb break="no"/>positing in his keeping their title deeds, their 
     <lb/>
     lands and all they have. These the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Attorney General takes and deposits in 
     <lb/>
     his bank, an when he is called upon to re<lb break="no"/>store them, when he is required to account 
     <lb/>
     for them, he pays as never man paid before 
     <lb/>
     him; to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">censitaires</hi>, instead of their title 
     <lb/>
     deeds burthened with mortgages, <hi rendition="simple:italic">lods et ventes</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">corvées</hi> and all sorts of services and duties, he 
     <lb/>
     restores their lands free from all burthens; 
     <lb/>
     while to the seigniors he tenders the full 
     <lb/>
     value of their seigniorial rights; and if this 
     <lb/>
     day there are seigniors holding a hundred 
     <lb/>
     thousand acres of land in full right of proper<lb break="no"/>ty, which they can safely estimate as worth 
     <lb/>
     eight dollars per acre, they may thank the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable the Attorney General for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada for it. The suitors in our courts 
     <lb/>
     come next; they were oppressed with enor<lb break="no"/>mous costs, which amounted almost to a de<lb break="no"/>nial of justice; they went and deposited their 
     <lb/>
     briefs, declarations and pleas in the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Attorney General's savings bank, and he 
     <lb/>
     returned them, giving them at the same time 
     <lb/>
     judicial decentralisation and diminished costs 
     <lb/>
     of suit. Thus it is that he has earned the re<lb break="no"/>spect and gratitude of his fellow citizens.' It is 
     <lb/>
     the same as regards the inhabitants of the 
     <lb/>
     townships; in place of their ambiguous civil law, 
     <lb/>
     he gave them a civil law applying to the whole 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, the townships as well as 
     <lb/>
     the seigniories; and all are now unanimous in 
     <lb/>
     expressions of gratitude towards the Hon. Atty. 
     <lb/>
     General for extricating them from the judicial 
     <lb/>
     chaos in which they were involved. Pleaders, 
     <lb/>
     advocates, in fact the whole country, deposit<lb break="no"/>ed their complaints in the Hon. Atty. General's 
     <lb/>
     hands, and at the end of five years he has 
     <lb/>
     given them a civil code which will do honor to 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, honor to the three distinguish 
     <lb/>
     ed Codification Commissioners selected by the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="392" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0392.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">392</fw>
            
            
     Hon. Atty. General, whose name it will trans<lb break="no"/>mit to posterity. Yes, his name is attached 
     <lb/>
     to that work, and the attacks of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Lotbiniere will hardly prevent 
     <lb/>
     that name from going down to our descend<lb break="no"/>ants surrounded with the respect of all those 
     <lb/>
     who know the services he has rendered to his 
     <lb/>
     country. But the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada was not satisfied with these 
     <lb/>
     services. In the midst of a terrible crisis his 
     <lb/>
     country confided to him all its interests, all 
     <lb/>
     its rights, all its institutions, its nationality, 
     <lb/>
     its religion, in a word everything it held most 
     <lb/>
     dear. The Hon. Attorney General received 
     <lb/>
     the whole trust into his safe and faithful keep<lb break="no"/>ing, and when called upon to render an ac<lb break="no"/>count, he exhibited all these interests, rights, 
     <lb/>
     institutions, our nationality and religion. in 
     <lb/>
     fact everything that the people held dear, and 
     <lb/>
     restored them guaranteed, protected and sur<lb break="no"/>rounded by every safeguard, in the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the British North American Provin<lb break="no"/>ces. He has been a faithful banker, and has 
     <lb/>
     not betrayed the trust reposed in him, he has 
     <lb/>
     honestly paid his debt; rich and poor, seigniors 
     <lb/>
     and <!-- GL Comment, this should be italicized -->censitaires, advocates and pleaders, all 
     <lb/>
     have received their due, and the banker is 
     <lb/>
     blessed from one end of the province to the 
     <lb/>
     other. The honorable member says that the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General will have his reward. 
     <lb/>
     He is right; my honorable colleague will have 
     <lb/>
     his reward—his day will come as did that of 
     <lb/>
     the late Sir LOUIS HYPOLITE LAFONTAINE. 
     <lb/>
     When that eminent citizen held the position 
     <lb/>
     occupied to-day by the Hon. Attorney General, 
     <lb/>
     the opposition heaped upon him the same re<lb break="no"/>proaches, the same insults that are now offered 
     <lb/>
     to my honorable friend. He was accused of 
     <lb/>
     being a traitor to his country ; it was broadly 
     <lb/>
     asserted that he was selling his fellow-citizens, 
     <lb/>
     and that he was the enemy of his race. 
     <lb/>
     Nevertheless, that defender of the rights and 
     <lb/>
     institutions of Lower Canada had but one 
     <lb/>
     ambition, namely, to secure for his fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen the splendid position they have 
     <lb/>
     ever since occupied. He let the disaffected 
     <lb/>
     continue to assail him, and before descending 
     <lb/>
     into the tomb, he had the happiness of seeing 
     <lb/>
     his patriotic efforts and the purity and noble<lb break="no"/>ness of his intentions acknowledged; and when 
     <lb/>
     his mortal remains were carried to their last 
     <lb/>
     resting place, all classes of his fellow-citizens 
     <lb/>
     were eager in doing honor to that great man, 
     <lb/>
     and all united in blessing the memory of one 
     <lb/>
     who was no longer accused of being a traitor, 
     <lb/>
     but whose name was universally admitted to 
     <lb/>
     be deserving of a place among the very highest 
     <lb/>
     in parliamentary history. It will be the same 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     as regards the present Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada. He will have his reward; 
     <lb/>
     his day will come, not in the sense of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Lotbiniere, who makes 
     <lb/>
     use of the expression as a menace, but by re<lb break="no"/>taining that confidence of his fellow-citizens 
     <lb/>
     which appears so completely incomprehensible 
     <lb/>
     to the honorable member for otbiniere. 
     <lb/>
     That he should enjoy the confidence of his 
     <lb/>
     fellow-citizens appears to me a thing perfectly 
     <lb/>
     natural, and not by any means difficult to 
     <lb/>
     understand. During his whole life, like Sir 
     <lb/>
     LOUIS HYPOLITE LAFONTAINE the present 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Attorney General for Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     has devoted himself to protecting and pro<lb break="no"/>moting the material and religious interests 
     <lb/>
     of his fellow—countrymen, and he has now 
     <lb/>
     crowned his gigantic labors by the important 
     <lb/>
     share he has had in the framing of the new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, which is destined to govern one 
     <lb/>
     of the greatest empires in the world, a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution beneath which all races and all reli<lb break="no"/>gions will find protection and respect. He 
     <lb/>
     will have his reward, and like his predecessor, 
     <lb/>
     his name will go down to posterity as one of 
     <lb/>
     the greatest benefactors of his country. I 
     <lb/>
     regret, Mr. SPEAKER, having spoken at such 
     <lb/>
     great length, but the importance of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion must be my excuse for having, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     wearied the House. After the long speeches 
     <lb/>
     delivered by the honorable member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga and the honorable member for Lotbiniere, 
     <lb/>
     it was impossible for me to curtail my re<lb break="no"/>marks, when I had to refute and destroy all 
     <lb/>
     the hazardous assertions of the two honorable 
     <lb/>
     members. I think I have said enough to 
     <lb/>
     show that the honorable member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga made a false prediction when he said that 
     <lb/>
     the day on which Confederation was accom<lb break="no"/>plished would be an evil day for Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     No,Mr. SPEAKER, the Confederation, I am per<lb break="no"/>fectly convinced, will afford the best possible 
     <lb/>
     guarantee for our institutions, our language 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—While the Honorable Solici<lb break="no"/>tor General was speaking, I twice asked per<lb break="no"/>mission to explain what I had stated, because 
     <lb/>
     I thought he had not understood me; but 
     <lb/>
     from the manner in which he has acted 
     <lb/>
     towards me, twice refusing me the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of explaining myself, I am now convinced that 
     <lb/>
     be perfectly well understood what I wished to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="393" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-21_Page_0393.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">393</fw>
     say, and that he merely pretended not to 
     <lb/>
     understand it. I am not willing to bear the 
     <lb/>
     onus of the charge he has brought against me. 
     <lb/>
     I shall take the opportunity of setting him 
     <lb/>
     right, and of explaimng what I said yesterday. 
     <lb/>
     I am quite ready to bear accusations of impru<lb break="no"/>dence or ignorance, butI will not stand a charge 
     <lb/>
     of cowardice, and that is the accusation I find 
     <lb/>
     in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journal de Québec</hi> of this day. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member charges me with having ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to the religious prejudices of the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians. I did not appeal to their 
     <lb/>
     religious prejudices; I made an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     their national prejudices. I look upon this 
     <lb/>
     measure of Confederation as fatal to the in<lb break="no"/>terests of Lower Canada, and I consider that 
     <lb/>
     that was the only means of breaking the bands 
     <lb/>
     by which the French-Canadians are bound, 
     <lb/>
     and of arousing them while it is yet time; 
     <lb/>
     that is what I have done and ever will do. 
     <lb/>
     ButI am not the man to appeal to the national 
     <lb/>
     prejudices of the English after my appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadians, as the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber has stated. I shall now state the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which I explained the passage from Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM's report. I said it was impossible 
     <lb/>
     that both races should long continue to live 
     <lb/>
     in peace; that some day or other the two 
     <lb/>
     nationalities would come into collision; that 
     <lb/>
     judgment would be given by the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, in which the English were to 
     <lb/>
     have the majority, and from which the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians could not hope to obtain 
     <lb/>
     justice. I did not state that the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians would act unjustly towards the 
     <lb/>
     British; but I said that the latter might 
     <lb/>
     complain, and that the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>
     would be called upon to decide as to whether 
     <lb/>
     injustice had been done; and that its sympa<lb break="no"/>thies must be distrusted. I added that the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament being composed of a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of English members, would be inclined 
     <lb/>
     to give ear to the English of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     rather than to the French-Canadians. I then 
     <lb/>
     noted Lord DURHAM'S report to prove that 
     <lb/>
     English-Canadians would never willingly sub<lb break="no"/>mit to the majority in Lower Canada. And 
     <lb/>
     in citing the two extracts from Lord DUR<lb break="no"/>HAM's report, I first read them in English 
     <lb/>
     and then translated them into French. How 
     <lb/>
     can it be asserted, therefore, that I made use 
     <lb/>
     of the English language in order to make an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the prejudices of the Anglo-Cana<lb break="no"/>dins? The charge is absurd. Far from 
     <lb/>
     desiring to influence them in that sense, I 
     <lb/>
     read the passages with hesitation, because I 
     <lb/>
     felt that the British ought to blush for them. 
     <lb/>
     There was no need of quoting the passages 
     <lb/>
     
            
            <cb/>
            
     referred to in order to tell the English Of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada what their sentiments were; I 
     <lb/>
     cited them in order to make them known to 
     <lb/>
     the French Canadians. With regard to the 
     <lb/>
     second passage, I could not cite it in order to 
     <lb/>
     attract the sympathies of the British, since it 
     <lb/>
     was an extract against them. How can it be 
     <lb/>
     shown that I cited that passage for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of exciting the national prejudices of 
     <lb/>
     the English ? I appealed neither to the re<lb break="no"/>ligious prejudices of the Canadians, nor to 
     <lb/>
     the national prejudices of the English. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—I did not say 
     <lb/>
     that the honorable member for Lotbiniere was 
     <lb/>
     a coward ; I found fault with him for treating 
     <lb/>
     the question incompletely and putting it in a 
     <lb/>
     wrong light. With reference to the quotations, 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member did not translate into 
     <lb/>
     French that part in which it was stated that 
     <lb/>
     the English will never submit to a French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian majority.

     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—I did not hear it, 
     <lb/>
     but I am quite willing to take his word. The

     honorable member has said that he wished to 
     <lb/>
     excite the national rejudices of the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians, but that is quite as bad as exciting 
     <lb/>
     religious prejudices. All I said was, that he 
     <lb/>
     was wrong in exciting the prejudices of the 
     <lb/>
     one race against the other.

     moment of excitement that he felt convinced 
     <lb/>
     that when I made an accusation against him 
     <lb/>
     I knew it was not well founded, I must con<lb break="no"/>clude that I was mistaken, and that be trans<lb break="no"/>lated his quotations from Lord DURHAM's 
     <lb/>
     report unknown to me. I take his word in 
     <lb/>
     the matter, but I am quite sure that if he had 
     <lb/>
     not been excited at the moment, he would not 
     <lb/>
     have charged me with wilfully misrepresent<lb break="no"/>ing him.

     recollection of having translated the passage

     <lb/>
     that I had great difliculty in translating it, as 
     <lb/>
     the House will remember.
