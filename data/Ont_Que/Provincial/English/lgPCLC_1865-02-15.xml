reach us. Such expressions do not surprise <lb/>
me, proceeding as they do from a man who <lb/>
never had the honor to be the elected repre- <lb break="maybe"/>
sentative of the people, and who holds his <lb/>
seat by the favor of the Crown, but I fail to <lb/>
discover by what right he judges us in such <lb/>
a manner. In conclusion, I shall move the <lb/>
following amendment :— <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> That all the words after "That" in the
first <lb/>
line thereof be left out, and that the following <lb/>
words be inserted in lieu thereof, viz :—"The <lb/>
debate on the motion for an Address to Her <lb/>
Majesty on the subject of a union of
the British <lb/>
North American Colonies be postponed until such <lb/>
time as the Government shall have made known <lb/>
to this House : 1st. The measures it intends to <lb/>
submit to the Legislature for
the purpose of <lb/>
organizing the local governments and legisla- <lb break="maybe"/>
 tures in Upper and Lower
Canada. 2nd. The <lb/>
 bill on the subject of
education which it intends <lb/>
 to submit to the present
Parliament for the pro- <lb break="maybe"/>
 tection of minorities in Upper
and Lower Cana- <lb break="maybe"/>
 da. 3rd. The correspondence
between the Im- <lb break="maybe"/>
perial Government and the Government of
Cana- <lb break="maybe"/>
 da, respecting the defence of
the province, and <lb/>
what measure the Government intends to
submit <lb/>
 to us for the same purpose.
4th. In what man- <lb break="maybe"/>
 ner the Government intends to
divide between <lb/>
 the Provinces of Upper and
Lower Canada the <lb/>
 balance of our present
provincial debt, after de- <lb break="maybe"/>
 ducting the $62,500,000 payable
by the Federal <lb/>
 Government. and which will be
the items assigned <lb/>
 to each of those provinces.
5th. The report of <lb/>
Mr. Fleming on the survey for the
Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway." <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> HON. MR. OLIVIER —Before proceed- <lb break="maybe"/>
ing to a vote, I will ask the hon. member <lb/>
(Hon. Sir N. F. BELLEAU) who proposed <lb/>
to my honorable friend (Hon. Mr. LETEL- <lb break="maybe"/>
LIER) and myself to resign our
seats if we <lb/>
did not now choose to vote for Confedera- <lb break="maybe"/>
tion, and submit the question to our elec- <lb break="maybe"/>
tors, whether the debate will be postponed <lb/>
until our elections are over ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. SIR. N. F. BELLEAU—As I am <lb/>
not a member of the Government, it will be <lb/>
understood that I cannot reply to that ques- <lb break="maybe"/>
tion. I did not propose to them to resign<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 
            <p> their seats, but I said that if they were
<lb/>
serious in their objections they might resign <lb/>
and submit the question to their constituents <lb/>
by presenting themselves for reelection. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. MR. OLIVIER—I understand the <lb/>
object of the hon. member in giving that <lb/>
advice. He would wish to see us retire <lb/>
from the House during the contest ; but that <lb/>
is a trap into which we will not fall. Sur- <lb break="maybe"/>
prise must have been excited that I did <lb/>
not correct all the inaccuracies of the hon. <lb/>
member when he spoke of what I had <lb/>
said ; but I preferred not doing so, as I <lb/>
should have had to take up nearly every <lb/>
single word of his in order to correct it, <lb/>
as he distorted and altered the sense of <lb/>
nearly everything that I said. I conceive <lb/>
that a blush must have mantled his forehead <lb/>
as he concluded his speech. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon. Mr. LETELLIER
DE ST. JUST'S <lb/>
amendment was then put to the vote, and <lb/>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:BURE2">HON. MR. BUREAU</persName> said—I should have <lb/>
               refrained from addressing the House, had I <lb/>not heard the astounding language
               made use <lb/>of by the hon. member opposite to me (Sir <lb/> N. F. BELLEAU). He has
               spoken to us of <lb/> annexationists and republicans, and of the <lb/> dangers with
               which they menaced the coun<lb break="no"/>try. I am far from surprised at such
                  lan<lb break="no"/>guage on his part, for an ardent supporter as <lb/> he is of
               the present Government, who desire <lb/> to effect Confederation with a view to <lb/>
               strengthen the monarchical principle in this <lb/> country, he is doubtless alarmed
               at the <lb/> tendencies of some of the members of this <lb/>
               <pb n="190" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0190.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">190</fw> Cabinet, and at the republican sentiments to <lb/> which they
               gave utterance. I, however, <lb/> believe that the annexationists who are most <lb/>
               to be feared are not those of whom he speaks, <lb/> those who holdly and openly
               express their <lb/> opinion on the questions which now agitate <lb/> the country, but
               those rather who endeavor <lb/> by all possible means, to sow the seeds of <lb/>
               discord between us and our neighbors in the <lb/> United States, and to plunge us
               into war. <lb/> Surely those who boldly proclaim their <lb/> opinions to the whole
               country, cannot be <lb/> accused of disloyalty when they do it with <lb/> the view of
               serving their country. I do not <lb/> believe that there is a single member in this
               <lb/> House who would wish to see our country <lb/> annexed to the United States. I
               think, on <lb/> the other hand, that all are striving to find <lb/> the means of
               establishing a government and <lb/> a political condition that shall bear equitably
               <lb/> on all sections of the population without <lb/> distinction of race or creed—a
               system which <lb/> will secure the stability of our institutions <lb/> and the
               general welfare of the country. The <lb/> hon. gentleman has also referred to the
               <lb/>dangers of the elective system as applied to <lb/> this House, because scheming
               politicians <lb/> without a stake in the country might acquire <lb/> popularity, and
               work their way into the <lb/> House. Let that hon. gentleman read the <lb/> history
               of his country, and he will find that <lb/> the principal men who have occupied the
               <lb/> leading political positions were children of <lb/> the people, who, thanks to
               their education, <lb/> their talents and their perseverance, have <lb/> attained to
               the control of the business of the <lb/> country. Let him call to mind the history
               <lb/> of the past, and he will remember that there <lb/> was a time when the
               Legislative Council had <lb/> become an obstacle to all reform and to all <lb/>
               progress. But thanks to our energy and to <lb/> our perseverance, a liberal ministry
               has been <lb/> enabled toobtain the long-sought-for reforms. <lb/> The
               LAFONTAINE-BALDWIN Administration, <lb/> seeing that there was no possibility of
                  obtain<lb break="no"/>ing reforms on account of the obstacles raised <lb/> by the
               Legislative Council as then constitu<lb break="no"/>ted, had recourse to the
               appointment of new <lb/> liberal councillors; and by the adhesion of <lb/> the older
               ones, they succeeded in carrying <lb/> their measures. The times at which these <lb/>
               appointments were made, were as follows :— <lb/> In 1848, the SHERWOOD-BADGLEY
                  Admin<lb break="no"/>istration appointed the Hon. D. B. VIGER. <lb/> In this case
               we had a Liberal nominated by <lb/> a Tory Ministry. Afterwards, on the accession
               <lb/> of the LAFONTAINE-BALDWIN Ministry, Sir <lb/>
               <cb/> E.P. TACHÉ and the Hon. Messsrs. JAMES <lb/> LESLIE, QUESNEL, BOURRET,
               DEBEAUJEU, <lb/> ROSS, METHOT, J. E. TURGEON, MILLS, <lb/> CRANE, JONES and WYLIE,
               were appointed. <lb/> Had it not been for the nomination of these <lb/> members, and
               the adhesion given by some <lb/> others, it would have been impossible to <lb/>
               reform the Legislative Council. But what <lb/> results may be anticipated from the
               proposed <lb/> constitution of the Federal Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil ? By
               limiting the number of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, the prerogative of
               the <lb/> Crown is, in fact, restricted, and a system is <lb/> adopted, exactly the
               reverse of that which <lb/> exists in England. And in the event of <lb/> serious
               dificulties arising between the House <lb/> of Commons and the Upper House, what
               <lb/> would happen ? The same thing would <lb/> happen which has already occurred
               before, <lb/> but with this difference, that the Crown <lb/> would not have the power
               of infusing new <lb/> elements, and legislation would thus be at a <lb/> stand-still.
               The only course to be pursued <lb/> under those circumstances will be to ask the
               <lb/> Imperial Government to amend the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the Council,
               as the people will be <lb/> powerless from our having deprived them of <lb/> the
               right of electing councillors. For my <lb/> part, I am convinced that this new system
               <lb/> will not be productive of beneficial results. <lb/> I do not propose to repeat
               here all the argu<lb break="no"/>ments which have been already urged <lb/> against
               the projected changes; but I must <lb/> say, as holding my authority from the people,
               <lb/> that the question of Confederation has <lb/> never been adverted to during the
               two elec<lb break="no"/>tions which I have passed through, and that, <lb/> therefore,
               I do not think that my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents expressed their opinion on this
               question <lb/> when they elected me, or that they conferred <lb/> upon me the right
               of changing the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Legislative Council, without
                  con<lb break="no"/>sulting them in the matter. I am aware that <lb/> in 1859
               Confederation was referred to in a <lb/> paragraph of the Speech from the Throne,
               <lb/> but I also remember that at that time I <lb/> combated the idea of
               Confederation, because <lb/> the carrying out of the views expressed in <lb/> that
               paragraph would have resulted in giving <lb/> all the influence to one section of the
                  pro<lb break="no"/>vince at the expense of the other section. <lb/> At that period
               it was not the question of <lb/> Confederation which was discussed, but the <lb/>
               question of representation based upon popu<lb break="no"/>lation, and the Upper
               Canada Separate <lb/> School question. I stated at the time, as <lb/> regarded those
               separate schools, that the <lb/>
               <pb n="191" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0191.jpg"/> <!-- GL Comment, forgot <fw> here -->

minority of
               Upper Canada must not be <lb/> abandoned to the mercy of the majority, and <lb/> we
               succeeded in obtaining for them a system <lb/> of separate schools which, however,
               does <lb/> not appear to satisfy the minority. In <lb/> Lower Canada. the Protestant
               minority has <lb/> always been satisfied with the school system, <lb/> until quite
               lately ; and they have now begun <lb/> to agitate with the view of obtaining, as they
               <lb/> pretend, a more equitable distribution of the <lb/> moneys appropriated for
               school purposes. <lb/> For my part, I know that they have no found<lb break="no"
               />ation for their claim, and I remember that <lb/> when I was Secretary of the
               province, I <lb/> drew the attention of the Superintendent of <lb/> Education to the
               unequal distribution of the <lb/> money, as it appeared that the Protestant <lb/>
               minority of Lower Canada received a larger <lb/> amount than they were entitled to.
               He <lb/>replied that the distribution had been so <lb/> made by his predecessor, and
               that he had <lb/> not deemed it advisable to make any change. <lb/> Thus we see that
               uneasiness prevails among <lb/> the minority, both in Upper Canada and <lb/> Lower
               Canada, and even among the majority <lb/> in Lower Canada. But I was astonished to
               <lb/> hear the remedy announced by my honorable <lb/> colleague (Hon. Sir N. F.
               BELLEAU), in the <lb/> event of the Federal Government endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing to
               prejudice the interests of Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. He tells us that as Lower
               Canada is <lb/> to have sixty-five representatives in the <lb/> Federal Legislature
               out of 194, these sixty-<lb break="yes"/>five members from Lower Canada will <lb/>
               always be able to preserve their rights by <lb/> taking sides with the Opposition to
               turn out <lb/> the Government. Does the hon. member <lb/> really suppose that all the
               members from <lb/> Lower Canada would make common cause <lb/> on any question ? Does
               he not know that <lb/> there will always be a minority among them <lb/> of different
               origin and religion who will pro<lb break="no"/>bably take part with the Government
               or <lb/> with the majority? In such a case, what <lb/> would the Opposition from
               Lower Canada <lb/> avail about which he talks ? Do we not <lb/> know that the
               dificulties which gave rise to <lb/> the plan of Confederation were produced by <lb/>
               theccalition of an Upper Canada minority <lb/> with the Lower Canada majority ? And
               <lb/> what happened to Upper Canada might very <lb/> well happen to Lower Canada. By
               rejecting <lb/> the principle of the double majority adopted <lb/> by a liberal
               ministry, the apple of discord <lb/> was thrown among the legislative body which
               <lb/> originated the present dificuties. Another <lb/> great error committed by the
               members from <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     Lower Canada was the overturning of a 
     <lb/>
     government which had maintained the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of an equality in representation. We 
     <lb/>
     now see to what that has brought us. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member (Hon. Sir N. F. BELLEAU) 
     <lb/>
     had said that our institutions would be pro<lb break="no"/>tected under the Federal Government. But 
     <lb/>
     how ? By the resolutions as they stand 
     <lb/>
     they would not be so guarded ; and would 
     <lb/>
     not the General Government put its veto on 
     <lb/>
     every act of the local governments ? And 
     <lb/>
     while on this subject, I should like to know 
     <lb/>
     what is to be the organization of the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government of Lower Canada. As far as I 
     <lb/>
     can see, it is this—that nearly all our local 
     <lb/>
     revenue is to be taken from us, and we are 
     <lb/>
     to be allowed a subsidy of eighty cents per 
     <lb/>
     head. And yet this is not all. There will 
     <lb/>
     be a debt of $5,000,000 to be shared between 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada ; and how is this 
     <lb/>
     sharing to be brought about ? If, as we are 
     <lb/>
     told, Lower Canada is to be charged with 
     <lb/>
     the payment of the debt contracted for the 
     <lb/>
     redemption of the Seigniorial Tenure, that 
     <lb/>
     alone will represent a capital of about 
     <lb/>
     $4,118,202, including $891,500 indemnity 
     <lb/>
     to the townships. Is Lower Canada to 
     <lb/>
     undertake the payment of that sum ? Cer<lb break="no"/>tain sources of revenue in Lower Canada are 
     <lb/>
     devoted to the redemption of the Seigniorial 
     <lb/>
     Tenure, but if the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     absorbs these sources of revenue, who will 
     <lb/>
     assure us that the Local Government will not 
     <lb/>
     repudiate the Seigniorial debt now by the 
     <lb/>
     Federal scheme sought to be imposed on it? 
     <lb/>
     The Local Legislature will say, perhaps, that 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government has not the right 
     <lb/>
     of annulling the act which imposes on 
     <lb/>
     United Canada the payment of the indemnity 
     <lb/>
     to the seigniors, and will probably refuse to 
     <lb/>
     assume the whole responsibility of it, alleging 
     <lb/>
     that the General Government ought to pay 
     <lb/>
     it. And if the Local Government takes this   
     <lb/>
     course, what will the General Government 
     <lb/>
     do ? On this question it will be easy to 
     <lb/>
     excite the passions of the people, prejudiced 
     <lb/>
     as they already are against the seigniors. 
     <lb/>
     Chiefly, and above all, we are bound to res<lb break="no"/>pect vested rights. We are recommended 
     <lb/>
     to vote with blind confidence, but we are 
     <lb/>
     refused the details, which might satisfy the 
     <lb/>
     country and the honorable members of this 
     <lb/>
     House. Why not lay the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the Local Government before the House? 
     <lb/>
     We are told that the possession of her civil 
     <lb/>
     code is to be guaranteed to Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but we are not informed how it is to be done. 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="192" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0192.jpg"/>  <!-- GL Comment, forgot <fw> here, I am going to stop reviewing, maybe you haven't fixed yet? -->
          
     Then the Federal Government will have 
     <lb/>
     the right of settling questions of divorce 
     <lb/>
     and marriage. With respect to divorce I 
     <lb/>
     shall make no remarks, because I think it 
     <lb/>
     best that the decision of such questions 
     <lb/>
     should be left to the General Government, 
     <lb/>
     an exception being made in favor of co— 
     <lb break="yes"/>religionists. What shall I say on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of marriage—the basis of all our 
     <lb/>
     institutions ? Is it not dangerous to have it 
     <lb/>
     at the mercy of the Federal Government? 
     <lb/>
     We shall soon be told probably that it is but 
     <lb/>
     a sounding affair, and before long, mayors 
     <lb/>
     will take the place of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">curés</hi>, and will 
     <lb/>
     celebrate the marriages of their constituents. 
     <lb/>
     Our laws which regulate our marriages at 
     <lb/>resent are very important to us, and are 
     <lb/>
     based on the Roman law. These are the 
     <lb/>
     only laws suitable to Canadians, and the wise 
     <lb/>
     provisions characterizing them were the fruit 
     <lb/>
     of the experience of several ages. We 
     <lb/>
     should not incur the risk of any change in 
     <lb/>
     them by a legislature, the majority of whose 
     <lb/>
     members do not hold our Opinions on this 
     <lb/>
     subject. The hon. member (Hon. Sir N. F. 
     <lb/>
     BELLEAU) might have favored us with his 
     <lb/>
     opinion on this head, but he did not, and I 
     <lb/>
     regret that he did not. There is another 
     <lb/>
     question deeply interesting to Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but it seems that on that neither must we 
     <lb/>
     permit ourselves to speak. That question 
     <lb/>
     relates to the interest of money. Do we 
     <lb/>
     not know that the question of the rate of 
     <lb/>
     interest has something to do with our civil 
     <lb/>
     laws? Is that also of no importance? An 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada majority has already sad<lb break="no"/>dled us with a law abolishing the rate of 
     <lb/>
     interest. Free trade in money was not 
     <lb/>
     suitable to Lower Canada, and the right of 
     <lb/>
     legislating on the question is now sought to 
     <lb/>
     be entrusted to the Federal Government. 
     <lb/>
     What will be the result? Who will assure 
     <lb/>
     us that the law limiting the rate of interest 
     <lb/>
     will not be repealed as it respects all cases, 
     <lb/>
     and that banks and corporations will not be 
     <lb/>
     allowed to exact such rates of interest as 
     <lb/>
     they may think fit, as private persons may 
     <lb/>
     now. This might become the fate of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Why not allow the local legislatures 
     <lb/>
     to regulate the question according to the 
     <lb/>
     exigencies and the ideas of communities 
     <lb/>
     which they represent, as the same is now 
     <lb/>
     fixed and decided in the United States, where 
     <lb/>
     the rate of interest varies in the several 
     <lb/>
     states? Thus Lower Canada will be pre<lb break="no"/>vented from regulating a question which has 
     <lb/>
     been decided for us by Upper Canada against 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     our wishes. I confess that I am surprised 
     <lb/>
     at this, because I see in the present Admin<lb break="no"/>istration men who have done battle at my 
     <lb/>
     side on that very question. The local legis<lb break="no"/>latures will have the power of making laws 
     <lb/>
     on the subjects of immigration and agricul<lb break="no"/>ture; but the Federal egislature will have 
     <lb/>
     the same pow er, and it is evident that it will 
     <lb/>
     have the upper hand on these matters; that 
     <lb/>
     the laws of Lower Canada, for instance, may 
     <lb/>
     be overridden by means of the veto of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government. But there is some<lb break="no"/>thing yet more fraught with danger for us. 
     <lb/>
     The Federal Government will have the right 
     <lb/>
     of imposing taxes on the lprovinces without 
     <lb/>
     the concurrence of the coal governments. 
     <lb/>
     Under article five of the 29th resolution, the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government may raise moneys by 
     <lb/>
     all modes or systems of taxation, and I look 
     <lb/>
     upon this power as most excessive. Thus, 
     <lb/>
     in case it should happen, as I said a moment 
     <lb/>
     ago, that the Lower Canada Government 
     <lb/>
     refused to undertake the payment of the debt 
     <lb/>
     contracted for the redemption of the Seig<lb break="no"/>niorial Tenure, the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     would have two methods of compelling it to 
     <lb/>
     do so. First, by retaining the amount out 
     <lb/>
     of the eighty cents per head indemnity to 
     <lb/>
     be accorded to the Local Government, and 
     <lb/>
     secondly, by imposing a local and direct 
     <lb/>
     tax. The Lieutenant Governor of the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government will be appointed by the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government, and will be guided by its 
     <lb/>
     instructions. We are not told whether the 
     <lb/>
     Local Government will be responsible to the 
     <lb/>
     Local Legislature; whether there will be only 
     <lb/>
     one or two branches of the Legislature, nor 
     <lb/>
     how the Legislative Council will be com<lb break="no"/>posed, if there is to be one; we are refused 
     <lb/>
     any information whatsoever on these points, 
     <lb/>
     which are nevertheless of some importance. 
     <lb/>
     I regret, therefore, that the amendment pro<lb break="no"/>posed yesterday by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Grandville, should have been rejected, since 
     <lb/>
     it would have enabled us to obtain important 
     <lb/>
     information before voting on the question. 
     <lb/>
     I do not see that the reasons advanced yes<lb break="no"/>terday by the Hon. Sir N. F. BELLBAU, to 
     <lb/>
     justify the haste with which it is attempted 
     <lb/>
     to pass this measure, are legitimate and 
     <lb/>
     conclusive. We are told that the present 
     <lb/>
     Ministry in England is in favor of this pro. 
     <lb/>
     ject. For my part I do not think the measure 
     <lb/>
     will be adopted without important amend<lb break="no"/>ments. Unfortunately the measure will. 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, be amended in England in a sense 
     <lb/>
    ighly prejudicial to Lower Canada in 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="193" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0193.jpg"/>
            
     particular. We shall probably see influences 
     <lb/>
     brought to hear there, as occurred once be— 
     <lb/>
     fore when the Legislative Council was made 
     <lb/>
     elective.  The Lower Canada members will 
     <lb/>
     recollect that when the law was passed in 
     <lb/>
     England, under influences which to this 
     <lb/>
     day remains unearthed, the clause was blot<lb break="no"/>ted out from our Constitution which we in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada justly regarded as our only 
     <lb/>
     safeguard against the encroachments and 
     <lb/>
     the domination of Upper Canada ; and 
     <lb/>
     in point of fact, for the striking out or 
     <lb/>
     changing of that clause, Upper Canada would 
     <lb/>
     never have demanded representation by 
     <lb/>
     population, and the difficulties which have 
     <lb/>
     resulted from this question would not have 
     <lb/>
     occurred, and we should have heard nothing 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederation measure which is now 
     <lb/>
     before us. Had the people of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     been well convinced that the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     could not he changed, they would have sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to sacrifices rather than create a 
     <lb/>
     useless agitation. It is said that we are to 
     <lb/>
     have guarantees for our institutions. But 
     <lb/>
     who will say that the guarantees left to us 
     <lb/>
     may not vanish when the measure reaches 
     <lb/>
     England, in the same way as the guarantee 
     <lb/>
     we had against representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion ? At all events I still maintain that our 
     <lb/>
     institutions are not guaranteed in any way 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever, and this is clearly shown by Sir 
     <lb/>
     N. F. BELLEAU himself, as I have already 
     <lb/>
     had occasion to prove. We are asked to 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice the election of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council ; but is the system proposed a better 
     <lb/>
     one ? I do not think so, for to my mind the 
     <lb/>
     mode in which it is proposed to constitute 
     <lb/>
     that House appears to be unsound in every 
     <lb/>
     way. Not only are the people to be deprived 
     <lb/>
     of an important right, but the prerogative of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown is to be infringed by limiting the 
     <lb/>
     number of members to be appointed. It is 
     <lb/>
     painful to take a backward step of this kind, 
     <lb/>
     and to abandon a reform, the fruit of the 
     <lb/>
     persevering struggles of so many eminent 
     <lb/>
     men ; and I believe that if we consent to this 
     <lb/>
     change, the consequences of the act will soon 
     <lb/>
     be seen. In order to show that the defects 
     <lb/>
     of the system are very real, I will cite the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the Hon. the Secretary of State 
     <lb/>
     for the Colonies, set forth in his despatch to 
     <lb/>
     the Governor General, relative to the project 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation and to the new Constitution 
     <lb/>
     for the Legislative Council. This is what 
     <lb/>
     Mr. CARDWELL says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The second point which Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment desire should be reconsidered is the Consti<lb break="no"/><cb/>tution of the Legislative Council. They appre<lb break="no"/>ciate the considerations which have influenced the 
     <lb/>Conference in determining the mode in which this 
     <lb/>body, so important to the constitution of the 
     <lb/>Legislature, should be composed. But it appears 
     <lb/>to them to require further consideration, whether, 
     <lb/>if the members be appointed for life, and their 
     <lb/>number be fixed, there will be any sufficient 
     <lb/>means of restoring harmony between the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council and the popular Assembly, if it shall 
     <lb/>ever unfortunately happen that a decided differ<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion shall arise between them. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

    <p>
     After this formal condemnation of the pro<lb break="no"/>ject of Confederation, and in view of our 
     <lb/>
     own experience, it seems to me that we are 
     <lb/>
     quite justified in opposing it, and in antici<lb break="no"/>pating that the Legislative Council will be<lb break="no"/>come again, as it formerly was, an obstacle in 
     <lb/>
     the way of all reform and of all progress, 
     <lb/>
     unless the present plan of Confederation be 
     <lb/>
     amended. (Cheers.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. Mr. FERRIER</persName> said—Honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, I had almost resolved to give a 
     <lb/>
     silent vote for the resolutions now before the 
     <lb/>
     House, but having, especially since I have 
     <lb/>
     had the honour of a seat in the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council, been accustomed to take note of 
     <lb/>
     passing events in the history of Canada, I 
     <lb/>
     think I may he allowed to occupy a short 
     <lb/>
     time in speaking of what has transpired in 
     <lb/>
     this country in past years, and more particu<lb break="no"/>larly of what has transpired within the last 
     <lb/>
     twelve months. In past years there were two 
     <lb/>
     great questions which agitated both East<lb break="no"/>ern and Western Canada. The one was the 
     <lb/>
     Seigniorial question in Lower Canada ; the 
     <lb/>
     other was the Clergy Reserve question in 
     <lb/>
     Western Canada. These two questions, for 
     <lb/>
     many years, occupied the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature and of the statesmen conducting 
     <lb/>
     successive governments. At last a settlement 
     <lb/>
     of these important questions was arrived at— 
     <lb/>
     I believe satisfactory to the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     people. Since that the no great questions 
     <lb/>
     of public interest have occupied the minds of 
     <lb/>
     the people, or have been urged either by the 
     <lb/>
     Government of the day or by the leaders of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition. The consequence has been 
     <lb/>
     that a political warfare has been waged in 
     <lb/>
     Canada for many years, of a nature calculated 
     <lb/>
     almost to destroy all correct political and 
     <lb/>
     moral principle, both in the Legislature and 
     <lb/>
     out of it. Has it not been the fact that any 
     <lb/>
     man who, through life, had sustained a good 
     <lb/>
     character, either as a private individual or a 
     <lb/>
     professional man, no sooner accepted office in 
     <lb/>
     the Government than the Opposition and the 
     <lb/>
     Oppsition papers would attack him at once 
     <lb/>
     as giving joined a very doubtful company? 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="194" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0194.jpg"/>
            
     Or, when a man of plain sense came and vis<lb break="no"/>ited the Legislature, and took his seat in the 
     <lb/>
     galleries to listen to the debates, did he not 
     <lb/>
     hear so frequently the charges of political crime, 
     <lb/>
    bribery and corruption, that he left the House 
     <lb/>with very different views from those with 
     <lb/>which he entered it ? Every member of Par<lb break="no"/>liament has felt this demoralizing influence, 
     <lb/>and it has met him at the polls, and nothing 
     <lb/>but money, in some cases, could secure his 
     <lb/>election. (Hear, hear.) I come now to the 
     <lb/>period of 1863-64, when we find two political 
     <lb/>parties nearly equal in strength, with a ma<lb break="no"/>jority supporting the Government of only two 
     <lb/>or three. That Government found it neces<lb break="no"/>sary to appeal to the country by a general 
     <lb/>election. After that election the Government 
     <lb/>of the honorable and gallant Knight (Hon. 
     <lb/>Sir E. P. TACHÉ) was formed. It existed 
     <lb/>only a very short time, and on the 14th of 
     <lb/>June of last year came what has been called 
     <lb/>the dead-lock. Then, honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/> there was, for eight or ten days, a breathing 
     <lb/>time for the parties who had been engaged in 
     <lb/>this political strife. It was a breathing time 
     <lb/>to them, as it were, to reflect upon the past 
     <lb/>and to endeavor to look forward to the future. 
     <lb/>It had been thought by many that the spirit 
     <lb/>of patriotism in the hearts of our statesmen 
     <lb/>was a dead principle. In their strife they 
     <lb/>seemed to have forgotten the best interests of 
     <lb/>Canada. But, during these ten days, the spirit 
     <lb/>of patriotism revived. This was a memorable 
     <lb/>period in the history of Canada. The leader 
     <lb/>of the Opposition, the Hon. GEORGE BROWN 
     <lb/>—I speak it to his honor—was the first to 
     <lb/>declare what he was ready to do, and what he 
     <lb/>proposed was so reasonable that very soon the 
     <lb/>acceptance of his propositions was brought 
     <lb/>about. I have pleasing recollections in refer<lb break="no"/>ring to that period, particularly as having had 
     <lb/>an opportunity of giving a word of advice on 
     <lb/>the evening of the day these propositions were 
     <lb/>made. I may refer to it, as the name of the 
     <lb/>gentleman I allude to, Mr. MORRIS, a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Legislative Assembly, was incorpor<lb break="no"/>ated in the documents that were submitted to 
     <lb/>this honorable House, when the result of the 
     <lb/>resolutions was laid before us. Meeting Mr. 
     <lb/>MORRIS one evening, he informed me of what 
     <lb/>the Hon. Mr. BROWN had proposed. I thought 
     <lb/>it was so reasonable, and looked so like a 
     <lb/>deliverance from the dilemma we were in, that 
     <lb/>I recommended him at once to communicate 
     <lb/>it to the leading members of the Government, 
     <lb/>and I accompanied him to a member of the 
     <lb/>Government, who is also a member of the House, 
     <lb/>now present. He told that honorable gentle<lb break="no"/><cb/>
            
     man what Hon. Mr. BROWN had communicat<lb break="no"/>ed to him, and be (Mr. MORRIS) was author<lb break="no"/>ized to make an arrangement for the other 
     <lb/>
     members of the Government to meet Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN. We all very well remember the time 
     <lb/>
     I am speaking of, and the astonishment of 
     <lb/>
     many that a reconciliation could have taken 
     <lb/>
     place between gentlemen who had been so 
     <lb/>
     long opposed to each other. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     that I ought to repeat what was the <hi rendition="simple:italic">on-</hi> 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">dit</hi> of the day with reference to it. But, I 
     <lb/>
     think I can remember this being said, that, 
     <lb/>
     when Hon. Mr. GALT met Hon. Mr. BROWN, 
     <lb/>
     he received him with that manly, open frank<lb break="no"/>ness, which characterizes him, and that, when 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. CARTIER met Hon. Mr. BROWN, 
     <lb/>
     he looked carefully to see that his two <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge </hi>
     <lb/>
     friends were not behind him—(laughter)—and 
     <lb/>
     that when he was satisfied they were not, he 
     <lb/>
     embraced him with open arms and swore 
     <lb/>
     eternal friendship— (laughter and cheers)— 
     <lb/>
     and that Hon. Mr. MACDONALD, at a very 
     <lb/>
     quick glance, saw there was an opportunity. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—That Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     MACDONALD saw there was an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     forming a great and powerful dependency of 
     <lb/>
     the British Empire ; that the gallant Knight, 
     <lb/>
     the Premier of the Government, with his 
     <lb/>
     liberal, cautious, and comprehensive mind, 
     <lb/>
     did not object, and that the Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     of Crown Lands, with his usual courtesy ,his 
     <lb/>
     vigorous and acute mind, agreed. ( Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) To the best of my recollection, that 
     <lb/>
     was the way in which it was said out of doors 
     <lb/>
     the propositions of Hon. Mr. BROWN were re<lb break="no"/>ceived by the gentlemen composing the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of that day. You all remember how 
     <lb/>
     delighted we were to find that political bitter<lb break="no"/>ness had ceased. We all thought, in fact. 
     <lb/>
     that a political millennium had arrived—and 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition was nowhere. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     The business of the session progressed very 
     <lb/>
     rapidly, and we were soon relieved from our 
     <lb/>
     responsible duties here. Immediately after 
     <lb/>
     the close of the session, the agreement entered 
     <lb/>
     into was fully carried out. Hon. Mr BROWN 
     <lb/>
    and the other two honorable gentleman who 
     <lb/>entered the Government with him, were added 
     <lb/>to it, according to the agreement. These 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen went to the country, and 
     <lb/>they were all returned, except one, and he 
     <lb/>very soon afterwards found a place. The 
     <lb/>Government thus formed, had, I believe, a 
     <lb/>majority of two-thirds of the population of 
     <lb/>Canada in their favor ; and, so far as my ob<lb break="no"/>servation has gone, two-thirds of the pres<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="195" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0195.jpg"/>
            
     also, have supported them in this scheme of 
     <lb/>
     union. The Government, thus sustained, 
     <lb/>
     soon began to act, and their first movement 
     <lb/>
     was to take the provincial steamer and go off 
     <lb/>
     to Prince Edwar Island. I remember well 
     <lb/>
     standing on the bank of the river at Rivière 
     <lb/>
     du Loup, seeing the steamer pass down, and I 
     <lb/>
     wished them God-speed. They went to the 
     <lb/>
     Conference at Charlottetown, and I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt they acted in a manner worth of gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen going to propose a union. We know 
     <lb/>
     too that they were well received. There had 
     <lb/>
     been a growing love in these provinces towards 
     <lb/>
     Canada for some time. This was manifested 
     <lb/>
     when they gave an invitation to this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture to visit them, after the close of last ses<lb break="no"/>sion. And I only regret that the Legislature— 
     <lb/>
     every member of it—did not accept that in<lb break="no"/>vitation. Those who did, came back much 
     <lb/>
     better informed than when they went there. 
     <lb/>
     We had the satisfaction of seeing those who 
     <lb/>
     probably are going to be our partners in this 
     <lb/>
     union. And I do assure you, that for one, I 
     <lb/>
     can speak of the people of the Lower Provin<lb break="no"/>ces, as an energetic, active, industrious peo<lb break="no"/>ple, quite equal to ourselves. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And, as regards the resources of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, I had no idea of them approaching 
     <lb/>
     the reality, before I paid that visit We saw 
     <lb/>
     farms there on the banks of the River St. 
     <lb/>
     John, quite equal to any farms in our west<lb break="no"/>ern peninsula, which is called the garden of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The members of the Conference at 
     <lb/>
     Charlottetown, as I understood, after discus<lb break="no"/>sing the whole question, and arriving at some<lb break="no"/>thing like an understanding, returned to their 
     <lb/>
     respective governments, and arranged to have 
     <lb/>
     a Conference, representing in a more oflicial 
     <lb/>
     manner all the provinces. Some gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have objected that this was an unauthorized, 
     <lb/>
     self-constituted Conference. But I believe, 
     <lb/>
     it can be shewn that they had the express 
     <lb/>
     authority of the British Government for en<lb break="no"/>tering into these negotiations. The Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces sent members of their several gov<lb break="no"/>ernments, and they did more—they appointed 
     <lb/>
     the leaders of the Opposition to accompany 
     <lb/>
     them—so that the people of those provinces 
     <lb/>
     were fully represented. They did, in fact, 
     <lb/>
     what was equivalent to that which has been 
     <lb/>
     done in Canada, where our coalition Govern<lb break="no"/>ment represents both classes of politics. The 
     <lb/>
     able statesmen, composing the Conference 
     <lb/>
     which assembled at Quebec, thus represented 
     <lb/>
     the whole people of these provinces. It has 
     <lb/>
     been objected that it was impossible that a 
     <lb/>
     Conference, meeting only for a few days, could 
     <lb/>have devised a measure that would be of a <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     character which we could accept. But, hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, when men meet together 
     <lb/>
     honestly to carry out a purpose, they can do 
     <lb/>
     a great deal in a very short time. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And I believe the gentlemen com<lb break="no"/>posing the Conference which assembled here 
     <lb/>in this city were men of honest purpose, and 
     <lb/>earnestly bent on framing a Constitution that 
     <lb/>would be for the best interests of our country. 
     <lb/>We cannot expect it-to be infallible, because 
     <lb/>no human act is such; but it is of such a 
     <lb/>character that I do not think we can ever 
     <lb/>have another opportunity, if this is let slip, 
     <lb/>of receiving again a document so well calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to answer the ends designed. There 
     <lb/>could be no merely party government either 
     <lb/>here or in the Lower Provinces which could 
     <lb/>produce a document that would be so accept<lb break="no"/>able, or ought to be so, to the whole people. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I think it is unfair to make 
     <lb/>comparisons tween Upper and Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da and the Lower Provinces. When we take 
     <lb/>partners for life we take them for richer or 
     <lb/>poorer, and endow them with all our worldly 
     <lb/>goods, and I think we should go on the same 
     <lb/>principle in carrying out this union with the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces. have been surprised at 
     <lb/>some of the arguments which I have heard 
     <lb/>some of the opponents of this scheme bring 
     <lb/>against it. I was assuredly surprised at the 
     <lb/>course taken the other day by my honorable 
     <lb/>friend from Niagara (Hon. Mr. CURRIE), who, 
     <lb/>in trying to make out a point, spoke of our 
     <lb/>commercial and agricultural interets here as 
     <lb/>being very small, and in speaking of our ship<lb break="no"/>ping and the amount of tonnage employed in 
     <lb/>doing the business of Canada, said, "Oh! 
     <lb/>that only exists on paper." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. Mr. CURRIE</persName>—I beg my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend's pardon. In any remarks I made I 
     <lb/>
     certainly did not say that either the com<lb break="no"/>mercial or agricultural interests of Canada 
     <lb/>
     were small. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—When my honor— 
     <lb/>
     able friend makes this statement, I have 
     <lb/>
     nothing further to say about it. I supposed 
     <lb/>
     I was correct in the impression I gathered 
     <lb/>
     from his remarks, but I must have misunder<lb break="no"/>stood him. But I must say this, that I 
     <lb/>
     thought he was exceedingly unkind when he 
     <lb/>
     took up newspapers and read from them a cata<lb break="no"/>logue of the supposed political sins of his own 
     <lb/>
     friends, the party he formerly acted with. As 
     <lb/>
     these honorable gentlemen are now devoting 
     <lb/>
     themselves to what I regard as being for the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of the country by carrying out this 
     <lb/>
     scheme of union, I think really my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend would do better to support them. 
     <lb/>

            <pb n="196" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0196.jpg"/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—That is a matter of 
     <lb/>
     opinion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—I am giving my 
     <lb/>
     opinion—nothing more. But my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend proceeded to refer to the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Railway—(hear, hear)—that monster corpor<lb break="on"/>ation which, one would have inferred from 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend's remarks, had really 
     <lb/>
     laid desolate every district of Canada through 
     <lb/>
     which it had passed. For my own part I 
     <lb/>
     cannot understand what damage the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Railway has done to Canada. We 
     <lb/>
     have had thirteen millions sterling of English 
     <lb/>
     capital—(hear, hear.) —expended in building 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Trunk ailway and the Victoria 
     <lb/>
     Bridge, which is the greatest work in the 
     <lb/>
     world. Canada has paid somewhere about 
     <lb/>
     three millions to complete the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     --about one-fifth part of the sixteen millions 
     <lb/>
     that have been spent, and it is the cheapest 
     <lb/>
     bargain she ever made. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     have the benefit of the whole of this expen<lb break="no"/>diture. If there has been extravagance in it, 
     <lb/>
     those English stockholders have been the 
     <lb/>
     suferers. We can only have suffered a fifth 
     <lb/>
     part of what they have done, and we have 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the whole of it. That I think 
     <lb/>
     is the view we ought to take of the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Railway in connection with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Then the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way has been referred to. That road has 
     <lb/>
     become, I think, even at present a necessity. 
     <lb/>
     It should have been made some years ago, 
     <lb/>
     and it would have been made but for the 
     <lb/>
     political incapacity of the Government of that 
     <lb/>
     day, which prevented it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON MR. CURRIE</persName>—Let me remind my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend that two members of that 
     <lb/>
     Government—Hon. Messrs. MCDOUGALL and 
     <lb/>
     HOWLAND—are in the present Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—It is fortunate 
     <lb/>
     that some men see the error of their ways, 
     <lb/>
     and do better, and I trust it has been so in 
     <lb/>
     the present case. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     If we had had this road to the sea-board at 
     <lb/>
     the present time, it is very likely the Recipro<lb break="no"/>city Treaty would not have been repealed. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We want the road at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent moment for the business of the country. 
     <lb/>
     Some honorable gentlemen say that, if the 
     <lb/>
     road were made to-day, we would have nothing 
     <lb/>
     to send over it. The fact is, these honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, when they make such a statement, 
     <lb/>
     show that they have not taken the trouble to 
     <lb/>
     enquire what the position of the trade of the 
     <lb/>
     country is. For the last ten days we have 
     <lb/>
     had about 100 cars standing loaded at Point St. 
     <lb/>
     Charles, and no way of getting them off. These 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     cars are full of produce for Boston and New 
     <lb/>
     York, and the two roads leading to these 
     <lb/>
     cities have so much to do, that they are un<lb break="no"/>able to do the business of their own country 
     <lb/>
     and of ours too. And, while these cars are 
     <lb/>
     thus detained, they are wanted for Western 
     <lb/>
     Canada, where the people are evermore cry<lb break="no"/>ing for cars, and we cannot get rid of the 
     <lb/>
     produce we have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIMP1">HON. MR. SIMPSON</persName>—Will my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend state what kind of produce these cars 
     <lb/>
     are loaded with, and where it came from ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—The whole, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve, is the produce of Canada. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     One portion of it is for the supply of New 
     <lb/>
     York and Boston, or for shipment there; and 
     <lb/>
     another portion is to be distributed along the 
     <lb/>
     routes by which these railways run. I was 
     <lb/>
     so particular as to make these enquiries of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. BRYDGES the day before yesterday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIMP1">HON.MR. SIMPSON</persName>—I saw Mr. BRYDGES 
     <lb/>
     too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—We have also a 
     <lb/>
     large accumulation of cars standing full of pro<lb break="no"/>duce at Portland, and no ships to take it away. 
     <lb/>
     Such is the present state of the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Railway, and it is a very awkward position to 
     <lb/>
     be placed in. As the gallant Knight (Hon. Sir 
     <lb/>
     E. P. TACHÉ) told us the other day, it is just as 
     <lb/>
     if a neighbor's farm stood between us and the 
     <lb/>
     highway. That is the position of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, they stand between Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     sea board, and they have now been pleased to 
     <lb/>
     say, "we will not allow you to pass through 
     <lb/>
     our farm "—because, although the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     Treaty is not yet repealed, they have put a 
     <lb/>
     check on intercourse by this passport system, 
     <lb/>
     and by the way in which they work the 
     <lb/>
     present law with reference to the produce we 
     <lb/>
     are taking along. For instance, if pork is sent 
     <lb/>
     on, an affidavit must be put in that that pork 
     <lb/>
     is the produce of Canada. Now, it is a diffi<lb break="no"/>cult thing to make such an affidavit. At this 
     <lb/>
     season of the year loads of pork come from all 
     <lb/>
     quarters, and after it is all packed into a 
     <lb/>
     barrel, it is almost impossible for any man to 
     <lb/>
     make an affidavit where it was raised. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is the same with flour. A miller 
     <lb/>
     frequently mixes flour brought in from the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and how is an aflidavit to be 
     <lb/>
     made whether that flour is mixed or not '? 
     <lb/>
     There may be four-fifths of it the produce of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and yet the other fifth prevents it 
     <lb/>
     from going. Hence, the trade is so hampered 
     <lb/>
     by all these obstructions put in the way by the 
     <lb/>
     United States Government, that it is very 
     <lb/>
     seriously interfered with. And, that being 
     <lb/>
     the position of our trade, I beg to ask whether 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="197" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0197.jpg"/>
            
     the Intercolonial Railroad is not now wanted? 
     <lb/>
     I have some memoranda here taken from some 
     <lb/>
     statements I have had an opportunity of looking 
     <lb/>
     at, and I find that the Lower Provinces re<lb break="no"/>quire 600,000 barrels of flour and grain an<lb break="no"/>nually beyond what they raise themselves. 
     <lb/>
     Now that they take flour from Boston and 
     <lb/>
     from Portland, a considerable quantity of it 
     <lb/>
     is carried down by the Grand Trunk Railway 
     <lb/>
     to Portland. It is then taken round to St. 
     <lb/>
     John, and is taken up the St. John river, 
     <lb/>
     and distributed all the way along, until within 
     <lb/>
     sixty miles of our own Canadian frontier at 
     <lb/>
     Rivièra du Loup. Now, I would ask any 
     <lb/>
     sensible man whether it would not be as easy 
     <lb/>
     for the Intercolonial Railway to take this pro<lb break="no"/>duce and distribute it along the line, just as 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Trunk is now doing in the State 
     <lb/>
     of Maine? St. John is just 600 miles from 
     <lb/>
     Montreal—the same distance that Portland is 
     <lb/>
     from Sarnia. Well, to move this quantity of 
     <lb/>
     flour that I have mentioned, 600,000 barrels, 
     <lb/>
     would occupy one train every working day 
     <lb/>
     through the year. I think that is a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     answer to any honorable gentleman who says 
     <lb/>
     there is nothing to do for this Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway. (Hear, hear.) In 1862, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick sold goods to the United States to 
     <lb/>
     the value of $880,000, and purchased $2,916,<lb break="no"/>000—thus paying to the United States $2, 
     <lb/>
     000,000 in hard cash. Nova Scotia exported 
     <lb/>
     $1,879,000 to the United States, and pur<lb break="no"/>chased from the United States $3,860,000— 
     <lb/>
     thus paying them another S2,000,000. These 
     <lb/>
     two provinces, therefore, paid to the United 
     <lb/>
     States in one year, the sum of four millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars. There is a trade now between the 
     <lb/>
     United States and those provinces of ten 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars a year. The proposed 
     <lb/>
    abrogation of the Reciprocity Treaty discards 
     <lb/>that trade, and should we not here in Canada 
     <lb/>lay hold of it ? (Hear, hear.) Is not every 
     <lb/>mercantile man wide awake and ready to lay 
     <lb/>hold of it at once, if there was a possibility of 
     <lb/>doing so ? but there is no such possibility, 
     <lb/>excepting by the Intercolonial Railroad. 
     <lb/>Another thing I wish to point out is, that half 
     <lb/>the importations of tea into New Brunswick 
     <lb/>and Nova Scotia are supplied from the United 
     <lb/>States. Now, that is precisely an article 
     <lb/>which we could send along the railway at a 
     <lb/>very low figure—and every honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man is well aware that Montreal and Quebec 
     <lb/>compete with New York and Boston in the 
     <lb/>tea trade. Upper Canada merchants know 
     <lb/>that they would never go to Montreal to pur<lb break="no"/>chase the large cargoes of tea sold there if 
     <lb/>they could do better in New York. And I 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     maintain, therefore, that Quebec and Mon<lb break="no"/>treal are in a position, as soon as they have 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity, to do the business of those 
     <lb/>
     provinces, better, in fact, than the United 
     <lb/>
     States can do. (Hear, hear.) Under the 
     <lb/>
     Reciprocity Treaty and the bonding system, 
     <lb/>
     in about the period of fifteen years, the trade 
     <lb/>
     between ourselves and the United States has 
     <lb/>
     increased from $9,000,000 to $37,000,000— 
     <lb/>
     being four hundred per cent. In 1862, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian imports passing through the United 
     <lb/>
     States in bond amounted to $6,000,000. And, 
     <lb/>
     unless we are careful in looking into the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of trade here as well as in the United 
     <lb/>
     States, we may lose what is absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary for the prosperity of our country. It 
     <lb/>
     requires men to be wide-awake in these days 
     <lb/>
     of rapid progress to keep pace with the march 
     <lb/>
     of events. (Hear, hear.) And I am prepared 
     <lb/>
     to shew, as I have already to some extent 
     <lb/>
     endeavored to shew, and my own mind is 
     <lb/>
     made up on it, that, before the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railroad can be made, we will have enough 
     <lb/>
     business for it to pay expenses—(hear, hear) 
     <lb/>
     —so that no loss can accrue to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     when the road is made—that is, three years 
     <lb/>
     hence, if it were set about now. But, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose, if this union is brought about, some time 
     <lb/>
     will be taken, after the Confederation is 
     <lb/>
     formed, to decide upon the mode of proceeding 
     <lb/>
     with the construction, and, if it is gone on 
     <lb/>
     with even in the most rapid manner, it would 
     <lb/>
     take at least four years before it was in full 
     <lb/>
     working order. I think it is much to be 
     <lb/>
     regretted that we have been so long in com<lb break="no"/>mencing it. In view of the present state of 
     <lb/>
     our relations with the United States, it ought 
     <lb/>
     to have been in existence now, and I say that 
     <lb/>
     in another year it would have paid expenses. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Honorable gentlemen object 
     <lb/>
     to the scheme of union because it was not 
     <lb/>
     published sufficiently to make the people of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces acquainted with it. I do not under<lb break="no"/>stand that objection. Every clause of the doc<lb break="no"/>ument now under consideration was published 
     <lb/>
     in Quebec, before the delegates left the city

     derstood very well what the word, " Private " 
     <lb/>
     meant. (Hear, hear.) I was invited to at<lb break="no"/>tend a very large meeting, comprising nearly 
     <lb/>
     all the leading merchants in Montreal, just 
     <lb/>
     after the delegates left for home. We spent 
     <lb/>
     a whole night over it ; I believe it was early 
     <lb/>
     in the morning before we parted. A third 
     <lb/>
     part of those present, I think, came apparent<lb break="no"/>ly determined to oppose the scheme. Fortu<lb break="no"/>nately we had a gentleman there who had 
     <lb/>
     made himself thoroughly acquainted with it, 
     <lb/>
     and who was able to go into explanations and 
     <lb/>
     deal with all the whys and wherefores that 
     <lb/>
     were urged by the various objectors. The 
     <lb/>
     result was, that when we closed the meeting 
     <lb/>
     there was only one man who declared himself 
     <lb/>
     positively opposed to the scheme— (hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear,)—and this man said he opposed it, be<lb break="no"/>cause, in his opinion, it would give the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians power to crush us British 
     <lb/>
     out of the Lower Provinces. I maintain, 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen, that the public opinion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada is not opposed to the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. (Hear, hear.) If it had been 
     <lb/>
     so, we should have petitions against it poured 
     <lb/>
     in upon us from every quarter. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think the scheme is perfect, but we should try 
     <lb/>
     with an honest purpose to work it out, and 
     <lb/>
     if it is found defective, it is not, of course, 
     <lb/>
     like the laws of the Medea and Persians—it 
     <lb/>
     can be altered. We have had the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of 1841 altered more than once—twice 
     <lb/>
     at least—since the union. If we find that 
     <lb/>
     some parts of the machinery do not work—if, 
     <lb/>
     after the establishment of the Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     we find some little error has been made—we 
     <lb/>
     will then, no doubt, have power and authority 
     <lb/>
     also to alter it. I trust this scheme of Feder<lb break="no"/>ation will be carried by a large majority in 
     <lb/>
     this House, as well as in the Legislative As<lb break="no"/>sembly, and that the legislatures of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces will also adopt it. If so, 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen, we shall enter on a new 
     <lb/>
     era in the history of British North America. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I believe that a Divine Provi<lb break="no"/>dence guides the destinies of nations, and 
     <lb/>
     I believe a Divine Providence has directed 
     <lb/>
     the statesmen who were present at that 
     <lb/>
     Conference in their deliberations, and has 
     <lb/>
     brought conflicting interests into harmony 
     <lb/>
     in a most wonderful way. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     What was our political condition on the 
     <lb/>
     fourteenth of June last— only about eight 
     <lb/>
     months ago ? What was our political con<lb break="no"/>dition then, and what brought the leaders 
     <lb/>
     of the political parties who were then fierce<lb break="no"/>ly contending with each other, almost as 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     in a death struggle, for power, into rela<lb break="no"/>tions of intimate friendship ? What led 
     <lb/>
     the Governments of New Brunswick, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island to send their leading statesmen, repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of both their political parties, to 
     <lb/>
     meet our Coalition Government ? I say it 
     <lb/>
     was an over-ruling Providence. A party gov<lb break="no"/>ernment could never have arrived at such a 
     <lb/>
     scheme of union as this. If we reject this 
     <lb/>
     proposed Confederation, we refuse to lay the 
     <lb/>
     foundations of a great nation, as a depen<lb break="no"/>dency of the British Empire. When I came 
     <lb/>
     of age I considered what country I should 
     <lb/>
     adopt. I adopted Canada. I have now lived 
     <lb/>
     in it for forty-four years. I have been iden<lb break="no"/>tified with the progress of its institutions— 
     <lb/>
     of those at any rate of Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     particularly of Montreal. I have had the 
     <lb/>
     pleasure of taking part with others in organ<lb break="no"/>izing some of them. I have seen some of 
     <lb/>
     them prosper, and others that will probably 
     <lb/>
     fail, as we may expect will be the case 
     <lb/>
     in a new country. I have, during these 
     <lb/>
     years also, travelled over a large part of 
     <lb/>
     Europe. I have travelled too over parts of 
     <lb/>
     Asia and Africa. I have seen people under 
     <lb/>
     monarchical governments—some of them toler<lb break="no"/>ably prosperous, others of them less so. I 
     <lb/>
     have seen people under despotic governments 
     <lb/>
     —some of them pretty comfortable, and others 
     <lb/>
     crushed down to the lowest depths of slavery. 
     <lb/>
     I have seen republican governments in Eu<lb break="no"/>rope, and of course I have seen the great 
     <lb/>
     Republic here on this continent. I have seen 
     <lb/>
     people, too, living under the government of 
     <lb/>
     the Church. But I have seen no people like 
     <lb/>
     those living under the government of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, or enjoying such perfect freedom, and 
     <lb/>
     such complete protection for life and property, 
     <lb/>
     as those living under the flag of Old England. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And had I my choice to make 
     <lb/>
     to-day, after an experience of forty-four years, I 
     <lb/>
     should still choose Canada as my home. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that at my age I have not long to live ; but, 
     <lb/>
     during the time that I shall be spared on 
     <lb/>
     earth, I would be willing to devote all my 
     <lb/>
     energies to the carrying out of this scheme— 
     <lb/>
     and I do pray it may succeed—because it is 
     <lb/>
     laying anew the foundations of one of the 
     <lb/>
     most important dependencies of the British 
     <lb/>
     Empire. I trust I shall not live to see it in 
     <lb/>
     any other condition than as a dependency of 
     <lb/>
     the British Empire. Honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     I shall have pleasure in voting for the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions of the honorable and gallant Knight. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName> said :—Honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, I desire to make one or two re<lb break="no"/>marks in reply to something which fell from 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend the Commissioner of 
     <lb/>
     Crown Lands, in reference to the objections 
     <lb/>
     I took on a former occasion to the details of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme. That honorable gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     after explaining one or two minor points, dis<lb break="no"/>posed of the others by saying that I opposed 
     <lb/>
     everything. As that statement might imply, 
     <lb/>
     if honorable members of this House were not 
     <lb/>
     acquainted with me, that my course had been 
     <lb/>
     factious, I desire to state what I have op<lb break="no"/>posed. Having been always a strong advo<lb break="no"/>cate of retrenchment and financial reform, I 
     <lb/>
     have opposed the exorbitant expenses of the 
     <lb/>
     Government. I have opposed the extrava<lb break="no"/>gance which has made the expenses of the 
     <lb/>
     civil government of Canada exceed those of 
     <lb/>
     any other country on the face of the globe, 
     <lb/>
     in proportion to the revenue. I have always 
     <lb/>
     opposed the expenditure of money without 
     <lb/>
     the authority of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I have always opposed the extravagant grants 
     <lb/>
     and subsidies to the Grand Trunk Railway 
     <lb/>
     Company. (Hear, hear.) My honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend opposite (Hon. Mr. FERRIER) has 
     <lb/>
     spoken of the benefit of the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Railway, and of the great expenditure of 
     <lb/>
     English capitalists in the work. lt is true 
     <lb/>
     the work was undertaken by them, but 
     <lb/>
     Canada has borne her full share—has fulfil<lb break="no"/>led every agreement. And more than that, 
     <lb/>
     Canada has paid at the rate of thirty thousand 
     <lb/>
     dollars per mile for her railways ; Canada 
     <lb/>
     has contributed $15,142,000 in principal, 
     <lb/>
     and $5,400,000 in interest, without taking 
     <lb/>
     into consideration a large number of smaller 
     <lb/>
     matters. If a calculation be made from 
     <lb/>
     these amounts, it will be found as I have 
     <lb/>
     stated, that Canada has paid at the rate of 
     <lb/>
     $30,000 for all the railway which was re<lb break="no"/>quired, namely, from Quebec to Toronto, 
     <lb/>
     which would have connected with the Great 
     <lb/>
     Western, and formed a Trunk line through 
     <lb/>
     the province to Sarnia. If large sums have 
     <lb/>
     been expended ; if large sums have been 
     <lb/>
     squandered, have not English contractors 
     <lb/>
     benefited ? Are the people of Canada to be 
     <lb/>
     blamed ? The scheme was planned by Eng<lb break="no"/>lish capitalists, and Canada fulfilled every 
     <lb/>
     obligation. (Hear, hear.) Now, there is 
     <lb/>
     another matter which I have opposed. I 
     <lb/>
     have always opposed the loose system of 
     <lb/>
     management of the Crown lands, a system 
     <lb/>
     by which our splendid domain has been frit<lb break="no"/>tered away. I do not mean my remarks on 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     this subject to apply to my honorable friend, 
     <lb/>
    the present, Commissioner of Crown Lands. 
     <lb/>He has only been in office a few months, and 
     <lb/>I have not read his report. But I refer to 
     <lb/>the past, and I say that the whole of that 
     <lb/>domain has been squandered away in useless 
     <lb/>expenses. There is another matter which I 
     <lb/>have opposed—the Militia Bill of 1862. I 
     <lb/>admit that I opposed that measure. That 
     <lb/>was a measure which was going to entail 
     <lb/>upon the country an enormous expenditure, 
     <lb/>which would have exhausted our resources 
     <lb/>at a time when that expenditure was not 
     <lb/>required. Why, honorable gentlemen, was 
     <lb/>not the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trent</hi> difficulty settled at the time ? 
     <lb/>Had not the American Government complied 
     <lb/>with the demands of Great Britain, and what 
     <lb/>threatened us to authorize that expenditure ? 
     <lb/>There is one expenditure which I opposed, 
     <lb/>which might perhaps be questioned. I op<lb break="no"/>posed the Supply Bill in 1858, and I had 
     <lb/>then voting with me my honorable friend 
     <lb/>the Commissioner of Crown Lands. (Hear, 
     <lb/>and laughter.) Whether that vote can be 
     <lb/>defended from a constitutional point of view, I 
     <lb/>cannot say ; but every vote I have given in 
     <lb/>this House, or the other branch of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, has been given in accordance with 
     <lb/>what I conceived to be the interests of my 
     <lb/>native country. (Hear.) My honorable 
     <lb/>friend the Commissioner of Crown Lands, 
     <lb/>alluded the other day to the conservative 
     <lb/>feature of the Senate in the United States, 
     <lb/>in allowing the same representation to small 
     <lb/>states as to the larger states. But this does 
     <lb/>not at all affect the general arrangement, 
     <lb/>because the large majority are large states. 
     <lb/>But while my honorable friend approves of 
     <lb/>this portion, he should have expressed an 
     <lb/>opinion on the whole system. In the United 
     <lb/>States, no change of Constitution can be ef<lb break="no"/>fected without the consent of two-thirds of 
     <lb/>both branches of the Legislature, and that 
     <lb/>must afterwards be sanctioned by three- 
     <lb break="yes"/>fourths of the state governments. This is 
     <lb/>a conservative feature also. Then, what are 
     <lb/>the constitutions of the state governments ? 
     <lb/>I have here a clause taken from the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution of one of the states (Connecticut), 
     <lb/>which provides that :— 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Now, in addition to this, what have we 
     <lb/>
     seen ? Have we not seen changes in the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution latterly in respect to slavery, and 
     <lb/>
     have they acted upon this till they have 
     <lb/>
     been ratified by the state governments ? 
     <lb/>
     Now, compare this mode of procedure with 
     <lb/>
     that adopted in regard to the scheme—and 
     <lb/>
     very properly called a scheme—of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion submitted to this House. How were 
     <lb/>
     these delegates called into existence ? Are 
     <lb/>
     they not self-appointed ? (Hear) Did not 
     <lb/>
     the members of the Executive Council of 
     <lb/>
     Canada constitute themselves delegates ? 
     <lb/>
     (Cries of " no, no," and " yes.") And the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Executive Councils of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, did they not also constitute 
     <lb/>
     themselves delegates ? They prepared a 
     <lb/>
     scheme which they have laid before Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and what is that scheme ? It was 
     <lb/>
     embodied in resolutions sent to members of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature before the meeting of the 
     <lb/>
     House, marked " Private," both on the out<lb break="no"/>side and inside. Did any honorable member 
     <lb/>
     feel himself at liberty to go before his con<lb break="no"/>stituents and explain it to them ? Did any 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     honorable member feel himself at liberty to 
     <lb/>
     call his constituents together, and say, here 
     <lb/>
     is a scheme on which I will have to vote at 
     <lb/>
     the next session of the Legislature ? No, he 
     <lb/>
     could not do it. Some of the newspapers did 
     <lb/>
     publish what purported to be the resolutions, 
     <lb/>
     but were they copied all over the country so 
     <lb/>
     that the people might see and judge of them ? 
     <lb/>
     No, they were not, and what was the reason ? 
     <lb/>
     Did not the Provincial Secretary write his 
     <lb/>
     mandate to the press, that any newspaper 
     <lb/>
     that did not support Confederation, was not 
     <lb/>
     to receive the Government patronage ? Not 
     <lb/>
     being an elective member, I did not feel 
     <lb/>
     myself at liberty to address the people on 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions. Did any member take 
     <lb/>
     them to his constituents and explain every 
     <lb/>
     detail of them ?

     <lb/>
     scheme to my constituents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—Did my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend tell them how much this 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway was to cost, or how 
     <lb/>
     much Upper Canada was to pay for it ? That 
     <lb/>
     it was to be established by the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and kept up as a public work ? I should be 
     <lb/>
     glad to hear my honorable friend on these 
     <lb/>
     points before a popular assemblage. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear). We have been told by my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend the Commissioner of Crown Lands, 
     <lb/>
     that concessions had to be made, but how 
     <lb/>
     were these concessions made ? Unfortunate<lb break="no"/>ly they were all made one way ; they were 
     <lb/>
     made to the Lower Provinces. No conces<lb break="no"/>sions to Canada, east or west, but all in 
     <lb/>
     favor of the Lower Provinces. And could 
     <lb/>
     you expect anything else would be the result 
     <lb/>
     of the Convention, when the small province 
     <lb/>
     of Prince Edward Island, and the small pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Newfoundland, sent representatives 
     <lb/>
     in the same manner and the same number 
     <lb/>
     as the whole province of Canada ? Could it 
     <lb/>
     have been expected that the delegates from 
     <lb/>
     Canada would supply all the talent ? How<lb break="no"/>ever much I esteem the talents of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Executive Council, I believe 
     <lb/>
     there are those in the Lower Provinces who 
     <lb/>
     possess the talent necessary to arrange a 
     <lb/>
     scheme of this kind. When Canada, with 
     <lb/>
     its 3,000,000 of population and $11,000,000 
     <lb/>
     of revenue, was represented there by twelve, 
     <lb/>
     and the Maritime Provinces, with only 
     <lb/>
     800,000 of population and a revenue under 
     <lb/>
     $3,000,000, was represented by nearly two to 
     <lb/>
     one, could it be expected that a favorable 
     
            
            <pb n="201" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0201.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">201</fw>
                 arrangement could be made. (Hear.) My 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend says that they voted by 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but it was all the same. Now, 
     <lb/>
     what was the first concession? The first 
     <lb/>
     concession was in granting twenty. eight 
     <lb/>
     members of this House to those rovinces, 
     <lb/>
     with only 800,000 inhabitants an paying a 
     <lb/>
     small amount of revenue, whereas in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada we have 1,500,000 of population, and 
     <lb/>
     contribute $7,000,000 or $8,000,000 to the 
     <lb/>
     revenue, and yet have only twenty-four 
     <lb/>
     members. Here is the first concession to 
     <lb/>
     make the Lower Provinces come in to sup<lb break="no"/>port the scheme And is it not a fact that 
     <lb/>
     this House will have the control of the 
     <lb/>
     legslation to a certain extent, and are we 
     <lb/>
     not entitled to it? Then there is another 
     <lb/>
     point in connection with the Lower Pro— 
     <lb/>
     vinces, which I will here notice. The 
     <lb/>
     frmehise is lower there— it is almost univer<lb break="no"/>sal. Persons entered upon the assessment 
     <lb/>
     roll for a small amount of personal property 
     <lb/>
     may vote for members of the Confederate 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. Here members are elected by 
     <lb/>
     persons assessed for real property to a certain 
     <lb/>
     amount. This is another matter which 
     <lb/>
     should have been attended to. It is not 
     <lb/>
     right that members should be sent to the 
     <lb/>
     General Parliament on these terms. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The whole scheme is, in fact, a 
     <lb/>
     history of concessions, and all on one side. 
     <lb/>
     The arrangement of the public debt at a 
     <lb/>
     rate per head, instead of according to re<lb break="no"/>venue, isanother mistake. My friend, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Saugeen Division, 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. MACPHERSON), stated the other 
     <lb/>day that my arguments were fallacious;<lb/>
    that in this case the rate per head of 
     <lb/>population was the one which ought to 
     <lb/>be adopted. Is not the revenue the 
     <lb/>means of payment of the debt? In popula<lb break="no"/>tion to be considered? I will satisfy my 
     <lb/>honorable friend that his reasoning was not 
     <lb/>correct, at least it is not what I would ex<lb break="no"/>pect from a gentleman occupying the position 
     <lb/>he does in the country. Is population al<lb break="no"/>ways wealth? No. It is wealth when it 
     <lb/>can be profitably employed ; it is wealth 
     <lb/>when you can employ it in manufactures, or 
     <lb/>in the cultivation of good farming lands; 
     <lb/>but look at the case of Ireland, where popu-   
     <lb/>lation has been a source of poverty . 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACP1">HON. MR. MACPHERSON</persName>— What I said 
     <lb/>was, that past revenue was not a fair cri<lb break="no"/>terion of what each province was to pay. 
     <lb/>In future we would have a uniform tariff. I 
     <lb/>am sure that my honorable friend will not 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     say that in this country population is a source 
     <lb/>
     of poverty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—My honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend says he adopts one plan for the past 
     <lb/>
     and another for the future. What justice 
     <lb/>
     is there in that? We have only to look at 
     <lb/>
     the roposed system to see the effect it has. 
     <lb/>
     If New Brunswick, with a million revenue, 
     <lb/>
     be allowed to put her debt of seven millions 
     <lb/>
     upon the Confederation, then, upon the same 
     <lb/>
     rule, Canada should enter into the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with all her debt and more. The esti<lb break="no"/>mated revenue of Canada in eleven millions. 
     <lb/>
     Any one could figure that out and see that 
     <lb/>
     Canada should have had no debt left for the 
     <lb/>
     local governments to pay; but on this prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of concession, why, of course, Canada 
     <lb/>
     must suffer. Now, to shew the working of 
     <lb/>
     the system, look at the effect of the rate of 
     <lb/>
     80 cents a head. Upper Canada will pay 
     <lb/>
     $1,540,000 to the General Government, and 
     <lb/>
     receive back $1,120,000 for the Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment—that is, supposing Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     contributes two-thirds of the revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     united provinces. That has been admitted 
     <lb/>
     by one who now holds a hi gh position in the 
     <lb/>
     Government. This is the fine scheme which 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend from Saugeen lauds. 
     <lb/>
     You pay according to wealth, and the dif<lb break="no"/>ference against Upper Canada is $420,000, 
     <lb/>
     or in other words, Upper Canada pays 
     <lb/>
     $1,540,000 out of one pocket and receives 
     <lb/>
     back $1,120,000 in the other. This is the 
     <lb/>
     working of the system which has been car<lb break="no"/>ried out, very much against the interests of 
     <lb/>
     not only Upper Canada but all Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     third concession is the amount to be paid to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, as a set-off against or not 
     <lb/>
     being indebted. There may be, I admit, a 
     <lb/>
     show of fairness in this, but the sum is a great 
     <lb/>
     deal too large. Canada will go on increasing, 
     <lb/>
     whereas from Newfoundland we can expect 
     <lb/>
     very little. The fourth matter is that of the 80 
     <lb/>
     cents a head. to which I have just alluded, 
     <lb/>
     and I have shown the working of that, and 
     <lb/>
     it is decidedly against it. Then comes 
     <lb/>
     the $63,000 a year to New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     for ten years. I was very glad to hear 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend from Saugeen (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. MACPHERSON) disapprove of that. I 
     <lb/>
     am glad to find him, so strong a supporter of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, admit that that was wrong. I 
     <lb/>
     have made my calculation in an Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada point of view. So long as the union 
     <lb/>
     was maintained, however, my voice was never 
     <lb/>
     raised by way of comparison. I desire to 
     <lb/>
     maintain that union. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="202" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0202.jpg"/>
           
     now we are forced to take this scheme as it 
     <lb/>
     is, without any amendment in any particular. 
     <lb/>
     I only now wish to point out that of the 
     <lb/>
     principal which this $63,000 represents, and 
     <lb/>
     which my honorable friend from Saugeen 
     <lb/>
     cannot endorse. Upper Canada will have to 
     <lb/>
    pay $367,000. Then $150,000 a-year to 
     <lb/>Newfoundland is a sixth concession, made 
     <lb/>for worthless lands. This is equal to a capi<lb break="no"/>tal of three millions. The lands of the other 
     <lb/>provinces are well taken care of ; but those 
     <lb/>in Newfoundland, what are they worth ? 
     <lb/>They are entirely valueless. When my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend the Commissioner of Crown 
     <lb/>Lands has all these lands to control, I am 
     <lb/>sure he will have his hands full. The lands 
     <lb/>of other provinces were worth retaining, and 
     <lb/>they were left under their own management ; 
     <lb/>but as these happened to be good for nothing, 
     <lb/>they were put upon the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Had they been good for anything, 
     <lb/>they would also have been reserved. There 
     <lb/>is another question. It is proposed to take 
     <lb/>the government railways of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>and Nova Scotia, and make them provincial 
     <lb/>works. I suppose we shall be told that the 
     <lb/>canals of Canada are also taken, and made 
     <lb/>public works of the Confederation. But 
     <lb/>there is a very great difference between these. 
     <lb/>The railways had only an existence of a few 
     <lb/>years, they would be worn out soon, and 
     <lb/>must be kept up at the expense of the Con<lb break="no"/>federate Government. What advantage 
     <lb/>could they be to the Confederate Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ? What are our expenses now for 
     <lb/>public works ? Have we not seen the tolls 
     <lb/>removed on our canals, and will it not be a 
     <lb/>part of the policy of the Confederate Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to remove the rates paid on these 
     <lb/>railways, and they will be kept up, as all 
     <lb/>public works are, at an enormous loss to the 
     <lb/>Government. (Hear, hear.) My honorable 
     <lb/>friend from Niagara the other day, I thought, 
     <lb/>on one point, was not quite correct in what 
     <lb/>he said in respect to Upper Canada. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter, and hear, hear.) From the census of 
     <lb/>1861, I find that the cash-value of farms in 
     <lb/>Upper Canada was $295,162,315, and in 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, $168,432,546, making a total 
     <lb/>of $463,594,861. The live stock in Upper 
     <lb/>Canada was valued at $53,227,516 ; in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, $24,572,124. Wheat, Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada, $24,640,425 ; Lower Canada, $2,563,<lb break="no"/>114. Other grains, Upper Canada, $38,<lb break="no"/>123,340 ; Lower Canada, $23,534,703. Now, 
     <lb/>in timber, mineral wealth, manufactures and 
     <lb/>fisheries, Upper Canada is quite equal to 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     Lower Canada and the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I believe that if Upper Canada could be left 
     <lb/>
     alone, if it was not to be burthened and its 
     <lb/>
     back broken by these concessions, the whole 
     <lb/>
     of Canada would become still more prosper<lb break="no"/>ous, provided we did not enter into any 
     <lb/>
     further useless and wasteful expenditure. 
     <lb/>
     Compare these resources with those of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces ! The gallant Premier, 
     <lb/>
     the other day, stated something with respect 
     <lb/>
     to the wealth of those provinces—with res<lb break="no"/>pect to their mines and timber. But the 
     <lb/>
     timber must become exhausted, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently that country cannot grow richer ; 
     <lb/>
     whilst in Canada, with a good productive 
     <lb/>
     soil and an industrious population, we must 
     <lb/>
     go on increasing in wealth. What is the 
     <lb/>
     value of the mines which we are to get ? In 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia the royalty on coal is only $28,<lb break="no"/>000, and the revenue derived from the gold 
     <lb/>
     fields, $20,000 ; and what else have we to 
     <lb/>
     obtain from these provinces ? Why, in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia they have no timber, and con<lb break="no"/>sequently their revenue cannot increase ; 
     <lb/>
     whilst we in Canada must inevitably go on 
     <lb/>
     and grow in prosperity, because the ele<lb break="no"/>ments of our wealth are in the soil and 
     <lb/>
     climate. (Hear, hear) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—Surely my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend does not pretend to say that the 
     <lb/>
     revenue of Nova Scotia cannot increase ? 
     <lb/>
     Why, it has doubled in one year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—What else have 
     <lb/>
     they besides their coal fields ? It is not 
     <lb/>
     pretended that they have any timber. If 
     <lb/>
     you increase the tariff, you will increase the 
     <lb/>
     revenue ; but it must not be expected that 
     <lb/>
     the revenue can be doubled. They will 
     <lb/>
     lessen their consumption if you increase the 
     <lb/>
     tariff. It is fallacious reasoning to say that 
     <lb/>
     when you double the tariff you double the 
     <lb/>
     revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—For the year 
     <lb/>
     1859, the revenue of Nova Scotia was 
     <lb/>
     $689,000, and it increased the next year to 
     <lb/>
     $1,249,000, and went on increasing, and yet 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend says that it cannot in<lb break="no"/>crease. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—I have not the 
     <lb/>
     statements which the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has noted from, but the figures I have given 
     <lb/>
     are those of 1862. There are excise duties, 
     <lb/>
     but I believe that the local duties will be 
     <lb/>
     paid to the local governments. The com<lb break="no"/>plaint which has been made by Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     has been, that although they contributed 
     <lb/>
     two-thirds or three-fourths of the revenue, 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="203" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0203.jpg"/>
            
     they did not possess a corresponding control 
     <lb/>
     of the legislation, and that they did not re<lb break="no"/>ceive back in proportion to the amount they 
     <lb/>
     paid. Will this be remedied by this mea<lb break="no"/>sure ? Draw a line east of Montreal, and do 
     <lb/>
     you not find the control of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     there, in consequence of the concessions 
     <lb/>
     made to the Maritime Provinces ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—The balance 
     <lb/>
     will be restored when the Red River Settle<lb break="no"/>ment comes in.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—I am afraid that 
     <lb/>
     no one here will live to see that country 
     <lb/>
     come in. I have listened with a good deal 
     <lb/>
     of attention to the speeches of my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friends, and I have read the reports of the 
     <lb/>
     debates in the other branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, and the only argument I have heard 
     <lb/>brought forward in favor of this scheme, is 
     <lb/>that it will strengthen the connection with 
     <lb/>the Mother Country. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen, I yield to no one in 
     <lb/>saying that that connection ought not to be 
     <lb/>broken. I say we are infinitely better here 
     <lb/>under the flag of Great Britain than under 
     <lb/>that of the United States. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>But no reason is assigned ; we are not told 
     <lb/>in what way the connection is to be strength<lb break="no"/>ened. Can you alter the geographical posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the country ? Will you have any more
     <lb/>people or means ? Your revenue is not 
     <lb/>increased, nor is your population, nor is your 
     <lb/>geographical position altered. Is it because 
     <lb/>the people of the Lower Provinces are ready 
     <lb/>to expend a large sum for the defence of the 
     <lb/>country ? Why, to show you what those 
     <lb/>provinces consider it necessary to do in this 
     <lb/>direction, I will read a short extract from a 
     <lb/>statement of the Financial Secretary of Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia :—

            </p>
   
    <p>
     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">As regards the sum proposed to be granted for

     danger from our neighbors across the line.

     But something more was said by the Fin<lb break="no"/>ancial Secretary. The present Premier was 
     <lb/>
     pressing to strike out this item and put

     $8,000 instead, and the Financial Secretary

     The honor of the country was at stake in 
     <lb/>
     this $20,000. New Brunswick the same year 
     <lb/>
     spent $15,000. Now, I opposed the expen<lb break="no"/>sive Militia Bill submitted to this House ; 
     <lb/>
     but then the Government had expended over 
     <lb/>
     half a million dollars a year in militia ex<lb break="no"/>penses ; and I admit they are going on very 
     <lb/>
    properly now. (Hear, hear.) Then we 
     <lb/>have been told that this Confederation 
     <lb/>scheme is going to raise the credit of the 
     <lb/>country. My honorable friend from Saugeen 
     <lb/>ventured the statement that on the intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of the adoption of these resolutions 
     <lb/>in the Conference reaching England, funds 
     <lb/>rose fifteen to seventeen per cent. Now, 
     <lb/>does any honorable gentleman suppose for a 
     <lb/>moment that that was the cause for this rise ? 
     <lb/>(A voice—It was.) I have here from the 
     <lb/>files of the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, the quotations of 
     <lb/>Canadian Securities, and on the 7th of 
     <lb/>November,—the date of His Excellency's 
     <lb/>letter, conveying information of the adoption 
     <lb/>of the scheme,—the inscribed stock was 86 
     <lb/>to 90.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACP1">HON. MR. MACPHERSON</persName>—I stated a 
     <lb/>
     fact when I said that that rise took place in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of the resolutions. I would like 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend to explain it in any 
     <lb/>
     other way.

     there are various causes which operate in

     raising or depressing stocks in England, 
     <lb/>
     the rate of interest of the Bank of England, 
     <lb/>
     &amp;c. Well, on the 7th of November as I 
     <lb/>
     said, the quotation was 86 to 90, and I find 
     <lb/>
     that on the 25th November, giving time for 
     <lb/>
     the news to reach England, it was only 88 
     <lb/>
     to 92. And now, with a strong probability 
     <lb/>
     of the measure passing, what is the price ?

     <persName ref="pers:MACP1">HON. MR. MACPHERSON</persName>.—I suppose 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member knows the reason of 
     <lb/>
     this decline. Soon after what was done in 
     <lb/>
     the Conference was known in England, the 
     <lb/>
     St. Alban's raid took place, and the con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the events connected with that 
     <lb/>
     was a fall of 17 or 18 per cent. in our securities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MB. SEYMOUR</persName>—In consequence 
     <lb/>
     of the wise policy of the statesmen of Eng<lb break="no"/>land friendly relations had been maintained 
     <lb/>
     with our neighbours. It is true the pass<lb break="no"/>port system was put on, but it is to be removed 
     <lb/>
     again, and all things are to become as they 
     <lb/>
     were before, with the exception, perhaps, of 
     <lb/>
     the Reciprocity Treaty. Every man of 
     <lb/>
     business knows that that rise in stocks was 
     <lb/>
     not caused by anything connected with the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme. Why should it? 
     <lb/>
     What is it that increases the value of stocks 
     <lb/>
     and depreeiates them? Is it not the confi<lb break="no"/>dence of cap italists who have invested in 
     <lb/>
     them, that the interest will be paid. But 
     <lb/>
     under this Confederation scheme will not 
     <lb/>
     our expenses be increased? This Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway must be built and kept up, and 
     <lb/>
     this must be at the cost of Canada. You 
     <lb/>
     have got your local governments to keep up, 
     <lb/>
     and you have got your Confederate Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to keep up, and if we look at the ex<lb break="no"/>perience of the past, is it likely there will 
     <lb/>
     be any reduction in the future? (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I have got figures here to show what 
     <lb/>
     the cost of the two governments was before the 
     <lb/>
     union of the provinces. The whole expense 
     <lb/>
     of the government of Lower Canada, with the 
     <lb/>
     salaries of officers, &amp;c., was £57,618. In Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada we were as economical. We were 
     <lb/>
     then under the rule of the Family Compact, 
     <lb/>
     and a worse compact we might have. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, and laughter.) They were high-mind<lb break="no"/>ed, and they did not stoop to matters of cor<lb break="no"/>ruption, as others have done since. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The whole expenses of the two gov<lb break="no"/>ernments were only a little over £100,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year. What are they now ? Some two years 
     <lb/>
     ago the expenses of the civil government 
     <lb/>
     alone, not including the cost of the militia, 
     <lb/>
     were $3,000,000. Here, in a little more 
     <lb/>
     than twenty years, the expenses have in<lb break="no"/>creased seven-fold, notwithstanding that we 
     <lb/>
     have only one Government. Now, what are 
     <lb/>
     we to expect from the Confederate Govern<lb break="no"/>ment? Every honorable member knows 
     <lb/>
     that things must be made pleasant for every<lb break="no"/>body, and when you are forming a Confed<lb break="no"/>erate Government, these expenses must be 
     <lb/>
     continued. You cannot turn people adrift, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     and you must either employ or pension them. 
     <lb/>
     Are we to suppose that because there is a 
     <lb/>
     Federation, these expenses will be lessened? 
     <lb/>
     I admit that in the Lower Provinces they 
     <lb/>
     have managed their afiairs with less expense 
     <lb/>
     than we have. But now we will have the 
     <lb/>
     local governments to pay for. We will 
     <lb/>
     have another stafl' to keep up for each pro<lb break="no"/>vince, which will add very materially to our 
     <lb/>
     expenses. The money must come out of the 
     <lb/>
     pockets of the people, who will have to pay 
     <lb/>
     it either by direct or indirect taxation. 
     <lb/>
     What possible difference can it make to the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country, whether they pay it 
     <lb/>
     directly by taxation or in duties? Direct 
     <lb/>
     taxation must be imposed, and that to a large 
     <lb/>
     extent, by the local governments. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     It being six o'clock, the SPEAKER left the _

            <p>
     After the dinner recess,— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>, continuing his 
     <lb/>
     remarks, said—I think, honorable gentlemen , 
     <lb/>
     that, taking into consideration the vast im<lb break="no"/>portance of this scheme—its importance in a 
     <lb/>
     financial point of view alone, without saying 
     <lb/>
     one word about the principle of changing the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution without consulting the people— 
     <lb/>
     there should be an appeal to the country 
     <lb/>
     before it is carried into effect. A point 
     <lb/>
     which I did not enter fully into before the 
     <lb/>
     recess was the argument that Confederation 
     <lb/>
     would strengthen the connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country. Now, do we not see all the 
     <lb/>
     financial reformers in England, with the 
     <lb/>
     Times and other influential organs of the 
     <lb/>
     press, which on financial grounds were desir<lb break="no"/>ous of separating the colonies from the parent 
     <lb/>
    state, all advocating this measure in the 
     <lb/>warmest possible manner? Undoubtedly the 
     <lb/>imperial government will sanction the scheme, 
     <lb/>but it is the policy now of that Government 
     <lb/>to sanction anything of a local character that 
     <lb/>the colonies desire. Well, in addition to 
     <lb/>the press that is favorable to the separation 
     <lb/>of the colonies from the Mother Country, and 
     <lb/>financial reformers like GOLDWIN Smith 
     <lb/>and others who have favored the same views, 
     <lb/>what was stated a short time ago by the 
     <lb/>Under Secretary of State for the Colonies 
     <lb/>to his constituents ? In speaking of this 
     <lb/>scheme, he said it was favored by the Imperial 
     <lb/>Government for the purpose of preparing us 
     <lb/>for a change in our relations ; for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of educating us to defend ourselves. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Was it not very strong lan<lb break="no"/>guage, coming as it did from no less a per<lb break="no"/>sonage than the Under Secretary for the 
     <lb/>
         

    
            <pb n="205" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0205.jpg"/>
         
     Colonies, that the Imperial Government is 
     <lb/>
     ready to favor a separation whenever we 
     <lb/>
     asked for it ? (Hear, hear.) Now, I am 
     <lb/>
     not one of those honorable gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     wish to see the day arrive when the colonies 
     <lb/>
     will ask for such separation. I am not one 
     <lb/>
     of those who wish to educate the people to 
     <lb/>
     that idea, but would rather impress upon 
     <lb/>
     them the paramount importance of endea<lb break="no"/>voring to maintain the union and connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Mother Country. (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DEBE1">HON. MR. DEBEAUJEU</persName>—What is the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the foreign press with regard to 
     <lb/>
     us ? Has it not threatened us, so that it is 
     <lb/>
     our duty to be prepared ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—I suppose my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend alludes to the press of the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring republic. We have certainly 
     <lb/>
     seen some of those newspapers, but very few 
     <lb/>
     of them threatening to invade and overrun 
     <lb/>
     us, but have you heard anything of that kind 
     <lb/>
     from the Government of the country, and 
     <lb/>
     are not our relations with it of the most 
     <lb/>
     friendly character ? Are you to be governed 
     <lb/>
     in your conduct by the rash utterances of a 
     <lb/>
     few newspapers,—perhaps sensation news<lb break="no"/>papers ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACP1">HON. MR. MACPHERSON</persName>—Has not 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SEWARD threatened us ?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—Not since he

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—Yes, just be<lb break="no"/>fore the last presidental election. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—Well, that is a 
     <lb/>
     matter of very little importance. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     Now, honorable gentlemen, I have shown 
     <lb/>
     that this scheme has no precedent, even on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the line. Among all the 
     <lb/>
     wild republican theories of our neighbors, 
     <lb/>
     they have never proposed to change the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution in this manner—never changed 
     <lb/>
     it, at all events, without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     people, obtained in some form or other. 
     <lb/>
     Reference has been made, I think, by my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend in front (Hon. Mr. ROSS 
     <lb/>
     to the union of England and Ireland. Well, 
     <lb/>
     every honorable member knows the means 
     <lb/>
     employed to bring about that union. MAY, 
     <lb/>
     in his <hi rendition="simple:italic">Constitutional History</hi>, states that 
     <lb/>
     £1,500,000 sterling were spent in carrying 
     <lb/>
     it. But how was the representation dealt 
     <lb/>
     with in that case ? Did England, being the 
     <lb/>
     richer country, possessing the largest share 
     <lb/>
     of wealth and capital, give a preponderance 
     <lb/>
     of the representation to Ireland, as we pro<lb break="no"/>pose to give to the Lower Provinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—That was a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union, while in this the representation will 
     <lb/>
     be based on population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—That does not 
     <lb/>
     affect the case. After the Irish union was 
     <lb/>
     effected, what was the representation of Ire<lb break="no"/>land in the House of Commons ? It was 
     <lb/>
     100 members in a total number of 656 ; and 
     <lb/>
     in the House of Lords 28 Peers, in a House 
     <lb/>
     of 450 members. And although it was con<lb break="no"/>sidered by England an absolute necessity 
     <lb/>
     that the union should be brought about, she 
     <lb/>
     did not give a preponderance, and scarcely a 
     <lb/>
     fair share, of the representation to the sister 
     <lb/>
     kingdom.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—That is because in the 
     <lb/>
     English Parliament they do not recognise 
     <lb/>
     the principle of representation by population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—My hon. friends 
     <lb/>
     will say that this proposed change is neither 
     <lb/>
     American nor English. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">SEVERAL HON. MEMBERS</persName>—It is 
     <lb/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. MR. SEYMOUR</persName>—No, it is neither 
     <lb/>
     one nor the other ; it is a mongrel Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. (Laughter.) In England no import<lb break="no"/>ant change in the laws is ever carried with-<lb break="yes"/>out being discussed in Parliament, session 
     <lb/>
     after session, followed by an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people upon it. Even so unimportant a 
     <lb/>
     change—or what would, in comparison with 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, be here regarded as so unim<lb break="no"/>portant a change—as the extension of the 
     <lb/>
     franchise, has been discussed in Parliament 
     <lb/>
     for years, and submitted to the people before 
     <lb/>
     passing into law. Now, I would like to en<lb break="no"/>quire of honorable gentlemen, what are the 
     <lb/>
     legitimate functions of the Legislature of this 
     <lb/>
     country. Do we not assemble here for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of enacting good and wholesome 
     <lb/>
    laws for the people ? (Hear, hear.) Those 
     <lb/>laws may be repealed, if they chance not to 
     <lb/>meet public approval ; but here you propose 
     <lb/>to change the Constitution—to change the 
     <lb/>whole fabric of society—in fact to revolu<lb break="no"/>tionize society, without asking the consent 
     <lb/>of the people, and without the possibility— 
     <lb/>at any rate, the reasonable possibility—of 
     <lb/>this important change ever being reconsid<lb break="no"/>ered. Does not this important subject affect 
     <lb/>every freeholder in the country as much as 
     <lb/>it affects us, and are there not thousands of 
     <lb/>people in the country who have as great an 
     <lb/>interest in it as the members of the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council of Canada ? And yet, forsooth, 
     <lb/>these gentlemen prepare a scheme, bring it 
     <lb/>down to this House, and tell the representa<lb break="no"/>

     tives of the people that they are not at liberty 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain the wishes of the people respect<lb break="no"/>ing it, nor to alter it in any manner, but 
     <lb/>
     that they must take it as it is. Still we are 
     <lb/>
     told, notwithstanding all this, that this is 
     <lb/>
     freedom, and that we are a free peeple. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>— You are at 
     <lb/>
     liberty either to accept or reject it. (Hear,

            </p>

     <lb/>
     be employed to carry it through without the 
     <lb/>
     people having an opportunity of saying yea 
     <lb/>
     or nay upon it. We are told it is not Brit<lb break="no"/>ish to permit this—even to pass a short act 
     <lb/>
     allowing the people to vote upon it ; but if 
     <lb/>
     this is not British, neither is the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion itself. (Hear, hear.) I entreat hon<lb break="no"/>orable members not to pass a measure of 
     <lb/>
     this importance without delaying it some 
     <lb/>
     little time, at all events, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     obtaining an expression of public opinion 
     <lb/>
     upon it. The people who are to be governed 
     <lb/>
     by it, who are for all time to come to live 
     <lb/>
     under this Constitution, certainly have a 
     <lb/>
     right to be consulted before it is consum<lb break="no"/>mated ; and for the special well-being of 
     <lb/>
     the country, I hope and trust it will not pass 
     <lb/>
     without affording them that opportunity.

     <persName ref="pers:BENN1">HON. MR. BENNETT</persName> said—Honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, after the many able and eloquent 
     <lb/>
     speeches we have heard on this subject, it 
     <lb/>
     may be presumptuous in me to offer any re<lb break="no"/>marks —(cries of "go on.")—but I cannot 
     <lb/>
     consent to give a silent vote upon the ques<lb break="no"/>tion before the House, and I think I would 
     <lb/>
     be wanting in my duty to those who sent me 
     <lb/>
     here if I did not make some observations 
     <lb/>
     upon this important subject. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I think honorable gentlemen ° 1 agree with 
     <lb/>
     me that this project is one of the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant—indeed, the most important—that has 
     <lb/>
     ever been brought before the Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear.) We are about to 
     <lb/>
     witness a great change in the Constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the country, the like of which has not been 
     <lb/>
     seen since the union of the provinces ; and I 
     <lb/>
     am free to say that a change of some kind or 
     <lb/>
     other is imperatively demanded, for I think 
     <lb/>
     that if the present state of things were al<lb break="no"/>lowed to continue it would be difiicult, if not 
     <lb/>
     impossible, to carry on the Government as it 
     <lb/>
     has been carried on for the last three or four 
     <lb/>
     years. (Hear, hear.) We have been told by 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the honorable and gallant gentleman at the 
     <lb/>
     head of the Government that we have been 
     <lb/>
     on an inclined plane, and I am sure that if 
     <lb/>
     some remedy had not been proposed we would 
     <lb/>
     have found ourselves sliding into a state of 
     <lb/>
     anarchy from the bitterness of feeling which 
     <lb/>
     prevailed in the country. I am not so sanguine, 
     <lb/>
     as some honorable gentlemen seem to be, that 
     <lb/>
     when we get Confederation we shall have a 
     <lb/>
     sort of political millennium, that we shall have 
     <lb/>
     no more political storms and agitations, but 
     <lb/>
     that we shall then enjoy nothing but the calm 
     <lb/>
     and sunshine of political life. But I think 
     <lb/>
     we will find ourselves pretty much in the 
     <lb/>
     same position as before with regard to parties 
     <lb/>
     —that we shall have a Government party and 
     <lb/>
     an Opposition, for in all free constitutional 
     <lb/>
     governments it is better to have an opposition 
     <lb/>
     than to be without one. I object, not to 
     <lb/>
     a healthy opposition, but to a factions one. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) From the difference in the 
     <lb/>
     laws, language and institutions of the several 
     <lb/>
     provinces it is clear that a legislative union 
     <lb/>
     of them is out of the question. The princi<lb break="no"/>ple of the double majority, as a remedy for 
     <lb/>
     our diflicnlties, has proved to be a failure; 
     <lb/>
     representation by population, which would 
     <lb/>
     have satisfied pper Canada, has been per<lb break="no"/>sistently denied by Lower Canada ; and, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, I see no resource but to fall back. 
     <lb/>
     upon the project of the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. (Hear, hear.) I would like to 
     <lb/>
     remark upon the peculiar position in which 
     <lb/>
     the elected members of this House stand in 
     <lb/>
     reference to this subject. It has been said 
     <lb/>
     that, if they vote for the resolutions, they vote 
     <lb/>
     to make themselves members of the House 
     <lb/>
     for life ; that this was not contemplated by 
     <lb/>
     the constituencies when they were elected ; 
     <lb/>
     and that it would be destroying the franchise 
     <lb/>
     and taking away a right from the people 
     <lb/>
     which the House had no authority to do. 
     <lb/>
     Well, all I can say is, that I have heard no 
     <lb/>
     such objections from the people of the con<lb break="no"/>stituency which I have the honor to repre<lb break="no"/>sent. All I have heard from them is a call 
     <lb/>
     for delay in the consideration of this question, 
     <lb/>
     and I maintain that delay is not fatal or 
     <lb/>
     injurious to it. (Hear, hear.) We have 
     <lb/>
     delayed it already for weeks; in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick it has been postponed till after the gen<lb break="no"/>eral election; and can any one show me that 
     <lb/>
     it will injure the measure to put it off for a 
     <lb/>
     short time longer? Surely it is good now, 
     <lb/>
     it will be just as good twelve months hence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The resolutions have been 
     <lb/>
     drawn up by able, talented, but fallible men ; 
     <lb/>
     and therefore we ought to weigh them care<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="207" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0207.jpg"/>
            
     fully before finally passing  them. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     ling.) I have no doubt it is the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     every man——even of the delegates who framed 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions—that if he had the power 
     <lb/>
     he would change them in some particular. 
     <lb/>
     If I had the power I have no hesitation in 
     <lb/>
     saying that I would change them; but we 
     <lb/>
     must take them as a whole or reject them 
     <lb/>
     altogether. When I hear of amendments 
     <lb/>
     being moved by different honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, therefore, am reminded of the looker- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     on at a game of chess. He imagines that he 
     <lb/>
     could improve many of the moves made by 
     <lb/>
     the players, but it would be found, if his sug<lb break="no"/>gestions were followed, that the end would be 
     <lb/>
     that he would find himself checkmated and 
     <lb/>
     the game lost. (Hear, hear.) In looking 
     <lb/>
     over the resolutions I have found some things 
     <lb/>
     that are good, and some that are open to ob<lb break="no"/>jection; but, upon a careful balance of both, 
     <lb/>
     I have come to the conclusion that the good 
     <lb/>
     preponderates. (Hear, hear.) I would, there<lb break="no"/>fore, hesitate to take upon myself the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility of risking the defeat of the measure 
     <lb/>
     by voting for any amendment to them. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ALEX1">HON. MR. ALEXANDER</persName> said—I shall 
     <lb/>
     not now trespass at any length upon the in<lb break="no"/>dulgence of this House. My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Port Hope (Hon. Mr. SEYMOUR) pos<lb break="no"/>sesses the esteem and respect not only of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, but of the country, from 
     <lb/>
     the straightforward and consistent course he 
     <lb/>
     has ever pursued on the floor of Parliament in 
     <lb/>
     regard to all great questions of public interest, 
     <lb/>
     and it is with very great diffidence and re<lb break="no"/>luctance that I venture bto challenge the 
     <lb/>
     figures, generally, stated by my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend, in the position he took, and the deduc<lb break="no"/>tions he drew from them, in reference to the 
     <lb/>
    proposed Confederation. But my honorable 
     <lb/>friend took surely a most gloomy view of the 
     <lb/>subject. He apprehend the worst conse<lb break="no"/>quences and results from the proposed alli<lb break="no"/>ance. The reply to that is that it just 
     <lb/>depends upon ourselves—it depends upon the 
     <lb/>members of the new Confederate Legislature 
     <lb/>whether good or evil shall flow from it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) If they proceed to work out the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution with reasonable frugalit and care, 
     <lb/>determined to keep down the public expendi<lb break="no"/>ure, and prevent all jobbery in the carrying 
     <lb/>out of public improvements, then, I am satis<lb break="no"/>fied that the Confederation may be carried out 
     <lb/>without materially increasing the public bur<lb break="no"/>dens; or, at all events, that our position will be 
     <lb/>such, that they will not fall more heavily upon 
     <lb/>us as a whole. The honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
            
<cb/>
            
     particularised certain instances of alleged in<lb break="no"/>justice, such as the financial arrangements 
     <lb/>
     with regard to Newfoundland and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. Why, surely there can be no great in<lb break="no"/>justice to Canada, in our agreeing on the one 
     <lb/>
     hand to allow certain subsidies, not of large 
     <lb/>
    amount, while we take the whole of their 
     <lb/>excise and custom duties with the power of 
     <lb/>levying a uniform tariff. As regards the pro<lb break="no"/>bable adequacy of the revenue of the proposed 
     <lb/>General Government to meet all the items of 
     <lb/>ordinary expenditure, I will leave my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend from Port Hope to disprove the 
     <lb/>correctness of the figures given by the Minister 
     <lb/>of Finance at Sherbrooke. For my own 
     <lb/>part, I would not presume to challenge the 
     <lb/>statements of so able a Minister of the Crown. 
     <lb/>But it is said that to meet the expense of the 
     <lb/>Local Government, we would require to have 
     <lb/>recourse to heavy direct taxation upon Upper 
     <lb/>and Lower Canada. I shall proœed to show 
     <lb/>that this would not be necessary, unless the 
     <lb/>Local Legislature ran out. Let us see what 
     <lb/>will be the position of Upper Canada, which is 
     <lb/>to receive upon the basis of 80 cents per head, 
     <lb/>$1,120,000. The local items which will have 
     <lb/>to be met out of that appropriation will be as 
     <lb/>follows :—

            <p>
     The prevailing desire in my section of West<lb break="no"/>ern Canada is, that the Local Legislature 
     <lb/>
     shall only be one Chamber of thirty members, 
     <lb/>
     with a very limited inexpensive Executive— 
     <lb/>
     a sort of large municipal deliberative body— 
     <lb/>
     which would involve a small expenditure, and 
     <lb/>
     if such views are carried out, there are no 
     <lb/>
     reasonable grounds for apprehending the ne<lb break="no"/>cessit for direct taxation. But I did not 
     <lb/>
     inten when I rose to enter again at length 
     <lb/>
     upon such details. I was only desirous to 
     <lb/>
     explain the course which I shall be obliged to 
     <lb/>
     pursue in reference to the amendment of the 
     <lb/>

     ton. After the leader of the Government, in 
     <lb/>
     another quarter, has declared that they will 
     <lb/>
     look upon any amendment of an important 
     <lb/>
     detail as a defeat of the whole scheme, I am 
     <lb/>
     not prepared to take the responsibility of vot<lb break="no"/>ing for an amendment which would have such 
     <lb/>
     an effect. (Hear, hear.) But while I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that I am acting in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the views of my constituents in voting in the 
     <lb/>
     negative, I do think that an opportunity should 
     <lb/>
     be afforded to any of the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House to record the views of their constituents 
     <lb/>
     upon this or upon any of the other details to 
     <lb/>
     which they take exception, and I therefore 
     <lb/>
     beg to move in amendment, seconded by the

     to-day that the people were then governed 
     <lb/>
     cheaply, honestly and properly. If it cost 
     <lb/>
     $770,000 to govern 450,000 people in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada in 1839, how much, in the same pro<lb break="no"/>portion, will it cost to govern 1,396,000 of 
     <lb/>
     people now in that section under the Con<lb break="no"/>federation ? The answer is, $2,170,000 a- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     year, or, in other words, just about double 
     <lb/>
     the amount of the local subsidy.

            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARMA1">HON. MR. ARMAND</persName>—I have listened at<lb break="no"/>tentively to the honorable members who have 
     <lb/>
     spoken to the question before the House, 
     <lb/>
     some of whom have manifested fear in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the changes proposed to be introduced 
     <lb/>
     in the Constitution, and I am far from blam<lb break="no"/>ing them, but it is to be observed that none 
     <lb/>
     of them have proposed a remedy for the dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties of the situation. Two or three said 
     <lb/>
     that the measure had taken the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     and the country by surprise, but it seems to 
     <lb/>
     me that those honorable members have for<lb break="no"/>gotten that the question of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     was discussed both in Parliament and in the 
     <lb/>
     country in 1859, and that since then the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature and the press have occupied them<lb break="no"/>selves with it often enough. Did not the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Assembly last year name a com<lb break="no"/>mittee to inquire into the difficulties which 
     <lb/>
     seemed to be hurrying us on to anarchy, and 
     <lb/>
     did not that committee report that the remedy 
     <lb/>
     for those evils was Confederation ? Those 
     <lb/>
     honorable members also seem to forget that 
     <lb/>
     since the Government disclosed its policy 
     <lb/>
     through the magnificent speech of the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance to his constituents at Sher<lb break="no"/>brooke—a speech circulated in all parts of the 
     <lb/>
     country by the press of the various political 
     <lb/>
    parties—24 elections have taken place, 13 for 
     <lb/>this honorable House and 11 for the other. 
     <lb/>Of the 13 for this House three candidates 
     <lb/>only declared themselves opposed to Confed<lb break="no"/>mtion, and of those three, but one was elect<lb break="no"/>ed. Of the 11 for the Assembly, one only ob<lb break="no"/>jected to it, and it is said that he will now 
     <lb/>vote for the measure. Relative to that pro<lb break="no"/>vision in the resolutions of the Conference, 
     <lb/>having ' regard to the elective principle in the 
     <lb/>Legislative Council, I have already stated my 
     <lb/>opinion, and I would tell the honorable mem— 
     <lb/>bet for the Wellington Division that it seems 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     to me that the delegates, who are all eminent 
     <lb/>
     men, could not have come to such a conclusion 
     <lb/>
     except after mature deliberation. I can well 
     <lb/>
     understand that before England permitted us 
     <lb/>
     to adopt its Constitution—gave us responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, allowed us the control of our 
     <lb/>
     own affairs; and when its governor swere not 
     <lb/>
     advised by ministers responsible to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, but were surrounded by advisers who 
     <lb/>
     were more like clerks, who to preserve their 
     <lb/>
     salaries were often obliged to submit to the 
     <lb/>
     arbitrary will of their master—I can easily 
     <lb/>
    conceive, I repeat, that it was expedient to seek 
     <lb/>a remedy for the wrongs under which we 
     <lb/>then labored. But to-day, when the parent 
     <lb/>state requires that its governors shall choose 
     <lb/>advisers responsible to the people, the elective 
     <lb/>system is no longer needful in relation to fin<lb break="no"/>ance or to the tranquillity and safety of the 
     <lb/>people. As to finance, I will certainly not say 
     <lb/>that officers of the Government take advan<lb break="no"/>tage of their position to speculate in setting 
     <lb/>up ephemeral candidates—most assuredly not; 
     <lb/>but will say that many citizens, little careful 
     <lb/>of their true interest and of the future of their 
     <lb/>country, convert election days into days of 
     <lb/>speculation, by giving rise to corruption, vio<lb break="no"/>lence and perjury; and I shall be ready, when<lb break="no"/>ever required, to prove as clearly as that two 
     <lb/>and two make four, that in several divisions 
     <lb/>the election resembled civil warfare more than 
     <lb/>proper election contests. I know that many 
     <lb/>persons, I will not say urged by an inordin<lb break="no"/>ate liberalism, degenerating into demagogy— 
     <lb/>for I do not believe we have in our young 
     <lb/>country any of those fierce demagogues—but 
     <lb/>I will say, that there are persons who wish that 
     <lb/>all the ofices under the State should be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to universal suffrage, because they 
     <lb/>know that in such circumstances they could 
     <lb/>impose upon the sympathy and the judg<lb break="no"/>ment of the people. But I would say to 
     <lb/>such persons— gentlemen, do not suppose 
     <lb/>yourselves wiser statesmen than those of 
     <lb/>the Mother Country, who have established 
     <lb/>their Constitution after centuries of efforts 
     <lb/>and contests, and who work it after the 
     <lb/>experience of centuries. I would further 
     <lb/>tell them " do not suppose yourselves better 
     <lb/>able to appreciate the British Constitution 
     <lb/>than Monsieur MONTALEMBERT, one of the 
     <lb/>great <hi rendition="simple:italic">literati</hi> of the day, the historian and 
     <lb/>eminent statesman; or than M. BERRYER, 
     <lb/>the prince of the French bar, both of whom 
     <lb/>proclaimed but recently that that Constitution 
     <lb/>was one of the most beautiful and free that 
     <lb/>could possibly be desired." I congratulate 
     <lb/>the Government upon desiring to preserve so 
     <lb/>
            

    

    
            <pb n="210" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0210.jpg"/>
            
     much of this law as may appear rational and 
     <lb/>
     good. I refer to the territorial divisions and 
     <lb/>
     the propriety of causing them to be repre<lb break="no"/>sented by persons who have vested interests 
     <lb/>
     therein ; and indeed how could any one rep<lb break="no"/>resent with equal devotion and advantage a 
     <lb/>
     division, as the man who had sacred rights 
     <lb/>
     therein, whether by personal residence or the 
     <lb/>
     ownership of the property upon which his 
     <lb/>
     qualification rests, and who clings to it be<lb break="no"/>cause it has descended to him from his an<lb break="no"/>cestor, or because he has acquired it by the 
     <lb/>
     sweat of his brow, his vigils and his toils? 
     <lb/>
     I hope it will not be said that I intend by my 
     <lb/>
     remarks upon this law to disparage the resi<lb break="no"/>dents in the towns, for the division which I 
     <lb/>
     have the honor to represent embraces part of 
     <lb/>
     the most populous city in Canada, and I only 
     <lb/>
     accepted the charge after the refusal of two 
     <lb/>
     of its most eminent citizens—eminent equally 
     <lb/>
     by their large fortunes and their social posi<lb break="no"/>tion. But probably those gentlemen had 
     <lb/>
     learned by their own experience or by that of 
     <lb/>
     others, that public life did not present suffi<lb break="no"/>cient charms to cause it to be eagerly coveted. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Before recording 
     <lb/>
     my vote on the amendment before the House, 
     <lb/>
     I feel it my duty to say a few words in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to that amendment. I cannot say that I 
     <lb/>
     altogether concur in the manner in which it is 
     <lb/>
     drawn, but at the same time I feel called upon, 
     <lb/>
     as an elected member, to support it. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that it would ill become me—that l would be 
     <lb/>
     hardly discharging my duty to my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents—if I were to sit silently by and give my 
     <lb/>
     vote to change the Constitution under which I 
     <lb/>
     was elected. (Hear, hear.) I feel that there 
     <lb/>
     is something extraordinary in the fourteenth 
     <lb/>
     of these resolutions before the House, and I 
     <lb/>
     would like to hear the Government give a 
     <lb/>
     full explanation as to the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     that resolution was arrived at in the Conference. 
     <lb/>
     Bear in mind, honorable gentlemen, that the 
     <lb/>
     eleventh resolution declares that "the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Legislative Council shall be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed by the Crown under the great seal of 
     <lb/>
     the General Government, and shall hold office 
     <lb/>
     during life." Thus the House will see that 
     <lb/>
     By this resolution the Crown has the right for 
     <lb/>
    all future time to select the legislative coun<lb break="no"/>cillors in Upper Canada from any part of the 
     <lb/>country which the Crown sees fit ; but in 
     <lb/>Lower Canada there is this difference that, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the sixteenth resolution, " each of 
     <lb/>the legislative councillors representing Lower 
     <lb/>Canada in the Legislative Council of the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Legislature,shall be appointed to represent 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>

     one of the twenty-four electoral divisions men<lb break="no"/>tioned in schedule A, of chapter 1st of the 
     <lb/>
     Consolidated Statutes of Canada, and such 
     <lb/>
     councillor shall reside or possess his qualifica<lb break="no"/>tion in the division he is appointed to repre<lb break="no"/>sent." Then the fourteenth resolution de<lb break="no"/>clares that " the first selection of the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislative Council shall be made, 
     <lb/>
     except as regards Prince Edward Island, from 
     <lb/>
     the legislative councils of the various pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, so far as a sufficient number be found 
     <lb/>
     qualified and willing to serve." Now, honor— 
     <lb/>
     able gentlemen, I have always understood— 
     <lb/>
     my reading of books on constitutional law has 
     <lb/>
     given me to understand—that the greatest of 
     <lb/>
     England's statesmen who have spoken on the 
     <lb/>
     question of the Royal prerogative, have always 
     <lb/>
     broadly laid it down as a rule that the prero<lb break="no"/>gative should never and could never be 
     <lb/>
     limited. How is it then that these thirty-<lb break="yes"/>
     three individuals, talented, able and gifted, 
     <lb/>
     as no doubt they were, who met in the room 
     <lb/>
     behind me and sat with closed doors, saw fit 
     <lb/>
     to hamper and cripple the operation of that 
     <lb/>
     good rule? (Hear, hear.) Should the pre<lb break="no"/>rogative of the Crown in the selection of mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House be limited? It may be 
     <lb/>
     true that, residing in many of the divisions in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada represented in this House, 
     <lb/>
     there may be good men, competent men, well 
     <lb/>
     qualified men ; but it is equally true that 
     <lb/>
     there may be just as good, able and talented 
     <lb/>
     men, outside of them as in it. Why, then, 
     <lb/>
     should the doors of this House be closed 
     <lb/>
     against these men ? Why is it, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to know, that the prerogative of the Crown is 
     <lb/>
     to be restricted so as to prevent the choice of 
     <lb/>
     these men ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—I can give ex<lb break="no"/>planations to the honorable gentleman. He 
     <lb/>
     must be aware that Lower Canada is in a dif<lb break="no"/>ferent position from Upper Canada, and that 
     <lb/>
     there are two nationalities in it occupying 
     <lb/>
     certain portions of the country. Well, these 
     <lb/>
     divisions have been made so as to secure to 
     <lb/>
     both nationalities their respective rights, and 
     <lb/>
     these, in our opinion, are good reasons for the 
     <lb/>
     provision that has been made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I do not think my 
     <lb/>
     honorable and gallant friend sees the point of 
     <lb/>
     my remarks. I would ask why in the first 
     <lb/>
     selection the choice of the Crown is restricted 
     <lb/>
     to the members of this Chamber, when proba<lb break="no"/>bly others out of it could be found whose 
     <lb/>
     presence here would be of more advantage to 
     <lb/>
     the public ?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—I do not know 
     <lb/>
     what advantage would be derived if the Crown 
     <lb/>

     had the right of making selections from all 
     <lb/>
     over the country. If that had been proposed, 
     <lb/>
     I think many honorable gentlemen would have 
     <lb/>
     found fault with it. (Hear, hear.) It was 
     <lb/>
     due to courtesy that the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House should not be overlooked, and not only 
     <lb/>
     that, but there were acquired rights which 
     <lb/>
     had to be respected. My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     appears to dissent from this statemcnt. Well, 
     <lb/>
     the last choice of the people are now in this 
     <lb/>
     House, and by the fact of their election they 
     <lb/>
     have acquired a right to a seat; and I think 
     <lb/>
     those gentlemen who have been appointed for 
     <lb/>
     life have gained rights which should not be 
     <lb/>
     overlooked. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—The honorable and 
     <lb/>
     gallant gentleman says we have an acquired 
     <lb/>
     right. I admit we have a right to sit here 
     <lb/>
     during the term for which we have been 
     <lb/>
     elected ; but what right have we to seat our<lb break="no"/>selves here for the remainder of our lives ? 
     <lb/>
     The people did not send us here to make this 
     <lb/>
     change in the composition of this House. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And what right even have the 
     <lb/>
     appointed members of this House to seats here 
     <lb/>
     during their lifetime ? I have a despatch 
     <lb/>
     here, written by the late Duke of NEWCASTLE, 
     <lb/>
     who will be considered pretty good authority 
     <lb/>
     upon the point, to the Lieutenant-Governor of 
     <lb/>
    Prince Edward Island, on this very question. 
     <lb/>I need not read the words of the despatch, 
     <lb/>but the sense of it is, that legislative coun<lb break="no"/>cillors have no right of property in their posi<lb break="no"/>tion, but simply a naked trust which the 
     <lb/>Legislature may at any time call upon them 
     <lb/>to surrender to other hands, if, in their opinion, 
     <lb/>the public interest shall require such transfer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—That is merely 
     <lb/>
     a matter of opinion. That may for a time 
     <lb/>
     have been the view of the Imperial authorities 
     <lb/>
     but previous to 1856 they held and said 
     <lb/>
     directly the contrary. (Hear, hear.) They 
     <lb/>
     then said that they had granted certain privi<lb break="no"/>leges to certain gentlemen for life, and that 
     <lb/>
     they would not commit the injustice of with<lb break="no"/>drawing those privileges when the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     had done nothing to forfeit them. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.)<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I am surprised at 
     <lb/>
     the honorable and gallant Premier questioning 
     <lb/>
     the ability of the distinguished gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who wrote the despatch to which I have just 
     <lb/>
     referred. Whatever may have been the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the Colonial Office in 1856, this is 
     <lb/>
     a later opinion, for the despatch is dated the 
     <lb/>
     4th of February, 1862. The honorable and 
     <lb/>
     gallant gentleman says they do not propose to 
     <lb/>
     take from any honorable gentleman the rights 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     he now enjoys. I could understand this 
     <lb/>
     argument they did not propose to take away 
     <lb/>
     the rights of any honorable member of this 
     <lb/>
     House; but I cannot understand it when you 
     <lb/>
     propose to drive from this House faithful 
     <lb/>
     subjects who have served their country hon<lb break="no"/>estly in the Legislature, and I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     we have not yet had from the gallant 
     <lb/>
     Premier that explanation to which the House 
     <lb/>
     is entitled. (Hear, hear.) Why is it that 
     <lb/>
     the legislative councillors from Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island are excepted? In that province, 
     <lb/>
     as we know, the Legislative Council is elec<lb break="no"/>tive, and it is an elected Chamber that is now 
     <lb/>
     in existence there, but the members of it are 
     <lb/>
     excepted from the provisions that apply to 
     <lb/>
     the legislative councils of the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Why is this? I think there must be some 
     <lb/>
     reason, in the first place, for breaking the 
     <lb/>
     good rule that in no way shall the prerogative 
     <lb/>
     ofthe Crown be restricted; and, in the second, 
     <lb/>
     for making an exception in regard to one that 
     <lb/>
     does not apply to the others. I think a reason 
     <lb/>
     may be found for this in the fact, that it was 
     <lb/>
     doubted whether the resolutions in a different 
     <lb/>
     shape would have passed through some of the 
     <lb/>
     chambers that compose the legislatures of the 
     <lb/>
     different provinces. (Hear, hear.) I would 
     <lb/>
     like to know what justice will be done if this 
     <lb/>
     change is carried out? What, for instance, 
     <lb/>
     will be done with to two honorable 
     <lb/>
     members who come from the city of Hamilton ? 
     <lb/>
     One of them (the Hon. Mr. MILLS) is an 
     <lb/>
     appointed member; the other (the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BULL) was the almost unanimous choice of 
     <lb/>
     the people only a few months since. Under 
     <lb/>
     the working of the resolutions, one of these 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen will forfeit his seat. 
     <lb/></p>
          
            
            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—Why ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>— If it does not follow 
     <lb/>that one of these honorable gentlemen will lose

     <lb/>gentlemen take either horn of the dilemma 
     <lb/>they please. It may be quite true that the 
     <lb/>gentlemen who have been sent here possess 
     <lb/>the confidence of their constituents, but it 
     <lb/>does not follow that they will be retained 
     <lb/>in their seats. It is plain that a great 
     <lb/>injustice will be done these honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen, some of whom have served 
     <lb/>their country faithfully, without, in any 
     <lb/>way trenching upon the rights of the Crown 
     <lb/>or infringing on those of the people ; and I 
     <lb/>think the conclusion this House and the 
     <lb/>country, as well as the other branch of the 
     <lb/>Legislature, will arrive at, is that these te

     solutions were devised because they were 
     <lb/>
     better calculated in this shape to be palatable, 
     <lb/>
     if not to this Chamber, at least to other 
     <lb/>
     houses of the legislatures of British North 
     <lb/>
     America. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—Like other hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have preceded me, I am over<lb break="no"/>come with the importance of this subject ; 
     <lb/>
     and I would fail in my duty were I to give 
     <lb/>
     a silent vote on the very grave question now 
     <lb/>
     before the House. I feel that, in the lan<lb break="no"/>guage of my hon. friend from the Eastern 
     <lb/>
     Division, it is a question of the greatest possi<lb break="no"/>ble importance ; and I think the House has 
     <lb/>
     great reason to congratulate itself on the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which the discussion of it has been 
     <lb/>
     approached—in the way in which it has been 
     <lb/>
     treated, both by the friends of the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     and by those who have opposed them. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Difference of opinion there must be 
     <lb/>
     on all great public questions. ( Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It is idle to expect that we should all be 
     <lb/>
     agreed on this any more than on any other 
     <lb/>
     great public question ; and after all, the most 
     <lb/>
     correct judgment, which can be formed on 
     <lb/>
     any occasion, is but an approximation to the 
     <lb/>
     truth. (Hear, hear.) All those who have 
     <lb/>
     preceded us in the work of constitution-
     <lb break="yes"/>
     making, have left, on the structures which 
     <lb/>
     they have erected, the impress of that at<lb break="no"/>tribute which prevades humanity—imperfec<lb break="no"/>tion. We have a very lamentable instance 
     <lb/>
     of this in the case of our neighbors on the 
     <lb/>
     southern side of the line. As was well said, 
     <lb/>
     by a prominent member of the Government 
     <lb/>
     in another place, the Constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     United States "was one of the most wonder<lb break="no"/>ful works of the human intellect—one of the 
     <lb/>
     most marvellous efforts of skill and organiza<lb break="no"/>tion that ever governed a free people. But 
     <lb/>
     to say that it was perfect would be wrong." 
     <lb/>
     The wonder is that men with the limited 
     <lb/>
     amount of experience which its authors 
     <lb/>
     possessed, should have framed such an in<lb break="no"/>strument. It has stood many rude tests, 
     <lb/>
     and but for the existence in the social com<lb break="no"/>pact of our American friends, of an element 
     <lb/>
     in direct antagonism to the whole genius of 
     <lb/>
     their system—negro slavery—the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the United States would have con<lb break="no"/>tinued to withstand—yes, and after the 
     <lb/>
     extinction of that element, will continue to 
     <lb/>
     withstand—all the artillery which their own 
     <lb/>
     or foreign despotism can array against it. 
     <lb/>
     Their institutions have the same features 
     <lb/>
     with our own. There are some points of 
     <lb/>
     variance ; but the same great principle is 
     <lb/>
     the basis of both—that life, liberty and the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     pursuit of happiness are the unalienable 
     <lb/>
     rights of man, and that to secure these rights, 
     <lb/>
     governments are instituted among men, 
     <lb/>
     deriving their just powers from the consent 
     <lb/>
     of the governed. This is the secret of the 
     <lb/>
     strength of the British Constitution, and 
     <lb/>
     without a free and full recognition of it, no 
     <lb/>
     government can be strong or permanent. I 
     <lb/>
     am free to admit that the scheme before us 
     <lb/>
     has some defects, which, in my judgment, 
     <lb/>
     will mar its well-working ; but, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, I am confident that, if it should be<lb break="no"/>come law, these defects can and will be 
     <lb/>
     remedied. The gentlemen composing a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the Conference, who were the 
     <lb/>
     authors of these resolutions, honestly thought 
     <lb/>
     that their views were right, but the time will 
     <lb/>
     come when they or their successors will see 
     <lb/>
     that they were wrong, and the errors will be 
     <lb/>
     rectified. We are told the resolutions must 
     <lb/>
     be either accepted or rejected. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     the question which we must solve is, whether 
     <lb/>
     these defects are so serious as to render it 
     <lb/>
     our duty to reject them, or are the advantages 
     <lb/>
     likely to result from their adoption more 
     <lb/>
     than equivalent to the drawbacks. I hold 
     <lb/>
     that the substitution of appointment by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown for the elective principle, in this 
     <lb/>
     Chamber, is a great objection. I have 
     <lb/>
     always been an advocate of the elective prin<lb break="no"/>ciple ; still I shrink from the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     of voting against the scheme because of 
     <lb/>
     that objection. (Hear, hear.) We had 
     <lb/>
     reached a condition almost bordering on 
     <lb/>
     anarchy ; and I am sure from the conflict of 
     <lb/>
     passions that prevailed—and it is not my 
     <lb/>
     design to blame one political party or the 
     <lb/>
     other for it, I simply state a fact, freely con<lb break="no"/>ceded by both parties—that a state of things 
     <lb/>
     existed for which a remedy of some kind must 
     <lb/>
     be found. And it is a cheering fact that in the 
     <lb/>
     midst of this state of things we have found 
     <lb/>
     men patriotic enough to merge former dif<lb break="no"/>ferences and unite together for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of framing a Constitution which will secure 
     <lb/>
     exemption from the evils under which we 
     <lb/>
     have labored. And although it may entail 
     <lb/>
     —I am not here to state that it will not en<lb break="no"/>tail—additional cost upon the country, yet 
     <lb/>
     that is not a valid argument against the adop<lb break="no"/>tion of the scheme. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     House and the country have to take this into 
     <lb/>
     consideration, whether, if it be rejected, we 
     <lb/>
     can devise a plan better fitted to extricate us 
     <lb/>
     from our present difficulties, and which will 
     <lb/>
     command the support of all the parties to 
     <lb/>
     this compact. It seems to be unnecessary to 
     <lb/>
     go into the discussion of the question as to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="213" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0213.jpg"/>
            
     whether union of the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Provinces is desirable. Every hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who has spoken, has given his 
     <lb/>
     assent to that proposition. But objections 
     <lb/>
     have been urged against the resolutions be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, an some of those objections 
     <lb/>
     have assumed a tangible shape. They have 
     <lb/>
     been presented in the amendments moved 
     <lb/>
     by my honorable friend from Wellington and 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend from Niagara. My vote 
     <lb/>
     shall be given for the resolutions, notwithstan<lb break="no"/>ding their defects, because I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the benefits which we shall derive from their 
     <lb/>
     adoption will far outweigh them. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We have been told that this scheme 
     <lb/>
     is new, that the country is not informed 
     <lb/>
     upon the subject, and that the people do not 
     <lb/>
     understand it. There was a time in the his<lb break="no"/>tory of this country—and that time has not 
     <lb/>
     very long gone by— when this plan of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, or at any rate the leading principles 
     <lb/>
     embodied in it, were discussed and approved 
     <lb/>
     by a very large number of the people. In 
     <lb/>
     1859, a numerous and respectable body re<lb break="no"/>presenting the Reform party of Upper   
     <lb/>
     Canada, met in the city of Toronto. That 
     <lb/>
     convention was composed of, I think, 560 
     <lb/>
     members, who substantially adopted it as the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the party. Among other resolu<lb break="no"/>tions which the convention agreed to were 
     <lb/>
     two which I shall take the liberty of read<lb break="no"/>ing to the House. The 4th resolution was 
     <lb/>
     to the following effect :—

            </p>
   
            <p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> That without entering on the discussion of

     . not to ignore the larger project of Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the British North American

     <lb/>
     convince the House, from what fell from 
     <lb/>
     myself on that occasion, that it was not so 
     <lb/>
     considered. But the difficulties then sur<lb break="no"/>rounding us were of a grave character and 
     <lb/>
     an immediate remedy was desired; and, as 
     <lb/>
     the resolution expresses it, the obstacle in 
     <lb/>
     the way of a Federal union of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and which prevented its acceptance 
     <lb/>
     as an immediate remedy, was the delay 
     <lb/>
     which would necessarily occur in obtaining 
     <lb/>
     the consent of the Lower Provinces. But 
     <lb/>
     the 5th resolution adopted at that meeting 
     <lb/>embodied in it some of the main features of<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the resolutions of the Conference.

     is my lot on this occasion, or I should, per<lb break="no"/>haps, have been reminded of them by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Niagara. It will be re<lb break="no"/>membered by those who were present at the 
     <lb/>
     meeting, that Mr. SHEPPARD moved a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, in amendment, affirming the propriety 
     <lb/>
     of dissolving the union between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada; but in doing so, he said, that 
     <lb/>
     if our object was to establish a large nation<lb break="no"/>ality, he would withdraw it, and support the 
     <lb/>
     main resolution. In reply to him I said :—

            <p>
     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Mr. SHEPPARD has stated that if he could see

     Now I, for one, have no hesitation in saying that

     advisable that you should have it, because it is a

     in the recollection of honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     that while this meeting in Toronto took place 
     <lb/>
     on the 9th of November, 1859, there was 
     <lb/>
     also another meeting in the city of Montreal, 
     <lb/>
     on the 25th of October preceding, the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings at which to a great extent influ<lb break="no"/>enced the decision of that convention. The 
     <lb/>
     meeting at Montreal, composed of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Opposition members of Parliament, 
     <lb/>
     gave forth to the world a very important 
     <lb/>
     and able document—a document which on 
     <lb/>
     its face was partly advisory to the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Reform party of Upper Canada, who 
     <lb/>
     were about to meet in Toronto. It was 
     <lb/>
     signed by the following gentlemen : the

     Hon. Messrs. A. A. DORION, L. T. DRUM<lb break="no"/>MOND, L. A. DESSAULES, and THOMAS

     D'ARCY MCGEE. If the House will bear

     I am sorry that my hon. friend from the

     think the remedy he proposes  is so ably

     shown in this document to be insufficient to

     meet the exigencies of the case, that even

     he would be convinced of the inadequacy 
     <lb/>
     of the views he has just now announced. 
     <lb/>
     The language I have quoted is just what we 
     <lb/>
     say now, that representation by population 
     <lb/>
     per se would not afford sufficient means of 
     <lb/>
     extrication from our difficulties, and would 
     <lb/>
     not give us the hope which the new consti<lb break="no"/>tutional system, of which it forms a main 
     <lb/>
     feature, does afford, that we will be rid of 
     <lb/>
     the evils which have distracted the country.

     during the last few years. It was, no doubt, 
     <lb/>
    suggested by the example of the neighboring

     It may be said in reply, that this document 
     <lb/>
     refers only to the Federation of the Canadas. 
     <lb/>
     The scheme before the House provides for 
     <lb/>
     that most fully ; but if the principle be good 
     <lb/>
     as regards Canada, it will be equally bene<lb break="no"/>ficial as regards the other British North 
     <lb/>
     American Colonies. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member from Wellington, in the very 
     <lb/>
     able speech which he delivered the other day, 
     <lb/>
     and to which all who heard him must have 
     <lb/>
     listened with very great pleasure, enunci<lb break="no"/>ated his views in his usual forcible and 
     <lb/>
     lucid style ; and whether there is a coinci<lb break="no"/>dence of opinion with him or not, one cannot 
     <lb/>
     but respect the intelligence, moderation and 
     <lb/>
     candor with which he expresses his views. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I trust that in giving my opin<lb break="no"/>ion upon some points of his remarks I shall 
     <lb/>
     be guilty of no want of courtesy although 
     <lb/>
     differing from him. (Hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, at the outset of his remarks, said 
     <lb/>
     that this Constitution, in order to be strong, 
     <lb/>
     "must be planted deep in the hearts and 
     <lb/>
     affections of the people," and that "there 
     <lb/>
     would be no good hope of its permanency 
     <lb/>
     without this." So true and correct is this 
     <lb/>
     position, that if I did not believe, honestly 
     <lb/>
     believe, that the Constitution which we are 
     <lb/>
     now discussing commanded the approbation of 
     <lb/>
     a large majority of the people—I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing now more particularly of the section of 
     <lb/>
     the province to which I belong—I would 
     <lb/>
     be one of those to advocate our delaying its 
     <lb/>
     passage until we ascertained beyond all doubt 
     <lb/>
     what the feelings of the people are ; but I 
     <lb/>
     think there is no reasonable ground to 
     <lb/>
     doubt what their views are. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     They were shown, in the first place, as 
     <lb/>
     pointed out by my honorable friend the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Crown Lands, in the fact that 
     <lb/>
     nearly all the elections of members of this 
     <lb/>
     and the other branch of the Legislature that 
     <lb/>
     have taken place since the formation of the 
     <lb/>
     Government, have resulted in its favor. 
     <lb/>
     That, I think, is very strong testimony of the 
     <lb/>
     popular approbation. (Hear, hear.) Then 
     <lb/>
     we have no petitions against it. (Hear,

     hear.) What have I been proving to the 
     <lb/>
     House but that the very party of which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman is a member resolved upon 
     <lb/>
     this in 1859. I do not think the feelings of 
     <lb/>
     that convention in its favor could have been 
     <lb/>
     more distinctly expressed. I certainly so 
     <lb/>
     understood it, and a large majority of the 
     <lb/>
     560 gentlemen present so understood it. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It has been before the country 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada since 1856, when our 
     <lb/>
     friends from Lower Canada formally brought 
     <lb/>
     it before Parliament. Are there any peti<lb break="no"/>tions from Lower Canada now against it ? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Are there any from Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada ? Has there been a single public 
     <lb/>
     meeting in either section against it ? ( Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) In Lower Canada, an hon. member 
     <lb/>
     says, there have been two or three. It has 
     <lb/>
     been said—I do not declare it, but make the 
     <lb/>
     statement on public rumor—that they were 
     <lb/>
     failures, small demonstrations of opposition. 
     <lb/>
     But in Upper Canada we have had no de<lb break="no"/>monstration whatever against it. An indi<lb break="no"/>rect attempt was made the other day at 
     <lb/>
     Toronto by an effort to condemn the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway in connection with Confe<lb break="no"/>deration, but it was a manifest failure. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I think, then, that we are justified 
     <lb/>
     in assuming—and, indeed, are bound to 
     <lb/>
     assume—that the people do not object to it, 
     <lb/>
     and that they fully understand its character ; 
     <lb/>
     for in spite of what may be said to the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     it has gone through the length and breadth 
     <lb/>
     of the land, having been widely circulated 
     <lb/>
     by every newspaper in the country ; and 
     <lb/>
     it is a flimsy argument for honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen to use, that because the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions addressed to them were marked 
     <lb/>
     " Private," they could not be communicated 
     <lb/>
     to the public. (Hear, hear.) They have 
     <lb/>
     been spread all over the country ; but we are 
     <lb/>
     told the entire press has been subsidized by 
     <lb/>
     the Government. To say that the press was 
     <lb/>
     influenced in any manner by the circular to 
     <lb/>
     which allusion has been made, is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous. (Hear, hear.) There are a few 
     <lb/>
     newspapers in either section of the province 
     <lb/>
     —certainly there are few in Upper Canada— 
     <lb/>
     that have spoken against the scheme ; but 
     <lb/>
     nine-tenths of them in both sections are in 
     <lb/>
     favor of it, and have discussed it in all its 
     <lb/>
     bearings—yet we are told that the public 
     <lb/>
     has not been sufficiently informed upon it, 
     <lb/>
     that in fact there is no public opinion in 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="217" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0217.jpg"/>
            
     respect to it, and that hence there are no 
     <lb/>
    petitions or demonstrations against it. I 
     <lb/>think this is a mode of reasoning which my 
     <lb/>hon. friend (Hon. MR. CURRIE) ought not 
     <lb/>to adopt—it is an argument unworthy of his 
     <lb/>intelligence. (Hear, hear.) My hon. friend 
     <lb/>from Wellington the other day attacked the 
     <lb/>character of the Conference, and the attack 
     <lb/>has been repeated since, by styling it a " self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>elected body." This designation was not 
     <lb/>correct. So far as Canada is concerned, 
     <lb/>we were represented by the Canadian Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, formed for the express purpose of 
     <lb/>carrying into effect a plan of Federal union 
     <lb/>—union of the Canadas at all events, and if 
     <lb/>possible of all the British North American 
     <lb/>Provinces. It will not be denied that the 
     <lb/>Government possesses the confidence of large 
     <lb/>majorities in both Houses of Parliament, 
     <lb/>and of the people of the province. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) The representatives of Canada, there<lb break="no"/>fore, could hardly be called a self-elected 
     <lb/>body, that is in the sense in which my hon. 
     <lb/>friend has applied the term, namely, that 
     <lb/>they represented nobody but themselves. 
     <lb/>To maintain this is indeed to go a great 
     <lb/>length, for it is practically to ignore both 
     <lb/>Houses of Parliament, and the very prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of representation. (Hear, hear.) Then, 
     <lb/>as regards the representatives of the other 
     <lb/>provinces, they were appointed by the sanc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Crown, on the invitation of the 
     <lb/>Governor General, and were selected from 
     <lb/>various political parties, to consider a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the utmost interest to every subject 
     <lb/>of the Sovereign, of whatever race or faith, 
     <lb/>resident in these provinces ; and they have 
     <lb/>arrived at a conclusion destined to exercise a 
     <lb/>most important influence upon the future 
     <lb/>condition and welfare of the whole com<lb break="no"/>munity. My honorable friend from Port 
     <lb/>Hope (Hon. Mr. SEYMOUR) referred to-day 
     <lb/>to the American mode of revising their 
     <lb/>constitutions. The honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>very correctly stated the manner in which 
     <lb/>the Federal Constitution may be amend<lb break="no"/>ed, but he is in error as to the mode 
     <lb/>in which state constitutions may be revised. 
     <lb/>One of the most important of the States re<lb break="no"/>vised its Constitution in 1846. I refer to 
     <lb/>the State of New York. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">modus operandi</hi> 
     <lb/>on that occasion was as follows :—An act was 
     <lb/>passed in the State Legislature authorizing 
     <lb/>the electors at large to choose delegates to a 
     <lb/>convention, for the express purpose of re<lb break="no"/>vising the Constitution. The instrument 
     <lb/>passed by the convention was then submit<lb break="no"/>
            
               <cb/>
            
     ted to the Legislature for approval ; but the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature had no power to alter it. It had 
     <lb/>
     either to be rejected or accepted as a whole. 
     <lb/>
     It was so accepted, none of the details being 
     <lb/>
     altered. My hon. friend will see that while 
     <lb/>
     the Conference was composed of leading re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of the people in the various 
     <lb/>
     provinces, those conventions are composed 
     <lb/>
     of gentlemen elected by the people for that 
     <lb/>
     special purpose ; and that the only difference 
     <lb/>
     between them is in the mode of selection. 
     <lb/>
     However, in both cases, all political parties 
     <lb/>
     are represented. My hon. friend from the 
     <lb/>
     Home Division (Hon. Mr. AIKINS) in speak<lb break="no"/>ing of this Conference the other day, said 
     <lb/>
     he would have preferred if it had been a 
     <lb/>
    party matter,and he took the ground that if 
     <lb/>it had, it would have been better for the 
     <lb/>country.

     <persName ref="pers:AIKI1">HON. MR. AIKINS</persName>—I beg the honorable

     <lb/>
     I regretted very much that the measure had 
     <lb/>
     not been taken up and discussed as a party 
     <lb/>
     measure ; for although I was of opinion that

     it could not be carried as a party measure, if

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—A number of 
     <lb/>
     the representatives in the Federal Congress 
     <lb/>
     who voted for it were democrats, and with<lb break="no"/>out their concurrence and support it could 
     <lb/>
     not have been carried. Besides, that was 
     <lb/>
     only an amendment, not a revision of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. The Constitution of the United 
     <lb/>
     States was not the work of a party. The 
     <lb/>
     revision of the Constitution of the State of 
     <lb/>
     New York, in 1846, was not the work of a 
     <lb/>
     party. It is not desirable that any Consti<lb break="no"/>tution should be the work of a party ; in 
     <lb/>
     so important an undertaking all party spirit 
     <lb/>
     should be laid aside. (Hear, hear.) Why ? 
     <lb/>
     Because men of all parties are alike interested 
     <lb/>
     in the formation of a Constitution, and 
     <lb/>
     because in the construction of such an in<lb break="no"/>strument, the collective wisdom of the lead<lb break="no"/>ing men of all parties is needed. Besides, 
     <lb/>
     a Constitution so framed will be more likely, 
     <lb/>
     as my hon. friend from Wellington has so 
     <lb/>
     well said, to live in the hearts and affections 
     <lb/>
     of the people. (Hear, hear.) To shew the 
     <lb/>
     good sense of our neighbors on this point, 
     <lb/>
     they do not give the revision of a Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion—and the work of the Conference was 
     <lb/>
     a revision of our Constitution—to any party, 
     <lb/>
     but to men specially chosen for the purpose, 
     <lb/>
     from all parties ; and I think the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General, and the Lieutenant-Governors of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces acted most wisely 
     <lb/>
     when they selected men of all shades of 
     <lb/>
     political opinion to compose this Conference 
     <lb/>
     and to prepare this Constitution, because all 
     <lb/>
     party views and feelings being laid aside, 
     <lb/>
     the whole object and motive of the members 
     <lb/>
     of the body was to devise a scheme which 
     <lb/>
     would best tend to promote the good of their 
     <lb/>
     common country. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member from Wellington has suggested a 
     <lb/>
     very important objection to the scheme ; 
     <lb/>
     and I am free to admit that, if the position 
     <lb/>
     he took were a correct one, then it would not 
     <lb/>
     be my duty, or that of any elected member 
     <lb/>
     of this House, to assent to the measure. 
     <lb/>
     In order that I may not misrepresent the 
     <lb/>
     position taken by the hon. gentleman, let 
     <lb/>
     me quote his language, as reported in the 
     <lb/>
     newspapers. He held :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">That the elective members had received a 
     <lb/>
     sacred trust to exercise ; that they were sent here 
     <lb/>
     by their constituencies to represent them, and to 
     <lb/>
     do that only. Under these circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     how could they conceive they had the power 
     <lb/>
     to vote away the rights of their electors ? That 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     was not their <hi rendition="simple:italic">mandat</hi>, and if they did, they 
     <lb/>
     would be doing that which they had no authority 
     <lb/>
     to do ; they would be doing that which they could 
     <lb/>
     not do without going beyond the authority con<lb break="no"/>fided to them. </quote> 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now, it must be frankly admitted that if 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman's position be correct, 
     <lb/>
     then his objection would be fatal to any 
     <lb/>
     elected member giving his concurrence to 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of the Conference. But, hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, let us enquire what is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of a representative. Two elements 
     <lb/>
     enter into the idea of representation— 
     <lb/>
     namely, power and duty. A representative 
     <lb/>
     derives the former from his constituents 
     <lb/>
     acting by their majority, under the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. From what source does he derive 
     <lb/>
     the latter ? Obviously not from his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, because even the majority are not 
     <lb/>
     agreed on all points connected with the dis<lb break="no"/>charge of his duty. My hon. friend (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SANBORN) has spoken of the position of 
     <lb/>
     a representative, as being that of a trustee. 
     <lb/>
     I shall quote from a very able work on the 
     <lb/>
     British Commonwealth, in which that posi<lb break="no"/>tion is, to my mind, very fully and very satis<lb break="no"/>factorily proved to be incorrect. COX says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Any trust, to be obligatory in conscience, 
     <lb/>
     must be defined by the self-same persons who 
     <lb/>
     appoint the trustee, or the person who is to 
     <lb/>
     fulfil the trust. His powers and duties must 
     <lb/>
     be derived from identically the same authority, 
     <lb/>
     for it obviously would be contrary to morals, as 
     <lb/>
     it is to law, that a man would be bound in con<lb break="no"/>science to exercise, in a particular way, powers 
     <lb/>
     delegated to him by several others, when they 
     <lb/>
     themselves, while delegating those powers, differ 
     <lb/>
     as to the mode in which they are to be exercised. 
     <lb/>
     For, which of the different ways is the trustee to 
     <lb/>
     choose ? By whom of those who appoint him 
     <lb/>
     is he to be guided in preference to the rest ? At 
     <lb/>
     the most he is bound to exercise his trust in a 
     <lb/>
    particular way in those particulars only respect<lb break="no"/>ing which the trust makers are agree . Let us 
     <lb/>now apply this abstract principle of equity to the 
     <lb/>relations between a representative and his con<lb break="no"/>stituents. Regard him as their trustee. With 
     <lb/>respect to the source of his power there is no 
     <lb/>ambiguity ; it is derived from his constituents 
     <lb/>acting by their majority. But from whom does 
     <lb/>he derive the duty of expressing this or that 
     <lb/>opinion in Parliament ? In what particular are 
     <lb/>the trust-makers agreed ? The very majority 
     <lb/>who voted for him are rarely, perhaps never, all 
     <lb/>agreed on any one point on which their opinions 
     <lb/>have been compared with his. Some of them 
     <lb/>differ from him on some points, some on others, 
     <lb/>but they all voted for him, from personal con<lb break="no"/>sideration, or because of their agreement with 
     <lb/>him on those points which they respectively 
     <lb/>deemed most important. In the minority, also, 
     <lb/>are probably some electors who assent to some, 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <pb n="219" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0219.jpg"/>
            
     and dissent from others, of his opinions. The 
     <lb/>
     essential conditions of a valid trust to express 
     <lb/>
     particular opinions in Parliament are then want<lb break="no"/>ing. The persons nominating him to his office, 
     <lb/>
     do not concur as to the opinions which he is to 
     <lb/>
     express. How then can a trust exist which it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to define. The real trust imposed on 
     <lb/>
     the representative is co-extensive with those 
     <lb/>
     obligations, which alone the trust-makers can 
     <lb/>
     generally confer on him,— namely, to exercise his 
     <lb/>
     representative power honestly and discreetly. 
     <lb/>
     This argument, of course, assumes that the can<lb break="no"/>didate as not defined his parliamentary obliga<lb break="no"/>tions by unconditional pledges. </quote>

            <p>
     The only other possible limitation might 
     <lb/>
     exist in the Constitution. I shall look then 
     <lb/>
     at the instrument from which we derive our 
     <lb/>
     powers as legislative councillors, and shall 
     <lb/>
     quote from the Imperial Act of 1854, in<lb break="no"/>tituled " An Act to empower the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to alter the Constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, and for other purposes." 
     <lb/>
     The first section is as follows :—

     <lb/>
     be appointed or elected by such persons, and in

     such manner as to the said Legislature may seem

     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">That it shall be lawful for the Legislature of

            <p>
     These are the powers given us by our 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. (Hear, hear.) They are of 
     <lb/>
     the most ample character. We were elected, 
     <lb/>
     pursuant to an act passed in consequence of 
     <lb/>
     the exercise of these powers. And, coming 
     <lb/>
     from the people, the members of this House 
     <lb/>
     were put in possession of these powers the 
     <lb/>
     moment they were elected. None of them 
     <lb/>
     at their elections pledged themselves not to 
     <lb/>
     exercise the powers granted by the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. They were not asked by their consti<lb break="no"/>tuents to do so. How then, by voting for 
     <lb/>
     this or any other measure altering the con<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
            
     stitution of the Legislative Council, can they 
     <lb/>
     be said to betray the trust reposed in them 
     <lb/>
     by their constituents? My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Wellington admits that under the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion we have the power to alter the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of this House in so far as it relates to 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but he says we are not authorized 
     <lb/>
     to extend our action to the other provinces, 
     <lb/>
     in a scheme of Federal union. That is 
     <lb/>
     begging the question. I answer his objec<lb break="no"/>tion that any change affecting the elective 
     <lb/>
     principle is a breach of trust. Besides, 
     <lb/>
     we do not propose to enact a system 
     <lb/>
     of Government embracing all British North 
     <lb/>
     America. We have not the power to do so. 
     <lb/>
     We merely propose to address Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     on the subject. The Imperial Parliament 
     <lb/>
     alone has that power; but if we have power 
     <lb/>
     without a breach of trust to alter the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the Legislative Council of Canada 
     <lb/>
     (and my hon. friend admits this), then, 
     <lb/>
     certainly, we cannot be guilty of a breach of 
     <lb/>
     trust in suggesting a change embraced in a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution for the various provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     will not yield to my hon. iriends from Wel<lb break="no"/>lington and Niagara, in attachment to the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle, as applied to this House. 
     <lb/>
     I have always been an advocate for it, and I 
     <lb/>
     am so still, but we cannot get it inserted in 
     <lb/>
     this instrument; and much as I deplore its 
     <lb/>
     absence from our proposed Constitution, I am 
     <lb/>
     not on that account prepared to reject the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. This scheme, like all other 
     <lb/>
     constitutional compacts, is a compromise 
     <lb/>
     between the conflicting opinions of its 
     <lb/>
     framers; and on the whole, it is a fair 
     <lb/>
     compromise. This feature is not peculiar to 
     <lb/>
     our plan of Confederation. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     will find in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Federalist</hi>, and from the 
     <lb/>
     correspondence of the able men who framed 
     <lb/>
     the " Articles of Confederation," that com<lb break="no"/>promise and concessions of opinion were 
     <lb/>
     submitted to. But out of them all grew 
     <lb/>
     the wonderful fabric of the American Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. In the resolution which my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend proposes, there is, according to his 
     <lb/>
     own admission, compromise. He admits 
     <lb/>
     that he cannot in its integrity procure the 
     <lb/>
     application of the elective principle to the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council. He even proposes to 
     <lb/>
     add to the Opposite principle; why, then, 
     <lb/>
     does my hon. friend object to similar conces<lb break="no"/>sious on our part, when we believe that the 
     <lb/>
     probable advantages of the whole scheme far 
     <lb/>
     outweigh its defects? (Hear, hear.) As 
     <lb/>
     regards limitation in the general powers of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament contended for by my hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     I hold that it is not to be found in the

     unwritten Constitution, made up of historical 
     <lb/>
     and parliamentary precedents, any more than 
     <lb/>
     in our written Charter from the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. That great commentator, 
     <lb/>
     BLACKSTONE, says of Parliament:— 
     <lb/>

     So, Justice STORY, in speaking of the

     American Constitution, says :—

            <p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> Where a power is granted in general terms the

     deducible from the context. </quote>

     Chief Justice MARSHALL says :—

            <p>
     <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The Constitution unavoidably deals in general

     The only other authority I shall quote

            </p>
   
            <p>
     But my hon. friend's motion is utterly in<lb break="no"/>consistent with the position which he has 
     <lb/>
     taken. He takes ground in his speech 
     <lb/>
     which is upset by his motion. According 
     <lb/>
     to that position he is bound to the elective 
     <lb/>
     principle, and he is therefore on principle 
     <lb/>
     bound to do all in his power to remove 
     <lb/>
     obstructions to its well-working. He is 
     <lb/>
     bound even to remove the present nominated 
     <lb/>
     members from the House. What does his 
     <lb/>
     resolution propose? It proposes not merely 
     <lb/>
     to allow the nominated members to remain 
     <lb/>
     for life, but to add ten to their number! 
     <lb/>
     This is surely not giving free scope to the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle. Were the Lower Provin<lb break="no"/>ces to have the power which my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     proposes to give them, they would appoint 
     <lb/>
     ten of their youngest men to seats in this 
     <lb/>
     House, who might be here for years after 
     <lb/>
     those to whom they were an offset had 
     <lb/>
     been removed from the House. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Besides, he proposes to give the 
     <lb/>
     present elected members seats for eight 
     <lb/>
     years, and then, of course, the whole 
     <lb/>
     of them would go back for re-election at 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     once. I am net convinced by any argu<lb break="no"/>ment which I have heard that the elective 
     <lb/>
     principle, exercised in some way, is not the 
     <lb/>
     best mode to compose this House. It has 
     <lb/>
     worked well so far. All the fears which 
     <lb/>
     were entertained in reference to it have 
     <lb/>
     proved groundless, and I believe it would 
     <lb/>
     continue to work well, and therefore, I dis<lb break="no"/>approve of the change proposed in the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. But I am not on that account 
     <lb/>
     prepared to reject the whole scheme. 
     <lb/>
     With all its detects (and I believe those 
     <lb/>
     defects will be remedied) I accept it, because 
     <lb/>
     it will be productive of good to the country 
     <lb/>
     at large. Therefore, I shrink from the res<lb break="no"/>ponsibility of rejecting it. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     have to apologize for having detained the 
     <lb/>
     House so long—(cries of "no,no," "go on")—-— 
     <lb/>
     but, before sitting down, I must refer to the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of which my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Niagara Division (Hon. Mr. CURRIE) has 
     <lb/>
     given notice. It is as follows :—

            <p>
    <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> That upon a matter of such great importance 
     <lb/>
     as the proposed Confederation of this and certain

     other British Colonies, this House is unwilling to

     assume the responsibility of assenting to a measure 
     <lb/>
     involving so many important considerations, with

            <p>
     My hon. friend does not tell us, in this

     resolution, which he intends to move—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARMS2">HON. MR. ARMSTRONG</persName>—I scarcely

     think it is in order to discuss a resolution

            <p>

     <lb/>
     of the general subject brought before the

     House. It is on the notice paper, and 
     <lb/>
     I think I am quite in order in referring to 
     <lb/>
     it. I was about to say that my hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     in that notice does not tell us whether 
     <lb/>
     he intends to propose that public opinion 
     <lb/>
     shall be tested by an appeal to the people 
     <lb/>
     in the way of a dissolution of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Assembly, or by submitting the scheme 
     <lb/>
     in its integrity to a popular vote. If we 
     <lb/>
     recommend the former course, we should 
     <lb/>
     place ourselves in rather a strange position. 
     <lb/>
     If we advised His Excellency to dissolve the 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly, while we sat quietly by 
     <lb/>
     to see what was going on, it would be in 
     <lb/>
     effect saying—"We have scruples as to 
     <lb/>
     whether public opinion has, or has not en<lb break="no"/>dorsed these proposed constitution] changes ; 
     <lb/>
     but, if your Excellency will be so kind as to 
     <lb/>
     dissolve the House of Assembly, those 
     <lb/>
     scruples will be resolved by a general elec<lb break="no"/>tion." (Hear, hear, and laughter.) I think 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="221" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0221.jpg"/>
            
     that would be an extraordinary course for 
     <lb/>
     this House to take—and a course which I 
     <lb/>
     think would not he considered by the coun<lb break="no"/>try at large a very becoming one. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) If the other plan be what my hon. 
     <lb/>friend intends by his notice, then I say it 
     <lb/>is a process of ascertaining the popular sanc<lb break="no"/>tion entirely unknown to the British Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. It is a process unknown even to 
     <lb/>our friends on the other side of the line, 
     <lb/>except in those cases where the general or 
     <lb/>state Constitution expressly provides for it. 
     <lb/>Where such provisions are not contained in 
     <lb/>the state constitutions, it is invariably held 
     <lb/>that submission to the popular vote, in order 
     <lb/>to give the force of law to any legislative 
     <lb/>act, is unconstitutional and void. In re<lb break="no"/>ference to the practice, SEDGWICK, an emi<lb break="no"/>nent American authority, says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p><quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     Efforts have been made, in several cases, by the 
     <lb/>
     state 1egislatures to relieve themselves of the res<lb break="no"/>ponsibility of their functions, by submitting statutes 
     <lb/>
     to the will of the people in their primary capacity. 
     <lb/>
     But these proceedings have been held, and very 
     <lb/>
     rightly, to be entirely unconstitutional and invalid. 
     <lb/>
     The duties of legislation are not to be exercised 
     <lb/>
     by the people at large. The majority governs, 
     <lb/>
     but only in the prescribed form. The introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of practices of this kind would remove all 
     <lb/>
     checks on hasty and improvident legislation, and 
     <lb/>
     greatly diminish the benefits of representative 
     <lb/>
     government. So when an act to establish free 
     <lb/>
     schools was by its terms directed to be submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the electors of the state to become a law only 
     <lb/>
     in case a majority of the votes were given in its 
     <lb/>
     favor, it was held in New York that the whole 
     <lb/>
     proceeding was entirely void. The Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     said the Court of Appeals, have no power to make 
     <lb/>
     such submission, nor had the people the power to 
     <lb/>
     bind each other by acting upon it. They volun<lb break="no"/>tarily surrendered that power when they adopted 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution. The government of this state 
     <lb/>
     is democratic, but it is a representative demo<lb break="no"/>cracy, and in passing general laws the pie act 
     <lb/>
     only thro h their representatives in the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. In Indiana, the principle is now framed 
     <lb/>
     into a constitutional provision which vests the 
     <lb/>
     legislative authority in a Senate and House of 
     <lb/>
     Representatives, and declares that no law shall 
     <lb/>
     be the taking effect of which shall be made 
     <lb/>
     to spend upon any authority except as provided 
     <lb/>
     in the Constitution. And under these provisions 
     <lb/>
     it has been held that so much of an act as relates 
     <lb/>
     to its submission to the popular vote was null and 
     <lb/>
     void.

            </quote></p>

            <p>
     That is the general principle, according to 
     <lb/>
     American practice. And as I have said, the 
     <lb/>
     process of submitting any statute to the po<lb break="no"/>pular vote, in order to give it the force of 
     <lb/>
     law, is unheard of in British constitutional 
     <lb/>
     practice. (Hear, hear.) I shall not detain 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the House by going into the question of ex<lb break="no"/>pense, as I promised to do. I will simply 
     <lb/>
     say in conclusion, that I do think it is our 
     <lb/>
     duty as patriotic men, as men actuated by an 
     <lb/>
     honest desire to extricate our country from 
     <lb/>
     the difficulties in which it is placed, to deal 
     <lb/>
     fairly with this scheme, and as no other has 
     <lb/>
     been presented—as those who oppose it have 
     <lb/>
     not presented for our consideration any other 
     <lb/>
     —have not even suggested the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     any other to extricate us from the evils of 
     <lb/>
     our position—and believing that in the main 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, as regards its great leading out<lb break="no"/>lines, will effect that purpose—then, I say, it 
     <lb/>
     is our duty as honest and patriotic men, to 
     <lb/>
     approve of it and to sanction it by voting for 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions in their integrity. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I have resolved, like my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from the Western Division, and my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from the Brock Division (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. BLAIR) to vote against all amendments 
     <lb/>
     which may be offered to it. We have been 
     <lb/>
     told distinctly by the members of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment that we must either accept or 
     <lb/>
     reject it as it is—that amendment is impos<lb break="no"/>sible. I can very well understand the reason 
     <lb/>
     of that. It was adopted as a compact be<lb break="no"/>tween the representatives of the different 
     <lb/>
     provinces who had assembled in Conference 
     <lb/>
     for the express purpose of' framing this Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. Were we to make any inroads 
     <lb/>
     upon those resolutions, then the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces might claim and might exercise the 
     <lb/>
     same right. This instrument is not perfect. 
     <lb/>
     We all admit that there are points in it to 
     <lb/>
     which we object; and there are points in it, 
     <lb/>
     I dare say, to which our friends in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces object. It is a compromise, 
     <lb/>
     and I think it is a very able, and in the main 
     <lb/>
     a very fair compromise. It is such a com<lb break="no"/>promise as ought to commend itself to every 
     <lb/>
     reasonable and candid mind. I think, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that all amendments should be vetoed. 
     <lb/>
     And I am not afraid that, in taking that 
     <lb/>
     course, we shall not be justified by the people 
     <lb/>
     at large. (Hear, hear.) The people under<lb break="no"/>stand the meaning and effect of these amend<lb break="no"/>ments perfectly well. Perhaps I should not 
     <lb/>
     call them "buncombe," but they savour very 
     <lb/>
     much of that kind of thing. I think the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House need have no fears 
     <lb/>
     of public opinion in this matter. As regards 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada—for whom I am 
     <lb/>
     in a better position to speak than for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Lower Canada—I am satisfied they 
     <lb/>
     will endorse our approbation of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions ; although, as we do, they may object 
     <lb/>

     to some of the details. I have not hesitated 
     <lb/>
     to state my own disapproval of some of 
     <lb/>
     them.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Hear, hear.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—I disapprove of 
     <lb/>
     some of the details, just as strongly as my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from the Home Division (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. AIKINS,) or my hon. friend from Niagara 
     <lb/>
     Division (Hon. Mr. CURRIE). But I look at 
     <lb/>
     it in this light: here we are offered a Consti<lb break="no"/>tution which will deliver us from many of 
     <lb/>
     the great evils under which we have been 
     <lb/>
     laboring. I feel that in the main it will have 
     <lb/>
     that effect; and that this will be the result, 
     <lb/>
     could not have been stated more clearly or 
     <lb/>
     forcibly than we find it in the document 
     <lb/>
     which I read, as coming from the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada Opposition, and signed by Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     DORION, Hon. Mr. DRUMMOND, Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     DESSAULLES, and Hon. Mr. McGEE. I think 
     <lb/>
     that document contains arguments in its 
     <lb/>
     favor which are unanswerable. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     In the circumstances, then, in which we are 
     <lb/>
     placed, and in the absence of any other more 
     <lb/>
    feasible scheme, I believe that, in spite of 
     <lb/>all its objectionable features, the good which 
     <lb/>will result from it as a whole, will more than 
     <lb/>counterbalance all the difficulties and all the 
     <lb/>evils which may possibly grow out of it. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) And besides, it is not a final<lb break="no"/>ity. We have every reason to believe that 
     <lb/>those principles, which, I think, should 
     <lb/>have been embodied in it, are such as 
     <lb/>will ultimately prevail. I have confidence 
     <lb/>enough in the representatives of the people, 
     <lb/>and in the members of the Upper House 
     <lb/>to be nominated by the Crown, and who 
     <lb/>will compose that branch of the new Le<lb break="no"/>gislature formed under this Constitution. 
     <lb/>I say I have confidence in them to believe 
     <lb/>that, if the opinions which I hold in respect 
     <lb/>to those details shall prove to be correct, 
     <lb/>the defects referred to will be removed from 
     <lb/>the Constitution. There will be no more dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty in excising the nominative principle 
     <lb/>from the future Legislative Council, than 
     <lb/>there was in excising it from the former 
     <lb/>body. I might say there were greater diffi<lb break="no"/>culties in the one case than in the other. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Looking then at the advan<lb break="no"/>tages likely to result from the adaption of 
     <lb/>the resolutions—the establishment of peace 
     <lb/>and harmony among the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try—the getting rid of those terrible diffi<lb break="no"/>culties and conflicts which have beset our 
     <lb/>path, we ought not to hesitate. Whatever 
     <lb/>hon. gentlemen may say now, they did not 
     <lb/>

estimate them slightly when they were com<lb break="no"/>plaining of the conduct of the governments<lb/>of the day, and my hon. friend from Ni<lb break="no"/>agara (Honorable Mr. CURRIE) inveighed<lb/>against the evils which then existed as<lb/>strongly as any man could do. Looking, then<lb/>I say, at the abuses and difficulties which<lb/>have arisen under a legislative union; and,<lb/>thence arguing the impracticability of going<lb/>en with that kind of union, and believing<lb/>that the great advantages likely to result<lb/>from this scheme of Federal union will much<lb/>more than counterbalance the evils likely<lb/>to arise from it, I do say it is our duty<lb/>as honest and patriotic men to adopt the<lb/>resolutions presented to us by the Con<lb break="no"/>ference.

     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBORN</persName> said—I have no<lb/>desire to take up the time of the House,<lb/>and shall only do so for a moment or two.<lb/>I have been unable, from ill health, to be<lb/>present during the speeches on the amend<lb break="no"/>ment which I had the honor to submit, and<lb/>I shall merely avail myself of this oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to answer two or three of the argu<lb break="no"/>ments which have been advanced by my<lb/>hon. friend who has just taken his seat. It<lb/>appears to me that the difficulties under<lb/>which my hon. friend labors can be very<lb/>easily removed; and that, if he is really in<lb/>harmony in sentiment with those who sus<lb break="no"/>tain the amendment now before the House,<lb/>he ought not to hesitate to give it his sup<lb break="no"/>port. On a former occasion I endeavored to<lb/>show that the amendment did not impair<lb/>the scheme at all; that it did not place us<lb/>in antagonism with any of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces; that it was entirely a matter of our<lb/>own concern,—the election of members to the<lb/>Legislative Council—and that it was of no<lb/>consequence to the other provinces how those<lb/>
               <lb/>members were elected, if they had relatively 
     <lb/>
    the same number as we. My hon.- friend 
     <lb/>accuses me of being inconsistent in taking 
     <lb/>ground in favor of the elective principle, 
     <lb/>while proposing still to retain the nominated 
     <lb/>members in their seats, and also to add ten 
     <lb/>new members from the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>To this, I would answer that it is an excep<lb break="no"/>tional condition in which we are placed. "Fe 
     <lb/>cannot obviate the difficulty. A similar dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty presented itself to those who sought 
     <lb/>the change when the elective principle was 
     <lb/>introduced into this House, and they met it 
     <lb/>just in the same manner in which we propose 
     <lb/>to meet it here. The life members were 
     <lb/>retained while recognition and sanction were 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="223" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0223.jpg"/>
            
     given to the elective principle, and the House 
     <lb/>
     remains now a visib e memento of the car<lb break="no"/>rying out of the very position which I take 
     <lb/>
     on the present occasion. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     ground taken then, and to which the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Premier (Hon. Sir ETIENNE P. TACHÉ) gave 
     <lb/>
     the sanction of his name and reputation, 
     <lb/>
     was a recognition of the principle embodied 
     <lb/>
     in the amendment now before this honorable 
     <lb/>
     House. ( Hear, hear.) If we gained any<lb break="no"/>thing by introducing the elective principle, 
     <lb/>
     we propose to keep that advantage, by re<lb break="no"/>taining it just in the same form, and bear: 
     <lb/>
     ing the same relation to the proposed Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Council as it is retained in and bears 
     <lb/>
     relation to this House.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—But, under the 
     <lb/>
     present union, there is no federative necessity 
     <lb/>
     for relative equality of numbers in the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council, as there will be under the 
     <lb/>
     proposed union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR.SANBORN</persName>—I admit no neces<lb break="no"/>sities of the kind. These necessities are en<lb break="no"/>tirely artificial. In that respect, I think hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen are entirely in error in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion they take. And, though I concede to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Erie Division (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. CHRISTIE) every credit for great candor 
     <lb/>
     and soundness of judgment, still I must say 
     <lb/>
     that, when he enters into the province of 
     <lb/>
     law, he is travelling a little, as we say in the 
     <lb/>
     profession, out of the record—and that any 
     <lb/>
     one who is familiar with the doctrine of 
     <lb/>
     trusts could not fail to see the falseness of 
     <lb/>
     his reasoning in that particular. As regards 
     <lb/>
     a trust, of course, the person who has a man<lb break="no"/>date given to him, must act according to his 
     <lb/>
     discretion under the circumstances. But 
     <lb/>
     then he must do so within the trust that is 
     <lb/>
     given him and not beyond the trust. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON.  MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—Of course. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBORN</persName>—My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     cites the act empowering the Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to change the constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, and on this act he bases 
     <lb/>
     his whole argument. If I convince him that 
     <lb/>
     that act does not cover his argument, will 
     <lb/>
     he then concede the point ? That act, to 
     <lb/>
     which my hon. friend refers, was passed for 
     <lb/>
     a specific purpose, to enable Parliament to re<lb break="no"/>construct this House. It had answered its 
     <lb/>
     purpose when the constitution of this House 
     <lb/>
     was changed, but it cannot properly be in<lb break="no"/>voked as giving authority with reference to 
     <lb/>
     bringing in other provinces to form a new 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—But my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend will observe, that we are not legislat<lb break="no"/>
            
               <cb/>
            
     ing now—that we are merely passing an 
     <lb/>
     Address. 
     <lb/></p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBORN</persName>—We must feel 
     <lb/>
     that, according to the rules of law, we are 
     <lb/>
     asked here to go beyond the duties which 
     <lb/>
     our electors sent us into this House to dis<lb break="no"/>charge. I contend that neither any act on 
     <lb/>
     our own Statute Book, nor any Imperial Act, 
     <lb/>
     authorizes us to assume that they elected us  
     <lb/>
     to come here to demolish the whole fabric of 
     <lb/>
     our Constitution; and to seek to form another 
     <lb/>
     and entirely different political system, em<lb break="no"/>bracing a number of other provinces, so that 
     <lb/>
     our identity is entirely swamped and lost. 
     <lb/>
     I must say that, if my hon. friend feels 
     <lb/>
     bound at all by the trust committed to him 
     <lb/>
     by those who sent him here as a representa<lb break="no"/>tive of the people, I conceive he is neces<lb break="no"/>sarily bound to this, that he must sustain 
     <lb/>
     the elective principle with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the proposed Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council. It is impossible, I think, to arrive 
     <lb/>
     at any other conclusion. (Hear, hear.) My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend made use of one expression, with 
     <lb/>
     apparently some degree of reluctance—the 
     <lb/>
     term " buncombe." I think that was sug<lb break="no"/>gestive, and very suggestive. For, if those 
     <lb/>
     who are favoring this principle favor it for 
     <lb/>
     what my hon. friend characterizes as " bun<lb break="no"/>combe," then they are seeking popularity 
     <lb/>
     with the people—they are seeking what the 
     <lb/>
     people want—(hear, hear)—and that argu<lb break="no"/>ment certainly does not avail my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     in his present position ; for he maintains 
     <lb/>
     that the people fully understand this thing, 
     <lb/>
     and want it. If this be the case—if the 
     <lb/>
     whole Province of Canada is bent upon hav<lb break="no"/>ing this scheme—then those who are trying 
     <lb/>
     to resist it are standing alone, and are either 
     <lb/>
     acting patriotically, or are beside themselves. 
     <lb/>
     They cannot certainly be acting from any 
     <lb/>
     desire to obtain popularity, because, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to my hon. friend, they are just doing 
     <lb/>
     what the people do not want them to do. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I know that the position of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend is somewhat embarrassing. 
     <lb/>
     He resides in a section of the province. 
     <lb/>
     where he feels there is a difficulty that needs 
     <lb/>
     to be removed in some way or other ; and 
     <lb/>
     he is now endeavoring to show that the best 
     <lb/>
     means of removing that difficulty is to em<lb break="no"/>brace a great many other difficulties of a 
     <lb/>
     huge character, and of which we cannot 
     <lb/>
     fully comprehend the consequences. When 
     <lb/>
     an hon. gentleman is prepared to take that 
     <lb/>
     ground, I think it would be better for him 
     <lb/>
     to take it in silence, than to attempt to sus<lb break="no"/>tain it by reason. As regards Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="224" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0224.jpg"/>
            
     we are not situated in the same way. There 
     <lb/>
     is the French party, and there is the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish party in Lower Canada, who are situated 
     <lb/>
     very differently from the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; and the people of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     have a disposition not to recognize their 
     <lb/>
     peculiar circumstances, or to have any con<lb break="no"/>cern for them at all. If my hon. friend will 
     <lb/>
     pardon me, I would say that his whole 
     <lb/>
     philosophy is in favor of Upper Canada. In 
     <lb/>
     speaking of the public opinion of this pro<lb break="no"/>vince, it was always Upper Canada—he had 
     <lb/>
     no idea of Lower Canada as having any exis<lb break="no"/>tence or any rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     is quite mistaken. I quoted as lengthily 
     <lb/>
     from the manifesto of the Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, as from that of the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada Opposition.

     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBORN</persName>—I am now speak<lb break="no"/>ing of the English of Lower Canada ; and, 
     <lb/>
     as regards the people giving a distinct assent 
     <lb/>
     to this proposition, my hon. friend will admit 
     <lb/>
     that the English of Lower Canada have not 
     <lb/>
     given such an assent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—I stated that I

     <lb/>
     which I belonged, than with regard to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada.

     <persName ref="pers:SANB1">HON. MR. SANBORN</persName>—The resolutions 
     <lb/>
     to which Hon. Mr. DORION was a part , and 
     <lb/>
     which were read by my hon. friend, con<lb break="no"/>ceive to embody, not what Mr. DORION'S 
     <lb/>
     party, or any one political party rather than 
     <lb/>
     another desired. I take it for granted that 
     <lb/>
     British subjects of French Canadian origin 
     <lb/>
     generally have their feelings in that direc<lb break="no"/>tion—that is, they desire large power for 
     <lb/>
     the local government—in fact they would 
     <lb/>
     desire the local governments to be the real 
     <lb/>
     governments, and that the Federation should 
     <lb/>
     be very much nominal, for very minor pur<lb break="no"/>poses, and with very weak powers in the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government ; while, on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, the English population of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada would take the opposite view, and 
     <lb/>
     desire larger powers in the Central Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and smaller powers in the Local Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. This, I think, was the view to 
     <lb/>
     which the resolutions read by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     had reference. Now, as regards the Reform 
     <lb/>
     party of Upper Canada, let us see what they 
     <lb/>
     had reference to—whether it was anything 
     <lb/>
     like the Constitution which is now proposed. 
     <lb/>
     I hold in my hand a pamphlet—the Address 
     <lb/>
     of the Reform Constitutional Association to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the people of Upper Canada in 1859—and 
     <lb/>
     I find here what they conceive to be the true 
     <lb/>
     remedy thus stated :—

            <p><quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> " The true remedy !" What then is the remedy 
     <lb/>
     best adapted to deliver the province from the 
     <lb/>
     disastrous position it now occupies ? We answer 
     <lb/>
     —dissolve the existing legislative union. Divide 
     <lb/>
     Canada into two or more provinces with local 
     <lb/>
     executives and legislatures having entire control 
     <lb/>
     over every public interest except those, and those 
     <lb/>
     only, that are necessarily common to all parts of 
     <lb/>
     the province. Let no public debt be incurred by 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures, until the sanction has been ob<lb break="no"/>tained by direct vote. Establish some central

     authority over all, with power to administer such 
     <lb/>
     matters, and such only as are necessarily common 
     <lb/>
     to the whole province. Let the functions of this 
     <lb/>
     central authority be clearly laid ; let its powers 
     <lb/>
     be strictly confined to discharging specified duties.

     be ratified by a direct vote of the people. 
     <lb/>
     And the beauty of the thing was, that the

     increase the debt of the provinces, but 
     <lb/>
     gradually to pay it off. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>

     like it, I should be happy to give it my best 
     <lb/>
     consideration at once ; and I should be very 
     <lb/>
     glad if they would only give us a small part 
     <lb/>
     of it, of which I think they must see the 
     <lb/>
     justice—namely, written guarantees, so as 
     <lb/>
     to assure us that our rights of property shall 
     <lb/>
     not be overturned by the Local Parliament ; 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="225" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-15_Page_0225.jpg"/>
            
     to prevent, for example, a Squatter's bill— 
     <lb/>
     (laughter)—being passed at the very first 
     <lb/>
     opportunity in the Local Parliament, demol<lb break="no"/>ishing all the rights of property. I see my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend opposite (Hon. Mr. CRAWFORD) 
     <lb/>
     look melancholy, because he foresees that, 
     <lb/>
     when the new Constitution is adopted, twelve 
     <lb/>
     months will not pass before that becomes 
     <lb/>
     law in Lower Canada, and all protection for 
     <lb/>
     proprietors, so far as that is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     brought to an end. But this is only one 
     <lb/>
     instance, significant of what will take place. 
     <lb/>
     It is perfectly well known, and none can 
     <lb/>
     realize it better than those who have a much 
     <lb/>
     greater horror of the progress of popular 
     <lb/>
     sentiments than I have, that the tendency 
     <lb/>
     in the popular mind is to break down mon<lb break="no"/>opolies of every kind, and to go to extremes 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with vested rights, even those 
     <lb/>
     which are established and founded on sub<lb break="no"/>stantial principles of justice. Now, these 
     <lb/>
     rights, at the very least, ought certainly to 
     <lb/>
     be confided to the highest legislative author<lb break="no"/>ity. I go further and maintain that guaran<lb break="no"/>tees for those rights ought to be placed in the 
     <lb/>
     written Constitution, that they ought to be 
     <lb/>
     beyond the power of interference by the 
     <lb/>
     legislative authority, and that they should 
     <lb/>
     be guarded by the judicial decisions of the 
     <lb/>
     highest courts in the country. In that case 
     <lb/>
     there would be a protection for property, but 
     <lb/>
     in this Constitution there is no such protec<lb break="no"/>tion for property either in Upper or Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. And here is the point to which 
     <lb/>
     I ask the attention of my honorable friends 
     <lb/>
     of all parties—a point which I think all of 
     <lb/>
     them have been too little concerned about, 
     <lb/>
     and which applies just as well to Upper as 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada. For I say that, if some 
     <lb/>
     security is not given to the people in one of 
     <lb/>
     these ways for maintaining vested rights 
     <lb/>
     and interests of this character, the most 
     <lb/>
     disastrous results will arise in every Local 
     <lb/>
     Parliament ; because, when these parlia<lb break="no"/>ments are constructed, they will neces<lb break="no"/>sarily consist of a different class of men from 
     <lb/>
     those who now compose the legislatures of 
     <lb/>
     the various provinces. There will be such 
     <lb/>
     inducements to men of the highest order to 
     <lb/>
     get elected to the Central Parliament, that 
     <lb/>
     the consequence will necessarily and natur<lb break="no"/>ally be the result to which I point. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I should like to refer to one argu<lb break="no"/>ment which was used by my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Saugeen (Hon. Mr. MACPHERSON)—who is 
     <lb/>
     not now in his place—that the appointment 
     <lb/>
     of members of the Legislative Council in 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the proposed Federal Parliament is not in 
     <lb/>
     fact an abandonment of the elective prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, because the appointments are to be by 
     <lb/>
     the Ministry of the day, who must have the 
     <lb/>
     confidence of the people. That is certainly 
     <lb/>
     a most extraordinary argument. If it held 
     <lb/>
     good at all, it should apply equally to both 
     <lb/>
     Houses, and the Legislative Assembly should 
     <lb/>
     be appointed by the Ministry, because the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry have been selected by those who 
     <lb/>
     have been elected by the people. This is 
     <lb/>
     the clear, logical deduction from my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's argument, if it is good for anything 
     <lb/>
     —because, if appointment by the Ministry 
     <lb/>
     is not an abandonment of the elective prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, you would still have an elective Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Assembly, although its members were 
     <lb/>
     appointed by the Government (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) But this was also well answered on 
     <lb/>
     a former occasion by my hon. friend behind 
     <lb/>
     me (Hon. Mr. AIKINS.) It is not simply 
     <lb/>
     the first appointment that we oppose. It is 
     <lb/>
     the appointments afterwards, as the first 
     <lb/>
     members die out or resign, and their suc<lb break="no"/>cessors are appointed on the nomination of 
     <lb/>
     the future local governments. Instead of 
     <lb/>
     this producing a favorable result, it appears 
     <lb/>
     to me it will have just the opposite effect. 
     <lb/>
     The reason is plain. If, in the very first 
     <lb/>
     instance, the prerogative is exercised, not by 
     <lb/>
     the Sovereign or the Sovereign's representa<lb break="no"/>tive, unbiassed, but is exercised by a party 
     <lb/>
     government, you have a House constituted 
     <lb/>
     at its very first meeting of a party character. 
     <lb/>
     In the other branch that particular Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has a majority. But it is possible, 
     <lb/>
     that that party may not long retain power. 
     <lb/>
     In the nature of things it is not probable 
     <lb/>
     that they will. No party does. But the 
     <lb/>
     Upper House remains permanent, and you 
     <lb/>
     provide by your very first operation for that 
     <lb/>
     dead-lock—that conflict between the Upper 
     <lb/>
     and the Lower House, which has been spoken 
     <lb/>
     of. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On motion of <persName ref="pers:MOOR1">HON. MR. MOORE</persName>, the 
     <lb/>
     debate was adjourned till to-morrow.

            <!-- TY, 2017-07-13, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

            <p>
      HON. MR. MOORE said —Honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, it is with a great degree of diffi<lb break="no"/>dence that I rise to address this House, after 
     <lb/>
     the very able speeches that have been made  
     <lb/>
     on both sides of this question, but I shall 
     <lb/>
     endeavor, honorable gentlemen, as briefly as 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
