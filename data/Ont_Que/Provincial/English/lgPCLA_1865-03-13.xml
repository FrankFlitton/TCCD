     I understood the other day that it was the

     intention of the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West to raise a question as to the propriety 
     <lb/>

     of moving this resolution at the present 
     <lb/>
    stage of the proceedings. I desire to know 
     <lb/>whether it is still his intention to raise that 
     <lb/>objection, because, if it is, I should confine 
     <lb/>myself in the first place to arguing that 
     <lb/>point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—I do 
     <lb/>
     object. But I do not mean to enter into 
     <lb/>
     any argument, but merely to ask the decision 
     <lb/>
     of the Speaker on the point of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     THE SPEAKER—Having learned that 
     <lb/>
     the point of order was to be raised, I have 
     <lb/>
     looked into the matter, and decide that the 
     <lb/>
     resolution is in order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">HON. MR. CAMERON</persName>—Then, I will 
     <lb/>
     proceed to offer to the House the obser<lb break="no"/>vations which I think it necessary to make, 
     <lb/>
     as well on the general subject as on the 
     <lb/>
     particular matter embraced in this motion. 
     <lb/>
     And as the House is aware that I very 
     <lb/>
     rarely trouble it with a speech on any mat<lb break="no"/>ter, unless I consider it to be one of impor<lb break="no"/>tance, and that when I do I seldom detain 
     <lb/>
     hon. members at any considerable length, I 
     <lb/>
     trust they will bear with me in those ob<lb break="no"/>servations. Considering the length of time 
     <lb/>
     that the subject has been discussed, and the 
     <lb/>
     great desire that exists in the mind of every 
     <lb/>
     one to have this subject brought to a con<lb break="no"/>clusion as rapidly as possible, I promise on 
     <lb/>
     this occasion to be brief. I have already, so 
     <lb/>
     far as my own individual vote in this House 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, done exactly what I would have 
     <lb/>
     done if I had only been an elector called upon 
     <lb/>
     for his vote. We have pronounced upon the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions submitted to the House, and I 
     <lb/>
     have shewn my own conviction of their pro<lb break="no"/>priety by having voted in their favor; and 
     <lb/>
     if I were to exercise my franchise as an 
     <lb/>
     elector, I would do outside the House what 
     <lb/>
     I have done inside the House, and declare 
     <lb/>
     in favor of those resolutions, though not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that the scheme for the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the provinces would be so advan<lb break="no"/>tageous as the larger scheme of a legislative 
     <lb/>union. But I have always felt that if you 
     <lb/>desire to obtain something which you believe 
     <lb/>for the benefit of the country, you should 
     <lb/>not insist upon that which is impossible— 
     <lb/>that which cannot be carried, but should 
     <lb/>endeavor to obtain that which you can fairly 
     <lb/>reach, and by and by you may get that 
     <lb/>which, at a far distance, seems impossible. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I believe the Confederation 
     <lb/>of the colonies will lead hereafter to a legis<lb break="no"/>lative union. The only difficulty I have felt 
     <lb/>is, that I believe it would have been infin<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
           itely better if all the powers given to local 
     <lb/>
     governments should also be given to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government, so that when the time 
     <lb/>
     came—when all those smaller stars should 
     <lb/>
     fall from the firmament—the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would possess all those powers, and 
     <lb/>
     there would be no necessity then for framing 
     <lb/>
     a new Constitution. This subject, I think, 
     <lb/>
     may be fairly considered under three aspects. 
     <lb/>
     First, as regards the necessity of a change in 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution at all. Secondly, as regards 
     <lb/>
     the nature of the change proposed, and how 
     <lb/>
     it will affect the interests involved in it. 
     <lb/>
     And, thirdly, as regards the propriety of the 
     <lb/>
     measure being submitted to the people, 
     <lb/>
     before it is finally enacted by the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. As to the first point—the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of a change—I believe there are 
     <lb/>
     very few people in the country, in whatever 
     <lb/>
     part of it they may be found, who will be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to say that some change in the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution of the country has not become 
     <lb/>
     necessary. I believe we are all satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     things cannot go on as they are now. I 
     <lb/>
     believe we are all satisfied that the people 
     <lb/>
     are looking out for some alteration, by which 
     <lb/>
     they hope a greater amount of prosperity 
     <lb/>
     may come to the country, than that which 
     <lb/>
     has been around it and about it for some 
     <lb/>
     years past. I am firmly convinced in my 
     <lb/>
     own mind—against the opinions of one or 
     <lb/>
     two hon. gentlemen, who stood up here the 
     <lb/>
     other night—that there has not been, since 
     <lb/>
     the union of these provinces, a greater 
     <lb/>
     amount of depression, a greater want of 
     <lb/>
     feeling of prosperity throughout the whole 
     <lb/>
     western portion of Canada, than exists 
     <lb/>
     there at this moment. I believe that into 
     <lb/>
     whatever part of the country you go, you 
     <lb/>
     will find that a succession of bad crops, and 
     <lb/>
     the difficulties which have arisen from large 
     <lb/>
     sums of money having been borrowed at 
     <lb/>
     high interest, and the necessity of large 
     <lb/>
     remittances to England—that all these have 
     <lb/>
     pressed heavily on the energies of the 
     <lb/>
     people, and tended to paralyse them; and 
     <lb/>
     they are looking out, therefore, in every 
     <lb/>
     direction, with the best hopes they can 
     <lb/>
     conjure up, for some change or alteration, 
     <lb/>
     such as they believe will place them on a 
     <lb/>
     better footing than that which they have 
     <lb/>
     hitherto occupied. (Hear, hear.) The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council for many years 
     <lb/>
     past, with a great number of those who 
     <lb/>
     have always been in the habit of acting 
     <lb/>
     with him, has believed that if we obtained, 
     <lb/>
     in the western portion of Canada, represen<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="964" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0964.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">964</fw>
           
     tation by population, it would have great 
     <lb/>
     influence in stimulating the energies of the 
     <lb/>
     people, and placing them on a much more 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory footing than that on which they 
     <lb/>
     now stand. I am satisfied, with that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, that it would have had this 
     <lb/>
     effect to a very great extent. But we know 
     <lb/>
     very well the antagonisms which existed be<lb break="no"/>tween the two sections, and that that mea<lb break="no"/>sure, while pressed by Upper Canada, was 
     <lb/>
     resisted by Lower Canada. We have felt— 
     <lb/>
     and no doubt many in Lower Canada have 
     <lb/>
     felt—that this Confederation of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Colonies would probably 
     <lb/>
     not have reached the point it has reached, 
     <lb/>
     had the demands—the just demands—of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada been conceded by Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; had we been placed in that 
     <lb/>
     position on the floor of this House, 
     <lb/>
     which we thought the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     western portion of Canada required at the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But we have not found that that was done. 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada felt that if representation by 
     <lb/>
     population were conceded, there would have 
     <lb/>
     been dangers incurred to her own institu<lb break="no"/>tions, which s e was not willing to place in 
     <lb/>
     the hands of the increased number of repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from Upper Canada. I think the 
     <lb/>
     people of Lower Canada were mistaken in 
     <lb/>
     that feeling. I do not believe that her 
     <lb/>
     institutions would have been dealt with in a 
     <lb/>
     way unsatisfactory to her people. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Upper Canada, I think, have always 
     <lb/>
     been prepared to do what was fair and just 
     <lb/>
     towards the peeple of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I have no doubt, however, 
     <lb/>
     that the people of Lower Canada would 
     <lb/>
     be much more ready to take up such a 
     <lb/>
     scheme as this. which would give them 
     <lb/>
     a Local Legislature to manage their own 
     <lb/>
     local affairs, rather than adopt a measure 
     <lb/>
     which would place them in what they 
     <lb/>
     might conceive to be an inferior posi<lb break="no"/>tion in point of their numbers on the floor 
     <lb/>
     of this House, and an inferior position in 
     <lb/>
     respect of power—supposing representation 
     <lb/>
     by population in the united Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Canada were carried. There can be no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that the idea that there is a necessity 
     <lb/>
     for change has not only grown up from the 
     <lb/>
     feeling to which I have referred, but from 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances connected with our rela<lb break="no"/>tions to the neighboring republic during 
     <lb/>
     the last three or four years. The Recipro<lb break="no"/>city treaty was passed ten years ago, ,at a 
     <lb/>
     time when the value placed upon the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadas by the neighboring country was very 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
      different from that now placed upon them— 
     <lb/>
    when the statesmen of the United States 
     <lb/>believed the effect of that measure would be 
     <lb/>gradually to ripen the pear of this country, 
     <lb/>until it would be prepared to fall into their 
     <lb/>hands. And, unquestionably, the views of 
     <lb/>many of those who consented to the Re<lb break="no"/>ciprocity treaty, at the time of their con<lb break="no"/>senting to it, were that they expected that 
     <lb/>its effect would be gradually to facilitate the 
     <lb/>passage of these colonies into the arms of 
     <lb/>the United States—to create a feeling in 
     <lb/>favor of annexation, and to check the feel<lb break="no"/>ing which was springing up of an entirely 
     <lb/>opposite character. But now there is no 
     <lb/>doubt that the disposition to abrogate the 
     <lb/>Reciprocity treaty has not arisen alone from 
     <lb/>angry feelings against England by the 
     <lb/>people of the United States, and in con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the fancied raids from this 
     <lb/>country—but also from the fact that there 
     <lb/>has been a great pressure of taxation upon 
     <lb/>themselves, and the necessity of raising the 
     <lb/>tariff, and from the belief that if a tax were 
     <lb/>placed upon the produce coming in to them 
     <lb/>from Canada, an increased revenue would re<lb break="no"/>sult. All these circumstances have iven rise 
     <lb/>to the desire on the part of the peop e and the 
     <lb/>Government of the United States to place 
     <lb/>this uestion on a different footing from that 
     <lb/>on which it has stood for ten years, and to 
     <lb/>repeal that treaty which they represent to 
     <lb/>be entirely in favor of Canada, though in 
     <lb/>point of fact it is very largely in favor of 
     <lb/>the United States. (Hear, hear.) Another 
     <lb/>reason why a change is necessary, is—as we 
     <lb/>cannot conceal from ourselves—that our 
     <lb/>position as a colony has been greatly altered 
     <lb/>by the events which have taken place in the 
     <lb/>United States. ,We cannot now expect that 
     <lb/>we can sit with our arms folded, praying 
     <lb/>that Providence may be good to us, though 
     <lb/>we do not prepare to defend ourselves. We 
     <lb/>cannot expect that England will be prepared 
     <lb/>to take on her shoulders almost the whole of 
     <lb/>the burden, and that we are to be neither the 
     <lb/>hewers of wood nor the drawers of water. We 
     <lb/>must be both. And if we obtain, as I hope, 
     <lb/>through the resolutions which have been 
     <lb/>passed, when the proper time comes, we will 
     <lb/>obtain—if we get the name and <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> of a 
     <lb/>nation, we should not be afraid also to take 
     <lb/>the responsibilities of a nation ; and the 
     <lb/>course most likely to save us from attack is 
     <lb/>that we should learn in the time of peace to 
     <lb/>be prepared for the exigency of war, and to 
     <lb/>put ourselves—a peeple of four millions, as 
     <lb/>we will be when united together—in a posi<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="965" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0965.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">965</fw>
           
     tion to defend our liberties from whatever 
     <lb/>
     quarter they may be attacked. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     We cannot therefore help seeing that a ne<lb break="no"/>cessity exists for this change, a necessity 
     <lb/>
     urged upon us, both by our political position, 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the state of the representa<lb break="no"/>tion in Parliament, and by the position in 
     <lb/>
     which, in common with the colonies below, 
     <lb/>
     we stand with reference to the probab<lb break="no"/>ilities of hostilities from the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and the placing of the country in a 
     <lb/>
     proper state of defence. The necessity 
     <lb/>
     Of change then being admitted—and I 
     <lb/>
     believe there is scarcely one honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman on either side of the House who 
     <lb/>
     does not admit it—some think that change 
     <lb/>
     should be brought about in one way, some 
     <lb/>
     think that it should be brought about in 
     <lb/>
     another way. Some think—and the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council at one time ap<lb break="no"/>parently was of that opinion—that the most 
     <lb/>
     desirable change would be the smaller 
     <lb/>
     scheme of the Federation of Canada, divided 
     <lb/>
     into two or three provinces—that that would 
     <lb/>
     be the best way of averting the evils. which 
     <lb/>
     threaten us. Some believe we can go on as 
     <lb/>
     we are now.

     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>— 
     <lb/>
     Hear! hear! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">HON. MR. CAMERON</persName>—I believe there 
     <lb/>
     are not a half a dozen members of this House 
     <lb/>
     who believe that, with the difliculties of our 
     <lb/>
     position, we can work the union on present 
     <lb/>
     terms. If we cannot, then we have the 
     <lb/>
     alternatives of the dissolution of the union— 
     <lb/>
     going back to the old position we occupied 
     <lb/>
     belore the union, which no man would 
     <lb/>
     entertain for a,moment—-or a Federation of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadas—or this larger scheme of a union 
     <lb/>
     of all the British North American Colonies. 
     <lb/>
     If any one for a moment will consider all 
     <lb/>
     those projects in the true view in which 
     <lb/>
     they ought to be considered, he will see that 
     <lb/>
     with ref.-rence to the second branch of my 
     <lb/>
     subject—the nature of the change, and the 
     <lb/>
     magnitude of the interests involved in it— 
     <lb/>
     this scheme is the one to which the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture and the people of this country must 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     necessarily come. (Hear, hear.) We are 
     <lb/>
     desirous of assuming a position on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent, which will place the whole of these 
     <lb/>
     feeble colonies under one united government. 
     <lb/>
     And when that united government is form<lb break="no"/>ed, when that uniou does take place, we 
     <lb/>
     shall then stand in a position which, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the facts and figures that have been 
     <lb/>
     used from time to time in this debate, will 
     <lb/>
     establish us as a power on this continent, 
     <lb/>
     and enable us to assist in working out the 
     <lb/>
     three problems presented by the three gov<lb break="no"/>ernments—the despotic government of 
     <lb/>
     Mexico, the republican government of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and the constitutional gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of these colonies. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I trust the result would be, that we should 
     <lb/>
     see the government of these colonies stand<lb break="no"/>ing longer than any of the others, inasmuch 
     <lb/>
     as we believe it is based on the more free 
     <lb/>
    exercise of the true will of the people, and ' 
     <lb/>carries out institutions which in the Mother 
     <lb/>Country have stood the test of time, toil and 
     <lb/>wear, until they have become more firmly 
     <lb/>cemented now than at any former period of 
     <lb/>their existence. (Hear, hear.)  And I 
     <lb/>cannot help feeling that if ere is that 
     <lb/>necessity for a change, the nature of 
     <lb/>the change preposed must commend itself to 
     <lb/>every one who is a true lover of his country 
     <lb/>on this side of the Atlantic. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>We are five colonies with a population of 
     <lb/>4,000,000, and we shall have a debt of about 
     <lb/>$80,000,000, or about 820 for each inhabi<lb break="no"/>tant. In the neighboring republic, from a 
     <lb/>statement made at the close of last year, we 
     <lb/>learn that the debt in that country, on the first 
     <lb/>of July next, will be no less than about 8150 
     <lb/>on the head of every inhabitant. Hence our 
     <lb/>young nation, with a debt of only $20 upon 
     <lb/>each "inhabitant, will stand in a position, in 
     <lb/>reference to debt, far different from what the 
     <lb/>people of that country will stand. Let us 
     <lb/>take a glance over the whole of the British 
     <lb/>Colonial Empire. England has thirty-eight 
     <lb/>colonies, containing ten millions of people. 
     <lb/>Six millions of these are white and four mil<lb break="no"/>lions are black. Of the six millions of white 
     <lb/>people, four millions are inhabitants of 
     <lb/>these British American Colonies. We have 
     <lb/>for Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>no less than five millions of tons' capacity of 
     <lb/>sea-going vessels, and on the lakes seven 
     <lb/>millions, making a total tonnage of'twelve 
     <lb/>millions, which, in point of tonnage, places 
     <lb/>us as the third power in the world. No 
     <lb/>other nations but England and _the United 
     <lb/>States possess a larger tonnage than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="966" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0966.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">966</fw>
            <p>
     Nova Scotia itself has a larger tonnage than 
     <lb/>
     the great empire of Austria. If this is to 
     <lb/>
     be our position in relation to our population, 
     <lb/>
     our debt and our tonnage, one cannot well 
     <lb/>
     help seeing that we must strengthen our<lb break="no"/>selves by coming together in a political and 
     <lb/>
     commercial union. We have now five inde<lb break="no"/>pendent, and I may say hostile tariffs—a 
     <lb/>
     different one in each of the colonies ; and we 
     <lb/>
     have five different governments. We will then 
     <lb/>
     have one strong independent government, and 
     <lb/>
     one system of customs taxation. Although 
     <lb/>
     we shall not have the same concentrated 
     <lb/>
     power that we would have in a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union, still we shall have a power that will 
     <lb/>
     hold over this country that great force that 
     <lb/>
     must be possessed to enable it to bring the 
     <lb/>
     whole military force of the country to bear 
     <lb/>
     in case its defence becomes necessary, and 
     <lb/>
     which will place us in a much better position 
     <lb/>
     than ever before. Look at the whole of the 
     <lb/>
     colonies of England, and let us inquire 
     <lb/>
     whether, in point of the magnitude of the 
     <lb/>
     trade they bring to England and the amount 
     <lb/>
     of English goods they consume, compared 
     <lb/>
     with the expenditure that England is called 
     <lb/>
     upon to make, there is really any valid found<lb break="no"/>ation for the position taken by those political 
     <lb/>
     economists of England, of the Manchester 
     <lb/>
     and Birmingham school. Take the whole 
     <lb/>
     of the exports of England to the colonies, 
     <lb/>
     and her imports from those colonies, and 
     <lb/>
     what do we find? The exports of England 
     <lb/>
     last year amounted to nearly £100,000 ,000 
     <lb/>
     sterling, while the exports from the colonies 
     <lb/>
     to Great Britain amounted to £40,000,000 
     <lb/>
     sterling. Place the colonists, man for man, 
     <lb/>
     with foreign countries, and you will find the 
     <lb/>
     trade of the colonies is of much more advan<lb break="no"/>tage to England than that of foreign nations, 
     <lb/>
     independently of all those other great interests 
     <lb/>
     which are involved in the retention by Eng<lb break="no"/>land of her colonial possessions. Take the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the whole of England's expendi<lb break="no"/>ture is £40,000,000 sterling, exclusive of the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the national debt, while her ex<lb break="no"/>pense for colonial purposes annually, exclusive 
     <lb/>
     of India and of the casual expenses arising from 
     <lb/>
     sending troops to colonies where hostilities 
     <lb/>
     are taking place, was only some £2,000,000 
     <lb/>
     sterling, of which amount Canada only 
     <lb/>
     had but little more than £500,000 sterling. 
     <lb/>
     When these things are taken into consider<lb break="no"/>ation, I say it will be found that the colonies 
     <lb/>
     are of much more value to the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country than is generally supposed, and 
     <lb/>
     much more than the school of politicians 
     <lb/>
     to which I have referred would have 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     people believe. If what the Mother Country 
     <lb/>
     obtains from our connection with them is 
     <lb/>
     of so little importance as to give currency 
     <lb/>
     to the doctrines of that school, I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it would be hard to shew that what 
     <lb/>
     we get from our connection with Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain is of no very great importance 
     <lb/>
     to us, except in the matter of defence. 
     <lb/>
     If we desire to live under the glorious old 
     <lb/>
     flag, and to maintain the honored name of 
     <lb/>
     British subjects, is it right for our brethren 
     <lb/>
     in England, who are "free from touch of 
     <lb/>
     spoil," to say that unless we provide for 
     <lb/>
     our own defence, we shall be cast off? We 
     <lb/>
     should be looked upon as disloyal if we took 
     <lb/>
     the same stand, and declared that we would 
     <lb/>
     choose our own connection if we provided 
     <lb/>
     the whole expense of our defence. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Sir, I think we should be able to tell the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country that we are prepared to do all 
     <lb/>
     in our power for self-defence. When I have 
     <lb/>
     stated that the debt of Canada is only $20 per 
     <lb/>
     head, and that that of the United States will 
     <lb/>
     soon be, if it is not now, $150 per head of the 
     <lb/>
     population, I am ready to say that I would 
     <lb/>
     most unhesitatingly be willing, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of completing our connection with the 
     <lb/>
     seaboard, of building the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way, and avoiding the liability we now labor 
     <lb/>
     under, of having our connection with Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain cut off. I say I would be willing 
     <lb/>
     to place $10 additional upon every inhabitant 
     <lb/>
     of the country, in order that we might be 
     <lb/>
     placed on the true footing on which we 
     <lb/>
     ought to stand in the estimation of the 
     <lb/>
     people of England and of the world—that of 
     <lb/>
     a people who do not consider the mere 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice of money as anything to be compared 
     <lb/>
     to the duty of defending themselves. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Sir, I think that when a delegation 
     <lb/>
     of our Government goes to England, those 
     <lb/>
     who compose it ought to be able to say what 
     <lb/>
     we are prepared to do for our defence. They 
     <lb/>
     ought to be able to say to the English 
     <lb/>
     Government that although we were a young 
     <lb/>
     and a comparatively poor country; though 
     <lb/>
     we have a rigorous climate and are shut out 
     <lb/>
     from the sea for a great portion of the year, 
     <lb/>
     yet we are a people that have shown more 
     <lb/>
     than once that our liberties could not be 
     <lb/>
     taken away from us by force of arms, and 
     <lb/>
     we are not prepared that they shall be taken 
     <lb/>
     in any other way, but that we are ready 
     <lb/>
     to take our just share in any scheme that 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country may adopt; but we are 
     <lb/>
     not prepared, and cannot be expected, to 
     <lb/>
     take the whole burden of defending this 
     <lb/>
     exposed portion of the British Empire upon 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="967" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0967.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">967</fw>
           
     ourselves. Look at our bonds in the English 
     <lb/>
     market. The British public are under the 
     <lb/>
     apprehension that we may at any moment 
     <lb/>
     be invaded by the United States, or that 
     <lb/>
     the views of the Manchester school may 
     <lb/>
     prevail, and our 5 per cents stand at 80. 
     <lb/>
     The position of the United States along 
     <lb/>
     our long exposed border is such that 
     <lb/>
     in their present excited and ready-armed 
     <lb/>
     condition we might be plunged into hostili<lb break="no"/>ties at any moment, and therefore our 
     <lb/>
     Government ought to say to the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government that it was absolutely necessary 
     <lb/>
     to make arrangements for defence on a large 
     <lb/>
     scale—that we are prepared to do that which 
     <lb/>
     we ought to do, but you cannot expect us to 
     <lb/>
     go to the whole of the expense which would be 
     <lb/>
     entailed by the depreciation of our bonds in 
     <lb/>
     the market. If we are to do so, or even to go 
     <lb/>
     to any large expense, you must guarantee 
     <lb/>
     our debentures. With the knowledge that 
     <lb/>
     you are our security, we need not care 
     <lb/>
     whether the United States is going to cross 
     <lb/>
     our border with hostile intent or not. If 
     <lb/>
     our neighbors know that any requisite 
     <lb/>
     amount will be given us either upon your 
     <lb/>
     loan or upon endorsement, so that our 
     <lb/>
     bonds will stand on the market at par, they 
     <lb/>
     will have reason to think twice before attack<lb break="no"/>ing us. When the English Government are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to back us in that way, then I say 
     <lb/>
     we ought to go forward and coöperate with 
     <lb/>
     them in carrying out an extended system of 
     <lb/>
     defensive works, bearing at least the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal portion of the burden. We do not care 
     <lb/>
     for their spending £50,000 ayear in drib<lb break="no"/>bling up a few fortifications at Quebec, while 
     <lb/>
     We put another small sum out in patching 
     <lb/>
     up earth works in the west, just to invite 
     <lb/>
     the Americans over when the works are half 
     <lb/>
     built, forming a trap for ourselves in which 
     <lb/>
     we may be more effectually caught. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure every member of this House, and every 
     <lb/>
     citizen of Canada must have been surprised 
     <lb/>
     at the position taken by English statesmen 
     <lb/>
     in reference to Canadian defences, and at 
     <lb/>
     their speaking of there being only a few days 
     <lb/>
     in the year in which men could work, in this 
     <lb/>
     climate, in building fortifications. I read the 
     <lb/>
     other day, that it had been stated in England 
     <lb/>
     that there was only a month of the year that 
     <lb/>
     men could work out of doors to advantage. 
     <lb/>
     Although it is true that for about half the 
     <lb/>
     year our communication with the sea is cut 
     <lb/>
     off by the formation of ice, yet men can 
     <lb/>
     work out of doors in Western Canada all the 
     <lb/>
    year round, and during the other half in 
     <lb/>Eastern Canada, and with the exception of 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     a few very stormy days, at one or another 
     <lb/>
     branch of the work required in erecting 
     <lb/>
     fortifications. But so far as guarding 
     <lb/>
     against attack from the United States is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, the great thing is to let them know 
     <lb/>
     that, whether we spend the money im<lb break="no"/>mediately—this summer—or not, we have it 
     <lb/>
     to spend. It should be known that both 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Parliament and the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Parliament have voted the money, 
     <lb/>
     and that it would be put into the 
     <lb/>
     most approved fortifications as rapidly as it 
     <lb/>
     could be. The people of the South soon 
     <lb/>
     built fortifications, behind which to fight for 
     <lb/>
     their liberties, and we too should be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to fight for our liberties. It is to the money 
     <lb/>
     they spent in fortifications that they owe 
     <lb/>
     their existence as a formidable power at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. The idea should not go 
     <lb/>
     abroad that we are about to spend a little 
     <lb/>
     matter of fifty or a hundred thousand pounds 
     <lb/>
     in doing a little plastering here and a little 
     <lb/>
     mason work there, but we should proceed 
     <lb/>
     as rapidly as possible to show that we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to expend in effective works all 
     <lb/>
     the money that may be necessary to put 
     <lb/>
     ourselves in a condition to resist invasion, 
     <lb/>
     even with a handful of troops, until 
     <lb/>
     more can be sent us. As we are at pre<lb break="no"/>sent, the Government of the United 
     <lb/>
     States feel that we are at their mercy, and 
     <lb/>
     that they can deal with us as they please. 
     <lb/>
     To-day they impose an obnoxious passport 
     <lb/>
     system upon us, and to-morrow they relieve 
     <lb/>
     us from that source of annoyance. To-day 
     <lb/>
     they threaten us with a repeal of the Reci<lb break="no"/>procity treaty, and to-morrow will, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     be prepared, if we are good children, to 
     <lb/>
     continue its operation. To-day the bonding 
     <lb/>
     system is to be repealed ; to-morrow we hear 
     <lb/>
     no more of it. Next we hear of their inten<lb break="no"/>tion of placing a force of gunboats on the lakes, 
     <lb/>
     and then we hear that the intention has been 
     <lb/>
     abandoned. What are all these fair pro<lb break="no"/>mises they indulge in, and good feelings they 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to call up, but blinds of their real 
     <lb/>
     purpose ? Does anybody believe that it is 
     <lb/>
     not in their hearts to do all those things 
     <lb/>
     with which they threaten us, and is it not 
     <lb/>
     our duty to be prepared to meet the conse<lb break="no"/>quences of their threats being carried into 
     <lb/>
     execution ? They now see that we are being 
     <lb/>
     aroused in this country, and they begin to 
     <lb/>
     treat us more mildly, until they come to 
     <lb/>
     some settlement with the South. They be<lb break="no"/>gin to see that they have acted aggressively 
     <lb/>
     against this paw of the British lion a little 
     <lb/>
     too soon—that the British lion is in danger 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="968" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0968.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">968</fw>
           
     of being waked up. (Hear, hear.) And, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, I think it would be a good 
     <lb/>
     thing if we were a little more aroused 
     <lb/>
     in this country by the events that are trans<lb break="no"/>piring about us, and that the people of 
     <lb/>England should become a little more in 
     <lb/>earnest, so that the people of the United 
     <lb/>States should not fall into the habit of 
     <lb/>regarding the British lion, as the Paris 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Charivari</hi> called it, as a stuffed lion. I 
     <lb/>sometimes wish the British lion would roar 
     <lb/>—(laughter)—as it has roared in times past, 
     <lb/>and as it roared when it made the Emperor 
     <lb/>of all the Russias tremble in his shoes. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear) I am afraid our neighbors 
     <lb/>are getting into the very false notion that it 
     <lb/>is only the skin of the animal that we have 
     <lb/>now—(laughter)—and that if the voice 
     <lb/>were heard, it would not be a roar, but a bray. 
     <lb/>But they must not trust too much to 
     <lb/>this idea, or they will be rudely awakened 
     <lb/>some day by finding the bones, and the blood, 
     <lb/>and the muscle of the mighty old animal of 
     <lb/>yore. I feel, sir, that we cannot do our duty 
     <lb/>to the Imperial authorities, nor they to us, 
     <lb/>unless we become united into one Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, instead of remaining in the scattered 
     <lb/>position in which we now stand. What 
     <lb/>would be our position if we were thus 
     <lb/>united? The opponents of Confederation say 
     <lb/>we should only get a more extended frontier 
     <lb/>to defend, and have no more men to defend 
     <lb/>it with; that the frontier we should acquire 
     <lb/>would be more difficult to defend with the 
     <lb/>addition of men we would acquire, than our 
     <lb/>present frontier would be to defend with our 
     <lb/>own force ; that Canada might be called upon 
     <lb/>to send troops to the Lower Provinces, thus 
     <lb/>leaving our own frontier exposed, or they 
     <lb/>would have to send their militia force up 
     <lb/>here, leaving their borders open to attack. 
     <lb/>But, in reply to that reasoning, I would say 
     <lb/>that it is not likely we should be attacked at 
     <lb/>all points at once. We might be compelled to 
     <lb/>withdraw entirely from one portion of the 
     <lb/>territory in order to defend more important 
     <lb/>portions, or to obtain more defensible posi<lb break="no"/>tions; but no man can hesitate to agree that 
     <lb/>it is infinitely better, for all purposes of 
     <lb/>defensive action, that the whole militia force 
     <lb/>of the country should be under the control 
     <lb/>of one executive head, who could grasp the 
     <lb/>whole force in one hand, than that they 
     <lb/>should be scattered over a wide domain of 
     <lb/>exposed territory, under the command of 
     <lb/>different executives, all of whom would have 
     <lb/>to be communicated with before any concen<lb break="no"/>tration could take place. The true position 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>

     in which we should stand before the world 
     <lb/>
     is, that the whole militia force should be 
     <lb/>
     understood to be under the control of one 
     <lb/>
     Central Government; for in that way, common 
     <lb/>
     sense ought to tell everybody, they would be 
     <lb/>
     of far more value in defense than they could 
     <lb/>
     possibly be if divided, and the moral effect 
     <lb/>
     produced upon a foreign power contemplat<lb break="no"/>ing attack would be very greatly enhanced, 
     <lb/>
     were it understood we were one united 
     <lb/>
     people, instead of being a divided commu<lb break="no"/>nity. Our entire population would be four 
     <lb/>
     millions of people, which, at the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     rate of computation, would give us an avail<lb break="no"/>able militia force of five hundred thousand 
     <lb/>
     men. If we believe that our people are 
     <lb/>
     really and truly a loyal people, warmly 
     <lb/>
     attached to the Constitution of the good old 
     <lb/>
     land, because believing that the engrafting 
     <lb/>
     of the institutions of that country upon the 
     <lb/>
     soil of this continent offers the best and 
     <lb/>
     greatest security for every man who desires 
     <lb/>
     to enjoy the blessings of a free country and 
     <lb/>
     free institutions, then we would, if united, 
     <lb/>
     have not only this sentiment of attachment 
     <lb/>
     to the English Throne, but we would have 
     <lb/>
     the machinery, which this great Constitution 
     <lb/>
     provides, in our hands by which we could 
     <lb/>
     carry out and defend our liberties and our 
     <lb/>
     people in the enjoyment of their free consti<lb break="no"/>tutional government. (Hear, hear.) Our 
     <lb/>
     opponents say we are hardly ripe, hardly of 
     <lb/>
     age fit to enter upon a new nationality. 
     <lb/>
     Why, sir, there are none of the lesser powers 
     <lb/>
     of Europe, except Belgium and Bavaria, 
     <lb/>
     that have a population of four millions. If 
     <lb/>
     we cannot establish a nation when we have 
     <lb/>
     four millions of people, what shall we say of 
     <lb/>
     Greece with its population of only one mil<lb break="no"/>lion? If we are ever to form ourselves into 
     <lb/>
     a nationality—and few will deny that it is our 
     <lb/>
     destiny to be united at some time—what bet<lb break="no"/>ter time will ever be likely to present itself 
     <lb/>
     for handing down to posterity the boon 
     <lb/>
     of a united and free nation—the greatest 
     <lb/>
     boon that a government and people can 
     <lb/>
     transmit—than the opportunity which the 
     <lb/>
     present favorable state of affairs presents to 
     <lb/>
     us? It is offered to us freely and openly in 
     <lb/>
     the face of the world, and we hope to con<lb break="no"/>vince the world hereafter that of the three 
     <lb/>
     systems of government now in existence on 
     <lb/>
     this continent, ours is the best. We have 
     <lb/>
     the despotic throne of the MONTEZUMAS 
     <lb/>
     filled by a foreign prince, and propped up 
     <lb/>
     by foreign bayonets ; we have the republican 
     <lb/>
     government of the United States, based on 
     <lb/>
     the principle that all men are free and equal 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="969" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0969.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">969</fw>
       
     and that the will of the majority must 
     <lb/>
     govern and be right; and we have the 
     <lb/>
     responsible government provided by the 
     <lb/>
     British Constitution, under which the 
     <lb/>
     English nation has existed so long, and 
     <lb/>
     beneath the protection of which her colonies 
     <lb/>
     have spread out, until upon their wide 
     <lb/>
     expanse the sun never goes down. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     This latter form of government we believe 
     <lb/>
     to be the best we can adopt for present pur<lb break="no"/>poses, and for the purpose of transmission 
     <lb/>
     to our descendants upon this continent. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, if we have institutions, popula<lb break="no"/>tion, wealth and territory of such extent 
     <lb/>
     and of such immense value to protect, and 
     <lb/>
     have the opportunity of uniting for their 
     <lb/>
     protection so freely given us, then is 
     <lb/>
     the end sought to be accomplished by the 
     <lb/>
     change that cannot but commend itself 
     <lb/>
     most clearly and distinctly to the mind of 
     <lb/>
     every one who desires to see a united and 
     <lb/>
     happy people inhabiting the territory of 
     <lb/>
     British North America, and stretching from 
     <lb/>
     ocean to ocean, under the protecting ægis of 
     <lb/>
     the British Constitution, the British form of 
     <lb/>
     government, and the British Crown. We have, 
     <lb/>
     in my own humble opinion, but two future 
     <lb/>
     states of existence to choose for ourselves. 
     <lb/>
     We have, on the one side, the opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     make ourselves a nation, able and willing to 
     <lb/>
     protect ourselves, with the aid of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, and to grow wealthy and prosperous 
     <lb/>
     under that form of existence. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, we have the certain prospect of 
     <lb/>
     absorption, at no distant period, into the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States. There is no alternative. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, ironically.) We must either adopt 
     <lb/>
     the one or make up our minds to submit 
     <lb/>
     to the other. I have no doubt but that 
     <lb/>
     an immense number of the people would 
     <lb/>
     not be willing to remain and submit to 
     <lb/>
     the latter alternative, but like the old 
     <lb/>
     U. E. loyalists, would even abandon all 
     <lb/>
     they possessed rather than cease to have 
     <lb/>
     the protection of the British flag, and bear 
     <lb/>
     the name of British men—men in whom 
     <lb/>
     loyalty is not a mere lip sentiment, but in 
     <lb/>
     whom it forms as much a constituent 
     <lb/>
     element of the blood as the principle of 
     <lb/>
     vitality itself. (Hear, hear.) I am satisfied, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that there is no other alternative—no 
     <lb/>
     choice for us between the endeavor on our 
     <lb/>
     part to concentrate British power and British 
     <lb/>
     feeling on this continent, and falling into 
     <lb/>
     the open arms of the republican govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the United States. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And, Mr. SPEAKER, when we examine the 
     <lb/>
     extent of the domain open to us, when 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     we reflect that we would rest with one foot 
     <lb/>
     upon the broad Atlantic and the other upon 
     <lb/>
     the Pacific, and remember the vast, fertile 
     <lb/>
     and salubrious territory that lies between us 
     <lb/>
     and the Rocky Mountains—those rich 
     <lb/>
     valleys of the Saskatchewan and the Assini<lb break="no"/>boine, the fertility of which are said to be 
     <lb/>
     far superior, and are certainly equal to any 
     <lb/>
     portion of this country —when we think of 
     <lb/>
     them and of the vast number of people 
     <lb/>
     that could be poured into them from 
     <lb/>
     the old world to develope their resources 
     <lb/>
     and bring their treasures down the lakes 
     <lb/>
     to our marts—I say when we see all 
     <lb/>
     these things, we see a future arising for us 
     <lb/>
     which is to me, and ought to be to others, 
     <lb/>
     so bright that no man should hesitate to 
     <lb/>
     accept that rather than the only other alter<lb break="no"/>native—drifting in small provinces into the 
     <lb/>
     United States, where we cannot but be 
     <lb/>
     borne down by their burden of taxation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But some people say we will 
     <lb/>
     escape taxation by going over to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans; that they would take us in to-morrow, 
     <lb/>
     and agree to put no taxation upon us for 
     <lb/>
     their war debt; but is not that idea chimer<lb break="no"/>ical, when they entertain no doubt that 
     <lb/>
     they can overrun and conquer us at any 
     <lb/>
     time, and force us to share in their debt, 
     <lb/>
     as well as discharge our own? With re<lb break="no"/>gard to our prospects in the way of settle<lb break="no"/>ment and the extending of our population   
     <lb/>
     and wealth, look at what we could do 
     <lb/>
     towards attracting emigrants from the old 
     <lb/>
     country to our lands. But here I must 
     <lb/>
     refer to one feature of the scheme that has 
     <lb/>
     been adopted by this House that I hope to 
     <lb/>
     see changed. I believe it is a fatal error to 
     <lb/>
     place the wild lands in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     local governments, who may thereby enter 
     <lb/>
     into regulations for immigration that will 
     <lb/>
     be antagonistic, and that will tend to retard 
     <lb/>
     rather than promote the settlement of this 
     <lb/>
     country. All those lands ought to have 
     <lb/>
     been placed in the hands of the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, in order that one comprehen<lb break="no"/>sive system of immigration might be adopted. 
     <lb/>
     When we look at Upper Canada, and ascer<lb break="no"/>tain that of her eighty millions of acres 
     <lb/>
     there are only thirteen and a half millions 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of proprietors—an average of 
     <lb/>
     nine acres to each inhabitant—when we see 
     <lb/>
     the vast quantity of land in this country avail<lb break="no"/>able for cultivation, not yet turned to account, 
     <lb/>
     we cannot help coming to the conclusion that 
     <lb/>
     we have a vast field for immigration to fill 
     <lb/>
     up, and which ought to have been placed 
     <lb/>
    under control of the General Government— 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="970" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0970.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">970</fw>
            
     not left to be speculated upon by the local 
     <lb/>
     governments. Now, sir, when one sees all 
     <lb/>
     that, and feels and knows that the great 
     <lb/>
     change which will be brought about by this 
     <lb/>
     union will give us so many things that are 
     <lb/>
     desirable, I say the magnitude of the 
     <lb/>
     interests that are involved ought to recom<lb break="no"/>mend to us, in the strongest manner, a 
     <lb/>
     change of the character of which I have 
     <lb/>
     been speaking—a change that would tend to 
     <lb/>
     place this country on such a footing that 
     <lb/>
     none can fail to see that we would even<lb break="no"/>tually become the members of a great 
     <lb/>
     community, and that in a much shorter space 
     <lb/>
     of time than many people imagine. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Allow me for a moment, sir, to 
     <lb/>
     allude to the history of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     to see the position in which that country 
     <lb/>
     once stood. In 1792, the United States, 
     <lb/>
     with a population, at that time, of nine 
     <lb/>
     millions of people, had a revenue of a 
     <lb/>
     little over four and a-half millions of dollars, 
     <lb/>
     while in Canada, in 1863, with a population 
     <lb/>
     of two and a-half millions, we had a revenue 
     <lb/>
     of fourteen millions of dollars. In 1821, 
     <lb/>
     when their population had greatly increased, 
     <lb/>
     the whole of their exports and imports 
     <lb/>
     amounted to ninety-eight millions of dollars, 
     <lb/>
     while ours, in 1863, with a population of 
     <lb/>
     only two and a-half millions, was no less 
     <lb/>
     than eighty-nine millions of dollars; that is, 
     <lb/>
     within nine millions of the entire imports 
     <lb/>
     and exports of the United States in 1821. 
     <lb/>
     It is true that since that time all those facili<lb break="no"/>ties which have made the United States a 
     <lb/>
     great power on this continent—the con<lb break="no"/>struction of railways and telegraphs, the 
     <lb/>
     application of steam power to all kinds of 
     <lb/>
     machinery, and other inventions of the 
     <lb/>
    past two or three decades—have sprung 
     <lb/>into existence, and they have reached for<lb break="no"/>ward to greatness with railroad speed. But, 
     <lb/>still, it is nothing against the argument to 
     <lb/>say that as we have, within the memory of 
     <lb/>man, risen so rapidly not only in popula<lb break="no"/>tion, but in everything that tends to place 
     <lb/>Canada on a footing that ought to be satis<lb break="no"/>factory to every well-wisher of his country, 
     <lb/>there is any reason to imagine, for one mo<lb break="no"/>ment, that all the changes have been made 
     <lb/>that will be made, and that with the enter<lb break="no"/>prise and exertions of a common and enlight<lb break="no"/>ened people, we will not be in a position to 
     <lb/>continue the prosperity that has sprung up 
     <lb/>within so short a time, and which has 
     <lb/>increased until within the last three or four 
     <lb/>years, when, from natural causes and the 
     <lb/>war in the United States, it received so 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
           
     serious a check. We shall find ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, so soon on the highroad to 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, by means of the union now con<lb break="no"/>templated, that we shall not care to envy 
     <lb/>
     the progress of any nation whatever. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Now, sir, when I have stated my 
     <lb/>
     reasons for believing that there is a neces<lb break="no"/>sity for such a change, and having en<lb break="no"/>deavored to show the nature of the change 
     <lb/>
     .proposed, I shall now proceed to show why 
     <lb/>
     the resolution which I hold in my hand, and 
     <lb/>
     which I offer for the adoption of this House, 
     <lb/>
     is one that ought to be accepted. I have 
     <lb/>
     said, sir, that I, as an individual member of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature of Canada, had not hesitated 
     <lb/>
     to take upon myself the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     voting in favor of the resolutions respecting 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, although they had not been 
     <lb/>
     accepted by the people of this country in 
     <lb/>
     any constitutional manner. I said that I 
     <lb/>
     did so upon the same principle as I would 
     <lb/>
     have done if I had been voting upon them 
     <lb/>
     outside of the House instead of inside. I 
     <lb/>
     would have voted for them as an elector, be<lb break="no"/>cause I believe they form a just basis for the 
     <lb/>
     contemplated union; and, sir, I desire to offer 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same opportunity to every elector 
     <lb/>
     to pursue the same course that I would pursue, 
     <lb/>
     and I make the same claim on their behalf 
     <lb/>
     that I would make to this House on my own. 
     <lb/>
     I think that they are entitled to have this 
     <lb/>
     matter submitted for their consideration be<lb break="no"/>fore the resolutions that have passed this 
     <lb/>
     House are finally acted upon by the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, it has 
     <lb/>
     been said that the effect will be to postpone 
     <lb/>
     the accomplishment of the union for an in<lb break="no"/>definite period, whereas the pressure of cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances are such that no time should be 
     <lb/>
     lost in placing ourselves in such a position 
     <lb/>
     of defence that we should be able to meet 
     <lb/>
     and hold back any force that might be sent 
     <lb/>
     against us. Well, sir, there is nothing in 
     <lb/>
     the resolution I have proposed that would, 
     <lb/>
     in my judgment, interfere with the imme<lb break="no"/>diate carrying out of the project. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment have told us that they propose to 
     <lb/>
    prorogue Parliament in a few days, and they 
     <lb/>have also told us that we are to be called to<lb break="no"/>gether again in the summer. What is to 
     <lb/>prevent us from considering the subject at 
     <lb/>the summer session? It is to be presumed 
     <lb/>that the Imperial Government will endeavor 
     <lb/>to come to some conclusion upon the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions which have been framed by the Con<lb break="no"/>ference, and which have been laid on the 
     <lb/>tables of both Houses of the English Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and I see nothing to prevent the Im<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="971" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0971.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">971</fw>
          
     perial Government from declaring their 
     <lb/>
     views upon the subject. I think there 
     <lb/>
     would be nothing whatever to prevent our 
     <lb/>
     Government from going to England, and 
     <lb/>
     offering these resolutions for the consider<lb break="no"/>ation of the Imperial Legislature, allowing 
     <lb/>
     that Legislature to act upon them as they 
     <lb/>
     might think proper ; but, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time declaring that the law to be passed 
     <lb/>
     ought not to come in force in the different 
     <lb/>
     colonies until it had been accepted by the 
     <lb/>
     legislatures of those colonies. There would 
     <lb/>
     be no time lost. It would be as easy for this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to be dissolved and to meet 
     <lb/>
     together again in time to take up the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the measure, which Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain had in the meantime passed, as it 
     <lb/>
     would be to meet again in the summer, and 
     <lb/>
     go through the same process. Why is 
     <lb/>
     Canada to be treated upon an entirely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent rule from that which has been adopted 
     <lb/>
     in the other provinces ? The Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick was dissolved in order that 
     <lb/>
     the people might be appealed to on this 
     <lb/>
     question. The Hon. Attorney General of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has declared that it is the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the Government of that colony to 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people upon it, and that nothing 
     <lb/>
     will be done until their opinion is obtained. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In Nova Scotia, too, the Gov 
     <lb/>
     ernment do not, as I understand, make it a 
     <lb/>
     government question. It is not to be put 
     <lb/>
     in that position, and if a difficulty arises in 
     <lb/>
     having it adopted by the Legislature, the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Nova Scotia are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     dissolve their Legislature too. I do not say 
     <lb/>
     anything about Prince Edward Island—its 
     <lb/>
     acceptance or rejection of the scheme would 
     <lb/>
     be of very small account. But their Legis<lb break="no"/>lature will, no doubt, also be dissolved, in 
     <lb/>
     order that the people may have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of expressing their opinions upon it, 
     <lb/>
     if their House of Assembly is found hostile, 
     <lb/>
     —a step which, no doubt, our Government 
     <lb/>
     would have taken if this House had shown 
     <lb/>
     itself hostile to the measure. Because this 
     <lb/>
     House is not hostile, and because Ministers 
     <lb/>
     found themselves strong enough to carry it 
     <lb/>
     by a large majority, they declared they 
     <lb/>
     would take the course they have adopted, 
     <lb/>
     although in the other provinces the case has 
     <lb/>
     been put on an entirely different footing. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, let us consider why 
     <lb/>
     we should he placed in the same position in 
     <lb/>
     which the legislatures and people of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces are placed. We hear it 
     <lb/>
     stated on all sides of this House that the 
     <lb/>
     whole country is in favor of this measure. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     If so, why should there be any hesitation 
     <lb/>
     about asking the country to confirm by an 
     <lb/>
     election that which is so clearly advantageous 
     <lb/>
     and which is so sure to be carried ? But, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I hear it said, inside of this House and 
     <lb/>
     outside of this House, that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada are opposed to this measure. 
     <lb/>
     If that be so then—if they are so strong<lb break="no"/>ly opposed to it as has been represented 
     <lb/>
     —is it a wise step for us to force it upon 
     <lb/>
     them against their will ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We are arranging to adopt an entirely 
     <lb/>
     new state of governmental existence, and 
     <lb/>
     are proposing to embrace a large area 
     <lb/>
     of country under this new form of 
     <lb/>
     government. We are claiming for it, and 
     <lb/>
     desire that it shall have its best and safest 
     <lb/>
     foundation in the hearts of the people. And, 
     <lb/>
     sir, will you not find it stronger in the 
     <lb/>
     hearts and more deeply rooted in the esti<lb break="no"/>mation of the people, if you appeal to them 
     <lb/>
     and obtain their sanction to it and their 
     <lb/>
     support in carrying it out ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     In proposing that it shall have the sanction 
     <lb/>
     of the people, I do not contemplate the 
     <lb/>
     absurdity, unknown to our form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, of asking them for a direct yea or nay 
     <lb/>
     upon it. No such thing as that has ever 
     <lb/>
     been entertained in my mind.  I propose to 
     <lb/>
     have it done in a constitutional manner. 
     <lb/>
     My whole political history would have shown 
     <lb/>
     any man acquainted with it, that there could 
     <lb/>
     have been no such democratic idea harbored 
     <lb/>
     by me as to go without the walls of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution in order to do an act which 
     <lb/>
     could be better done within it. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     any one who had for a moment the belief, 
     <lb/>
     that while I was endeavoring to build up, I 
     <lb/>
     was at the same time putting forth what 
     <lb/>
     may be called a sacrilegious hand to pull 
     <lb/>
     down, was very much mistaken as to the 
     <lb/>
     course I was to pursue—the only proper 
     <lb/>
     and safe course that could be pursued. If 
     <lb/>
     you wish to erect this monument of a new 
     <lb/>
     nationality on the true feelings and hearts 
     <lb/>
     of the people, you must erect it upon an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to them. You should not be afraid of 
     <lb/>
     it. You may say that difficulties will arise 
     <lb/>
     —that other questions will be raised—that 
     <lb/>
     the elections will not always turn on the 
     <lb/>
     direct issue—for Confederation or against 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. But I tell you that it will, 
     <lb/>
     if the people are so much in favor of this 
     <lb/>
     project as you say. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     merits or demerits of the candidates will 
     <lb/>
     be passed to one side, and the vote will 
     <lb/>
     be taken on the true merits of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion—otherwise the people are not worthy of 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="972" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0972.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">972</fw>
           
     having that appeal made to them. An appeal 
     <lb/>
     has been made to history, and it has said 
     <lb/>
     that appeals to the people on questions of 
     <lb/>
     this kind are unknown under the British 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. The cases of the union between 
     <lb/>
     England and Scotland, of the union between 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain and Ireland, and of the union 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadas themselves, have been re<lb break="no"/>ferred to; and it has been asked if in any 
     <lb/>
     of those cases an appeal was made to the 
     <lb/>
     people, and an answer given in the negative. 
     <lb/>
     I am not prepared to accept that answer as 
     <lb/>
     altogether correct in point of fact. In the 
     <lb/>
     first of those cases, where the resistance was 
     <lb/>
     perhaps the greatest, an appeal was made to 
     <lb/>
     the people. It was not until long after the 
     <lb/>
     matter was first mooted that the union 
     <lb/>
     between England and Scotland was brought 
     <lb/>
     about. It was questioned at that time—just 
     <lb/>
     as afterwards, in 1799, with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     union of Ireland—whether the Scottish Par<lb break="no"/>liament had power to deliver up the fran<lb break="no"/>chise of the people into the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     English Parliament. With reference to the 
     <lb/>
     union of Scotland with England, the matter 
     <lb/>
     was brought before the people—not in one, 
     <lb/>
     or in two, but in many ways. There were 
     <lb/>
     commissioners appointed, and conventions, 
     <lb/>
     and various attempts to bring about that 
     <lb/>
     union before it was finally consummated. 
     <lb/>
     It was attempted in JAMES the First's time, 
     <lb/>
     in CHARLES the First's time, in CROMWELL'S 
     <lb/>
     time, and again in the reign of King WIL<lb break="no"/>LIAM, and finally carried out in the reign of 
     <lb/>
     Queen ANNE. The proclamation summon<lb break="no"/>ing the Scottish Parliament of 1702 declared 
     <lb/>
     that among other things, it was to treat of 
     <lb/>
     the union of Scotland with England. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We have still extant in the books 
     <lb/>
     the very words of that proclamation, which 
     <lb/>
     declared that that Parliament was sum<lb break="no"/>moned in Scotland for the very purpose of 
     <lb/>
     treating of this question. That Parliament 
     <lb/>
     did not finally decide upon the matter, but 
     <lb/>
     the following Parliament did, and the union 
     <lb/>
     was consummated. And that Parliament 
     <lb/>
     was in exactly the position of that of 1702, 
     <lb/>
     having been called together by precisely the 
     <lb/>
     same kind of proclamation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     That matter of the union between England 
     <lb/>
     and Scotland was, I believe, the only subject 
     <lb/>
     that was discussed. And, although subse<lb break="no"/>quently the greatest hostility was aroused, 
     <lb/>
     and troops had to be sent from the north of 
     <lb/>
     Scotland, it was not until after that Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment had been for some time assembled that 
     <lb/>
     petitions came in from any of the burghs 
     <lb/>
     against it. (Hear, hear.) We have been 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     told in this debate that there is now the 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction of content all over the province 
     <lb/>
     in reference to this measure. Allow me to 
     <lb/>
     tell you that in many localities, it is the 
     <lb/>
     deadness of apathy and not the satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     of content. This has arisen, not because 
     <lb/>
     the people do not feel an interest in the 
     <lb/>
     question, but because there has been a 
     <lb/>
     pressure upon them from many causes, and 
     <lb/>
     that they have had to contend with a great 
     <lb/>
     number of difficulties of one kind or another, 
     <lb/>
     resulting in an unexampled want of pros<lb break="no"/>perity. (Hear, hear.) They are, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     looking out apparently for anything—they 
     <lb/>
     are not particular what—which they believe 
     <lb/>
     would tend to relieve them from the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties of their present position. I say this, 
     <lb/>
     although I should be glad that it was not 
     <lb/>
     apathy, or deadness, or death, but content<lb break="no"/>ment, throughout the length and breadth of 
     <lb/>
     the land, which was leading to the general 
     <lb/>
     acceptance of this measure. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     in the western part of the country—I cannot 
     <lb/>
     speak for the eastern part, unless in so far 
     <lb/>
     as it is shewn by the petitions which have 
     <lb/>
     been sent in, and the opinions which have 
     <lb/>
     been expressed in this House by honorable 
     <lb/>
     members from Lower Canada—but in the 
     <lb/>
     western portion of the country, I am satisfied, 
     <lb/>
     from my own personal knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
     feeling existing there, that a large majority, 
     <lb/>
     equal to if not greater than that which 
     <lb/>
     voted the other night on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House, would be returned at another election 
     <lb/>
     in favor of this measure (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And it is because I believe that, and would 
     <lb/>
    not leave it for any one to say that the 
     <lb/>people had not had an opportunity of ex<lb break="no"/>pressing themselves, through an election, on 
     <lb/>a matter of such vital importance—that I 
     <lb/>claim that it should be submitted to them, 
     <lb/>in order that they shall declare by their votes 
     <lb/>whether they are in favor of this measure or 
     <lb/>not. (Hear, hear.) In speaking of the 
     <lb/>union of Scotland, of the union of Ire<lb break="no"/>land, and the union of the Canadas, we must 
     <lb/>recollect that the same circumstances to a 
     <lb/>great extent existed. In the case of the 
     <lb/>Scottish union, there were those desolating 
     <lb/>wars between England and Scotland in 
     <lb/>which the best blood of both lands had 
     <lb/>been shed, and there had long existed a 
     <lb/>perpetual feud and hostility which had left 
     <lb/>the border country—now a smiling and fer<lb break="no"/>tile territory—a barren and desolate waste. 
     <lb/>Then again, when the union of Ireland 
     <lb/>with Great Britain took place, there 
     <lb/>was a rebellion just quenched—there were 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="973" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0973.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">973</fw>
           
     40,000 troops in the country—there were one 
     <lb/>
     hundred and sixteen placemen in the House 
     <lb/>
     —and there may have been good reasons for 
     <lb/>
     the fact that a majority of some six or seven 
     <lb/>
     in the Irish Parliament against the union 
     <lb/>
     had dwindled down and disappeared next 
     <lb/>
     session, being swallowed up in a majority 
     <lb/>
     of thirty-five. In this country the same 
     <lb/>
     thing had occurred. The union was con<lb break="no"/>summated when the members of the rebellion 
     <lb/>
     of 1837-38 were still supposed to be slum<lb break="no"/>bering in various parts of the land—and 
     <lb/>
     there were, therefore, strong reasons why, 
     <lb/>
     in the midst of disquiet and disturbance— 
     <lb/>
     when there might be a difficulty about 
     <lb/>
     elections being conducted with purity and 
     <lb/>
     freedom from Executive control—such a 
     <lb/>
     question should not be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
    people. But now we have no such cause. 
     <lb/>We are told that the people are happy, 
     <lb/>contented and prosperous, though desirous 
     <lb/>of some change—and there is, therefore, no 
     <lb/>exciting cause to prevent a free and full 
     <lb/>expression of the mind of the people by a 
     <lb/>general election—nothing to prevent the 
     <lb/>whole matter being placed on a proper foot<lb break="no"/>ing before the people, and men being chosen 
     <lb/>with reference to their views on the subject 
     <lb/>of Confederation, and that alone. You have 
     <lb/>nothing to prevent this new system being 
     <lb/>inaugurated on the true and proper basis on 
     <lb/>which it ought to be inaugurated, namely, 
     <lb/>on the popular will, and receiving therefore, 
     <lb/>from the outset, that strength which the 
     <lb/>popular will alone could give to it, in its 
     <lb/>endorsement by those who have a right to 
     <lb/>send representatives to this House. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) It has been said that a motion of 
     <lb/>this kind takes away, in point of fact, from 
     <lb/>the Legislature, the power which the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature has, by denying the right of the 
     <lb/>Legislature to make any such change. I do 
     <lb/>not say anything against the power of the 
     <lb/>Legislature. The Legislature has, within the 
     <lb/>limits that are assigned to it, all the rights 
     <lb/>which its charter gives it. But I cannot 
     <lb/>help feeling that when we are dealing with 
     <lb/>this question, we are dealing with it very 
     <lb/>differently from the manner in which it was 
     <lb/>dealt with, either by the independent Par<lb break="no"/>liament of Scotland, or by the independent 
     <lb/>Parliament of Ireland. We are acting 
     <lb/>under a limited charter and constitution — 
     <lb/>having no right ourselves to deal with this 
     <lb/>matter finally by any act of our own—having 
     <lb/>only the right to deal with it by these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, and not to enact it with the autho<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
            
     rity of law. (Hear, hear.) We, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     stand limited in our powers at the outset— 
     <lb/>
     so limited that it has been decided in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, that the privileges which belong to 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons and the House of Lords 
     <lb/>
     in England do not belong entirely to our legis<lb break="no"/>lative bodies—that these have grown with 
     <lb/>
     time, until they have become incorporated 
     <lb/>
     with the very existence of the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment—while we hold our privileges in a very  
     <lb/>
     different way, not having the same compre<lb break="no"/>hensive grasp of them, as in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons. It is clear that we have 
     <lb/>
     not the same power as the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment—otherwise we should not be obliged to 
     <lb/>
     go to that body for its sanction of these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. And there are limitations of 
     <lb/>
     the power of the Imperial Parliament itself, 
     <lb/>
     to which we also are subject. We cannot 
     <lb/>
     make any act of ours permanent, any more 
     <lb/>
     than we can make ourselves permanent,  
     <lb/>
     because another Parliament has the right to 
     <lb/>
     repeal what we have done. We cannot of  
     <lb/>
     ourselves enact this measure into a law. 
     <lb/>
     We can offer these resolutions—we have the 
     <lb/>
     power to do that—and the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Parliament have, no doubt, the 
     <lb/>
     power to act upon them as they choose. 
     <lb/>
     But the question is—is it wise to give these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions the force of law; is it proper to 
     <lb/>
     do so; is it the most just course to take 
     <lb/>
     towards the people of this country, to 
     <lb/>
     declare that in a matter of this importance 
     <lb/>
     we will legislate for them, to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     introducing an entire change of the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution—of providing that the Upper Chamber, 
     <lb/>
     which they have declared to be elective, shall 
     <lb/>
     cease to be elective, and shall be nominated 
     <lb/>
     by the Crown, without consulting them? 
     <lb/>
     I do not mean to say, with regard to that 
     <lb/>
     change, that it is not a beneficial change. I 
     <lb/>
     was one of the few who stood on the floor 
     <lb/>
     of this Legislature battling against the 
     <lb/>
     change from nomination by the Crown to 
     <lb/>
     election by the people in the Upper House. 
     <lb/>
     I was one of those also who contended for 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, the effect of which would be to 
     <lb/>
     place the power of the people in the Lower 
     <lb/>
     House, by representation according to num<lb break="no"/>bers in that body, with equal representation 
     <lb/>
     for the two sections of the province in the 
     <lb/>
     Upper House. And I recollect that some 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen now on the Treasury benches 
     <lb/>
     —the Hon. President of the Council among 
     <lb/>
     others, through the columns of the influen<lb break="no"/>tial paper he controls—declared that the idea 
     <lb/>
     embodied in those resolutions was absurd, and 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="974" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0974.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">974</fw>
            
     could not be acted upon, although the very 
     <lb/>
     idea which the Government have now incor<lb break="no"/>porated in this scheme, from a different point 
     <lb/>
     of view. (Hear, hear.) And the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council voted, as I did, 
     <lb/>
     against the introduction of the elective prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, and in favor of the retention of the 
     <lb/>
     nominative principle—not, however, for the 
     <lb/>
     reasons I did, but for different reasons alto<lb break="no"/>gether, as he explained at the time. But 
     <lb/>
     the view he entertains now, in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     nominated Legislative Council, was the view 
     <lb/>
     he entertained then, and the change is one 
     <lb/>
     which I will be glad to see brought about. 
     <lb/>
     But it is a change of which the people at the 
     <lb/>
     last election had no idea. And the alteration 
     <lb/>
     in the minds of public men has been so great, 
     <lb/>
     within a short space of time, that I say we 
     <lb/>
     have a right to think and pause and reflect. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Look at the programme 
     <lb/>
     which was brought down on this subject by 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional committee moved for by 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. President of the Council. The 
     <lb/>
     part of the report of that committee which 
     <lb/>
     was most opposed was the Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     British North America. And it is well 
     <lb/>
     known that what the Government offered, 
     <lb/>
     at the time of its formation, was that the 
     <lb/>
     lesser scheme of a Federation of the Canadas 
     <lb/>
     should go first, and the larger scheme of a 
     <lb/>
     Federation of all the colonies afterwards. 
     <lb/>
     They were first of all to try to have a Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government for Canada alone, and then to 
     <lb/>
     extend that, as circumstances permitted, to 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Colonies. Well, in the short space of little 
     <lb/>
     over three months, men's minds were so 
     <lb/>
     changed that the Federation of the Canadas 
     <lb/>
     ceased to be talked of, and the Confeder<lb break="no"/>tion of the whole provinces came up in 
     <lb/>
     its stead. That scheme for the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of British North America, which a short 
     <lb/>
     time ago seemed to have but very few sup<lb break="no"/>porters, was brought suddenly before us 
     <lb/>
     with a large number of supporters. How do 
     <lb/>
     we know that there may not be a change 
     <lb/>
     again in a short space of time—that the 
     <lb/>
     whole system with which we are now deal<lb break="no"/>ing, and on which hon. gentlemen have 
     <lb/>
     placed their views before the country, may 
     <lb/>
     not be changed again, without the people, 
     <lb/>
     who are said to be so satisfied with this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, having had the matter placed before 
     <lb/>
     them for consideration, or the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     voting for or against the scheme? Therefore 
     <lb/>
     I believe it would be wiser, better, and more 
     <lb/>
     for the interests of the whole of this country 
     <lb/>
             <cb/>
           
     —and that it would greatly strengthen the 
     <lb/>
     power which this Confederate Government 
     <lb/>
     would have—were it voted upon by the 
     <lb/>
     people in the constitutional mode of a general 
     <lb/>
     election, before it is finally resolved upon as 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution of these colonies. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that if you wish to root it in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     the people, you will remove the objection 
     <lb/>
     which may at any time spring up, and be 
     <lb/>
     made the means, in the hands of designing 
     <lb/>
     men, of creating dissatisfaction hereafter. 
     <lb/>
     And I say that for the sake of carrying this 
     <lb/>
     scheme in the Lower Provinces, it is desir<lb break="no"/>able to take this course. What is the reason 
     <lb/>
     of the suspicion entertained with regard to 
     <lb/>
     this scheme by the Lower Provinces? They 
     <lb/>
     say that the Government of Canada is urging 
     <lb/>
     it so rapidly, that there must be some <hi rendition="simple:italic">arriére 
     <lb/>
     pensée</hi>—that there is something in it which 
     <lb/>
     will place her in a better position—that they 
     <lb/>
     are therefore pressing it upon the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and of the Lower Provinces, without 
     <lb/>
     giving them an opportunity of considering 
     <lb/>
     it fairly. One of the things made use of in 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces is that our interest in 
     <lb/>
     the matter is so great, and we are entangled 
     <lb/>
     in so many difficulties, that we wish the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces united with us in order that, on 
     <lb/>
     their credit united with ours, we may be able 
     <lb/>
     to incur greater liabilities, and carry out our 
     <lb/>
     views as to public works, the benefit of which 
     <lb/>
     we will gain exclusively, although the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces assume their share of the liability. 
     <lb/>
     For the present, therefore, unless by a great 
     <lb/>
     stretch of power on the part of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, it will be impossible to force it 
     <lb/>
     on the Lower Provinces. They say that 
     <lb/>
     Canada, pressing it in that way, must have 
     <lb/>
     some ulterior object in view, which does not 
     <lb/>
     distinctly appear. Can we suppose for a 
     <lb/>
     moment that the position of the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     going to England will be, that they will 
     <lb/>
     press the Imperial Parliament to pass this 
     <lb/>
     measure, <hi rendition="simple:italic">coûte que coûte</hi>, whether the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces like it or not, urging that as 
     <lb/>
     Canada possesses the larger population— 
     <lb/>
     two-thirds of the whole—if she desires to 
     <lb/>
     have it the others must have it, whether 
     <lb/>
     they will or not. If that policy were pur<lb break="no"/>sued, it would be necessary, first of all, to 
     <lb/>
     deprive them of their constitutions, and then 
     <lb/>
     to declare that they must unite with us— 
     <lb/>
     that the will of the majority should over<lb break="no"/>rule the wishes of the minority, exactly 
     <lb/>
     as in the United States, where everything 
     <lb/>
     depends on the will of the majority, and the 
     <lb/>
     minority are presumed to have but few 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="975" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0975.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">975</fw>
         
     rights, if any at all. But if you show that 
     <lb/>
     not only the majority of this Parliament, 
     <lb/>
     but the majority of the people also in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     are in favor of this scheme; and if you can 
     <lb/>
     show what the majorities in the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces are at the same time—if you can 
     <lb/>
     in this way show what is the will of the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the whole of the people of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces, you will have your hands much 
     <lb/>
     strengthened, when you go to England, if 
     <lb/>
     you wish to say that because Canada asks it, 
     <lb/>
     and the majority of the whole people of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces asks it, the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     must be compelled to come in. The passage 
     <lb/>
     of this resolution, in my judgment, would 
     <lb/>
     not imperil the passage of the scheme at 
     <lb/>
     all. It would not prevent the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who go home from taking such steps before 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Parliament as they would 
     <lb/>
     think it desirable to take, or as they 
     <lb/>
     might be instructed here to take by the 
     <lb/>
     Government of which they are members. 
     <lb/>
     Let the Imperial Parliament pass the mea<lb break="no"/>sure, according to the views of the delegates, 
     <lb/>confirmed by the action of this Parliament— 
     <lb/>but let them say that the measure shall not 
     <lb/>come into force in all these colonies until 
     <lb/>each Parliament has voted upon it. And 
     <lb/>let each Parliament be elected by the people, 
     <lb/>with special instructions to declare whether 
     <lb/>this new Constitution shall be the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of these colonies or not. Every one 
     <lb/>who is a well-wisher of his country—who 
     <lb/>desires to see it go on and prosper—who be<lb break="no"/>lieves that the concentration of power in one 
     <lb/>Executive over all these colonies will place 
     <lb/>us in a position to assume the name and 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi> of a nation upon the earth—will be 
     <lb/>glad to find our power in that way con<lb break="no"/>solidated. And if we base the struc<lb break="no"/>ture, as it ought to be based, on the 
     <lb/>expressed will of the people themselves, 
     <lb/>then I think we will be offering to those 
     <lb/>who come after us, as well as to ourselves, 
     <lb/>a heritage which every man should be 
     <lb/>proud of—and which will bring to our shores, 
     <lb/>from Great Britain and other parts, people 
     <lb/>who will be desirous to obtain here, along 
     <lb/>with all the favorable circumstances attend<lb break="no"/>ant upon the settlement of our lands, the 
     <lb/>advantages of the free Constitution which 
     <lb/>we have made, as nearly as possible, a <hi rendition="simple:italic">fac<lb break="no"/>simile</hi> of that of the mother-land. But 
     <lb/>though I am myself in favor of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration resolutions, and anxious to see them 
     <lb/>carried out, I am desirous that they shall be 
     <lb/>carried out in a manner which will be con<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
      ducive to the best interests of the country, 
     <lb/>
     based on a heartfelt expression of opinion 
     <lb/>
     by the people, by means of a general elec<lb break="no"/>tion. I promised I would not detain the 
     <lb/>
     House, and having presented such argu<lb break="no"/>ments as seem to me to require the passage 
     <lb/>
     of this resolution, I resume my seat. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName> said—I have great 
     <lb/>
     pleasure, sir, in seconding the resolution 
     <lb/>
     which is now before the House, because I 
     <lb/>
     think it is very desirable that before any 
     <lb/>
     such a change as that which is proposed 
     <lb/>
     should go into effect, the people, who are to 
     <lb/>
     be affected by the change, should have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of pronouncing upon it in a 
     <lb/>
     more decisive way than they can through 
     <lb/>
     their representatives in this House, who 
     <lb/>
     have been sent here for an entirely different 
     <lb/>
     purpose than that of making a change in the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. It would not signify to me if 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances attending the union of 
     <lb/>
     Scotland with England, or of Ireland with 
     <lb/>
     England, had furnished no reason for con<lb break="no"/>tending that an appeal to the people was 
     <lb/>
     proper. They were entirely different from 
     <lb/>
     those under which we are existing. If there 
     <lb/>
     had been no precedents whatever, I say that 
     <lb/>
     at this enlightened day, when the people 
     <lb/>
     interfere and have a right to interfere in the 
     <lb/>
     management of their own affairs, no such a 
     <lb/>
     change as this should take place with<lb break="no"/>out their having a voice in it I do 
     <lb/>
     not feel, with the proposer of this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, that it is absolutely necessary that 
     <lb/>
     a dissolution of this House should take 
     <lb/>
     place for the purpose of obtaining an expres<lb break="no"/>sion of the popular will. I do not see why 
     <lb/>
     the taking of a direct vote—yea and nay— 
     <lb/>
     would be an unconstitutional proceeding. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I have found that by the 
     <lb/>
     legislation of this country a precedent has 
     <lb/>
     been established that the people who are to 
     <lb/>
     be affected should have the right of voting 
     <lb/>
     upon certain mersures relating to their 
     <lb/>
     financial affairs. We find that in those 
     <lb/>
     bodies which the people are empowered to 
     <lb/>
     create, and which are as much representa<lb break="no"/>tive bodies as we are, the township and 
     <lb/>county councils— whenever a debt is to be 
     <lb/>created over a certain amount, affecting the 
     <lb/>communities over which those councils 
     <lb/>exercise control, the question must first be 
     <lb/>left to the people to pronounce upon it 
     <lb/>before it can become law. The people 
     <lb/>send their representatives to those bodies 
     <lb/>to legislate for them in a similar man<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="976" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0976.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">976</fw>
     ner to that in which we are sent here to 
     <lb/>
     legislate for the country at large. The only 
     <lb/>
     difference is the difference between a small 
     <lb/>
     legislative body and a large one. They are 
     <lb/>
     just as much representatives of the people as 
     <lb/>
     we are. When we provide that they shall 
     <lb/>
     submit by-laws to a direct vote of the people, 
     <lb/>
     can it be said that it is a violation of the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, or even an unjust or improper 
     <lb/>
     course to take a vote in a similar way, when 
     <lb/>
     so much larger matters are at stake? I do 
     <lb/>
     say, sir, that if there were no example for 
     <lb/>
     it—if our Legislature had not shown that it 
     <lb/>
     was the people's right to have a voice on all 
     <lb/>
     matters affecting them largely—we should 
     <lb/>
     now proceed to make that precedent. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I do not mean to say, however, in speak<lb break="no"/>ing thus, that I am adverse in the slightest de<lb break="no"/>gree to there being a dissolution of the House; 
     <lb/>
     but it strikes me that we will have a great 
     <lb/>
     many side-issues in a contest of that kind, and 
     <lb/>
     cannot, therefore, arrive at the direct sense 
     <lb/>
     of the people so closely as we should be able 
     <lb/>
     to do by a square vote of yea or nay. Never<lb break="no"/>theless, it is of very great importance that 
     <lb/>
     before advancing to the end of the proceed<lb break="no"/>ings that we have contemplated by passing 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions, they should first be 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the country in some way. I 
     <lb/>
     am in favor of the resolutions going to the 
     <lb/>
     people in any way rather than the scheme 
     <lb/>
     should be carried out without such expres<lb break="no"/>sion; and I am also desirous that the public 
     <lb/>
     should be awakened from that apathy which 
     <lb/>
     has been alluded to by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Peel, and which I am also satisfied exists 
     <lb/>
     among the people upon this question. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel has asserted that 
     <lb/>
     there could not be half a dozen gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     found on the floor of this House who would 
     <lb/>
     say that this country could go on and 
     <lb/>
     prosper—but I say it could prosper for the 
     <lb/>
     next decade as it has prospered during the 
     <lb/>
    past, without any change whatever. I 
     <lb/>believe I am one of  those, few though they 
     <lb/>may be, who so think; but I am also one of 
     <lb/>those who thought that it would be very 
     <lb/>desirable to have a change in the represen<lb break="no"/>tation of the different sections of the province, 
     <lb/>on the floor of this House. I thought that 
     <lb/>Upper Canada contributed so much more 
     <lb/>towards the revenue of this country than 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, that she ought to have a 
     <lb/>larger voice in the disposal of that revenue. 
     <lb/>Therefore a change of the Constitution, in 
     <lb/>this respect, has been agitated by men 
     <lb/>entertaining that opinion, but I never did  
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     feel that the people of Lower Canada con<lb break="no"/>sidered themselves on the eve of a revolu<lb break="no"/>tion, or that the people of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     had arrived at that point, that they felt it 
     <lb/>
     absolutely necessary to resort to revolutionary 
     <lb/>
     measures to obtain justice. While I feel 
     <lb/>
     that we have now arrived at that stage that 
     <lb/>
     we can have a union with the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that would give us a strength and a 
     <lb/>
     stability that we cannot acquire by the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions we have just passed, yet I do not 
     <lb/>
     desire that any change should take place 
     <lb/>
     without the people of this country having 
     <lb/>
     the fullest and freest opportunity of express<lb break="no"/>ing themselves upon its desirability. I 
     <lb/>
     desire that the people should have this 
     <lb/>
     scheme presented to them, side by side 
     <lb/>
     with the proposal for a legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     that we may ascertain whether or not 
     <lb/>
     they would adopt a Federal union, in pre<lb break="no"/>ference to a Legislative union. I have 
     <lb/>
     been charged with having advanced argu<lb break="no"/>ments in discussing the resolutions, which 
     <lb/>
     were as applicable and favorable to a Federal 
     <lb/>
     as to a Legislative union, and that I said 
     <lb/>
     nothing more favorable to the one than to 
     <lb/>
     the other. Well I admit that if you take 
     <lb/>
     three or four isolated points of a man's argu<lb break="no"/>ment, you can make them support exactly 
     <lb/>
     the opposite of that which his whole course 
     <lb/>
     of argument was calculated to uphold, and 
     <lb/>
     when you put all of my remarks together, 
     <lb/>
     you will find that they bear strongly in favor 
     <lb/>
     of the legislative form of union. This much 
     <lb/>
     will be found, that every argument which I 
     <lb/>
     advanced that could be said to favor Federa<lb break="no"/>tion, was also an argument in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     Legislative union ; and, in addition, I brought 
     <lb/>
     prominently to view the greater economy 
     <lb/>
     connected with the working of the latter. 
     <lb/>
     I consider that argument a strong one, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the circumstances at present existing 
     <lb/>
     in this country—the suffering in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the failure of crops, and the de<lb break="no"/>pression of trade owing to the war in 
     <lb/>
     the United States, the position of this 
     <lb/>
     country is such that it is not able to bear 
     <lb/>
     additional heavy burdens; and if we are 
     <lb/>
     going to make a change in our Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     that change should he of a character that 
     <lb/>
     would lessen those burdens instead of in<lb break="no"/>creasing them, if possible. And if we must 
     <lb/>
     incur a heavy burden for defensive purposes, 
     <lb/>
     let us have as much saving, in other respects, 
     <lb/>
     as we can effect, so that there will be as little 
     <lb/>
     expenditure as may be for the mere machinery 
     <lb/>
     of government, and then we shall have a 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">977</fw>
            
     form of union that will meet the approval

     of the people, and be perpetuated. Looking 
     <lb/>
     at this change that is considered so necessary, 
     <lb/>
     let us enquire what events have brought it 
     <lb/>
     about. Let honorable gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches answer for me, and we will 
     <lb/>
     find that it has been the cry that retrench<lb break="no"/>ment was absolutely necessary—that if we 
     <lb/>
     did not have retrenchment, or give to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada that fair control over the expenditure 
     <lb/>
     of our income that she ought to have, in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of her contributing so much 
     <lb/>
     more to the revenue, there would be a revo<lb break="no"/>lution. That was the way in which the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council, for party and poli<lb break="no"/>tical purposes, chose to discuss this matter 
     <lb/>
     while he was in opposition. Not that there 
     <lb/>
     was really any danger of revolution, but 
     <lb/>
     because there was justice in the cry, they 
     <lb/>
     used strong language to give effect to their 
     <lb/>
     argument. Now, I would like to understand 
     <lb/>
     and I have not yet been able to understand 
     <lb/>
     from any member of this House who has 
     <lb/>
     been advocating representation by population 
     <lb/>
     —whether there was any reason for believing 
     <lb/>
     that we could not have got that constitu<lb break="no"/>tional change just as well as we can get this 
     <lb/>
     one. lt was party feeling that kept the 
     <lb/>
     people apart, yet that party feeling was 
     <lb/>
     swamped in a moment when the leaders of 
     <lb/>
     the parties brought their heads together, and 
     <lb/>
     declared that it should no longer exist. 
     <lb/>
     They united for the avowed purpose of reme<lb break="no"/>dying the difficulties under which the pro<lb break="no"/>vince labored, and for the purpose of giving 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada their rights; and 
     <lb/>
     they say this is to be accomplished by a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union. They might as well have 
     <lb/>
     formed a union for a more economical object 
     <lb/>
     —for the purpose of forming a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union between the provinces. It may be 
     <lb/>
     said that hon. gentlemen of French extraction 
     <lb/>
     from Lower Canada were so determined 
     <lb/>
     to resist the demands of Upper Canada, that 
     <lb/>
     the rights of that section of the province 
     <lb/>
     could never have been obtained, unless by a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union of the colonies. I think, 
     <lb/>
     however, that they are men of intelligence, 
     <lb/>
     and that if they found Upper Canadians 
     <lb/>
     were true to their determination to contend 
     <lb/>
     for their rights until they should be obtained, 
     <lb/>
     the result would have been very different 
     <lb/>
     from what it has been. Hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     from Lower Canada, of French origin, must 
     <lb/>
     have seen that they were liable to be swept 
     <lb/>
     away at any moment that there should be a 
     <lb/>
     union between the British of Lower and of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada. If the issue had been 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
            
     placed fairly and equally before them; if 
     <lb/>
     they had been brought to see that matters 
     <lb/>
     had arrived at such a state that it was 
     <lb/>
     absolutely necessary that some change should 
     <lb/>
     take place—the people of the Eastern 
     <lb/>
     Townships and of the eastern part of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada standing ready to be banded together 
     <lb/>
     against them--they would have seen that 
     <lb/>
     the elements on the floor of this House 
     <lb/>
     were such as would force upon them either 
     <lb/>
     a legislative union with the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     or representation by population in Canada 
     <lb/>
     alone. Whether a legislative union, with 
     <lb/>
     representation by population as a basis, 
     <lb/>
     could have been obtained from the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces or not, I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say; but I am given to understand that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Lower Provinces advocated a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union as strongly as those of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, and that they were about to 
     <lb/>
     carry out a legislative union among them<lb break="no"/>selves. Now, if Prince Edward Island and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland were willing to go into a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union with Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, I do not see why the proposal 
     <lb/>
     to bring in an additional province should 
     <lb/>
     have effected so complete a change in their 
     <lb/>
     views. I am satisfied that if the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who represented the interests of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada had set themselves about 
     <lb/>
     trying to get that which would have been 
     <lb/>
     best for their people, and had endeavored to 
     <lb/>
     enforce the rights of Upper Canada, they 
     <lb/>
     would have accomplished that which would 
     <lb/>
     have been of more service to the people of 
     <lb/>
     the united provinces, and which would have 
     <lb/>
     placed beyond chance or possibility those 
     <lb/>
     contentions which will necessarily result 
     <lb/>
     so soon as you have individualized those 
     <lb/>
     provinces by giving each a Local Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     By this scheme you will have increased the 
     <lb/>
     burdens of the people, and in so doing will 
     <lb/>
     have increased their opportunity for discon<lb break="no"/>tent. You have given to the general and 
     <lb/>
     local legislatures coördinate jurisdiction, or 
     <lb/>
     at least have given them the right to legislate 
     <lb/>
     on the same questions, and, in thus placing 
     <lb/>
     in their hands an element of contention, 
     <lb/>
     have shown that you are not building up a 
     <lb/>
     firm and stable government. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Now it is said that one of the strongest 
     <lb/>
     reasons for union is found in the necessity 
     <lb/>
     of placing our common country in a position 
     <lb/>
     of defence, but I do not see why we cannot 
     <lb/>
     make arrangement for a defence under our 
     <lb/>
     present government. Let us be told what 
     <lb/>
     it is that is required of us, and see whether 
     <lb/>
     the different legislatures will not vote the 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="978" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0978.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">978</fw>
         
     money necessary. If we can get the money 
     <lb/>
     through the Imperial Government, then let 
     <lb/>
     us show them that we are prepared to make 
     <lb/>
     it good, that we are prepared to raise the 
     <lb/>
     money upon our own paper, if they will 
     <lb/>
     guarantee it for us. If they will do that, 
     <lb/>
     they will find that these provinces are 
     <lb/>
     willing and ready to make all due provision 
     <lb/>
     for their defence. This province is only one 
     <lb/>
     of a number which are equally bound to 
     <lb/>
     defend themselves with us, as I believe they 
     <lb/>
     have the spirit and inclination to do. I fancy 
     <lb/>
     you will find as much loyalty in the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces as in Canada, and you will find 
     <lb/>
     that when we are ready to aid the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country in defence of this portion of her 
     <lb/>
     territory, they will be ready too ; and as they 
     <lb/>
     are now united to the Mother Country as 
     <lb/>
     well as ourselves, we could be in no better 
     <lb/>
     position for defence through the contem<lb break="no"/>plated union. The union cannot make us 
     <lb/>
     stronger, when we have to look to the Impe<lb break="no"/>rial power as the bond that keeps us together 
     <lb/>
     under any circumstances. It is to them we 
     <lb/>
     shall look for orders when the time comes to 
     <lb/>
     act. I am not one of those who like to look 
     <lb/>
     at the idea of the severance of the bond 
     <lb/>
     between this and the Mother Country, but 
     <lb/>
     yet I feel that if Upper Canada is burdened 
     <lb/>
     more heavily than she has been by the addi<lb break="no"/>tional burdens which this Federal union 
     <lb/>
     must impose to sustain its costly machinery, 
     <lb/>
     there will be great danger of the same state 
     <lb/>
     of things being brought about which ren<lb break="no"/>dered some change necessary at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. It cannot but be felt that this scheme 
     <lb/>
     has not been brought forward with a view 
     <lb/>
     to more economical government, or with a 
     <lb/>
     view to providing the best means of union 
     <lb/>
     that could be obtained, but that it had its 
     <lb/>
     origin in expediency and compromise. The 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada felt compelled to seek 
     <lb/>
     some change, and the people of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, if they adopt the measure, will 
     <lb/>
     in a sense have it forced upon them by the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada. A scheme has been 
     <lb/>
     adopted which it is thought will prove the 
     <lb/>
     most expedient for the time being, but 
     <lb/>
     which must be changed in the course of a 
     <lb/>
     few years, after leading us into contentions 
     <lb/>
     and strife, such as we have had for the past 
     <lb/>
     ten years. Why not pause and discuss the 
     <lb/>
     measure more thoroughly, and have it weed<lb break="no"/>ed of its defects, so that we may accomplish 
     <lb/>
     at once the construction of a Constitution 
     <lb/>
     that shall be a lasting one, and not risk the 
     <lb/>
     formation of a union on a Constitution that 
     <lb/>
     will tumble to pieces, and drive a large por<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
    
     tion of the people to look for relief in a 
     <lb/>
     union with the neighboring republic—a 
     <lb/>
     union that I for one should regard as the 
     <lb/>
     greatest curse that could befall this Canada 
     <lb/>
     of ours. (Hear, hear.) Now, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     that the measure should be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     country before it is carried out, is a matter 
     <lb/>
     that is rendered the more necessary by an 
     <lb/>
     article that I will read from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> 
     <lb/>
     newspaper, which paper is the organ of 
     <lb/>
     the Government at the present time, and 
     <lb/>
     has always been understood to express 
     <lb/>
     the views of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford (Hon. Mr. BROWN), now the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council. It is in re<lb break="no"/>ference to the Intercolonial Railway, which 
     <lb/>
     so many people now think may be built 
     <lb/>
     without detriment to the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     country, if we are to have all the benefits 
     <lb/>
     supposed to be derivable from this union. 
     <lb/>
     Here is what was said by that newspaper 
     <lb/>
     when the former negotiations for building the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway were in progress :—

            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Upper Canada has not, it appears, suffered 
     <lb/>
     enough in the estimation of Upper Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members of the Cabinet, from being tied to one 
     <lb/>
     poor eastern province—it must have three more 
     <lb/>
     added to its already heavy burdens. One legis<lb break="no"/>lature is not a sufficiently cumbrous, unwieldy 
     <lb/>
     and expensive body, but we must add to it the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of three other communities, each 
     <lb/>
     section with varying local interests, and all pulling 
     <lb/>
     at the same purse. And to show what we may 
     <lb/>
     look for in the future, we are to pay four-twelfths 
     <lb/>
     of the cost of a railway to unite us to these new 
     <lb/>
     allies, and to keep the road running besides. 
     <lb/>
     Truly a charming scheme to be proposed by a 
     <lb/>
     retrenchment government—(hear, hear)—whose 
     <lb/>
     sole aim was to be the reduction of expenditure

     and the correction of abuses in administration !

     Now, burdens of an enormous amount are to be

     imposed upon the people of Upper Canada, a 
     <lb/>
     railway job to be undertaken, likely to be as 
     <lb/>
     disastrous and disgraceful as the Grand Trunk, 
     <lb/>
     and an already unwieldy political system to be 
     <lb/>
     encumbered three-fold ; all that Messrs. SICOTTE

     There is a refreshing coolness in the demand

     that Canada shall pay for the construction of a

     road, which is professedly designed to draw away

     (Hear, hear.) Now, Mr. SPEAKER, look<lb break="no"/>ing at that article, and assuming that 
     <lb/>
     the writer of it really was a man who 
     <lb/>
     had the interests of the country at heart, 
     <lb/>
     and assuming that it expressed the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of the Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, I would like to know what really 
     <lb/>
     has taken place within those two years which 
     <lb/>
     renders it so absolutely necessary that this 
     <lb/>
     road that would have been so disastrous to 
     <lb/>
     the interests of Canada, if built at that time, 
     <lb/>
     should be commenced now? Is the only 
     <lb/>
     change that has taken place the elevation of 
     <lb/>
     the editor to a seat at the Executive Council 
     <lb/>
     Board? He found that it would not do for 
     <lb/>
     him to coalesce with that very respectable old 
     <lb/>
     corruptionist who sits along side of him, and 
     <lb/>
     who compared the Upper Canadians to so 
     <lb/>
     many codfish in Gaspé Bay, unless he had 
     <lb/>
     something as a basis of excuse for the Coal<lb break="no"/>ition that would make it look plausible and 
     <lb/>
     sound well ; and so they got up the idea of a 
     <lb/>
     "new nationality," which was to crush 
     <lb/>
     out all former cries and hide from the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada their true interests, by 
     <lb/>
     declaring that no matter how extravag<lb break="no"/>ant a government may be, if you can get 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     a union of this kind, you can afford to spend 
     <lb/>
     your millions annually in excess of your 
     <lb/>
     income in the construction and maintenance 
     <lb/>
     of a road calculated to injure our trade, and 
     <lb/>
     all for the sake of adding to our population 
     <lb/>
     some 800,000 inhabitants. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Under these circumstances, it strikes me 
     <lb/>
     that before a change so great as this is made 
     <lb/>
     —a change that has been condemned and 
     <lb/>
     its leading feature, the Intercolonial Railway, 
     <lb/>
     so strongly denounced by the Reform press 
     <lb/>
     generally of Upper Canada—before such a 
     <lb/>
     change as this is made, the people should be 
     <lb/>
     consulted. It may be that the reasoning 
     <lb/>
     then adopted and given expression to through 
     <lb/>
     the columns of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> has taken a deep 
     <lb/>
     hold upon the minds of the people, and that 
     <lb/>
     they have not, like the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council, obtained the new light which 
     <lb/>
     seems to have broken in upon his mind. 
     <lb/>
     We are now told—no railway, no union ; but 
     <lb/>
     if this railway was so complete a curse 
     <lb/>
     that it was not to be built when we had 
     <lb/>
     only to contribute five-twelfths of the expense, 
     <lb/>
     we ought to have some greater reason given 
     <lb/>
     than has yet been furnished, why this union 
     <lb/>
     should take place, involving as it does the 
     <lb/>
     construction of that Intercolonial Railway, 
     <lb/>
     at a cost to us of ten-twelfths of the work. 
     <lb/>
     What great difference is there in the circum<lb break="no"/>stances of the country now from what there 
     <lb/>
     was then, to make up for the great mischief 
     <lb/>
     that the railway was to do if constructed two 
     <lb/>
     years ago? The Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council does not choose to answer these 
     <lb/>
     questions. He finds that he has got an 
     <lb/>
     excellent body of followers in this House at 
     <lb/>
     the present time, who are carried away with 
     <lb/>
     the idea that some change is necessary, and 
     <lb/>
     they are prepared to run into anything where 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable President leads, for the sake 
     <lb/>
     of the novelty; for it is said that if you 
     <lb/>
     get a little novelty to tickle the people 
     <lb/>
     for a season, they may be kept quiet, little 
     <lb/>
     heeding the storm that will come after the 
     <lb/>
     calm. When this House first met, I ob<lb break="no"/>served a great many opponents to this 
     <lb/>
     scheme; but somehow or other the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion of a great many of them very soon 
     <lb/>
     subsided. Some peeple say that several 
     <lb/>
     hon. members had axes to grind, and they 
     <lb/>
     were only holding on to the handle until 
     <lb/>
     they were sure the edge was sharp. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) Soon after the meeting of the House, 
     <lb/>
     it was observed that the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council had taken a trip around among 
     <lb/>
     them, and the next thing we knew they 
     <lb/>
     had wheeled right about. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="980" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0980.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">980</fw>
           
     the breath of the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council must have been exceedingly pesti<lb break="no"/>lential, for hon. gentlemen who had pre<lb break="no"/>pared themselves with speeches of two 
     <lb/>
     hours' duration, on standing up to deliver 
     <lb/>
     them, found themselves so weak in the 
     <lb/>
     knees that they were only able to stand for 
     <lb/>
     a few moments, and what they uttered was 
     <lb/>
     totally different from what they had pre<lb break="no"/>pared, and all in consequence of the breath 
     <lb/>
     of the Hon. President of the Council. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) From the exceedingly detri<lb break="no"/>mental character of that breath, I would 
     <lb/>
     strongly advise my hon. friends to keep at 
     <lb/>
     a safe distance, and not allow the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council to come near them, 
     <lb/>
     for fear of a similar almost fatal result. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It being six o'clock, the Speaker left the 
     <lb/>
     Chair until half-past seven. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After the recess, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. CAMERON</persName>, continuing his remarks, 
     <lb/>
     said—When the House rose at six o'clock, 
     <lb/>
     I had remarked upon the singular effect the 
     <lb/>
     breath of the Hon. President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     had upon many hon. members of this House ; 
     <lb/>
     and in connection with this matter, I would 
     <lb/>
     like now to observe that there seems to be a 
     <lb/>
     practice growing into favor, which, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to my judgment, is deserving of every 
     <lb/>
     condemnation. It is for hon. members of 
     <lb/>
     the Government to address themselves priv<lb break="no"/>ately to particular members, and give them 
     <lb/>
     reasons for their action, which reasons are 
     <lb/>
     not made known generally to the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House Now, I understand 
     <lb/>
     that every honorable member on the floor 
     <lb/>
     of this House represents a portion of 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country, and the por<lb break="no"/>tion of the people which one represents 
     <lb/>
     is as much entitled to consideration and to 
     <lb/>
     information in possession of the Government 
     <lb/>
     as the rest of the people or the constituencies 
     <lb/>
     of every other hon. member of the House. 
     <lb/>
     If the Government gives to some that infor<lb break="no"/>mation which in certain cases it has not 
     <lb/>
     communicated to those hostile to certain 
     <lb/>
     measures, it places those hon. members in a 
     <lb/>
     false position, makes them act contrary to 
     <lb/>
     what they would, perhaps, if all the facts 
     <lb/>
     were in their possession, and is a proceeding 
     <lb/>
     that is opposed to the best interests of the 
     <lb/>
     country. (Hear, hear.) If reasons were 
     <lb/>
     privately given by a Minister to me which 
     <lb/>
     he withheld from other hon. members of 
     <lb/>
     the House, I would think he was endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing to deceive me ; for, according to his 
     <lb/>
     oath of office, he is bound to preserve the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     secrets of the Cabinet, and if he betrayed 
     <lb/>
     them to me, I would conclude that he had 
     <lb/>
     some sinister end in view, and was endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing to make we proceed in a course contrary 
     <lb/>
     to that which would be dictated by my 
     <lb/>
     honest convictions. (Hear, hear.) Now, in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the Hon. the President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council, I had hoped that when he had cried 
     <lb/>
     a truce and buried the party hatchet, brushed 
     <lb/>
     off his war paint and smoked the pipe of 
     <lb/>
     peace with his political enemies—(laughter) 
     <lb/>
     —we would have no more misrepresenta<lb break="no"/>tions going to the country through the me<lb break="no"/>dium of the newspaper organ which he 
     <lb/>
     wields. I did not expect, therefore, to find 
     <lb/>
     that that organ would have devoted a whole 
     <lb/>
     column to a humble individual like myself, 
     <lb/>
     who happens to express views contrary to 
     <lb/>
     those now held by that hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     That paper, in referring to the recent debate 
     <lb/>
     in this House on the Confederation resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, makes an attack on me, by represent<lb break="no"/>ing that I have betrayed my constituents by 
     <lb/>
     acting, as it says, contrary to the pledges 
     <lb/>
     I gave them previous to my election. Now, 
     <lb/>
     I presume my constituents know what 
     <lb/>
     pledges I did make to them, and it is not 
     <lb/>
     necessary that any communications should 
     <lb/>
    be made through the channels of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> 
     <lb/>
     to let them know that I have betrayed 
     <lb/>
     those pledges, for they are as well able to 
     <lb/>
     judge as that paper whether I violated my 
     <lb/>
     promises or not. If any argument I used 
     <lb/>
     to justify the position I took in regard to 
     <lb/>
     that question was bad, it might have been 
     <lb/>
     pointed out ; but it was quite unnecessary 
     <lb/>
     to tell them that I had broken my pledges, 
     <lb/>
     when they were as competent to judge upon 
     <lb/>
     that point as any one else. Yet that is 
     <lb/>
     what the organ of the hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     doing, showing that the old party leaven 
     <lb/>
     leavens the hon. gentleman still, and that 
     <lb/>
     all the elements of party discord and strife 
     <lb/>
     are just as rampant now in this House as 
     <lb/>
     they were before the present Coalition was 
     <lb/>
     formed. (Hear.) Now, the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West, in that amusing and interest<lb break="no"/>ing scene he had with the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Carleton the other day, made a declaration 
     <lb/>
     which, according to my sense of political 
     <lb/>
     morality, is not exactly one that should 
     <lb/>
     have been made by a Minister of the Crown 
     <lb/>
     holding the position of the hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     He declared that it was the bounden duty 
     <lb/>
     of the members of his party to follow their 
     <lb/>
     leader in all things—not exercising their 
     <lb/>
     own judgment in reference to any matter 
     <lb/>
     that may come before the House, but sub<lb break="no"/>
          
            <pb n="981" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0981.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">981</fw>
      mitting themselves to him, in the belief that 
     <lb/>
     when he made any proposition, no matter of 
     <lb/>
     what character, he had some good object 
     <lb/>
     in view. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—No, 
     <lb/>
     no. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—When the 
     <lb/>
     motion for the previous question was sprung 
     <lb/>
     upon the House, the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     W est rather rated the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Carleton, because that honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     chose to express an independent view on 
     <lb/>
     the matter, and then he stated that the fol<lb break="no"/>lower ought always to obey the leader, 
     <lb/>
     because it was to be supposed the latter 
     <lb/>
     would not take any particular action without 
     <lb/>
     having good reasons for it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Now, it seems to me that we have not been 
     <lb/>
     sent to this House by the people to follow 
     <lb/>
     the leaders of a party, but to represent the 
     <lb/>
     constituencies according to the best judg<lb break="no"/>ment we possess; and we are not, I think, 
     <lb/>
     required to give up that right of judgment 
     <lb/>
     upon all questions that come before this 
     <lb/>
     House, to the leader of a party or anybody 
     <lb/>
     else, but to exercise it properly ourselves. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, in introducing any measure, ought to 
     <lb/>
     be able to satisfy honorable members of this 
     <lb/>
     House of the goodness and wisdom of that 
     <lb/>
     measure, and he should not ask or receive 
     <lb/>
     support any further than his ability to give 
     <lb/>
     such satisfaction.  (Hear, hear ) The doc<lb break="no"/>trine laid down by the Hon. Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral is, therefore, in my opinion—because it 
     <lb/>
     takes away the right of private judgment of 
     <lb/>
     honorable members of this House—perni<lb break="no"/>cious and injurious to the best interests of 
     <lb/>
     the country. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—In

     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—In inducing

     honorable members of this House to act in

     any matter contrary to their own judgment, 
     <lb/>
     because the leader of the party to which they 
     <lb/>
     belong tells them to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—No, 
     <lb/>
     no. I did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I understood 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman so, when the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Carleton and himself had 
     <lb/>
     that pleasant altercation the other day; and 
     <lb/>
     if that was not his meaning, I am sorry that 
     <lb/>
     I imputed it to him. (Hear, hear. ) Now, I 
     <lb/>
     have contended that this measure of Con<lb break="no"/>federation ought to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people before its adoption. I have already 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
    given from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> newspaper reasons 
     <lb/>
     why it should. I do not, sir, bring forward 
     <lb/>
     these extracts from that paper for the mere 
     <lb/>
     purpose of placing the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council in an awkward and unpleasant 
     <lb/>
     position; but my design in doing so is to 
     <lb/>
     lead honorable gentlemen to reflect and think 
     <lb/>
     upon the probable effect of the votes they 
     <lb/>
     may give. If the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> newspaper advo<lb break="no"/>cated measures formerly which met with the 
     <lb/>
     approbation of the people, and if its influ<lb break="no"/>ence was so wide spread as is asserted, and as 
     <lb/>
     it undeniably is, the leaven with which it 
     <lb/>
     leavened the country by those articles advo<lb break="no"/>cating certain doctrines remains there still, 
     <lb/>
     and has not been removed by any new argu<lb break="no"/>ments it may now advance. It would be 
     <lb/>
     well for honorable gentlemen, therefore, to re<lb break="no"/>flect well before making up their minds 
     <lb/>
      that the old leaven of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> has gone 
     <lb/>
     abroad—has still a hold of the public mind 
     <lb/>
     —and may affect them very seriously when 
     <lb/>
     they next present themselves at the polls. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I will read another extract showing 
     <lb/>
    what was the opinion held by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> on 
     <lb/>
     a subject which is viewed quite differently 
     <lb/>
     now by the Hon. President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     and the Government :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     We have a debt of seventy millions, and a de<lb break="no"/>ficiency of three or four millions, created by un<lb break="no"/>dertaking works which have failed to pay any 
     <lb/>return for the cost of construction. But no en<lb break="no"/>terprise, the burden of which we have assumed, 
     <lb/>comes anything near the Intercolonial in the 
     <lb/>poverty of its promised results. It will not se<lb break="no"/>cure the profitable settlement of an acre of land; 
     <lb/>it will not help our trade; it will not pay its own

     <lb/>The few barren acres at the east are to get

     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

    
   
            <p>
     Now, here is the doctrine. in reference to 
     <lb/>
    this matter, held by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> and the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council only two years ago; 
     <lb/>
     and if these views were correct then they 
     <lb/>
     ought to be correct now, and the people 
     <lb/>
     should have an opportunity of pronouncing 
     <lb/>
     upon them, and saying whether that railway 
     <lb/>
     should be built, especially when, under this 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme, we are to pay up<lb break="no"/>wards of three millions annually for the 
     <lb/>
     maintenance of the local governments. If 
     <lb/>
     the railway was objectionable then, surely it 
     <lb/>
     is more objectionable now, when the annual 
     <lb/>
     expenditure in connection with it will be at 
     <lb/>
     least double what it would have been had it 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="982" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0982.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">982</fw>
           
     been carried out at that time. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, perhaps the people will see that this 
     <lb/>
     great scheme of Confederation, which has 
     <lb/>
     made the lion and the lamb lie down to<lb break="no"/>gether, as the Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
    Council has said, is something that has made 
     <lb/>them forget that prudent economy that had 
     <lb/>a large place in the feelings of the people of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada—a place created, perhaps, 
     <lb/>chiefly by the Hon. President of the Council 
     <lb/>himself; and if it is true, as that honorable 
     <lb/>gentleman urged in his paper, it is still more 
     <lb/>true and essential now that the people 
     <lb/>should have an opportunity of pronouncing 
     <lb/>upon it. And, sir, I adopt the view of the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Peel—although starting 
     <lb/>from it, he arrives at somewhat different con<lb break="no"/>clusions from myself— if you force this 
     <lb/>scheme upon the people without asking for 
     <lb/>their consent, and if they wake from the 
     <lb/>apathy which they feel now, to find that 
     <lb/>they are saddled with burdens which they 
     <lb/>never contemplated, you make them oppo<lb break="no"/>nents of the union, and worse opponents 
     <lb/>than if you asked them now whether they 
     <lb/>approved of it or not; and so you will have 
     <lb/>a dissatisfied people laboring under burdens 
     <lb/>which I fear will eventually create serious 
     <lb/>discontent throughout the length and breadth 
     <lb/>of the land. (Hear, hear.) And there is 
     <lb/>this additional reason for referring the ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the people, now that the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have rejected the scheme, and I pre<lb break="no"/>sume their governments will not dare to 
     <lb/>press it forward in opposition to the wishes 
     <lb/>of the people. Now, hon. gentlemen opposite, 
     <lb/>when they introduced this scheme, and said 
     <lb/>they could suffer no amendments to be made 
     <lb/>in it, put it on the plea that it was absolute<lb break="no"/>ly necessary, to keep faith with the Lower 
     <lb/>Provinces, that they should carry it in its 
     <lb/>entirety. I am glad to find that the Hon. 
     <lb/>President of the Council is not so willing 
     <lb/>and anxious to break faith with those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces as he was two years ago in reference 
     <lb/>to one of the essential ingredients of this 
     <lb/>scheme—the Intercolonial Railway. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) I admire, sir, the principle of keep<lb break="no"/>ing faith in any engagement; but I do not 
     <lb/>think it was necessary, in order to keep faith 
     <lb/>in this matter, that it should be treated as 
     <lb/>the Government proposes that this House 
     <lb/>shall deal with it. All the Government had 
     <lb/>to do to carry out what it undertook with 
     <lb/>the governments of the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>was to bring the scheme before Parliament, 
     <lb/>as those governments have done, and allow 
     <lb/>Parliament to deal with it as it saw fit. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     There was no necessity for saying to the 
     <lb/>
     House that it must reject it or adopt it in 
     <lb/>
     its entirety. All the Government had to 
     <lb/>
     do—its members not being delegates to the 
     <lb/>
     Conference chosen by the people at large, 
     <lb/>
     nor even appointed by Parliament for that 
     <lb/>
     purpose, but going there, as it were, with 
     <lb/>
     the tacit understanding on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the people in this House, 
     <lb/>
     to see whether any arrangement of union 
     <lb/>
     might be made that would work beneficially 
     <lb/>
     for the interests of the whole provinces— 
     <lb/>
     all it had to do was to settle upon some plan 
     <lb/>
     which it would report to this House for 
     <lb/>
     action; but it had no power whatever to 
     <lb/>
     bind this Legislature absolutely and irrevoc<lb break="no"/>ably to the scheme adopted by the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, so that it could not dissent from or 
     <lb/>
     alter it. (Hear, hear.) Well, we find hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen who advocate this scheme 
     <lb/>
     say that it is not a perfect measure, that it 
     <lb/>
     is not what any one of the provinces would 
     <lb/>
     desire or accept of itself, but that it is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to have this patch-work of a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, because there are difficulties which 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary to get over and remove; and 
     <lb/>
     yet, while it is admitted to be imperfect, to 
     <lb/>
     tell us that we should not have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of saying whether its provisions are 
     <lb/>
     right or wrong, is, to my mind, to insult the 
     <lb/>
     intelligence of this House, and to commit a 
     <lb/>
     wrong which I think honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     will have cause to regret hereafter. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Many honorable gentlemen have 
     <lb/>
     advocated this measure with great warmth, 
     <lb/>
    with a feeling of earnestness and truthful<lb break="no"/>ness, and with what I believe to be a sincere<lb break="no"/>ly patriotic desire to accomplish something 
     <lb/>that will work for the best interests of this 
     <lb/>country. There is, for instance, the hon. 
     <lb/>member for South Lanark (Mr. MORRIS), 
     <lb/>who years ago, in one of those day-dreams 
     <lb/>of youth which most of us experience, con<lb break="no"/>ceived the idea that a union of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces would be exceedingly beneficial to 
     <lb/>the people of all of them; and having got 
     <lb/>that idea somewhat in advance of his fellow<lb break="no"/>men, he thought that it was absolutely ne<lb break="no"/>cessary for our prosperity that it should be 
     <lb/>worked out; but he forgets that in order to 
     <lb/>secure its smooth working it is necessary to 
     <lb/>have perfect joints to the machinery, and 
     <lb/>instead of getting that which will work 
     <lb/>well for the people, he gets that which has 
     <lb/>the name only of union, and few indeed of 
     <lb/>its advantages. If that honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man had his choice, he would no doubt have 
     <lb/>chosen something strong and stable, and not 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="983" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0983.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">983</fw>
            
     something delusive and perishable ; for, as the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel and other honor<lb break="no"/>able members who advocate this measure 
     <lb/>
     say, it is only a temporary expedient to tide 
     <lb/>
     us over our difficulties—a scheme of union 
     <lb/>
     to serve for the present, and not intended to 
     <lb/>
     endure for all time. (Hear, hear.) We are 
     <lb/>
     not, in fact, building up the frame-work of a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution that is to stand for ever, but 
     <lb/>
     something that we will have to tinker up 
     <lb/>
     from time to time, till we at length succeed 
     <lb/>
     either in destroying it altogether or making 
     <lb/>
     it a passably fair erection. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It appears to me, sir, that when this country 
     <lb/>
     was given responsible government—when 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada were taught the lesson 
     <lb/>
     that they were henceforth to exercise the 
     <lb/>
     right of thinking for themselves—it is a 
     <lb/>
     sort of rude interference with that right 
     <lb/>
     when a certain number of gentlemen from 
     <lb/>
     Canada enter into a contract with certain 
     <lb/>
     other gentlemen from the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     —thirty-three in number altogether—sign 
     <lb/>
     that contract, and then declare that the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the people in these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces shall first be bound by it, that the 
     <lb/>
     people themselves shall next be bound by it, 
     <lb/>
     that neither representatives nor people shall 
     <lb/>
     have the power to alter or amend it, and 
     <lb/>
     then that if we do insist upon our right to 
     <lb/>
     alter it, we shall be thrown back into that 
     <lb/>
     state of difficulty which has been held 
     <lb/>
     up by some honorable gentlemen as a 
     <lb/>
     bug-bear to frighten us into submission, the 
     <lb/>
     country being represented as having been 
     <lb/>
     bordering on revolution, into which it would 
     <lb/>
     assuredly be thrown if this measure were not 
     <lb/>
     accepted in its entirety. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     think that this proposal will not go down— 
     <lb/>
     that it will not meet with that full accept<lb break="no"/>ance which honorable gentlemen imagine. 
     <lb/>
     The people have too much intelligence to 
     <lb/>
     intrust the arrangement of so important a 
     <lb/>
     subject as this, which so intimately affects 
     <lb/>
     their future prosperity and happiness, to the 
     <lb/>
     hands of any set of men, however able and 
     <lb/>
     talented they may be ; and if this scheme is 
     <lb/>
     carried without giving the people a chance of 
     <lb/>
     pronouncing their opinion, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men will be told, when they go back to their 
     <lb/>
     constituents, that the peeple have rights to 
     <lb/>
     be respected, that they like to be consulted 
     <lb/>
     about the character of the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     under which they are to live, and that before 
     <lb/>
     it is adopted finally, they like to have a word 
     <lb/>
     to say in regard to it, as well as those who 
     <lb/>
     assume to speak for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. McGEE</persName>—They have a word 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     to say. They say ditto to our action. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—Well, I should 
     <lb/>
     like them to have a full opportunity of saying 
     <lb/>
     ditto or not as they pleased, and I fancy if 
     <lb/>
     they had, the ditto would not be so strong 
     <lb/>
     as honorable gentlemen opposite seem to 
     <lb/>
     think. (Hear, hear.) I have been told 
     <lb/>
     that I have violated my pledges in opposing 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, and that my constituents sent 
     <lb/>
     me here because they thought me to be in 
     <lb/>
     favor of it. Well, I have that yet to learn 
     <lb/>
     from them ; for I have heard no complaint 
     <lb/>
     from them against my action, and have had 
     <lb/>
     one letter fully approving of it, and it so 
     <lb/>
     happens that it was written by a warm friend 
     <lb/>
     of the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     in the old time. (Hear, hear.) I am not 
     <lb/>
     aware that the people anywhere approve of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme and say ditto to it, as the Hon<lb break="no"/>orable Minister of Agriculture tells us ; and 
     <lb/>
     when the next election takes place, I pre<lb break="no"/>sume we will have the ditto in some shape. 
     <lb/>
     Now, the Honorable President of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil may think that I have some personal 
     <lb/>
     feeling against himself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Not at all.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName> —If the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman does think that I am actuated 
     <lb/>
     by personal motives in my strictures upon 
     <lb/>
     him, he is very much mistaken. I have not 
     <lb/>
     the slightest personal feeling against him ; 
     <lb/>
     and as far as I personally am concerned, he 
     <lb/>
     may remain in the Ministry and work 
     <lb/>
     through with his colleagues just as long as 
     <lb/>
     he can, and I promise he will find no factious 
     <lb/>
     opposition from me. (Hear, hear.) If I 
     <lb/>
     understand myself at all, I desire to promote 
     <lb/>
     the interests and advance the prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     my country ; but I do not believe those 
     <lb/>
     interests or that prosperity advanced by the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of this scheme. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     believe a scheme of union could be devised 
     <lb/>
     which would be serviceable to all of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but I do not believe that Confed<lb break="no"/>eration is that scheme. I do not think it is 
     <lb/>
     desirable to adopt this, and then trust to the 
     <lb/>
     chance of obtaining a change afterwards. 
     <lb/>
     Honorable gentlemen from Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     are only postponing the time when they will 
     <lb/>
     stand like other men in the community, 
     <lb/>
     having voice for voice with the rest, and 
     <lb/>
     nothing more. But if we change the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution now, is it wise or prudent to make 
     <lb/>
     the change only of such a character as to 
     <lb/>
     require future amendment, and give rise to 
     <lb/>
     future agitation ? and is it not better that 
     <lb/>
     we should endeavor to make the Constitution 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">984</fw>
            
     right in the first instance ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And as there are elements by which a union 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces could be formed that would 
     <lb/>
     be lasting, and that would serve the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of this country, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the Treasury benches would have 
     <lb/>
     better shown their patriotism by waiting a

     little longer to accomplish it.

     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—I

     thought my hon. friend knew that every

     man in Lower Canada was against it, every

     man in New Brunswick. every man in Nova

     Scotia, every man in Newfoundland, and 
     <lb/>
     every man in Prince Edward Island. How,

     understand that it was asserted here that 
     <lb/>
     that feeling existed in the Lower Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I do understand, moreover, that there are 
     <lb/>
     enough members on the floor of this House 
     <lb/>
     —in the Parliament now assembled—who

     are ready and willing to give us representa<lb break="no"/>tion by population.

     <lb/>
     And I think I can show that the people

     of the Lower Provinces are in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     Legislative union, rather than a Federal 
     <lb/>
     union—(hear, hear)—for they appointed de<lb break="no"/>legates to meet at Charlottetown for the

     purpose of establishing a Legislative union 
     <lb/>
     among themselves,

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is, no doubt, sincere in the opinion he

     expresses. It is true there was a union of 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces proposed, but it was 
     <lb/>
     not stated what kind of union it was to be.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—Well, all the 
     <lb/>
     sentiments and feeling I have seen expressed 
     <lb/>
     on the subject leads me to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that it was a legislative union they proposed ; 
     <lb/>
     and when the delegates to the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference spoke to their constituents, they put 
     <lb/>
     forward the idea that a legislative union 
     <lb/>
     would have been better than the one pro<lb break="no"/>posed At any rate this scheme has been 
     <lb/>
     rejected in one of the provinces, and if car<lb break="no"/>ried into operation, it will have to be forced 
     <lb/>
     upon the people of one or other of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Well, if you are going to force a 
     <lb/>
     Constitution upon any part of the people, it 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     would be better to force upon them that 
     <lb/>
     which would, according to your own ex<lb break="no"/>pressed opinion, be better and of greater 
     <lb/>
     service to the country than the scheme 
     <lb/>
     under consideration. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     people of Lower Canada presented the 
     <lb/>
     appearance of being against representation 
     <lb/>
     by population ; they thought that it would 
     <lb/>
     be the annihilation of their peculiar institu<lb break="no"/>tions—that by its adoption their laws would 
     <lb/>
     be interfered with, their language extin<lb break="no"/>guished, and their religion destroyed ; and 
     <lb/>
     yet how readily did they concede the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple in this Confederation scheme. They 
     <lb/>
     granted representation by population in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower House of the Federal Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And why had they done so ? 
     <lb/>
     Because, they say, under the Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment our local affairs and interests will be 
     <lb/>
     safe in our own keeping—our laws will be 
     <lb/>
     safe, our language will be safe, our reli<lb break="no"/>gion will be safe. Now, if they were 
     <lb/>
     assured that all these interests would be 
     <lb/>
     equally as safe and well protected under any 
     <lb/>
     form of government that might be chosen 
     <lb/>
     for the good of the whole country, can any 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman assume to say that they 
     <lb/>
     would be opposed to that form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment ? (Hear, hear.) It is well to under<lb break="no"/>stand that hon. gentlemen representing 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada constituencies and the people 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada have been educated to fear 
     <lb/>
     aggression on the part of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     especially if representation by population 
     <lb/>
     were granted ; and they have been so 
     <lb/>
     educated in consequence of the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which the Hon. President of the Council, 
     <lb/>
     his organ, and the organs of his party, have 
     <lb/>
     agitated that question in times past ; but 
     <lb/>
     when the people of Lower Canada under<lb break="no"/>stand that there is an opportunity of con<lb break="no"/>ceding that which they have hitherto refused, 
     <lb/>
     and at the same time of securing the enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of those rights and privileges which 
     <lb/>
     they all hold dear, I cannot believe that 
     <lb/>
     they will longer oppose that which all of 
     <lb/>
     them cannot fail to see must come sooner or 
     <lb/>
     later. (Hear, hear.) They must see that it 
     <lb/>
     is better for them to make terms now when 
     <lb/>
     they may ; for I apprehend that they would 
     <lb/>
     not carry their resistance to a just principle 
     <lb/>
     to the length of a revolution ; for it is quite 
     <lb/>
     clear that they could not be successful in 
     <lb/>
     any such movement, or set themselves up as 
     <lb/>
     an independent power in this country, while 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada and the other provinces re<lb break="no"/>main a part of the British possessions ; nor 
     <lb/>
     could they become a part of the United 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="985" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0985.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">985</fw>
               
     States, for under that government their laws, 
     <lb/>
     their language and their religion would be 
     <lb/>
     far less secure than they would be if the 
     <lb/>
     government were entirely in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada. I feel satisfied, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentlemen from Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     would have yielded representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation, if it had been shown to them by the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of Upper Canada that they 
     <lb/>
     could accept of no change which would 
     <lb/>
     increase our difficulties and add to the bur<lb break="no"/>dens we have to bear, as this scheme does ; 
     <lb/>
     for that was the charge made over and over 
     <lb/>
     again at the polls in Upper Canada, that we 
     <lb/>
     were laboring under heavy burdens which 
     <lb/>
     had been cast upon us by successive govern<lb break="no"/>ments, owing to the influence of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. (Hear, hear.) Sir, I cannot 
     <lb/>
     conceive it to be possible that any body of 
     <lb/>
     men sent here by the people under the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution will make changes in that Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion which were not contemplated by those 
     <lb/>
     who sent them here, without submitting 
     <lb/>
     those changes first to the people. They have 
     <lb/>
     not been agitated at the polls, and the people 
     <lb/>
     seem to think that they should be consider<lb break="no"/>ed, and there is an apathy amongst them 
     <lb/>
     that does not prove that they are well dis<lb break="no"/>posed towards the scheme. It is true that 
     <lb/>
     the boast is made that they are all in favor 
     <lb/>
     of it, and a recent meeting at Toronto is 
     <lb/>
     pointed to as showing what their feeling is 
     <lb/>
     upon the subject. Well, of course, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Lambton and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Kent were at that meeting, and they said, 
     <lb/>
     and no doubt believed that those who com<lb break="no"/>posed that meeting were very distinguished 
     <lb/>
     individuals. (Laughter.) And because 
     <lb/>
     these distinguished individuals were present, 
     <lb/>
     and resolutions were carried in favor of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, then it was at once assumed 
     <lb/>
     that the whole country was in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. But it ought to be recollected that 
     <lb/>
     that meeting was got up by a number of 
     <lb/>
     young men—talented and able young men, 
     <lb/>
     no doubt, but still young and enthusiastic— 
     <lb/>
     associated together to form or reorganize a 
     <lb/>
     Reform association, and that it was attended 
     <lb/>
     only by them and those friendly to them and 
     <lb/>
     their views, and not by the citizens of To<lb break="no"/>ronto, assembled for the purpose of deter<lb break="no"/>mining whether the scheme should be 
     <lb/>
     adopted or not. It cannot be assumed, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that a meeting of that kind truly re<lb break="no"/>flected the opinion of the people of Toronto ; 
     <lb/>
     nor would this conclusion be arrived at when 
     <lb/>
     it is remembered that when a gentleman got 
     <lb/>
     up and moved that the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     ation should be submitted to the people, 
     <lb/>
     he was laughed at. Is it likely that if the 
     <lb/>
     meeting was not composed entirely of those 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Confederation, a proposition of 
     <lb/>
     that kind would be received with a laugh ? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)  And if you read the reports 
     <lb/>
     of the speeches delivered at that meeting, 
     <lb/>
     you will find that hardly anything was said 
     <lb/>
     at all in reference to the true merits of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, but that there was a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     that "highfaluting" talk which you hear in 
     <lb/>
     this House about the great and glorious 
     <lb/>
     results that this scheme is to bring forth. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) As to its probable actual 
     <lb/>
     working and the benefits it will confer upon 
     <lb/>
     the people, or as to its disadvantages, there 
     <lb/>
     was not a word spoken in sober language, 
     <lb/>
     and in this House you find hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     debating in just the same extravagant style 
     <lb/>
     as was exhibited at that meeting. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">HON. MR. McDOUGALL</persName>—I have under<lb break="no"/>stood from the several speeches delivered by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman upon this subject, that 
     <lb/>
     he feels quite convinced that a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union would be better, and that he would 
     <lb/>
     vote for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">HON. MR. MCDOUGALL</persName>—Well, then, 
     <lb/>
     I should like to know what authority he 
     <lb/>
     would have to vote for that rather than a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union, and from what he draws the 
     <lb/>
     inference that the people are in favor of it? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—When I said I 
     <lb/>
     would vote for a legislative union, I did not 
     <lb/>
     say I was ready to adopt it without submit<lb break="no"/>ting it to the people. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
     <lb/>
     it has been said that the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     are not in favor of and would not accept a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union. An hon. friend has just 
     <lb/>
     put in my hand a report of a speech deliv<lb break="no"/>ered by Dr. TUPPER of Nova Scotia, in 
     <lb/>
     which that gentleman expresses himself in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I suppose it is ex<lb break="no"/>ceedingly likely that at a meeting held in 
     <lb/>
     Halifax to consider a union of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, the people of that city were in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a legislative union, because Hali<lb break="no"/>fax was to be the capital, the central place 
     <lb/>
     of the proposed union, the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     giving up their individuality. I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that there may be some in all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces who are in favor of a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     rather than a Federal union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—Now, in the

     correspondence laid before this House on 
     <lb/>
      
            <pb n="986" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0986.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">986</fw>
               
     the subject of a union of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
      Provinces, the words used, as I recollect 
     <lb/>
     them, were a "Legislative union," and you 
     <lb/>
     do not find that the people of those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces desired Federal rather than a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative union. In the correspondence laid 
     <lb/>
     before the House on the subject, I think 
     <lb/>
     that the words used are those of a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union. You do not find the words "Fed<lb break="no"/>eral union" in it ; and I think that is the 
     <lb/>
     kind of union which those gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     desired the best interests of this country 
     <lb/>
     ought to have striven to have had. But 
     <lb/>
     because some fifteen or sixteen gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     who patched up this Constitution with so 
     <lb/>
     many discordant elements in it, did not 
     <lb/>
     choose to give it to us, is no reason why we 
     <lb/>
     should not have it. All that we desired was 
     <lb/>
     that we should have a strong government, 
     <lb/>
     and they should have been satisfied to have 
     <lb/>
     gone on with the government of the coun<lb break="no"/>try without any change. (Hear, hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen who were brought together 
     <lb/>
     in this Coalition had said so many hard 
     <lb/>
     things of each other, that it was found neces<lb break="no"/>sary to make people forget these by putting 
     <lb/>
     before them some great scheme, and I hope 
     <lb/>
     it will be a lesson to the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council not to say such hard things 
     <lb/>
     of people in future. (Hear, hear, and laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. Mr. DORION</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     do not intend to discuss the motion proposed 
     <lb/>
     by the honorable member for Peel ; I merely 
     <lb/>
     desire to explain to Lower Canadian members 
     <lb/>
     that the object of that motion is to ask that 
     <lb/>
     any measure passed by the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment may not be put in force in Canada with<lb break="no"/>out being submitted to the people of this pro<lb break="no"/>vince. Those who are of opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature ought not to pass a measure of 
     <lb/>
     such importance—which is nothing short 
     <lb/>
     of a revolution in our Constitution—those 
     <lb/>
     who consider the measure of sufficient import<lb break="no"/>ance to induce them not to ask England to 
     <lb/>
     carry out that revolution without consulting 
     <lb/>
     the people, must vote in favor of this motion. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Even supposing that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple were in favor of Confederation, it would 
     <lb/>
     still be of great advantage to submit the ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the electors. The question is not yet 
     <lb/>
     understood. The newspapers have said, on 
     <lb/>
     the one hand, that it was a good measure, and 
     <lb/>
     on the other that it was a bad one ; but in 
     <lb/>
     reality there has been no serious discussion, 
     <lb/>
     and it is perfectly clear that the people are 
     <lb/>
     not yet acquainted with it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Members of this House undertake a very 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     serious responsibility in voting for this mea<lb break="no"/>sure without consulting the people ; and the 
     <lb/>
     advantage of an appeal to their electors— 
     <lb/>
     even supposing the result to be favorable to 
     <lb/>
     the scheme—would be to relieve them of that 
     <lb/>
     responsibility. (Hear, hear.) And if the 
     <lb/>
     measure be neither understood nor approved 
     <lb/>
     of by the people, you run the risk, by voting 
     <lb/>
     it in that position, of creating prejudices 
     <lb/>
     which would perhaps be removed by discus<lb break="no"/>sion. Therefore, in the interest of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure itself, as well as of honorable members of 
     <lb/>this House, it ought to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>people before it is finally voted, and for my 
     <lb/>part I shall vote for the amendment of the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Peel. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:EVAN1">HON. MR. EVANTUREL</persName>—I should like 
     <lb/>
     to ask my friend the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga, and all the honorable members of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition, who constantly repeat that 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is now defunct, and that we 
     <lb/>
     have nothing more to do but to bury it, why 
     <lb/>
     they desire to submit it to the people ? I 
     <lb/>
     fail to see the necessity, if it be true that the 
     <lb/>
     scheme is already defunct. (Hear, hear, and 
     <lb/>
     laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—My answer is, that 
     <lb/>
     we desire that it should be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people, in order to shew that it is unpopular. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member thought to place me in a 
     <lb/>
     dilemma, but he was mistaken. He thinks 
     <lb/>
     the measure will be passed in England as it 
     <lb/>
     stands at present, and it is to avoid that con<lb break="no"/>tingency that we desire an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     amended in England to our advantage, it may 
     <lb/>
     also be modified in a contrary sense. But 
     <lb/>
     that is not the question. I say that we ought 
     <lb/>
     to submit it to the people, in order that it 
     <lb/>
     the verdict should be favorable to the mea<lb break="no"/>sure, it may go to the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     with the sanction of the people and of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment; and if the people are opposed to the

     scheme, the delegates must not be left in a 
     <lb/>
     position to say that public opinion in Canada 
     <lb/>
     is favorable to the measure. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>

     <lb/>
     that the fears of the honorable member for

     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">987</fw>
     the scheme should be known as a whole, for 
     <lb/>
     how could the people form a sound judgment 
     <lb/>
     if we were to lay before them only a vague 
     <lb/>
     plan of Confederation, that is to say, the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions as they stand at present, unless 
     <lb/>
     they were also put in possession of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the local governments, and all the 
     <lb/>
     other details of the measure which most deep<lb break="no"/>ly interest them, and with which they are en<lb break="no"/>titled to be made acquainted ? Let us wait 
     <lb/>
     until the plan is known, and the people will 
     <lb/>
     be consulted when the proper time comes. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI3">MR. J. B. E. DORION</persName>—Really, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, if the honorable member for Beau<lb break="no"/>harnois meant what he said, he has given us 
     <lb/>
     something new. But I do not believe he is 
     <lb/>
     really serious when he tells us that we should 
     <lb/>
     wait until the constitutions of the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments are submitted to us, before judging 
     <lb/>
     of the merits of the resolutions now before 
     <lb/>
     us. However, supposing him to be perfectly 
     <lb/>
     in earnest, and that he had no intention of 
     <lb/>
     trifling, as he sometimes does, does he fancy 
     <lb/>
     for one moment that we are going to accept 
     <lb/>
     the reasons he brings forward to induce us to 
     <lb/>
     vote against an appeal to the people ? If so, 
     <lb/>
     he is very much mistaken. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     can easily understand that he is embarrassed, 
     <lb/>
     and that he should shield himself even under 
     <lb/>
     weak arguments in voting against the motion 
     <lb/>
     in amendment, for he promised at two elec<lb break="no"/>toral meetings to vote for an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people. (Hear, hear.) He says he will not 
     <lb/>
     vote for an appeal to the people, because he is 
     <lb/>
     not acquainted with the details of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure ; but why, then, does he vote on the 
     <lb/>
     main motion without knowing these details ? 
     <lb/>
     He knows that the Government have told us 
     <lb/>
     that we must vote Confederation before they 
     <lb/>
     bring down the constitution of the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments, and that they intended going to 
     <lb/>
     England to secure the new Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     without submitting to us the plan of the local 
     <lb/>
     constitutions. It will be too late when the 
     <lb/>
     delegates return, and after England has given 
     <lb/>
     us a new Constitution, to submit the present 
     <lb/>
     resolutions to the people. (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>
     if we can judge here of this grand scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation—as the hon. member says— 
     <lb/>
     without having before us the details of the 
     <lb/>
     organization of the local governments, why 
     <lb/>
     should not the people, in like manner, be af<lb break="no"/>forded an opportunity of recording their opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the scheme ? The reasons advanced 
     <lb/>
     by the honorable member are utterly futile. 
     <lb/>

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GIBB1">MR. GIBBS</persName>.—Before the vote is taken 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     on this motion,I feel it to be my duty to make a 
     <lb/>
     few remarks explanatory of the vote I intend 
     <lb/>
     to give. When I addressed the House the 
     <lb/>
     other evening, I stated that I had given a 
     <lb/>
     pledge to my constituents that when the motion 
     <lb/>
     came up in this House for submitting the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of a union of the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     North America to the people of this province, 
     <lb/>
     I would feel it to be my duty to vote for it. 
     <lb/>
     The language I used was something like this, 
     <lb/>
     that although I was in favor of the Federation 
     <lb/>
     of the British North American Provinces, yet 
     <lb/>
     that as the measure was to affect not only 
     <lb/>
     those now inhabiting these provinces, but 
     <lb/>
     others to follow us, I would insist upon it 
     <lb/>
     that the question should be submitted to 
     <lb/>
     the people before going into effect, while upon 
     <lb/>
     the canvass in my riding, I stated that I looked 
     <lb/>
     upon the resolutions submitted in the light of 
     <lb/>
     the basis of an agreement that might have 
     <lb/>
     been entered into by a number of individuals 
     <lb/>
     desirous of going into a partnership, which no 
     <lb/>
     one could alter without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     others. I was, therefore, not at all surprised 
     <lb/>
     to hear the Honorable Attorney General West, 
     <lb/>
     at the opening of the discussion, say that we 
     <lb/>
     could not change that treaty, that we must 
     <lb/>
     vote on it in this way—either accept or reject 
     <lb/>
     it as a whole. It was said that if the people 
     <lb/>
     sent me to the House as their representative, 
     <lb/>
     I would be found voting for their resolutions 
     <lb/>
     as they were, without seeking to amend them 
     <lb/>
     in any respect. Although I believed that the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions would be presented and pressed as 
     <lb/>
     they stood, I did not believe that no amend<lb break="no"/>ment would ever be made to them ; and 
     <lb/>
     although the Parliament of Canada has been 
     <lb/>
     told that it cannot alter the scheme, I am not 
     <lb/>
     without hope that when the delegation pro<lb break="no"/>ceeds to England,certain necessary amendments  
     <lb/>
     will be introduced by the Government of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. Now, sir, I consider that to a cer<lb break="no"/>tain extent the members opposed to the details 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme, but who are disposed to favor 
     <lb/>
     the general principle, have put their political 
     <lb/>
     consciences in the hands of the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the Treasury benches ; therefore I 
     <lb/>
     am in hopes that the resolutions will not pass 
     <lb/>
     into law exactly in the shape in which they 
     <lb/>
     have been presented to this House. Being 
     <lb/>
     sent here to represent the people, and feeling 
     <lb/>
     the matter to be a very important one, affecting 
     <lb/>
     very materially the Constitution under which 
     <lb/>
     they live, I consider it my duty to vote for 
     <lb/>
     such an amendment as that which has been 
     <lb/>
     submitted by the honorable member for Peel. 
     <lb/>
     I was strenghtened in that view of the case by 
     <lb/>
     the words of Lord DURHAM on the subject of 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="988" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0988.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">988</fw>
               
     the union of Upper and Lower Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     noble lord had recommended the adoption of a 
     <lb/>
     general legislative union of all the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces, and also the sub<lb break="no"/>mission of the question to the people of those 
     <lb/>
     provinces for their approval. He said, " But 
     <lb/>
     the state of the lower province, though it 
     <lb/>
     justifies the proposal of an union, would not, I 
     <lb/>
     think, render it gracious or even just on the 
     <lb/>
     part of Parliament, to carry it into effect with<lb break="no"/>out referring it to the ample deliberation and 
     <lb/>
     consent of the people of those colonies." Now, 
     <lb/>
     sir, I take it that what is alluded to here is 
     <lb/>
     the consent of the legislatures of those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. If this House should be dissolved, 
     <lb/>
     and the measure passed in England be of 
     <lb/>
     a permissive character, it would, when re<lb break="no"/>turned, either be accepted or rejected by 
     <lb/>
     the House, and in the meantime the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies could be consulted in reference 
     <lb/>
     to it. (Hear, hear.) The necessity for 
     <lb/>
     this has been proved by some of the remarks 
     <lb/>
     which have been made by honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who have addressed the House on the subject. 
     <lb/>
     Several honorable members, who advocated the 
     <lb/>
     measure, stated that they had already placed 
     <lb/>
     it before their constituents, and that they had 
     <lb/>
     their endorsement in voting for it as they 
     <lb/>
     intended to do. That is right as far as it 
     <lb/>
     goes, but it only shows that these honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen deemed it necessary to take that 
     <lb/>
     course and consult their constituents, thus 
     <lb/>
     fortifying themselves by securing beforehand 
     <lb/>
     their approval. (Hear, hear.) It is said 
     <lb/>
     that doctors disagree, but I think the same 
     <lb/>
     may be said of lawyers ; for we find the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Peel saying that it would be 
     <lb/>
     unconstitutional to take the course advocated 
     <lb/>
     by the honorable member for North Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     But I concur rather in the mode of appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people proposed by the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario, " yea " or " nay," than in that 
     <lb/>
     of the honorable member for Peel. The prin<lb break="no"/>ciple has been acknowledged by the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, and it has been introduced into 
     <lb/>
     our county councils, so far that any sum 
     <lb/>
     exceeding $20,000 cannot be levied without 
     <lb/>
     the consent of the people having been first 
     <lb/>
     obtained. I believe that we should support 
     <lb/>
     Federation, or the fears entertained by many 
     <lb/>
     may be realized, that its rejection may have a 
     <lb/>
     tendency towards annexation. I did not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate to give my adhesion to the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     of the Conference, believing as I do that 
     <lb/>
     their adoption is calculated to benefit these 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and also to strengthen the connec<lb break="no"/>tion between this country and Great Britain. 
     <lb/>
     My attachment to British institutions is not 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     mere sentiments, but a principle which ha 
     <lb/>
     grown with my growth and strengthened with 
     <lb/>
     my strength. (Hear, hear.) I fear if this 
     <lb/>
     scheme be not adopted, and matters continue 
     <lb/>
     as at present—let the just rights of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada be denied her—let the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     treaty be abrogated—we may hear a cry 
     <lb/>
     throughout the province that will alarm if not 
     <lb/>
     astonish us. One thing has struck me as 
     <lb/>
     rather singular in passing through the coun<lb break="no"/>try—that not one individual whose proclivities 
     <lb/>
     were supposed to be in favor of American 
     <lb/>
     institutions had expressed himself as in favor 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme now before the House. I look 
     <lb/>
     upon that as a strong argument in its favor. 
     <lb/>
     As I have already stated, sir, although I am 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the measure, I think it but right 
     <lb/>
     that it should be submitted to the people, for 
     <lb/>
     their approval, before being carried into effect, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore I deem it my duty to vote for 
     <lb/>
     the amendment of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Peel. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK2">MR. JACKSON</persName>—I have only a word or 
     <lb/>
     two to say, Mr. SPEAKER, before the vote is 
     <lb/>
     taken on this motion. I cannot reconcile the 
     <lb/>
     conduct of the honorable member for Peel in 
     <lb/>
     voting that an Address should be presented 
     <lb/>
     to Her Majesty in favor of the scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     then move to have it submitted to the people. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member for Peel has made out 
     <lb/>
     a case for the resolutions which have been 
     <lb/>
     adopted by this House. He stated that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Upper Canada were in favor of it ;  
     <lb/>
     he has no objection to it himself ; it meets 
     <lb/>
     with his hearty concurrence. I can easily 
     <lb/>
     conceive how my honorable friend from North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario can vote for this resolution ; but I 
     <lb/>
     cannot understand how an honorable <choice><sic>gentle<lb break="no"/>tleman</sic><corr>gentleman</corr></choice> can vote that an Address shall be 
     <lb/>
     presented to the Queen, asking Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     to submit the scheme to the Imperial Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and, after that has been voted, turn 
     <lb/>
     round and vote that the scheme should be 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the people. I cannot understand 
     <lb/>
     that. If I voted for the motion now before 
     <lb/>
     the House, I should think I was acting in 
     <lb/>
     opposition to the vote I gave before. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I stated the other evening that my 
     <lb/>
     constituents were in favor of the House 
     <lb/>
     adopting this measure, and that they did not 
     <lb/>
     consider an appeal to the people necessary. 
     <lb/>
     In accordance with their decision I gave my 
     <lb/>
     vote, and I shall now vote in opposition to 
     <lb/>
     the motion of the honorable member for Peel. 
     <lb/>
     If it was necessary, I think I could show to 
     <lb/>
     the House that if it were submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people, side issues would be raised, irrelevant 
     <lb/>
     altogether to the main question, in order to 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="989" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0989.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">989</fw>
               
     promote some local object or interest, and we 
     <lb/>
     would have no united expression of opinion. 
     <lb/>
     I think that every honorable gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     supported the resolutions must vote in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to the motion of the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I do not. rise to de<lb break="no"/>tain the House from the division beyond a 
     <lb/>
     very few minutes. But I think it would 
     <lb/>
     not be desirable that the debate should close 
     <lb/>
     without a few words from this part of the 
     <lb/>
     House. And first, a word with reference to 
     <lb/>
     the speech of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON). That 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman, in the course of his re<lb break="no"/>marks, said he had no personal feeling to<lb break="no"/>wards myself. I quite believe that, and I am 
     <lb/>
     entirely willing that the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     should enjoy all the little relief he evidently 
     <lb/>
     obtains from his fierce assaults on myself and 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Provincial Secretary (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McDOUGALL). I do not think that any of 
     <lb/>
     the other remarks of the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     require notice— (laughter) —as they were 
     <lb/>
     only a repetition of what had frequently 
     <lb/>
     come from other honorable members in the 
     <lb/>
     previous part of this debate. But as re<lb break="no"/>gards the honorable member for Peel (Hon. 
     <lb/>
    J. HILLYARD CAMERON), I do say that any<lb break="no"/>thing more extraordinary than the line of ar<lb break="no"/>gument he took up here to-night, I never heard 
     <lb/>from any hon. member of this House. What 
     <lb/>was the position taken by the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>from Peel ? He commenced by saying that 
     <lb/>justice to Upper Canada required the grant<lb break="no"/>ing of parliamentary reform, and that this 
     <lb/>scheme gave that measure of justice to 
     <lb/>Upper Canada. He said the province must 
     <lb/>be defended ; that the question of the de<lb break="no"/>fence of this province was the most urgent 
     <lb/>and the most important question we had to 
     <lb/>consider at this moment, and that this mea<lb break="no"/>sure provided the best way of meeting that 
     <lb/>question of defence. He said that the threat<lb break="no"/>ened abolition of reciprocity with the United 
     <lb/>States required to be met—that the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of this province would be imperilled 
     <lb/>by the repeal of the Reciprocity treaty— 
     <lb/>and that he conceived that this measure sup<lb break="no"/>plied the very best way of meeting that dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty. He said also that we cannot go on 
     <lb/>as we are—that it was quite impossible that 
     <lb/>the state of things which has existed in Ca<lb break="no"/>nada could continue—that there must be a 
     <lb/>change—and he conceived that what was pro<lb break="no"/>posed by this measure was a most desirable 
     <lb/>change. He said we had but one of two al<lb break="no"/>ternatives—a dissolution of the union, or the 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
            
     adoption of the Federal principle—and that 
     <lb/>
     for his part he considered that a dissolution 
     <lb/>
     of the union was the last thing to be adopt<lb break="no"/>ed, and that the Federal system is the best 
     <lb/>
     remedy that can be applied under our par<lb break="no"/>ticular circumstances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME2">HON. J. H. CAMERON</persName>—I said I pre<lb break="no"/>ferred the legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—At any rate, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman voted in the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional committee for a Federal union, and 
     <lb/>
     signed the report in favor of it, as the only 
     <lb/>
     measure that could be carried, and as one de<lb break="no"/>sirable to be carried. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME2">HON. J. H. CAMERON</persName>—After having 
     <lb/>
     voted first for the legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I cannot speak as 
     <lb/>
     to that. Then the honorable gentleman went 
     <lb/>
     on to say that on all these grounds this mea<lb break="no"/>sure commended itself " to every true lover 
     <lb/>
     of his country." Yet, after having passed 
     <lb/>
     this high eulogium on the measure, what does 
     <lb/>
     he say ? Why, that he won't have it now— 
     <lb/>
     that he won't have it until it has been sent to 
     <lb/>
     the country, and the opinion of the electors 
     <lb/>
     has been obtained upon it ! He says there is 
     <lb/>
     danger of annexation to the United States if 
     <lb/>
     these difficulties are not met—that annexation 
     <lb/>
     is hanging over us—that this measure will 
     <lb/>
     deliver us from that dire fate—and yet he is 
     <lb/>
     not prepared to apply the remedy now ! And 
     <lb/>
     what are the reasons of the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man for refusing to give effect to a measure 
     <lb/>
     of which he professes to be so enamoured ? 
     <lb/>
     Does he, like the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario, deny the power of Parliament 
     <lb/>
     to pass such a measure ? Not at all ; he 
     <lb/>
     admits we have full power to pass it. Does 
     <lb/>
     he personally entertain any doubt as to the 
     <lb/>
     benefit from passing it now ? On the con<lb break="no"/>trary, he is enthusiastically for the measure, 
     <lb/>
     and declares that he would vote for it, just as 
     <lb/>
     it stands, as an elector at the polls. Does he 
     <lb/>
     want delay ? On the contrary, he demands 
     <lb/>
     that the measure shall be urged on with all 
     <lb/>
     speed. (Hear, hear.) He says the sooner 
     <lb/>
     the members of Government are in Eng<lb break="no"/>land the better for the people of Canada— 
     <lb/>
     that this question of Federation, and the 
     <lb/>
     question of defence, and the question of 
     <lb/>
     American reciprocity, should be urged on the 
     <lb/>
     British Government without one hour's un<lb break="no"/>necessary delay. He protests that on the 
     <lb/>
     fate of this measure some of the most vital 
     <lb/>
     interests of the province depend, and yet he 
     <lb/>
     will not have it until months of valuable time 
     <lb/>
     have been lost, until the country has been 
     <lb/>
     forced to pass through all the turmoil and 
     <lb/>
 
            <pb n="990" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0990.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">990</fw>
               
     confusion and uncertainty of a general elec<lb break="no"/>tion, and until a new Parliament has been 
     <lb/>
     summoned and given its sanction to the 
     <lb/>
     measure. And the most curious part of it is, 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman does not want the 
     <lb/>
     appeal now—he will take it by and by. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME2">HON. J. H. CAMERON</persName>—My argument 
     <lb/>
     was entirely the contrary. I said there should 
     <lb/>
     not be a day's delay in appealing to the coun<lb break="no"/>try ; that as the Government had told us 
     <lb/>
     they were to meet Parliament in July, there 
     <lb/>
     would be no reason to prevent this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment being dissolved, and a new Parliament 
     <lb/>
     being summoned by that time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Yes ; but the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman most inconsistently told us 
     <lb/>
     in the same breath that the deputation of 
     <lb/>
     Ministers must go at once to England. Does 
     <lb/>
     he fancy a general election would be brought 
     <lb/>
     on during the absence from the country of 
     <lb/>
     the leading members of the Administration ? 
     <lb/>
     If he does, I tell him he is mistaken. But 
     <lb/>
     does the honorable gentleman pretend there 
     <lb/>
     is any doubt as to the feeling of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada on this measure ? Not at all. On 
     <lb/>
     the contrary, he is quite confident that if sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the people there would be a vast 
     <lb/>
     majority in its favor—a complete sweep over 
     <lb/>
     the country. Nay, strange enough, he gives 
     <lb/>
     this very fact of the certainty of approval as 
     <lb/>
     the chief argument in favor of an election. 
     <lb/>
     He says, " Send it to the people ; there is no 
     <lb/>
     fear of the result. The very men who now 
     <lb/>
     sit here to-day, or others who think as they 
     <lb/>
     do, will come back and adopt it ! " Could 
     <lb/>
     anything more absurd than this be imagined ? 
     <lb/>
     Is not the argument clearly in the opposite 
     <lb/>
     direction ? Should not the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman have said—" The people approve of 
     <lb/>
     this measure ; their representatives approve 
     <lb/>
     of it ; if you had an election, the same men 
     <lb/>
     would be sent back, or others like them ; a 
     <lb/>
     vast sum would be uselessly expended ; much 
     <lb/>
     valuable time would be lost ; partisan broils 
     <lb/>
     might be revived ; don't, then, lose a moment, 
     <lb/>
     but put it through at once." (Cheers.) But 
     <lb/>
     I confess the honorable gentleman did sug<lb break="no"/>gest one argument in favor of an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the people, and a very strange one it certain<lb break="no"/>ly was coming from such a quarter. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel says he has not a doubt as to 
     <lb/>
     the feelings of the people of Upper Canada ; 
     <lb/>
     he is quite certain that an almost unanimous 
     <lb/>
     verdict would be rendered by them in favor 
     <lb/>
     of this measure. But he says he has some 
     <lb/>
     doubts as to what the people of Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da might think about it ; they might possi<lb break="no"/>bly like to give the measure a death-blow, 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
            
     and he is in favor of giving them a chance to 
     <lb/>
     do it ! Now, sir, I did think that a very 
     <lb/>
     peculiar style of argument from one so en<lb break="no"/>amoured of this measure, and from one, too, 
     <lb/>
     who has been supposed not to be very closely 
     <lb/>
     allied with the majority of Lower Canadians 
     <lb/>
     on matters of public policy, and especially on 
     <lb/>
     this particular question. (Hear, hear.) Who 
     <lb/>
     could have expected to find the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel assuming the <hi rendition="simple:italic">rôle</hi> of an exponent of 
     <lb/>
     popular feeling in Lower Canada, and con<lb break="no"/>stituting himself the guardian of the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the French-Canadians ? (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     did strike me that the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     might very properly have left the Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians to speak for themselves. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     In view of the vote recorded on this measure 
     <lb/>
     at our last sitting—considering the fact that 
     <lb/>
     a majority of twelve on the Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     vote was then recorded in favor of the meas<lb break="no"/>ure, I do think the hon. member for Peel might 
     <lb/>
     have been well content to accept the votes of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadian representatives as the best 
     <lb/>
     index to Lower Canadian feeling. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) There were three Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     members absent, on Saturday morning, from 
     <lb/>
     the division ; but had they been here, there 
     <lb/>
     would have been a majority of thirteen on 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Canada vote in favor of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—No ; Messrs. DUN<lb break="no"/>KIN, ABBOTT and DAOUST would have voted 
     <lb/>
     against it.

     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —I believe Mr.

     <lb/>
     for the honorable member for Argenteuil 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. ABBOTT), I see he is now in his 
     <lb/>
     place, and can answer for himself. With Mr. 
     <lb/>
     DUNKIN voting against the measure, there 
     <lb/>
     would have been a Lower Canada majority of 
     <lb/>
     thirteen in its favor. (Hear, hear.)

     five, the one argument of the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Peel in demanding the turmoil and 
     <lb/>
     delay and expense of a general election was 
     <lb/>
     his tenderness as to the feelings of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians. (Hear, hear.) And yet, sir, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel has seen the sort 
     <lb/>
     of agitation that is being carried on against 
     <lb/>
     this measure in Lower Canada ; he has card 
     <lb/>
     the way in which petitions against it have 
     <lb/>
     been concocted in this character, and sent 
     <lb/>
     broadcast over this country with urgent en<lb break="no"/>treaties to have them signed by men, women 
     <lb/>
     and children ; he has seen these petitions 
     <lb/>
     come back here with hardly a genuine signa<lb break="no"/>ture appended to them ; he has heard the ar<lb break="no"/>guments and the cries on which this agitation 
     <lb/>
     has been based. (Hear, hear.) I ask him 
     <lb/>
     if it is to aid and strengthen such an agitation 
     <lb/>
     against this measure that he demands a gen<lb break="no"/>eral election ? I ask him if there has been 
     <lb/>
     one argument against the scheme which, in 
     <lb/>
     his opinion, supplied any reasonable founda<lb break="no"/>tion for the agitation sought to be excited in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada ; if there has been one cry at<lb break="no"/>tempted to be raised against it that honestly 
     <lb/>
     went to the true merits of the question ? If 
     <lb/>
     there has been, I have yet to hear it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, the most curious 
     <lb/>
     part of the proposal of the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel is the attitude he would have us oc<lb break="no"/>cupy in addressing the Queen. We have 
     <lb/>
     already adopted an Address praying Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty to pass an Imperial Statute giving 
     <lb/>
     effect to the resolutions of the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence ; and the hon. member for Peel now asks 
     <lb/>
     that we shall pass a second Address praying 
     <lb/>
     that the said Imperial Act shall be subject to 
     <lb/>
     the approval, and shall not be law until it 
     <lb/>
     obtains the approval, of their high mightinesses 
     <lb/>
     the one hundred and thirty gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     may happen to sit in the House of Assembly 
     <lb/>
     of the next Canadian Parliament. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) He would have us approach the 
     <lb/>
     Throne saying—" May it please Your Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty—Here is the Constitution which has 
     <lb/>
     been adopted by the Governments of the five 
     <lb/>
     British American Provinces ; we declare to 
     <lb/>
     you that this is the new Constitution we want 
     <lb/>
     for British America ; we pray Your Majesty 
     <lb/>
     to give effect to it ; we pray that the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament may pass an act enforcing this new 
     <lb/>
     Constitution on all these provinces, and that 
     <lb/>
     Your Majesty will assent to it. But at the 
     <lb/>
     same time we ask Your Majesty to do this 
     <lb/>
     only on one condition, namely, that the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Canada—not the present one, but the 
     <lb/>
     next Legislature that may be chosen—shall 
     <lb/>
     have the opportunity of criticising and dis<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
       secting the work of the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and of kicking Your Majesty's Bill 
     <lb/>
     out of the chamber on the first day it meets." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and great laughter.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel will permit me to tell him 
     <lb/>
     that if he fancies this would be a decorous 
     <lb/>
     mode of approaching the Sovereign, he has a 
     <lb/>
     strange idea of the respect due from loyal 
     <lb/>
     subjects to the chief magistrate of the Empire 
     <lb/>
     which it is their happiness to form a part. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And I further tell this honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman and any other honorable 
     <lb/>
     member who may think with him, that if 
     <lb/>
     they expect honorable gentlemen to go to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government and say—" We ask you 
     <lb/>
     to take all the trouble of preparing this mea<lb break="no"/>sure—to assume it as your own—and to carry 
     <lb/>
     it through both Houses of Parliament against 
     <lb/>
     all opposition ; but at the same time we ask 
     <lb/>
     you to put in a clause that the Legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Canada shall be above the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, shall be above the Sovereign, and shall 
     <lb/>
     deal with your Act just as it pleases,"—then, 
     <lb/>
     I tell the House that parties must be found 
     <lb/>
     to convey that message, who are destitute of 
     <lb/>
     self-respect, and who have not a proper sense 
     <lb/>
     of the respect due to those holding the highest 
     <lb/>
     dignities of the realm. (Cheers.) I do say 
     <lb/>
     that a more direct insult to the Crown could 
     <lb/>
     not be offered than that now proposed by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel. But another 
     <lb/>
     most singular part of the proposal of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel, is that while he 
     <lb/>
     is trying to pass this vote of want of confi<lb break="no"/>dence in the Government—for if it is not 
     <lb/>
     that, it would, if carried, be at least a direct 
     <lb/>
     defeat of the policy of the Government—he 
     <lb/>
     professes at the same moment an immense 
     <lb/>
     desire to strengthen the hands of the Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration. (Hear, hear.) He fancies, or pro<lb break="no"/>fesses to fancy, that if this motion of his were 
     <lb/>
     carried, the Government would take their dose 
     <lb/>
     placidly, and go meekly to England with the 
     <lb/>
     record of their defeat in their hands. He 
     <lb/>
     tells us in effect,—" I don't want you, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding this vote, to hesitate about 
     <lb/>
     going to England—not at all. Your presence is 
     <lb/>
     wanted in England as quickly as possible. You 
     <lb/>
     ought to go immediately ; you ought to talk 
     <lb/>
     strongly to the Imperial Government ; you 
     <lb/>
     ought to tell them how they are to settle the 
     <lb/>
     defence question, how the reciprocity ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and so on. You must speak for the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada in a bold and firm tone, that 
     <lb/>
     will do justice to the people of this country." 
     <lb/>
     It is the honorable gentleman's idea that we 
     <lb/>
     should go very strong to England, and his 
     <lb/>
     way of strengthening us is by passing upon 
     <lb/>
   
            <pb n="992" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0992.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">992</fw>
               
     our policy a direct vote of censure the hour  
     <lb/>
     before we start. (Hear, hear.) He wants us 
     <lb/>
     to go home strong—with an Address to the 
     <lb/>
     Sovereign in one hand, and a defeat by the 
     <lb/>
     people's representatives in the other. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If the hon. gentleman thinks he is 
     <lb/>
     sustaining the Administration by his present 
     <lb/>
     motion, I can only say that I for one do not 
     <lb/>
     thank him for his support. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman may carry his resolution 
     <lb/>
     if he can, but I tell him that in that case no 
     <lb/>
     mission will go to England with any such in<lb break="no"/>sulting message from this Government as now 
     <lb/>
     constituted. (Hear, hear.) The House may 
     <lb/>
     perfectly comprehend that if any Address is 
     <lb/>
     to be carried to the Queen by the present 
     <lb/>
     Government, it must be the Address we have 
     <lb/>
     submitted to Parliament. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON) 
     <lb/>
     says that we are attempting to dictate to the 
     <lb/>
     House—that we are endeavoring to take away 
     <lb/>
     from them the rightful powers of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this Legislature. We do nothing of 
     <lb/>
     the kind. The members of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
      may act as they deem right ; they may reject 
     <lb/>
     our Address, or amend it, or couple it with any<lb break="no"/>thing they please—all we say is, that we can<lb break="no"/>not be the bearers of a message shaped in the 
     <lb/>
     way the hon. member for Peel proposes. But 
     <lb/>
     if this House says there shall be an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the people, it will get an appeal to the people 
     <lb/>
     at once—to-morrow—(hear, hear)—and that 
     <lb/>
     without the mockery of going home to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government with an Address asking 
     <lb/>
     in one breath that the bill may be passed into 
     <lb/>
     law, and in the next that it may not be passed 
     <lb/>
     into law. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel has said that the legislatures of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces have gone, or are going, to the 
     <lb/>
     people—and why not we ? The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     ought to know that the other legislatures were 
     <lb/>
     in a different position from that which we 
     <lb/>
     occupied. As regards the New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, its term expired, I think, in May 
     <lb/>
     —they had not been for four years before 
     <lb/>
     their constituents—they were going soon at 
     <lb/>
     any rate, and they came to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that it was well to go at once. And so also 
     <lb/>
     it was in Newfoundland—the period when a 
     <lb/>
     dissolution must take place was rapidly ap<lb break="no"/>proaching, and they took the same course. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman says that if the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature of Nova Scotia do not approve of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions, the Government will advise a 
     <lb/>
     dissolution. So probably would we under 
     <lb/>
     such circumstances. If this Legislature had 
     <lb/>
     not approved of the scheme, we would un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly, with His Excellency's assent, have 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
      appealed to the country against the decision 
     <lb/>
     of this House. And otherwise what necessity 
     <lb/>
     is there for a direct appeal to the people ? 
     <lb/>
     Here we have been discussing the question for 
     <lb/>
     years— 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Oh ! oh ! 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman may cry " Oh ! oh !" but I tell him 
     <lb/>that the people throughout the country gener<lb break="no"/>ally understand this question just as well as 
     <lb/>the members of the Legislature. Those who 
     <lb/>are most difficult to be made to understand 
     <lb/>are those who don't want to understand.  
     <lb/>Even the honorable member for Cornwall 
     <lb/>once understood this question, and if he does 
     <lb/>not now it is because he has forgotten it. 
     <lb/>(Laughter.) If there were any doubt about 
     <lb/>public feeling, there might be propriety in 
     <lb/>going to the people. But is there any doubt 
     <lb/>about it ? I am not opposing the honorable 
     <lb/>gentleman's resolution on constitutional 
     <lb/>grounds. I am not denying the rights of the 
     <lb/>people ; if I had any doubt whatever about 
     <lb/>what would be the verdict of the people, I 
     <lb/>should be the first to say that we ought to go 
     <lb/>to the people. But it is simply because I am 
     <lb/>satisfied there would be a sweeping verdict of 
     <lb/>the people in favor of the measure, that I 
     <lb/>think it unnecessary to take it to the country. 
     <lb/>What would be the verdict of the people may 
     <lb/>be judged from what has been the vote of 
     <lb/>their representatives here, who are responsible 
     <lb/>to them. Never has there been such a ver<lb break="no"/>dict in this Parliament on any matter of grave 
     <lb/>importance as we have had in favor of this 
     <lb/>measure—in the Upper House a majority of 
     <lb/>three to one, and in the Lower House also a 
     <lb/>majority as nearly as possible of three to one. 
     <lb/>And of the six honorable members who were 
     <lb/>absent from the vote—the SPEAKER, and the 
     <lb/>five honorable members who were absent—five 
     <lb/>would have gone for it and only one against 
     <lb/>it—the House being divided, 94 for to 36 
     <lb/>against. And as regards those 36, more than 
     <lb/>one-half of them have risen in this House and 
     <lb/>declared themselves in favor of the general 
     <lb/>principle, and only opposed to some of the 
     <lb/>details. I say there never has been such a 
     <lb/>unanimous verdict from any Parliament in 
     <lb/>favor of any great constitutional change. And 
     <lb/>since the policy of the Government has been 
     <lb/>announced, no fewer than 50 out of our 
     <lb/>130 constituencies have been appealed to 
     <lb/>by elections, for the one House or the other 
     <lb/>—and in the whole of these, only four can 
     <lb/>didates offered themselves in opposition to 
     <lb/>this policy, and but two got elected—and 
     <lb/>I think one of those two did actually vote 
     <lb/>

     in favor of the measure. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     am told that the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     Wentworth (Mr. RYMAL) made a statement 
     <lb/>
     to which I would call his attention—as I 
     <lb/>
     certainly did not notice that he made it— 
     <lb/>
     while addressing the House. I was remark<lb break="no"/>ing that I had not heard one member from 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada declare that a large majority 
     <lb/>
     of his constituents were not in favor of this 
     <lb/>
     measure, and I was told that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber had stated so with reference to his

     declare that they have not the slighest 
     <lb/>
     doubt as to the feeling of their constituents 
     <lb/>
     —that it is strongly in favor of the measure. 
     <lb/>
     I repeat, then, that I have not as yet heard 
     <lb/>
     one hon. member declare that his constitu<lb break="no"/>ency was opposed to this scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RYMA1">MR. RYMAL</persName>—With reference to the 
     <lb/>
     testimony of the hon. member for Burling<lb break="no"/>ton division (Hon. Mr. BULL) and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Hamilton (Mr. MAGILL), per<lb break="no"/>mit me to say that I know more of the South 
     <lb/>
     Riding of Wentworth than either one of those 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen. Neither of them has ever 
     <lb/>
     had the confidence of the electors of South 
     <lb/>
     Wentworth. One of them was in a minority 
     <lb/>
     there, last fall, of 300. The other tried it 
     <lb/>
     some years ago, and had not the shadow of a 
     <lb/>
     chance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—That may be true. 
     <lb/>
     But the hon. gentleman should have stated 
     <lb/>
     this also, that Dr. SMITH,the opponent of Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. BULL, declared he was in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     general principles of this measure, and that 
     <lb/>
     if the details were satisfactory, he would go 
     <lb/>
     for it. So that in fact both the candidates 
     <lb/>
     for that constituency, including the whole 
     <lb/>
     of Wentworth and the city of Hamilton, 
     <lb/>
     declared in favor of the policy of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:RYMA1">MR. RYMAL</persName>—I beg to say that I have 
     <lb/>
     heard Dr. SMITH say—not once, or twice, but 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     on different occasions—that he did not be<lb break="no"/>lieve this scheme would work well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—That was the 
     <lb/>
     reason of his defeat, I suppose. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—It is quite possible 
     <lb/>
     that he may have said so since his defeat, 
     <lb/>
     but I can only say that I conversed with 
     <lb/>
     Dr. SMITH myself while he was a candidate, 
     <lb/>
     and heard a very different opinion from him. 
     <lb/>
     But I think it ill became the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to speak so disparagingly of the 
     <lb/>
     testimony of gentlemen as to the feeling of 
     <lb/>
     the county, simply because they were not 
     <lb/>
     strong in a particular contest. When he 
     <lb/>
     remembers how hard a fight he himself had 
     <lb/>
     at last election, and that he was only elected 
     <lb/>
     by a very small majority, he was hardly in a 
     <lb/>
     position to throw discredit on such a score 
     <lb/>
     on the statement of hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     have just come from the people, and, after 
     <lb/>
     putting the measure fairly and squarely 
     <lb/>
     before the electors, have got an almost 
     <lb/>
     unanimous verdict in its favor. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Hamilton polled an immense 
     <lb/>
     majority, and it was not right for my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend to indulge in a sneer 
     <lb/>
     because he may have been in a min<lb break="no"/>ority on a previous occasion. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, I might detain the House 
     <lb/>
     much longer in replying to what fell from 
     <lb/>
     honorable members who have spoken during 
     <lb/>
     this discussion. But I do not desire to keep 
     <lb/>
     the House from the vote. I would simply 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the members of this House, that if 
     <lb/>
     ever there could be a case made out for 
     <lb/>
     action—immediate action—it has been made 
     <lb/>
     out with reference to this measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—After its rejection 
     <lb/>
    below? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—That does not 
     <lb/>affect us.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—It affects the pos<lb break="no"/>sibility of immediate action. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     will soon know whether or not we can get 
     <lb/>
     immediate action. He must recollect, that 
     <lb/>
     although the New Brunswick elections have 
     <lb/>
     apparently gone against Confederation, there 
     <lb/>
     is still a considerable number of members 
     <lb/>
     returned there in favor of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and that there is another large party who are 
     <lb/>
     not opposed to union, but only object to 
     <lb/>
     some of the details. And there is this to be 
     <lb/>
     considered also. It was presented there in 
     <lb/>
     a very different light from that in which 
     <lb/>
     it comes before us. We have been consid<lb break="no"/>ering this question for many years. There 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="994" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0994.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">994</fw>
            
     is not a point that can be taken against it 
     <lb/>
     which has not been thoroughly sifted before 
     <lb/>
     the country. We are, therefore, in a differ<lb break="no"/>ent position, and there is this hanging over 
     <lb/>
     us besides—as stated by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel—we cannot go back, we must go 
     <lb/>
     forward—we must have some decision on this 
     <lb/>
     question—we cannot let things rest as they 
     <lb/>
     are. lt is of no use for the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON) to 
     <lb/>
     tell us that matters can go on as they have 
     <lb/>
     been doing for many years past. That was 
     <lb/>
     not the opinion of the hon. gentleman when 
     <lb/>
     he came here in 1862. (Hear, hear.) He 
     <lb/>
     came as a supporter of the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     Government then in existence, and yet 
     <lb/>
     the first vote he gave was in condemn<lb break="no"/>ation of his own friends, because they 
     <lb/>
     did not bring in a Ministerial measure 
     <lb/>
     to settle this question. If he looks at 
     <lb/>
     his own speech on that occasion, denouncing 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General West and his 
     <lb/>
     colleagues, because they would not give 
     <lb/>
     representation by population, and because 
     <lb/>
     the feeling was so strong that not a moment 
     <lb/>
     should be lost in dealing with the question 
     <lb/>
     —he would find there an answer to his ar<lb break="no"/>guments now, when he tells us this thing 
     <lb/>
     may be shoved aside, and matters go on as 
     <lb/>
     before. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I did not state 
     <lb/>
     at the time referred to that there was any 
     <lb/>
     danger of revolution, or anything of that 
     <lb/>
     kind. I urged the question as a measure of 
     <lb/>
     justice for Upper Canada against my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friends who were not in favor of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—He urged it upon 
     <lb/>
     his friends on that occasion to turn them 
     <lb/>
     out, because they would not move; and now 
     <lb/>
     he urges it in the very opposite direction— 
     <lb/>
     namely, to turn them out because they do 
     <lb/>
     move. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man would allow me to make a remark, I 
     <lb/>
     would say it appears to me the fallacy he has 
     <lb/>
     fallen into is in assuming that this measure is 
     <lb/>
     identical with the measure of representation 
     <lb/>
     by population, for which he has been agitat<lb break="no"/>ing the country for some year past. It is 
     <lb/>
     not the same question. The question of 
     <lb/>
     Federation or Confederation has not been 
     <lb/>
     before the country. It was not before the 
     <lb/>
     country at the last general election. He 
     <lb/>
     knows full well that the party, of which he 
     <lb/>
     is a distinguished member, has pronounced 
     <lb/>
     over and over again, and through his own 
     <lb/>
     mouth, against this scheme of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     He knows that the Reform Convention of 
     <lb/>
     1859 did so.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—No, it did not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I say it did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—Get the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, and prove it if you can. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—What were the 
     <lb/>
     facts? The Government of that day had 
     <lb/>
     proposed a Confederation of all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     as their remedy for the Canadian difficulty. 
     <lb/>
     The Liberal party did not accept that. If 
     <lb/>
     they had done so, the probability is that you 
     <lb/>
     would have had Confederation long ago, 
     <lb/>
     with the consent of the Lower Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     But the Reform Convention declared it was 
     <lb/>
     no remedy. It is true they put in a saving 
     <lb/>
     clause, that at some future day, in some 
     <lb/>
     remote contingency, after the settlement of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian difficulty, but not as a means 
     <lb/>
     of settling it, the Federation of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces might be taken up. But I merely 
     <lb/>
     rose to point out to my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     fallacy into which he has fallen—and it is a 
     <lb/>
     very close one—in assuming that this mea<lb break="no"/>sure is identical with the measure for which 
     <lb/>
     he agitated the country so long, and which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Ontario advo<lb break="no"/>cated on the occasion to which he refers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I think the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has risen for a very poor purpose. 
     <lb/>
     And in place of accepting his explanation 
     <lb/>
     as correct, I dissent from it toto caelo. The 
     <lb/>
     position of the matter is quite the opposite 
     <lb/>
     of what he states. He says this is a different 
     <lb/>
     thing altogether. I totally deny that it is. 
     <lb/>
     I say this is simply what we asked for, only 
     <lb/>
     in another form. The measure we asked for 
     <lb/>
     was representation by population. We got 
     <lb/>
     that. (Hear, hear.) And the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is the last man to object to this, which 
     <lb/>
     is the very basis on which he agreed to go 
     <lb/>
     into the BROWN—DORION Administration— 
     <lb/>
     representation by population being the basis, 
     <lb/>
     accompanied by such checks and guarantees 
     <lb/>
     as might be shown to be necessary. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The hon. gentleman has stated that 
     <lb/>
     I have spoken against Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. He will turn to no speech of 
     <lb/>
     mine since I entered Parliament in 
     <lb/>
     which, when I made any allusion to 
     <lb/>
     the matter, I did not take care expressly 
     <lb/>
     to state that I regarded a union of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces as the grand future destiny of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces. But to those who offered 
     <lb/>
     us Confederation of the provinces  a pre<lb break="no"/>sent remedy for all the evils we suffered, I 
     <lb/>
     said I would not accept that. But I took 
     <lb/>
     care to say nothing directly against it, what<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="995" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0995.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">995</fw>
     ever others may have said or written. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, I doubted whether we had 
     <lb/>
     strength enough to assume the burdens it 
     <lb/>
     would throw upon us. In the next place, I 
     <lb/>
     knew little about the sentiments of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, how they would regard it. 
     <lb/>
     And I thought it likely that it would take 
     <lb/>
     years to accomplish. I would not consent, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that any party should make this 
     <lb/>
     a stalking horse, and waste time in keeping 
     <lb/>
     us negotiating between the Imperial and the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Governments, so as to stave off 
     <lb/>
     the practicable remedy which we sought. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—That is what you 
     <lb/>
     are doing now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     is entirely mistaken. He will find there is 
     <lb/>
     no member of this Government who has any 
     <lb/>
     idea of shirking this question for an hour. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And he will see that that is 
     <lb/>
     the very basis of our present policy. In the 
     <lb/>
     original negotiations for this Coalition, 
     <lb/>
     while I admitted that it was a good thing 
     <lb/>
     and a desirable thing that we should look for 
     <lb/>
     the future of these provinces in the direction 
     <lb/>
     of provincial union, yet I contended there 
     <lb/>
     was a present remedy which we should have 
     <lb/>
     and could have of our own motion, until the 
     <lb/>
     other was obtained. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     will admit that we have been wonderfully, 
     <lb/>
     unexpectedly successful in the policy we 
     <lb/>
     initiated in July last; and I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say, as I have always been prepared to say, 
     <lb/>
     that if practicable, this measure is a better 
     <lb/>
     one than the smaller scheme. But so far 
     <lb/>
     from its being a different remedy from ours, 
     <lb/>
     I say it is but an extension of our plan— 
     <lb/>
     that we who have contended for represent<lb break="no"/>ation by population for so many years, are 
     <lb/>
     getting all that we asked and something more. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is true that our Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada friends have obtained security for 
     <lb/>
     their local institutions. For my part, I am 
     <lb/>
     glad they have got it. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     have always been willing they should have 
     <lb/>
     it. I can appeal to my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Kamouraska (Hon. Mr. CHAPAIS) whether 
     <lb/>
     I have not always yearly, for thirteen years 
     <lb/>
     past, said to him that I was willing to con<lb break="no"/>sider the position of Lower Canada with 
     <lb/>
     reference to her local institutions, and to 
     <lb/>
     give any protection for them which might 
     <lb/>
     be thought to be reasonable. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And I say this is an admirable compromise 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances—and I say it will 
     <lb/>
      be a sad day for the people of Canada if 
     <lb/>
     anything should happen to defeat this mea<lb break="no"/>sure. I do say that the man who looks 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          
     back upon the last twelve or fifteen years, 
     <lb/>
     and the agitation we have gone through, 
     <lb/>
     and who would risk throwing us back into 
     <lb/>
     that state again, is not—to use the lan<lb break="no"/>guage of the hon. member for Peel—a true 
     <lb/>
     lover of his country. (Cheers.) After such 
     <lb/>
     an immense vote—three-fourths of both 
     <lb/>
     branches of the Legislature—in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the measure, I look upon it as a most 
     <lb/>
     wanton attempt on the part of the minority 
     <lb/>to endeavor to have it brought into jeopardy 
     <lb/>by the sectional issues, and the various side 
     <lb/>issues which might be raised in different 
     <lb/>parts of the country, so as to make the result 
     <lb/>of a general election falsely appear to be a 
     <lb/>disapproval of the measure on the part of 
     <lb/>the country. Had any one risen in this 
     <lb/>House at the beginning of last session, and 
     <lb/>proposed this measure—and if it had been 
     <lb/>found that all the Upper Canadian members 
     <lb/>of this Chamber were in favor of it but 
     <lb/>eight, while the Lower Canadian members 
     <lb/>were in favor of it by a majority of thirteen, 
     <lb/>and that three-fourths of the Upper House 
     <lb/>were in its favor—I ask hon. gentlemen if 
     <lb/>the man would not have been regarded as 
     <lb/>insane who would have proposed that it 
     <lb/>should not be put through at once, but 
     <lb/>deferred for a general election? (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) And when the House gave its 
     <lb/>sanction last session to the Government 
     <lb/>going on with this project, and submitting 
     <lb/>a scheme worthy of adoption—I ask hon.  
     <lb/>members if they ever expected we could 
     <lb/>present a measure which would carry a vote 
     <lb/>of three-fourths of both branches of the 
     <lb/>Legislature? (Hear, hear.) We have been 
     <lb/>unexpectedly successful. And as to con<lb break="no"/>sulting the people, I tell hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>that the people will laugh to scorn their 
     <lb/>pretended zeal for popular rights. The 
     <lb/>people want the kernel and not the shell. 
     <lb/>They want not, for the sake of a constitutional 
     <lb/>form, to risk the success of this measure—to 
     <lb/>risk the breaking up of the combination 
     <lb/>formed to carry it—and to risk the bringing 
     <lb/>back of all those discords and difficulties 
     <lb/>from which, by the maturing of this scheme, 
     <lb/>they thought we had happily escaped. 
     <lb/>(Cheers.)

     <persName ref="pers:CAME2">HON. J. H. CAMERON</persName>—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has misrepresented my position in 
     <lb/>
     this matter. I have voted for the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions on which an Address is to be based, and 
     <lb/>this resolution is simply in amendment to 
     <lb/>the motion for the appointment of a com<lb break="no"/>mittee to draft that Address, and conveys no

     any way with Ministers going home with 
     <lb/>
     those resolutions—a copy of which is already 
     <lb/>
     before the Imperial Parliament—in their 
     <lb/>
     hands. The hon. gentleman must have mis<lb break="no"/>understood what I stated. I ask only that 
     <lb/>
     the people have an opportunity of doing that 
     <lb/>
     which I have done myself—that is, to vote 
     <lb/>
     for the measure. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman says he does not thank me for my 
     <lb/>
     support. Sir, that hon gentleman personally 
     <lb/>
     has never had my support. It is not to him 
     <lb/>
     I give my support, but to the Government 
     <lb/>
     as a whole, and to the cause which has called 
     <lb/>
     it into existence. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     knows well my political views have been so 
     <lb/>
     little in accordance with his, that nothing 
     <lb/>
     but the importance of this movement would 
     <lb/>
     have put it in his power to make me such a 
     <lb/>
     taunt, and that he has no occasion whatever 
     <lb/>
     to thank me for my support, which is given 
     <lb/>
     not because he is in the Ministry, but in 
     <lb/>
     spite of his being in that position. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—I propose con<lb break="no"/>fining my observations to the motion now 
     <lb/>
     in your hands, Mr. SPEAKER. First, as to 
     <lb/>
     the point on which the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford allowed me to interrupt him. 
     <lb/>
     I charged the hon. gentleman with assum<lb break="no"/>ing that the question now before the House 
     <lb/>
     was specifically the one on which he agitated 
     <lb/>
     the country for several years, and upon 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. member for North Ontario 
     <lb/>
     voted in 1862. I happen to have placed in 
     <lb/>
     my hands the report of what took place 
     <lb/>
     when the subject of a Federal union was 
     <lb/>
     before the House, in 1858. Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     GALT having put the resolution before 
     <lb/>
     the House, respecting the Federation of 
     <lb/>
     the British North American Provinces, Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. BROWN moved his standing motion 
     <lb/>
     respecting representation according to popu<lb break="no"/>lation, as an amendment to it. There he put 
     <lb/>
     the two propositions in distinct juxtaposition, 
     <lb/>
     and yet to-night he endeavors to convince 
     <lb/>
     the House that this measure is substantially 
     <lb/>
     the measure which he was then contending 
     <lb/>
     for—endeavors to show insincerity on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the honorable member for North On<lb break="no"/>tario, because he voted against his own 
     <lb/>
     friends, in 1862, on representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and now votes against this measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I am sure my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend does not wish to misrepresent; but 
     <lb/>
     I think he will find that that motion was 
     <lb/>
     proposed, and that there were two other 
     <lb/>
     amendments which were voted down. I 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     recollect that at the close of my speech I 
     <lb/>
     said I wanted representation by population— 
     <lb/>
     I am willing to take it alone; I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to take it with a Federal union; I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to take it any way so that we get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> —The honorable 
     <lb/>
    gentleman is confounding what occurred in 
     <lb/>1856 with what occurred in 1858. In 1856 
     <lb/>he did signify his willingness to accept the 
     <lb/>proposition of a Canadian Federation, if it 
     <lb/>was concurred in by any considerable num<lb break="no"/>ber of the representatives from Lower 
     <lb/>Canada. But what I now allude to is what 
     <lb/>took place in 1858, when, instead of accept<lb break="no"/>ing Hon. Mr. GALT'S proposition to Federate 
     <lb/>all the provinces, he put a motion in amend<lb break="no"/>ment to it, showing that in 1858, as in 1859, 
     <lb/>he was not willing to consider that question 
     <lb/>as a means of settling the Canadian difficulty. 
     <lb/>But I think the honorable gentleman, though 
     <lb/>he was more or less successful in answer<lb break="no"/>ing the honorable member for Peel, utterly 
     <lb/>failed to meet the very cogent reasoning of 
     <lb/>my honorable friend from North Ontario. 
     <lb/>I hold as strongly as any member of this 
     <lb/>House to the doctrine of representation as 
     <lb/>contradistinguished from the doctrine of 
     <lb/>delegation. We are here commissioned by 
     <lb/>our constituents to do all that may be done 
     <lb/>under the Constitution under which we are 
     <lb/>sent here to legislate. But I hold that the 
     <lb/>change of the Constitution is something 
     <lb/>beyond our functions; that the represent<lb break="no"/>ative elected to administer the existing 
     <lb/>Constitution has no right to vote for the 
     <lb/>subversion of that Constitution. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) That is the doctrine which I hold, 
     <lb/>and I think honorable gentlemen will find 
     <lb/>it exceedingly difficult to controvert it. 
     <lb/>Then it has been said that there can be 
     <lb/>no possible occasion of appealing to the 
     <lb/>people, for they have already been appealed 
     <lb/>to and expressed their approval of the 
     <lb/>scheme. I do not know how many consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies have been appealed to since June 
     <lb/>last. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>
     AN HON. MEMBER—Fifty or sixty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Well, fifty or sixty. 
     <lb/>
     But the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     has referred to the Hon. Mr. BULL as being 
     <lb/>
     elected to support this measure, and a little 
     <lb/>
     further on he spoke of his opponent, Dr. 
     <lb/>
     SMITH, and said that he too was in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme generally, but that there might 
     <lb/>
     be some of the details of which, when it came 
     <lb/>
     out, he could not approve, thus letting out 
     <lb/>
     that the details of the scheme were not 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="997" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0997.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">997</fw>
          
     before the people at all. When my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from South Oxford went to his own 
     <lb/>
     constituency for reëlection, were any of the 
     <lb/>
     details before the people? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The general project of Federation was before 
     <lb/>
     the people, though prominence was then 
     <lb/>
     given chiefly to the lesser scheme of a Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Federation, but none of the details were 
     <lb/>
     known. He surely will not argue from the 
     <lb/>
     result of that election or of any of the elec<lb break="no"/>tions, including those for the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council, except perhaps that for the city 
     <lb/>
     of Hamilton and that of the Hon. Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General, which occurred after the publication 
     <lb/>
     of the resolutions, that the people have voted 
     <lb/>
     with a knowledge of the details of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure. These elections, therefore, prove no 
     <lb/>
     more that the people are in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, than the election of the MACDONALD- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     SICOTTE Government in l862—a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment formed upon the principle of retrench<lb break="no"/>ment, pledged to the double majority system, 
     <lb/>
     and who made opposition to representation 
     <lb/>
     by population a close question, proved that 
     <lb/>
     the people were in favor of that system, or 
     <lb/>
     of making opposition to representation by 
     <lb/>
     population a close question. Then, sir, 
     <lb/>
     there is one other point to which I wish to 
     <lb/>
     refer. The Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West, in the course of his conversation with 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for North Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     said that the people of all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     were against a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—I did 
     <lb/>
     not say so. The hon. gentleman was speak<lb break="no"/>ing of the different provinces as represented 
     <lb/>
     in the Quebec Conference. The delegates 
     <lb/>
     were all opposed to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, at all events, said this, that a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive union could not be carried. I should 
     <lb/>
     like to ask him what position it places him 
     <lb/>
     in as to political sagacity, to confess to-night 
     <lb/>
     that he has been wrong for the last twenty 
     <lb/>
     years. He has declared over and over again 
     <lb/>
     that he was in favor of a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
     At the very last meeting of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional committee, or of the Brown Com<lb break="no"/>mittee, as it has been called—a committee to 
     <lb/>
     which great importance has been attached, 
     <lb/>
     but which really possesses very little signifi<lb break="no"/>cance—last session, upon a motion for the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the report, that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     voted against Federation in every form. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—How 
     <lb/>
     does the hon. gentleman know that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
               
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—It was reported to 
     <lb/>
     the House, on the very day of the crisis which 
     <lb/>
     eventuated in the formation of this Coalition, 
     <lb/>
     that honorable gentleman voted in committee 
     <lb/>
     against the Federal principle, whether as ap<lb break="no"/>plied to Canada or to all the provinces, he 
     <lb/>
     being in favor of a legislative union. He, 
     <lb/>
     the leader of this House, who sets himself up 
     <lb/>
     as the most sagacious politician of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, who claims to be a leader of them, now 
     <lb/>admits that down to the 14th of June last, he 
     <lb/>himself was mistaken as to the possible mode 
     <lb/>in which a change of government could be 
     <lb/>effected in this province. (Hear, hear.) He 
     <lb/>was opposed to a Federal union, yet he now 
     <lb/>comes down as the leader of the Government, 
     <lb/>and says that it is absurd to talk of a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive union; that he has been altogether wrong, 
     <lb/>and that it is utterly impracticable to carry 
     <lb/>out the views he held down to the 14th of 
     <lb/>June last, and affirmed down to that very 
     <lb/>day. Well, sir, that is all that I rose to say 
     <lb/>—to say that the Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>Council has not really met the point raised 
     <lb/>by this motion; that there had been no ap<lb break="no"/>peal to the people in these elections on the 
     <lb/>details of this scheme; that it was not in the 
     <lb/>contemplation of the electors at the last gen<lb break="no"/>eral election; that the whole Liberal party 
     <lb/>were opposed to it as a means of settling the 
     <lb/>Canadian difficulty; that it was never brought 
     <lb/>forward until the crisis of June last; that the 
     <lb/>people have consequently had no opportunity 
     <lb/>of pronouncing upon it; and that we have no 
     <lb/>right to dispose of it finally without an appeal 
     <lb/>to the people, involving, as it does, a subver<lb break="no"/>sion of the Constitution. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAGI1">MR. MAGILL</persName>—I had no intention of 
     <lb/>
     speaking on this subject, had my name not 
     <lb/>
     been mentioned to-night by some of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen who have addressed the House. 
     <lb/>
     I have only to say that when the subject was 
     <lb/>
     brought before the electors of the city of 
     <lb/>
     Hamilton, there appeared to be but one opin<lb break="no"/>ion concerning it—they all seemed to be in 
     <lb/>
     favor of carrying out a Federal union. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I believe that the people were in 
     <lb/>
     favor of any change, and I think I would 
     <lb/>
     not be discharging my duty to my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents if I did not stand up in this House and 
     <lb/>
     state my opinions as I expressed them a short 
     <lb/>
     time ago to the electors. I think that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada were highly satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     the conduct of the public men of this coun<lb break="no"/>try; that they were proud of the manly, 
     <lb/>
     straightforward and self-denying spirit evinced 
     <lb/>
     by them in showing their willingness to set 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="998" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0998.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">998</fw>
            
     aside personal or party interests, and unite as 
     <lb/>
     one man for the common good of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. (Hear, hear.) They were willing to bury 
     <lb/>
     all past differences for the welfare and pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the country at large. (Hear.) My 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from South Wentworth (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     RYMAL) has spoken of the feeling among the 
     <lb/>
     people there. That honorable gentleman may 
     <lb/>
     perhaps know more of the people in that 
     <lb/>
     county than I do; but from what I know of 
     <lb/>
     them, I can say without any hesitation that 
     <lb/>
     the people there are strongly in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     union of all these provinces. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Then, as to the election of Hon. Mr. BULL, I 
     <lb/>
     think that nothing so much helped to secure 
     <lb/>
     his return as his promise to support the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in this scheme. And I think that it 
     <lb/>
     ill becomes the honorable member for South 
     <lb/>
     Wentworth, one of the eight Upper Canadians 
     <lb/>
     who oppose this scheme, to get up in this 
     <lb/>
     House and speak as he has done to-day. I 
     <lb/>
     believe that this scheme will be attended by 
     <lb/>
     the very best and most beneficial results. My 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from South Wentworth (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     RYMAL), in furnishing an illustration to prove 
     <lb/>
     the impropriety of the scheme of union, com<lb break="no"/>pared it to adding  joints to a fishing rod; but 
     <lb/>
     the comparison did not bear him out in his 
     <lb/>
      conclusions, as the people of Canada have at 
     <lb/>
     all times, and in every emergency, shown 
     <lb/>
     themselves to be possessed of that indomitable 
     <lb/>
     spirit which will never quail before a foe— 
     <lb/>
     and the union of such material cannot fail to 
     <lb/>
     give them increased power to resist aggression, 
     <lb/>
     and to maintain and hand down to posterity 
     <lb/>
     the rights and privileges which we so happily 
     <lb/>
     enjoy. (Hear, hear.) The fact of uniting 
     <lb/>
     strong men together is not going to make 
     <lb/>
     them any weaker. What is it that has given 
     <lb/>
     rise to the name England possesses all the 
     <lb/>
     world over? Why, it is union. That is the 
     <lb/>
     glory of the British Constitution. "Union 
     <lb/>
     is strength" the old maxim says, and I believe 
     <lb/>
     that it will prove so as regards the united 
     <lb/>
     Provinces of British North America. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, I regret 
     <lb/>
     that this resolution was not brought up 
     <lb/>
     sooner; however, I am glad that it is brought 
     <lb/>
     up now, for it will explain to outsiders the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which this Confederation scheme 
     <lb/>
     has been carried through this House. When 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Lower Provinces and of 
     <lb/>
     England observe the reluctance which the 
     <lb/>
     Government has to allowing the people an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to express themselves, by means 
     <lb/>
     of general elections, it will let them into the 
     <lb/>
     whole secret of  the manner in which the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     Government have obtained so large a vote for 
     <lb/>
     their scheme in the present Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, this is all the more 
     <lb/>
     important, because people who do not live in 
     <lb/>
     Canada cannot be expected to understand our 
     <lb/>
     affairs any better than we understand theirs. 
     <lb/>
     As an instance of how a people may be mis<lb break="no"/>understood abroad, we heard the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Agriculture (Hon. Mr. MCGEE), 
     <lb/>
     who professes to be well acquainted with the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, prophesying that the result 
     <lb/>
     of the elections in New Brunswick would be 
     <lb/>
     largely in favor of Confederation; but when 
     <lb/>
     he found his fine prediction destroyed, we 
     <lb/>
     then heard him trying to explain the result as 
     <lb/>
     being due to annexation tendencies and 
     <lb/>
     Americanizing influences. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCGE1">HON. MR. MCGEE</persName>—Not all, but a good 
     <lb/>
     deal of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—Now, in Canada, all those 
     <lb/>
     who oppose the Confederation scheme are 
     <lb/>
     accused of having the same annexation feel<lb break="no"/>ing as the people of New Brunswick are said 
     <lb/>
     to be tainted with. It is extraordinary how 
     <lb/>
     different people on the same side of politics 
     <lb/>
     will look upon things. I have just noticed in 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily News</hi> of this city, a few lines of a 
     <lb/>
     rather startling character. [Having read a 
     <lb/>
    passage from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">News</hi> of the 10th of March, 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the abolition of the passport 
     <lb/>
     system, Mr. JOLY proceeded:] There are 
     <lb/>
     two ways of looking at this. Here is a news<lb break="no"/>paper, supporting the Government, which says 
     <lb/>
     that if the Lower Provinces have not been 
     <lb/>
     relieved from the passport system, as Canada 
     <lb/>
     has been, it is certainly because their relations 
     <lb/>
     are not so friendly with the United States as 
     <lb/>
     ours. It is only since our relations became 
     <lb/>
     friendly with the United States—since we 
     <lb/>
     passed that Alien Bill, and voted that money 
     <lb/>
     stolen by the St. Alban's raiders—it is only 
     <lb/>
     since we have bowed down before them that 
     <lb/>
     we have obtained relief from the obnoxious 
     <lb/>
     system. The Lower Provinces having taken 
     <lb/>
     a firmer stand, the United States Government 
     <lb/>
     have refused to make the same concession to 
     <lb/>
     them as has been made to us. I think, there<lb break="no"/>fore it is a mistake to say that it is American 
     <lb/>
     influence or annexation proclivities that have 
     <lb/>
     caused the defeat of the friends of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation in New Brunswick. The only transac<lb break="no"/>tions that we have taken upon ourselves to 
     <lb/>
     make, affecting any foreign state, have been 
     <lb/>
     the passing of the Alien Bill and the granting 
     <lb/>
     of that money for the St. Alban's banks. In 
     <lb/>
     this instance, it appears most clear that this 
     <lb/>
     province stands in a better, closer and more 
     <lb/>
    friendly relation with the United States, 
     <lb/>
  
    
            <pb n="999" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_0999.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">999</fw>
          
     through such action, than the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Therefore it seems to me more rea<lb break="no"/>sonable to suppose that the American sympa<lb break="no"/>thizers in New Brunswick have been defeated 
     <lb/>
     at the polls, instead of triumphant. The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council explains the differ<lb break="no"/>ence between Canada and New Brunswick, as 
     <lb/>
     to the desirability of having new elections, by 
     <lb/>
     saying that there was a new election there 
     <lb/>
     because the term of the Legislature was about 
     <lb/>
     to expire. Well, this would have been our 
     <lb/>
     last session too, if the Confederation scheme 
     <lb/>
     had passed, and therefore supposing the Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme to have gone into operation 
     <lb/>
     as soon as the Government anticipated it 
     <lb/>
     would, we should have been exactly in the 
     <lb/>
     same position as New Brunswick in relation 
     <lb/>
     to a new election. The same reasons for 
     <lb/>
     having a new election there exist here, and 
     <lb/>
     there is no better reason to be assigned for 
     <lb/>
     refusing to allow the people of Canada to ex<lb break="no"/>press themselves on this project, than there 
     <lb/>
     was for the Government of New Brunswick to 
     <lb/>
     refuse a dissolution of the Legislature of that 
     <lb/>
     province. But while we see the Government 
     <lb/>
     of that province willing and anxious to give 
     <lb/>
     the people an opportunity of expressing their 
     <lb/>
     will, how differently are the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     treated ! (Hear, hear.) The Hon. President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council has alluded to a majority of 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadians being in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme. I find by the vote 
     <lb/>
     that twenty-six voted in favor of it, and twen<lb break="no"/>ty-two against. Among the twenty-six were 
     <lb/>
     three members of the Administration who 
     <lb/>
     propounded the scheme, and were so inter<lb break="no"/>ested in the result of the vote, that in all 
     <lb/>
     fairness they ought not to be counted. De<lb break="no"/>ducting these, the figures would stand twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     three to twenty-two.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY.GEN. CARTIER</persName>—Well, if you 
     <lb/>
     deduct the members of the Government, you 
     <lb/>
     ought also to deduct the leaders of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—I think not, because they 
     <lb/>
     were not more deeply interested in the vote 
     <lb/>
     than other members on the floor of the House. 
     <lb/>
     Out of the twenty-six, there are at least half 
     <lb/>
     a dozen whose conduct has been condemned 
     <lb/>
     in the most direct manner by their constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, in public assemblies duly held for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of considering the Confederation ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I can instance the counties of Joliette, 
     <lb/>
     Rouville, Chambly, L'Assomption, &amp;c. So if 
     <lb/>
     we take the French-Canadians and place the 
     <lb/>
     matter in a fair and equitable footing, we will 
     <lb/>
     find that they are about equally divided in this 
     <lb/>
     House, and that it is hard to tell whether the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     majority of the people are for or against 
     <lb/>
     it by their representatives in Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     It is impossible to know what the opinions of 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadians are at this moment, or 
     <lb/>
     to find out, except by giving them an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to record their votes by means of the 
     <lb/>
     elections. The French-Canadians are nearly a 
     <lb/>
     million of people, and I think they are en<lb break="no"/>titled to be heard on this scheme as much as 
     <lb/>
     any of the Lower Provinces ; and if for no 
     <lb/>
     other purpose than to give them an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of expressing themselves, there ought 
     <lb/>
     to be a general election. I say that we have 
     <lb/>
     been taken by surprise through the rapid 
     <lb/>
     manner in which this scheme has been intro<lb break="no"/>duced and carried through this House. We 
     <lb/>
     have been told that because our leaders would 
     <lb/>
     not agree to any arrangement by which the 
     <lb/>
     demands of Upper Canada could be met, 
     <lb/>
     either in whole or in part, the scheme has 
     <lb/>
     been imposed upon us. If that alternative 
     <lb/>
     had been presented to us at an earlier day, I 
     <lb/>
     think it would have been possible for us to 
     <lb/>
     have met our Upper Canadian friends in a 
     <lb/>
     scheme of conciliation, agreeing upon a mea<lb break="no"/>sure which, if not satisfactory to all, would, 
     <lb/>
     at all events, draw as more closely to one 
     <lb/>
     another. For instance, the principal com<lb break="no"/>plaint is that Upper Canada pays two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of the taxes, and is allowed to have control of 
     <lb/>
     only one-half the money contributed by those 
     <lb/>
     taxes. I will not say that I would grant re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population rather than be 
     <lb/>
     forced to accept the Confederation scheme ; 
     <lb/>
     but I can say that I find the claim of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, in reference to the finances, perfectly 
     <lb/>
     fair and just, and I only rise to express my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, as one of the members of this House, 
     <lb/>
     to that effect. I would be quite willing to 
     <lb/>
     enter into some arrangement that would give 
     <lb/>
     to Upper Canada a greater proportion of the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, in proportion to its population, 
     <lb/>
     and stake my chances of reëlection upon that 
     <lb/>
     declaration. (Hear, hear.) I dare say that 
     <lb/>
     many in Upper Canada would not be quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with that ; but for my part, I do not 
     <lb/>
     feel that I have a right to offer more. I 
     <lb/>
     merely wish to show that Lower Canadians 
     <lb/>
     are not so lost to all sense of justice as not 
     <lb/>
     to recognise the correctness of that principle, 
     <lb/>
     and are not so much opposed to the making 
     <lb/>
     of some concessions as many of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada seem to imagine. If we had 
     <lb/>
     been informed as to what was coming, I think 
     <lb/>
     we certainly should have gone into some ar<lb break="no"/>rangement towards suiting the views of Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, by increasing her share of con<lb break="no"/>trol on the revenue, rather than be compelled 
     <lb/>
            <pb n="1000" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1000.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1000</fw>
       
     to accept this Confederation scheme. The 
     <lb/>
     most pressing reason given for passing the 
     <lb/>
     measure now is, that the relations between 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada have reached such 
     <lb/>
     a stage, that the Government of the country 
     <lb/>
     cannot go on in peace and quietness any 
     <lb/>
     longer. I do not think anything of the kind 
     <lb/>
     is the case. I do not think any honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman from Upper Canada is ready to 
     <lb/>
     rush into civil war. I do not think any num<lb break="no"/>ber of people in Upper Canada has given up 
     <lb/>
     the hope of obtaining, by constitutional 
     <lb/>
     means, what they think is fair. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think any of them would think of coming 
     <lb/>
     down here and obtaining the rights of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada by murder, bloodshed and civil war. 
     <lb/>
     I think it is most unfortunate that the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council should have at<lb break="no"/>tempted to frighten us by the use of such 
     <lb/>
    terms.

     (Hear, hear.) Well now, having withdrawn

     those words with reference to one member

     <lb/>
     same charge against another member, oc<lb break="no"/>cupying even a higher position in the 
     <lb/>
     Cabinet. Here are the very words employed 
     <lb/>
     by the leader of the Administration, in ad<lb break="no"/>dressing the Upper House. On page 9 of the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Parliamentary Debates</hi> on Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     I find this passage in the speech of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. and gallant knight at the head of 
     <lb/>
     the Government :—"At the time these mea<lb break="no"/>sures were resolved upon, the country was 
     <lb/>
     bordering on civil strife, and he would ask if 
     <lb/>
     it was not the duty of both sides to do all 
     <lb/>
     the could to prevent the unfortunate results 
     <lb/>
     which would have followed." Well, I see it 
     <lb/>
     is the term "civil strife" that is used instead 
     <lb/>
     of "civil war." (Laughter.) But it is used 
     <lb/>
     in the same sense as the term "civil war." 
     <lb/>
     The French version of our official reports 
     <lb/>
     has <hi rendition="simple:italic">"guerre civile."</hi> I think it is most un<lb break="no"/>fortunate to hear hon. members of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, who have in their keeping the fair 
     <lb/>
     fame of the country, letting it go to the 
     <lb/>
     world that Canada, which was always looked 
     <lb/>
     upon as such a happy, free and prosperous 
     <lb/>
     country, was on the eve of civil strife. It is 
     <lb/>
     all the more unfortunate that I was mistaken 
     <lb/>
     in reference to the person who uttered those 
     <lb/>
     words, for I find now that it is the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Canada, instead of the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council. If that honorable 
     <lb/>
    gentleman had said anything approaching to 
     <lb/>what I charged him with, I am sure he would 
     <lb/>not have denied it in the manner he has, for 
     <lb/>I think he would have been willing to have 
     <lb/>considered the spirit of the charge more than 
     <lb/>the mere letter. I will not now take up the 
     <lb/>time of the House any longer. I simply 
     <lb/>wish to show the unfair means that had been 
     <lb/>used by the Government in carrying their

     Well, Mr. SPEAKER, that is quite true. Sir,

     we have been in a state of strife for a great

     many years. An election is a civil strife,

     he fattens on that kind of strife. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—Well, I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     what the hon. gentleman calls the war in 
     <lb/>
     the United States; is that not civil strife? 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. Mr. BROWN</persName>—No, no, no; that 
     <lb/>
     is civil war, because it is a war among the 
     <lb/>
     people themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOLY1">MR. JOLY</persName>—Well, I do not think there 
     <lb/>
     is anything wrong in calling it civil strife, 
     <lb/>
     and I consider the terms synonymous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—The 
     <lb/>
     war in the United States is a most dis<lb break="no"/>astrous, and even barbarous civil war; but 
     <lb/>
     the word civil strife is not applicable to it. 
     <lb/>
     I have already explained the meaning of 
     <lb/>
     the term, and I hope now that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend sees the evil of his ways, he will 
     <lb/>
     abandon his opposition to the Government. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, for the sake 
     <lb/>
     of the character of this House, and for the 
     <lb/>
     sake of the public purse, I must protest 
     <lb/>
     against the current of the debate which has 
     <lb/>
     arisen from the motion of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel. I thought we had got through 
     <lb/>
     with the discussion, and that as every hon. 
     <lb/>
     member had had the opportunity of speak<lb break="no"/>ing not only once or twice, but three or four 
     <lb/>
     times, we had finished the debate, and taken 
     <lb/>
     a vote which was rather satisfactory to the 
     <lb/>
     Government, by which the question had been 
     <lb/>
     introduced into the House, and that it was 
     <lb/>
     generally understood that the discussion of 
     <lb/>
     the propriety of the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
    provinces was to end there. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>But I find in the remarks of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>opposite a tendency to reopen the whole 
     <lb/>question, after it has been decided by this 
     <lb/>House, upon a motion made by myself for 
     <lb/>the appointment of a committee to draft an 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     Address in which the resolutions should be 
     <lb/>
     embodied. I say, sir, that this is an abuse 
     <lb/>
     of parliamentary privilege, a waste of the 
     <lb/>
     time of this House and of the public money, 
     <lb/>
     while it serves no good purpose, and I am 
     <lb/>
     sure that the good feeling and common 
     <lb/>
     sense of this House will not allow anything 
     <lb/>
     of this kind to go on. One thing connected 
     <lb/>
     with this subject I greatly regret. I very 
     <lb/>
     much regret that although the debate has 
     <lb/>
     been so long protracted, and although we have 
     <lb/>
     had an expression from almost every member 
     <lb/>
     of this House, we have hitherto failed in 
     <lb/>
     getting the arguments promised in the 
     <lb/>
     speech of my hon. friend from Chateauguay. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear ) For some reason or other we 
     <lb/>
     cannot get that speech out. Just as MOSES  
     <lb/>
     went up to Pisgah's top and viewed the 
     <lb/>
     promised land in the distance, just so the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member gives us an occasional glimpse 
     <lb/>
     of the promised speech, but we have thus far 
     <lb/>
     been disappointed in our expectations of 
     <lb/>
     hearing it delivered. We have been prom<lb break="no"/>ised it two or three times during the past 
     <lb/>
     month. The honorable member ought to 
     <lb/>
     remember that " hope deferred maketh the 
     <lb/>
     heart sick." I am sure I desire to have the 
     <lb/>
     pleasure and satisfaction of hearing from the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman, and having the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of the information which the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is well known to be able of giving 
     <lb/>
     this House; for though young in years, he 
     <lb/>
     is old in political wisdom and in that political 
     <lb/>
     sagacity of which he denies me the posses<lb break="no"/>sion. I say I am sorry, and this House must 
     <lb/>
     be sorry, and the country must be sorry, that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman has practised so much 
     <lb/>
     self-denial as to refuse to allow his radiance 
     <lb/>
     to shine forth upon this great question. 
     <lb/>
     The thing which so utterly destroys the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's utility is his extreme 
     <lb/>
     modesty. (Laughter.) Why, when he had 
     <lb/>
     to rush to the rescue of the disordered 
     <lb/>
     finances of this country, at great personal 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice, for the sake of saving the country 
     <lb/>
     from the ruin that hung over it through the 
     <lb/>
     lavish extravagance of my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     present Hon. Finance Minister, he looked, 
     <lb/>
     with the exercise of his great financial ability, 
     <lb/>
     down into the recesses of the public chest 
     <lb/>
     and speedily discovered the source of all the 
     <lb/>
     evils that had fallen upon the country, and 
     <lb/>
     yet the modesty of the hon. gentleman pre<lb break="no"/>vented him from making known the remedy. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) And so it is even now. He 
     <lb/>
     has been promising to give us his views upon 
     <lb/>
     this great question; but four weeks have 
     <lb/>
     passed, and his speech yet hangs fire. And 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="1002" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1002.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1002</fw>
          
     to-day he told us, after drawing himself up 
     <lb/>
     with that righteous indignation which he 
     <lb/>
     can so well affect, that the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West had tried to stop 
     <lb/>
     the publication of the debates, and that 
     <lb/>
     he himself had yet to fire his speech 
     <lb/>
     on this great subject, because it was too late 
     <lb/>
     to do so on Saturday morning ; and yet, 
     <lb/>
     when the honorable gentleman gets up, he 
     <lb/>
     says he will confine himself to this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. He did so, and confined himself very 
     <lb/>
     narrowly to it. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has somehow or other become the 
     <lb/>
     guardian of my political reputation. He 
     <lb/>
     has, on two or three occasions, warned me 
     <lb/>
     that although the course I took was, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     that of a practical man—that of one who 
     <lb/>
     desired merely to keep office and become 
     <lb/>
     famous for political acuteness—yet it would 
     <lb/>
     never secure for me the fame of being a 
     <lb/>
     great statesman. Well, sir, I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     to confine myself to practical things—to the 
     <lb/>
     securing of such practical measures as the 
     <lb/>
     country really wants. I am satisfied not to 
     <lb/>
     have a reputation for indulgiug in imaginary 
     <lb/>
     schemes and harboring visionary ideas that 
     <lb/>
     may end sometimes in an annexation move<lb break="no"/>ment, sometimes in Federation and sometimes 
     <lb/>
     in a legislative union, but always utopian 
     <lb/>
     and never practical. I am satisfied to 
     <lb/>
     leave the imaginary, the poetic and the 
     <lb/>
     impossible to the hon. member for Chateau<lb break="no"/>guay. The other day the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man paused to say, in the course of one 
     <lb/>
     of his little, numerous, by the by speeches, 
     <lb/>
     that in taking the course I have done 
     <lb/>
     on this question—that of advocating a 
     <lb/>
     Federal instead of a Legislative union— 
     <lb/>
     I violated all the principles of my former 
     <lb/>
     life having a bearing on this subject. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, it is quite true that after a 
     <lb/>
     careful examination of the Constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the United States, in connection with its 
     <lb/>
     practical working, and the civil war that has 
     <lb/>
     grown out of it, I saw many weaknesses in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Federal system, as 
     <lb/>
     operated in that country, and I was as 
     <lb/>
     desirous as any man could be in taking part 
     <lb/>
     in the Conference relating to union between 
     <lb/>
     the Provinces of British North America, 
     <lb/>
     that as much as the legislative form of 
     <lb/>
     government as possible, and as few of the 
     <lb/>
     weaknesses which experience had shown to 
     <lb/>
     exist in the American Constitution, should 
     <lb/>
     be incorporated in ours. I do not like 
     <lb/>
     to refer to any remarks of mine in times 
     <lb/>
     past ; but as this charge has been brought 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     against me, I will read, by permission of the 
     <lb/>
     House, a passage from a speech of mine, in 
     <lb/>
     relation to representation by population. And 
     <lb/>
     I might here say that it is the only speech 
     <lb/>
     I ever delivered in my life, which I have 
     <lb/>
     ever taken any particular trouble to revise. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman will see, from this pass<lb break="no"/>age, what my sentiments were, in 1861, on 
     <lb/>
     the subject, while taking part in a debate on 
     <lb/>
     representation by population. I was reply<lb break="no"/>ing to a speech made by my present col<lb break="no"/>league, the Hon. Minister of Agriculture. 
     <lb/>
     I said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The only feasible scheme which presented 
     <lb/>
     itself to his (my) mind, as a remedy for the evils 
     <lb/>
     complained of, was a Confederation of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. (Hear, hear.) But in speaking of 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation he must not be understood as 
     <lb/>
     alluding to it in the sense of the one on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the line. For that had not been 
     <lb/>
    successful. But then he did not say so from 
     <lb/>any feeling of satisfaction at such a result. 
     <lb/>Far from him be any such idea. He heartily 
     <lb/>agreed with the junior member for Montreal 
     <lb/>(Hon. Mr. MCGEE) in every word of regret 
     <lb/>which he had expressed at the unhappy and 
     <lb/>lamentable state of things which they now 
     <lb/>witnessed in the States, for he remembered 
     <lb/>that they were of the same blood as ourselves. 
     <lb/>He still looked hopefully to the future of the 
     <lb/>United States. He believed there was a vigor, 
     <lb/>a vitality, in the Anglo-Saxon character and 
     <lb/>the Anglo-Saxon institutions of the United 
     <lb/>States, that would carry them through this great 
     <lb/>convulsion, as they had carried through our 
     <lb/>Mother Country in days of old. (Loud cheers 
     <lb/>from both sides of the House.) He hoped with 
     <lb/>that honorable gentleman (Hon. Mr. MCGEE), 
     <lb/>that if they were to be severed in two—as 
     <lb/>severed in two he believed they would be— 
     <lb/>two great, two noble, two free nations 
     <lb/>would exist in place of one. (Hear, hear.) But, 
     <lb/>while he thus sympathized with them he must 
     <lb/>say, let it be a warning to ourselves that we do 
     <lb/>not split on the same rock which they had done. 
     <lb/>The fatal error which they had committed—and 
     <lb/>it was, perhaps, unavoidable from the state of the 
     <lb/>colonies at the time of the revolution—was in 
     <lb/>making each state a distinct sovereignty, and 
     <lb/>giving to each a distinct sovereign power, except 
     <lb/>in those instances where they were specially re<lb break="no"/>served by the Constitution and conferred upon the 
     <lb/>General Government. The true principle of a 
     <lb/>Confederation lay in giving to the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment all the principles and powers of sover<lb break="no"/>eignty, and that the subordinate or individual 
     <lb/>states should have no powers but those expressly 
     <lb/>bestowed on them. We should thus have a pow<lb break="no"/>erful Central Government, a powerful Central 
     <lb/>Legislature, and a decentralized system of minor 
     <lb/>legislatures for local purposes.

     speech delivered in 1861; and I say that 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution which this House, by a 
     <lb/>
     majority of three to one, has carried out as 
     <lb/>
     far as it is concerned, is, in spirit and letter, 
     <lb/>
     that which I then pointed out; and that was 
     <lb/>
     not the result of my experience, my thought 
     <lb/>
     and my opinion alone, but of the experience, 
     <lb/>
     thought and opinion of every man who had 
     <lb/>
     studied and taken into consideration the 
     <lb/>
     character of the Constitution of the United 
     <lb/>
     States. I know that in making that quota<lb break="no"/>tion I am committing the error which I 
     <lb/>
     have charged upon other hon. members of 
     <lb/>
     the House of going back in the debate; but 
     <lb/>
     I thought that it was due to myself to read 
     <lb/>
     it to the House, because the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Chateauguay—not in that blunt, plain<lb break="no"/>spoken style which characterises some hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, but with that soothing, soft lan<lb break="no"/>guage that is so grateful to one's feelings— 
     <lb/>
     (laughter)—stated that in proposing a Fede<lb break="no"/>ral union of these provinces I belied the 
     <lb/>
     whole of my political life, and that it was for 
     <lb/>
     this reason I made so feeble and ineffectual 
     <lb/>
     a speech when I offered these resolutions to 
     <lb/>
     the House. As to the feebleness and in<lb break="no"/>effectiveness of my speech, that, sir, I admit; 
     <lb/>
     but as to my sentiments on Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     they were the sentiments of my life, my 
     <lb/>
     sentiments in Parliament years ago, my sen<lb break="no"/>timents in the Conference, and my sentiments 
     <lb/>
     now. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I submit, 
     <lb/>
     with all due deference to your decision, that 
     <lb/>
     the motion proposed by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel is in order ; and it is a point, I am 
     <lb/>
     free to admit, of such doubt that I ought 
     <lb/>
     not to set up my opinion against that impar<lb break="no"/>tially given by yourself, for one is very apt 
     <lb/>
     to decide in his own favor in a doubtful 
     <lb/>
     case. It would have been very convenient 
     <lb/>
     for the Government to have it declared out 
     <lb/>
     order, and our feelings may therefore have 
     <lb/>
     caused us to take a less impartial view than that 
     <lb/>
     taken by yourself; and it became our duty 
     <lb/>
     to submit to your ruling, unless we believed 
     <lb/>
     in our conscience that beyond all doubt you 
     <lb/>
     were wrong. Having been declared to be 
     <lb/>
     properly before the House, I must say that 
     <lb/>
     the motion of the hon. member is altogether 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent with his votes upon the question 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation. (Hear, hear.) I cannot 
     <lb/>
     understand how an hon. member who gave 
     <lb/>
     the two votes he did last week upon that 
     <lb/>
     question, could make the motion in amend<lb break="no"/>ment now under consideration. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Indeed I understood him to say that 
     <lb/>
    he did not design this as an amendment, 
     <lb/>but as a separate and independent motion; 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     and I think it is to be regretted that having 
     <lb/>
     made up his mind to support the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     I proposed, he did not also support the 
     <lb/>
     formal machinery necessary to give them 
     <lb/>
     effect; that he did not accept my invitation 
     <lb/>
     to propose his views in a separate and dis<lb break="no"/>tinct motion, instead of in the shape of an 
     <lb/>
     amendment to an Address for which he him<lb break="no"/>self voted. (Hear, hear ) When I say that 
     <lb/>
     I regret that my hon. friend has taken this 
     <lb/>
     course, I must at the same time congratulate 
     <lb/>
     him upon the sound doctrine he has laid 
     <lb/>
     down in his speech; for if I wanted, if the 
     <lb/>
     House wanted, an argument in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     measure which the Government has laid 
     <lb/>
     before the House, we could not have had it 
     <lb/>
     in more eloquent and convincing language 
     <lb/>
     than that contained in the speech of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend. My hon. friend is always eloquent 
     <lb/>
     and always convincing, but he could not have 
     <lb/>
     been more eloquent or more convincing than 
     <lb/>
    when he spoke on this question of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation.

     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—What a 
     <lb/>
     compliment!

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—It 
     <lb/>
     may be a compliment, but it is not flattery. 
     <lb/>
     A compliment is the statement of an agree<lb break="no"/>able truth; flattery is the statement of an 
     <lb/>
     agreeable untruth. Now, were I to state 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member for Cornwall delivered 
     <lb/>
     an eloquent and convincing speech, that 
     <lb/>
     would be flattery—(great laughter )—but when 
     <lb/>
     I state, in all sincerity, that the speech of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Peel was an eloquent 
     <lb/>
     and convincing one, I may compliment, but 
     <lb/>
     I do not flatter. (Hear, hear.) But what 
     <lb/>
     struck me as strange was that while my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend stated to the House that he was not a 
     <lb/>
     man to make an unconstitutional motion, or 
     <lb/>
     to make a motion committing in any way a 
     <lb/>
     breech of constitutional usage, or to propose 
     <lb/>
     anything less than a constitutional appeal 
     <lb/>
     to the people, he should oppose the motion 
     <lb/>
     before the House; for I know that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend is not the man to commit a 
     <lb/>
     fundamental error against constitutional and 
     <lb/>
     free institutions. He knew well, and it is 
     <lb/>
     much to the credit of my hon. friend as a 
     <lb/>
     sound constitutional lawyer, that although 
     <lb/>
     he drew his notice of motion hurriedly, it 
     <lb/>
     was necessary, when he presented it to the 
     <lb/>
     House, to guard against mistake; and he 
     <lb/>
     took care that the appeal he proposed to 
     <lb/>
     make to the people on this question should 
     <lb/>
     be a constitutional appeal by the members 
     <lb/>
     of this House going to the polls. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) But my hon. friend the seconder of 
     <lb/>

     the resolution, who called upon the House 
     <lb/>
     to support it, says he does not believe a 
     <lb/>
     word of it. (Laughter.) The very first 
     <lb/>
     sentence that he uttered was that he did 
     <lb/>
     not believe in the resolution; for he said 
     <lb/>
     that he was in favor of submitting yes or no 
     <lb/>
     to the people, but not in the mode proposed 
     <lb/>
     by the resolution, the only mode known to 
     <lb/>
     our Constitution.

     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I do not wish 
     <lb/>
     my language to be misrepresented by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend. What I stated was that I did 
     <lb/>
     not consider that to be the only way of 
     <lb/>
     ascertaining the views of the people, and 
     <lb/>
     did not think it wrong to take a vote, yea or 
     <lb/>
     nay, upon the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—Well, 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Peel submitted that the 
     <lb/>
     appeal should be made in one way, the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional way, and that was the way my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from North Ontario did not 
     <lb/>
     like. How could my hon. friend suppose 
     <lb/>
     that a vote like that could be taken in a 
     <lb/>
     country whose Constitution is modelled on 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution of England? By what 
     <lb/>
     contrivance known to our Constitution could 
     <lb/>
     we take such a vote? There is none such. 
     <lb/>
     There is no means, no system, by which we 
     <lb/>
     could make an appeal of that kind, and in 
     <lb/>
     order to do it we should have to subvert the 
     <lb/>
     principles of the British Constitution. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman knows there is no means of 
     <lb/>
     doing it. We might, indeed, pass a law 
     <lb/>
     declaring that the people shall vote yes or 
     <lb/>
     no on this question; but such a law would 
     <lb/>
     in itself be a change in our Constitution, and 
     <lb/>
     I would like to see any man representing 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty in this country give his sanc<lb break="no"/>tion to a measure of that kind, which would 
     <lb/>
     be a subversion of the first principles of 
     <lb/>
     British constitutional government. Sir, we 
     <lb/>
     in this House are representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     people, and not mere delegates; and to pass 
     <lb/>
     such a law would be robbing ourselves of 
     <lb/>
     the character of representatives, and be a 
     <lb/>
     proceeding which even the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Chateauguay himself denounces in 
     <lb/>
     language, although he supports it in counte<lb break="no"/>nance when pressed by others. That hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is too familiar with the principles 
     <lb/>
     of British constitutional government to 
     <lb/>
     support such a proceeding himself, but still 
     <lb/>
     he encourages others to do it, and to say 
     <lb/>
     that which he would not advance himself. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear,hear.) Sir,a reference to the people— 
     <lb/>
     a direct reference to the people—of a question 
     <lb/>
    of this kind may be the means by which 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     a despot, an absolute monarch, may get that 
     <lb/>
     popular confirmation and approval which he 
     <lb/>
     desires for the laws necessary to the support 
     <lb/>
     and continuation of his usurpation. It may 
     <lb/>
     he the means by which a despot, at the point 
     <lb/>
     of the bayonet, may ask the people to vote 
     <lb/>
     yea or nay on the measure he preposes; but 
     <lb/>
     in every free country where there is a Con<lb break="no"/>stitution at all, the vote must be taken by 
     <lb/>
     the constituted authorities, the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people, and not become a mere 
     <lb/>
     form and cover to tyranny, but a measure 
     <lb/>
     which accords with the calm and deliberate 
     <lb/>
     judgments of the people, as expressed through 
     <lb/>
     their representatives. (Hear, hear.) I was 
     <lb/>
     rather alarmed when I first read the notice 
     <lb/>
     given by my hon. friend from Peel, and 
     <lb/>
     feared that he was going to take the course 
     <lb/>
     advised by the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, because the language of his notice 
     <lb/>
     was undefined upon the subject. I, however, 
     <lb/>
     had every confidence in the constitutional 
     <lb/>
    principles—the conservative principles—of 
     <lb/>the hon. gentleman; but as the language of 
     <lb/>the notice was not clear, I was exceedingly 
     <lb/>relieved when he read the motion to the 
     <lb/>House in its present complete shape. I 
     <lb/>admit that it was quite open to any member 
     <lb/>of this Parliament to move either that the 
     <lb/>House be dissolved or not dissolved. I 
     <lb/>admit that the hon. member had a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional right to move that the House be dis<lb break="no"/>solved, with a view of referring this question 
     <lb/>to the people, and therefore it was that I felt 
     <lb/>relieved when I found that this was the course 
     <lb/>he proposed. and regret, on the other hand, 
     <lb/>that the hon. member for North Ontario has 
     <lb/>so far fallen away from his old conservative 
     <lb/>principles as to take the other ground. 
     <lb/>Now, what is the opinion entertained upon 
     <lb/>this subject in England? I was exceedingly 
     <lb/>pleased to read lately the report of a speech 
     <lb/>delivered to his constituents, at Huddersfield, 
     <lb/>by Mr. LEATHAM, a member of the Imperial 
     <lb/>Parliament. He is, I believe, a brother-in- 
     <lb break="yes"/>law of Mr. JOHN BRIGHT, and belongs to 
     <lb/>the advanced Liberal school of English 
     <lb/>politicians, known as the Manchester school; 
     <lb/>and although educated in the political doc<lb break="no"/>trines of that school, he yet had the courage 
     <lb/>to get up before the people of Huddersfield, 
     <lb/>as Radical a constituency as any in all 
     <lb/>England, and spoke in strong language 
     <lb/>against the Permissive Bill, a temperance 
     <lb/>measure which resembles that passed through 
     <lb/>this Legislature by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Brome, because he held that it was uncon<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="1005" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1005.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1005</fw>
           
     stitutional to hand over to the people the 
     <lb/>
     power of voting directly upon a law before 
     <lb/>
     it came into effect. He contended that the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of voting for a measure must 
     <lb/>
     rest upon the Legislature alone, and that it 
     <lb/>
     could not refer this responsibility to the 
     <lb/>
    people. When you find an advanced Liberal 
     <lb/>like Mr. LEATHAM taking that ground, and 
     <lb/>going to the length he did in support of it, 
     <lb/>you can well understand the principles that 
     <lb/>actuate the great majority of the people of 
     <lb/>England. Allow me to read to the House 
     <lb/>the language employed by Mr. LEATHAM on 
     <lb/>this point. It is not long, and it seems to 
     <lb/>me exceedingly instructive. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, in 
     <lb/>an article on the speech, says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Mr. LEATHAM</persName>'S argument on this subject is 
     <lb/>
     well worthy of attention, not only for its bearing 
     <lb/>
     on the question of compulsory temperance, but 
     <lb/>
     from the much wider range of subjects to which 
     <lb/>
     it is applicable. "It is," he says, "the essence 
     <lb/>
     of representative government that the electing 
     <lb/>
     class, which is analogous to the class paying 
     <lb/>
     rates, shall possess no direct legislative power; 
     <lb/>
     and the principle of parliamentary representation 
     <lb/>
     is that not even the representative principle shall 
     <lb/>
     alone legislate. We have taken the precaution 
     <lb/>
     to protect the rights and property of Englishmen 
     <lb/>
     by the prerogatives of the Crown, the privileges 
     <lb/>
     of the Lords, and the authority of a represent<lb break="no"/>ative Assembly. All these constitute the three<lb break="no"/>fold and invaluable shelter which we have raised 
     <lb/>
     over the rights and property of the meanest 
     <lb/>
     subject in the realm. But here is a proposition 
     <lb/>
     which, with naked and revolutionary simplicity, 
     <lb/>
     proposes to intrust the property and maintenance 
     <lb/>
     of the rights of a large class of persons to dimi<lb break="no"/>nutive, homogeneous, democratic, and irresponsi<lb break="no"/>ble parliaments set up all over the country, in 
     <lb/>
     place of a central, responsible, compound, and 
     <lb/>
     constitutional one. It seems to me that this 
     <lb/>
     strikes at the root of a constitutional and repre<lb break="no"/>sentative system."

     These, sir, are the words used by an advanced 
     <lb/>
     reformer, a member of one of the most 
     <lb/>
     advanced schools of politicians in England. 
     <lb/>
     They are words of wisdom, and ought to 
     <lb/>
     rest with weight on the mind of every 
     <lb/>
     admirer of representative institutions, who 
     <lb/>
     does not wish to see those institutions de<lb break="no"/>graded in this country, and representation be<lb break="no"/>come mere delegation. (Hear, hear.) Why, 
     <lb/>
     sir, for what do we come to this House, if it is 
     <lb/>
     not because we are supposed to be convinced 
     <lb/>
     by argument, if it is not that we are to sit 
     <lb/>
     down together and compare notes and discuss 
     <lb/>
     the questions that may come before us, and to 
     <lb/>
     be convinced according to the force of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons that may be advanced for or against 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     them? And if we are honest, conscientious 
     <lb/>
     men, we change our opinions as we become 
     <lb/>
     convinced that that which we held before 
     <lb/>
     was wrong and the opposite right. But if 
     <lb/>
     the other doctrine obtains, that we are not 
     <lb/>
     representatives but delegates, we might as 
     <lb/>
     well meet here and pass measures without 
     <lb/>
     any discussion whatever, every man voting 
     <lb/>
     according to the instructions of the commis<lb break="no"/>sion which he holds in his pocket from his

     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName> — 
     <lb/>
     Well, that was not voted upon without 
     <lb/>
     argument; for full opportunity was given to 
     <lb/>
     discuss it before hon. members were requir<lb break="no"/>ed to vote. I was saying, sir, that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel committed an act of incon<lb break="no"/>sistency in voting for these resolutions, and 
     <lb/>
     then proposing this amendment. What did 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions amount to? The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman voted for an Address to the 
     <lb/>
     Queen, praying that she may be pleased to 
     <lb/>
     lay before the Imperial Parliament a measure 
     <lb/>
     for the union of these colonies, on the basis 
     <lb/>
     of the resolutions of the Quebec Conference. 
     <lb/>
     He voted for it because he approved of the 
     <lb/>
     proposition ; and if we had followed the 
     <lb/>
     practice of the Imperial Parliament, the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress would have been adopted by the vote 
     <lb/>
     which he and a majority of hon. members 
     <lb/>
     gave, and probably would be on its way to 
     <lb/>
     England now for presentation to Her Ma— 
     <lb/>
     jesty. It is a practice lately adopted to 
     <lb/>
     refer the Address formally to a committee, to 
     <lb/>
     report it back again to the House. Well, 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend, by his vote, affirmed that this 
     <lb/>
     Address should be sent to Her Majesty; but 
     <lb/>
     what does this motion proposed by him de<lb break="no"/>clare? Why, that the Address which he de<lb break="no"/>clared by his vote should be presented to the 
     <lb/>
     Queen, should not be sent. That is the plain 
     <lb/>
     meaning of it, and —I was going to say that 
     <lb/>
     it gives the lie to his former action, but—is 
     <lb/>
     the very opposite to the previous vote of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. (Hear, hear.) That is 
     <lb/>
     the course which my hon. friend has taken, 
     <lb/>
     and I must say that it is an extraordinary

     and inconsistent one.

     <persName ref="pers:CAME2">HON. J. H. CAMERON</persName>—My hon. friend

     says that it is merely a matter of form to

     refer an Address adopted by the House to a

     committee, and is so regarded in England. 
     <lb/>
     But I wish to point out to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     that in the Imperial Parliament, on the 7th 
     <lb/>
     of February last, the Address in reply to the 
     <lb/>
     Speech from the Throne was moved and 
     <lb/>
     unanimously assented to by the House ; 
     <lb/>
     that it was then referred to a committee of 
     <lb/>
     the House, which committee reported it 
     <lb/>
     back, and that on the Address coming up 
     <lb/>
     for a second reading, Mr. SCULLY moved an 
     <lb/>
     amendment in reference to the state of 
     <lb/>
     Ireland, in opposition to the Address for 
     <lb/>
     which he had himself before voted. (Hear,

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—Well, 
     <lb/>
     if Mr. SCULLY was present when the Address 
     <lb/>
     was first voted, he would no doubt have voted 
     <lb/>
     against it. But this is the first case I have 
     <lb/>
     yet heard of an honorable member voting 
     <lb/>
     to carry a certain motion, and then proposing 
     <lb/>
     an amendment to upset it; and when he did 
     <lb/>
     propose it, I myself thought it was unparlia<lb break="no"/>mentary, but the Speaker ruled it in order, 
     <lb/>
     and to his decision I bow. Now, if the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman thought that from the circum<lb break="no"/>stances of the country or for any other cause, 
     <lb/>
     no Address of the kind should go to the 
     <lb/>
     Queen, he should have said so by voting 
     <lb/>
    against it. But he did not say that; on 
     <lb/>the contrary, he said that there should be an 
     <lb/>Address to the Queen, praying Her to lay a 
     <lb/>measure before the Imperial Parliament— 
     <lb/>that measure to contain a Constitution for 
     <lb/>these colonies, and that Constitution to em<lb break="no"/>brace all the resolutions adopted by the 
     <lb/>Quebec Conference; and the very next 
     <lb/>moment the hon. gentleman gets up, and 
     <lb/>like the boy who builds up and then knocks 
     <lb/>down a house of cards, moves an Address to 
     <lb/>the Governor General, praying him not to 
     <lb/>send that Address to the Queen, and thus 
     <lb/>defeats the very motion for which he voted. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) He voted first that this 
     <lb/>House should address the Queen, and then 
     <lb/>by his motion says that it shall not address 
     <lb/>the Queen at all, but that this House shall 
     <lb/>be dissolved, and that there shall be an 
     <lb/>election, and then that another House shall 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     address the Queen. (Hear, hear.) After 
     <lb/>
     voting that this House shall address the 
     <lb/>
     Queen, it seems to me to be little less than an 
     <lb/>
     insult to Her Majesty to say that the House 
     <lb/>
     shall be deprived of all possibility of passing 
     <lb/>
     the Address, and that a future, not this Par<lb break="no"/>liament, shall do so. It seems to me that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend's inconsistency is clear, palpable, 
     <lb/>
     and beyond all doubt. (Hear, hear.) Sir, 
     <lb/>
     I shall not enter into the question as to the 
     <lb/>
     reference of this subject to the people. The 
     <lb/>
     small paragraph I have read from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     LEATHAM'S speech contains very shortly the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom of ages, and I might appeal, if further 
     <lb/>
     testimony were required, to all the great men 
     <lb/>
     who have acted on the political stage of Eng<lb break="no"/>land. Mr. PITT scouted at the idea; and it 
     <lb/>
     was never countenanced by any of the great 
     <lb/>
     public men of England. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     says that at the time of the union of 
     <lb/>
     England and Scotland, there was a distinct 
     <lb/>
     reference to the people of Scotland. It is 
     <lb/>
     true that proclamations were issued, calling 
     <lb/>
     upon the people to elect representatives from 
     <lb/>
     the boroughs on the question of union with 
     <lb/>
     England; but the hon. gentleman knows 
     <lb/>
     very well that Scotland had no free repre<lb break="no"/>sentative institutions at that time—he knows 
     <lb/>
     that until the passage of the Reform Bill, 
     <lb/>
     elective institutions were only a mockery in 
     <lb/>
     Scotland. The boroughs were in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of close corporations, who elected whom they 
     <lb/>
     pleased, and it was quite impossible to obtain, 
     <lb/>
     by such means as an election afforded, a true 
     <lb/>
     expression of the opinion of the people of 
     <lb/>
     that country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—The counties were 
     <lb/>
     the same. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—There 
     <lb/>
     was no country—although the people had a 
     <lb/>
     free and manly spirit—that had a more re<lb break="no"/>stricted constitution than Scotland till the 
     <lb/>
     year 1832. But the hon. gentleman ought to 
     <lb/>
     have looked upon the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     question, and told the House whether there 
     <lb/>
     was an election in England on the question 
     <lb/>
     of the union with Scotland. There was not, 
     <lb/>
     sir, and the idea would have been scouted 
     <lb/>
     by the leading minds of England had it been 
     <lb/>
    proposed. (Hear, hear.) Sir, when the 
     <lb/>Imperial Parliament passed the Septennial 
     <lb/>Bill to save England from the disastrous 
     <lb/>consequences of the reign of the STUARTS— 
     <lb/>for although a Highlandman, I say they 
     <lb/>were disastrous—when the members who 
     <lb/>were elected for three years declared them<lb break="no"/>selves elected for seven, without going to 
     <lb/>the people; and when the union with Ireland 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1007" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1007.jpg"/>

     was accomplished without a reference to the 
     <lb/>
     people, did any one say that these things 
     <lb/>
     were unconstitutional ? Has my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     not shown that Sir ROBERT PEEL, who was 
     <lb/>
     the great protector of the liberties of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, quoted these proceedings with 
     <lb/>
     approbation, as showing what the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons could do if it chose. And so 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Montmorency 
     <lb/>
     quoted the language of WILLIAM PITT, 
     <lb/>
     who, although his name in late days was con<lb break="no"/>nected with some things which did not meet 
     <lb/>
     the approbation of his party, was the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Conservative party, and carried through 
     <lb/>
     to his deathbed the principles of his father 
     <lb/>
     the Earl of CHATHAM. He was supported 
     <lb/>
     by his party and by all the leading whigs 
     <lb/>
     when he made his speech on the Irish union, 
     <lb/>
     in which he alleged that the Irish Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment had full power to vote away those rights 
     <lb/>
     which it was elected to preserve. His lan<lb break="no"/>guage was quoted by the honorable member, 
     <lb/>
     and did time permit, I would read it again 
     <lb/>
     to the House, for it is the language of wisdom 
     <lb/>
     and truth. My honorable friend from Peel 
     <lb/>
     says—" Oh, that is all very well, but this is 
     <lb/>
     quite a different thing from the Irish union, 
     <lb/>
     because we have only a limited Constitution 
     <lb/>
     under our Constitutional Act." That is quite 
     <lb/>
     true, but Ireland as well as this country had 
     <lb/>
     only a limited Constitution, under which not 
     <lb/>
     even a measure of supply could be laid before 
     <lb/>
     the Irish Parliament unless it had previously 
     <lb/>
     been sent to the English Government, ap<lb break="no"/>proved, and then sent back for the approval 
     <lb/>
     and sanction of the Irish Parliament ; and it 
     <lb/>
     was not till 1782 that this was changed, and 
     <lb/>
     the reference to England of such measures 
     <lb/>
     done away with. My honorable friend refers 
     <lb/>
     us to the language of the Constitutional Act 
     <lb/>
     to show how limited our Constitution is ; but 
     <lb/>
     by that act we are empowered, in the widest 
     <lb/>
     language that could be employed, to make 
     <lb/>
     laws for the peace, welfare and good govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the people of Canada. There could 
     <lb/>
     be no larger powers conferred upon us, and 
     <lb/>
     although it is quite true that our political 
     <lb/>
     existence is only statutory, that constitution<lb break="no"/>ally our judges have no right to commit for 
     <lb/>
     contempt, and that we have no prescriptive 
     <lb/>
     rights such as those which the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament possesses, yet this is equally true— 
     <lb/>
     that we stand, with regard to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, precisely in the same position as the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons in England stands with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the people of England. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And no man who values representative 
     <lb/>
     government would consent to sit here under 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     a less extensive commission—no man will get 
     <lb/>
     up and disclaim the possession of such 
     <lb/>
     powers. But my honorable friend says we 
     <lb/>
     can only pass resolutions, and cannot 
     <lb/>
     change our Constitution except by ad<lb break="no"/>dressing the Sovereign, praying Her to give 
     <lb/>
     them effect through the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment ; and he argues from this that we 
     <lb/>
     ought to go to the people and have a new 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to do it. A new Parliament 
     <lb/>
     can, however, do nothing more than we can 
     <lb/>
     do. Sir, I believe in my conscience, that 
     <lb/>
     this House, more than any House since 
     <lb/>
     1841, represents truly and faithfully the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada. If the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House do not represent the country—all its 
     <lb/>
     interests, classes, and communities—it never 
     <lb/>
     has been represented. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     believe that all classes and interests are 
     <lb/>
     represented here ; but if the House votes for 
     <lb/>
     this motion, it declares that it does not re<lb break="no"/>present them. (Hear, hear.) If we repre<lb break="no"/>sent the people of Canada, then, in the 
     <lb/>
     words of the Constitutional Act, we are here 
     <lb/>
     to pass laws for the peace, welfare and good 
     <lb/>
     government of the country. But if we do 
     <lb/>
     not represent the people of Canada—if we 
     <lb/>
     declare so by passing this resolution—then 
     <lb/>
     what great criminals have we been in the 
     <lb/>
     past ! If we do not represent them, if we 
     <lb/>
     have no right to represent them, then we 
     <lb/>
     have no power to pass one single bill and 
     <lb/>
     declare it to be law, even although it be 
     <lb/>
     a bill to establish a saw-mill. If we do not 
     <lb/>
     represent the people of Canada, we have no 
     <lb/>
     right to be here. But if we do represent 
     <lb/>
     them, we have a right to see for them, 
     <lb/>
     to think for them, to act for them; we have 
     <lb/>
     a right to go to the foot of the Throne 
     <lb/>
     and declare that we believe it to be for the 
     <lb/>
     peace, welfare and good government of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada to form of these provinces 
     <lb/>
     one empire, presenting an unbroken and un<lb break="no"/>daunted front to every foe ; and if we do 
     <lb/>
     not think we have this right, we are un<lb break="no"/>worthy of the commission we have received 
     <lb/>
     from the people of Canada. (Hear, hear, 
     <lb/>
     and cheers.)

     Hon. Atty. Gen. West a word of explanation. 
     <lb/>
     I was not so fortunate as to be in Parliament 
     <lb/>
     in 1861, and I have never happened to read 
     <lb/>
     the speech from which he quoted. I should 
     <lb/>
     be very sorry to misrepresent him, and per<lb break="no"/>haps I would have misrepresented him in 
     <lb/>
     making the statement I did, if I had read 
     <lb/>
     that speech. But I think he will bear me 
     <lb/>
     out in this, that at the British American 
     <lb/>
     League, some fifteen years ago, he did vote 
     <lb/>
     and speak in favor of a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD1">HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD</persName>—My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend is mistaken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—That body, at all 
     <lb/>
     events, did pass certain resolutions in favor 
     <lb/>
     of a legislative union. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     was a member of that body, and either voted 
     <lb/>
     for or against those resolutions—he can 
     <lb/>
     say which. My impression is that he sup<lb break="no"/>ported them. At all events, he will not 
     <lb/>
     deny that last session, in the debate on 
     <lb/>
     the Address, or on the motion of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for South Oxford, he did 
     <lb/>
     express an opinion in favor of a Legislative 
     <lb/>
     union, as distinguished from a Federal union. 
     <lb/>
     It was shortly before the change of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and there was some difference between 
     <lb/>
     the two honorable gentlemen—the Hon. At<lb break="no"/>torney General East and the Hon. Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General West—who were then sitting 
     <lb/>
     on this side. And in the committee, formed 
     <lb/>
     on the motion of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford, the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
      West voted against the Federative system, 
     <lb/>
     and declared himself in favor of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive system in contradistinction to the other, 
     <lb/>
     and my impression was that he had uniformly 
     <lb/>
     held that ground. It now appears that in his 
     <lb/>
     speech of 1861 he shews that at that time he 
     <lb/>
     contemplated the possibility of a modified sort 
     <lb/>
     of Federation—a Federation very different, 
     <lb/>
     however, from the joint authority of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for South Oxford, who argues 
     <lb/>
     that this is the very measure of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion of 1859.

     <lb/>
     I did with reference to the speech of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West in 1861. (Cries of "Go 
     <lb/>
     on !") Hon. gentlemen opposite are rather 
     <lb/>
     difficult to please. Not long since, when the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council was not in such 
     <lb/>
     good humor as he is just now, he complained 
     <lb/>
     that I inflicted myself too often on the House. 
     <lb/>
     Now they insist that I shall speak. (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) I had intended to at some length 
     <lb/>
     on the general election. I came down to 
     <lb/>
     this House this afternoon, intending to speak 
     <lb/>
     at some length, but I confess that the view sug<lb break="no"/>gested by the Hon. Attorney General West had 
     <lb/>
     occurred to me, that it was not desirable on 
     <lb/>
     this motion to reopen the whole debate. 
     <lb/>
     And when my hon. friend and leader beside 
     <lb/>
     me (Hon. Mr. DORION) got up, after I had 
     <lb/>
     intimated my intention to speak, and stated, 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of those who act with him—and I 
     <lb/>
     am a good party man, I follow my leader— 
     <lb/>
     that we had no desire to reopen the debate, 
     <lb/>
     but wished this matter to be got through to<lb break="no"/>night, I decided to waive my speech, believing 
     <lb/>
     that my views on all points of this scheme are 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently well known. (Laughter.) But 
     <lb/>
     I beg to assure hon. gentlemen that if on any 
     <lb/>
     point of the scheme they have any doubt as 
     <lb/>
     to what my views are, I shall answer any 
     <lb/>
     questions they may choose to put, as distinctly 
     <lb/>
     and as concisely as I can. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—My honor<lb break="no"/>able friend has correctly stated the intention 
     <lb/>
     arrived at by this side of the House. It was 
     <lb/>
     not our intention to make any lengthened 
     <lb/>
     observations on the motion before the House. 
     <lb/>
     But honorable gentlemen opposite have not 
     <lb/>
     followed the rule they laid down with respect 
     <lb/>
     to this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—I did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Well, I think 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable President of the Council made 
     <lb/>
     a considerable speech to-night, and impressed 
     <lb/>
     his conclusions so strongly on the House as 
     <lb/>
     almost to drive away an ideas we may have 
     <lb/>
     had as to what we should say. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     I was rather struck by the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the Honorable Attorney General West took 
     <lb/>
     credit to himself for having refrained from 
     <lb/>
     insisting on objections on the ground of order 
     <lb/>
     to the motion of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Peel, after he had declared that he would 
     <lb/>
     avail himself of all parliamentary usages to 
     <lb/>
     prevent that motion being put. But the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman forgets that English 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1009" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1009.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1009</fw>
          
     authority, as well as former decisions in this 
     <lb/>
    House, sustain the motion of the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Peel. In 1843, when an Address 
     <lb/>was passed in this House, sustaining the stand 
     <lb/>whic Hon. Mr. BALDWIN had taken, in Sir 
     <lb/>CHARLES METCALFE'S time—after it had 
     <lb/>passed, an amendment to the Address was 
     <lb/>moved, but the Speaker who occupied your 
     <lb/>place ruled the motion to be out of order, and 
     <lb/>an appeal being made to the House, the House 
     <lb/>sustained the appeal, and the Address was 
     <lb/>amended by the passing of an amendment 
     <lb/>moved by Mr. BOULTON. I say, then, that 
     <lb/>the Honorable Attorney General West need 
     <lb/>not have taken credit to himself for not 
     <lb/>having appealed against the decision of the 
     <lb/>Chair, because he must have known that the 
     <lb/>authorities were against him. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The honorable gentleman is no doubt pos<lb break="no"/>sessed of astuteness. No one can manifest 
     <lb/>greater astuteness than he displays in adapt<lb break="no"/>ing himself to any new position in which he 
     <lb/>may find himself. There is not a public man 
     <lb/>in the country who has maintained his ground 
     <lb/>so long, in opposition to so many public 
     <lb/>questions on which he has at last submitted 
     <lb/>to change his opinions, and which he has 
     <lb/>finally carried in some shape or other, with 
     <lb/>the aid of his opponents. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Was not the secularization of the Clergy 
     <lb/>Reserves opposed by that honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>from the time he came into Parliament in 
     <lb/>1844, until 1854—a period of ten years? 
     <lb/>Did he not declare it was a spoliation of 
     <lb/>church property? Did he not oppose the 
     <lb/>demand to have the seigniors deprived of 
     <lb/>their rights ? Did he not call that a spolia<lb break="no"/>tion also? Did he not oppose the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of the elective principle into the 
     <lb/>Legislative Council? Did he not, by his 
     <lb/>speeches and by his votes, declare it was a 
     <lb/>republican movement, and that we might as 
     <lb/>well give up the Constitution of this coun<lb break="no"/>try and adopt that of the United States, 
     <lb/>as have an elected Legislative Council? 
     <lb/>But after having battled for ten years 
     <lb/>against these questions—the abolition of the 
     <lb/>Seigniorial tenure, and the elective Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council—questions which caused 
     <lb/>the rebellion in Lower Canada—and that 
     <lb/>of the Clergy Reserves, which Lord 
     <lb/>SYDENHAM declared to be the cause of 
     <lb/>the rebellion in Upper Canada—questions 
     <lb/>which shook the foundations of society, and 
     <lb/>brought, not only civil strife, but war—the 
     <lb/>honorable gentleman gave up the opposition 
     <lb/>he had maintained for ten years, and in order 
     <lb/>to get a seat on the Treasury benches, and to 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     keep his party in power, tamely submitted, 
     <lb/>
     and subjected himself to the humiliation of 
     <lb/>
     carrying out these measures. Yet he claims 
     <lb/>
     to have been consistent! Those three great 
     <lb/>
     questions—and others which had occupied 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the country, and had caused 
     <lb/>
     the greatest political antagonism between 
     <lb/>
     parties—those questions were carried by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman, by acting on that side of 
     <lb/>
     the House with the very parties to whom he 
     <lb/>
     had been opposed in those questions ; and 
     <lb/>
     with the aid of renegade reformers, he was 
     <lb/>
     permitted for nearly ten years to keep pos<lb break="no"/>session of the Treasury benches. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I am sorry to see that the same course 
     <lb/>
     has been pursued in the formation of this 
     <lb/>
     Government. What was done in 1854 was 
     <lb/>
     repeated in 1864. (Hear, hear.)

     point in discussion—that of the propriety of

     referring this matter to the people—went off

     on another tack, and on several tacks. I 
     <lb/>
     never witnessed a more excruciating lashing 
     <lb/>
     than he administered to the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel. He ridiculed the whole of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman's motion. But be ad<lb break="no"/>ministered one consolation which, no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman found to be palatable.

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>

     These words have in them a peculiar charm

     in the estimation of the Hon.Attorney General 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     West, who ought to show us where he has 
     <lb/>
     found, in the practice of the English Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, a scheme of this kind introduced, then 
     <lb/>
     he might say that the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Peel is wrong ; but when he brings in a 
     <lb/>
     measure that is at variance with English 
     <lb/>
     principles and practice, then I think we are 
     <lb/>
     at liberty to try to find ways and means for 
     <lb/>
     submitting it for the approval of the people. 
     <lb/>
     If it is parliamentary usage for the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to come down to this House, and, with  
     <lb/>
     the assistance of their political supporters, 
     <lb/>
     suddenly to change our Constitution, and take 
     <lb/>
     away our liberties, then, forsooth, are we not 
     <lb/>
     to take our own course as to whether or not 
     <lb/>
     we shall ask that their measure shall be 
     <lb/>
     referred to those who sent us here ? The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General West scouts the idea 
     <lb/>
     of our being delegated only to work under the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution that we have. He forgets that 
     <lb/>
     when we make laws under our Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     we can change them ourselves at any time; 
     <lb/>
     but when we make a Constitution, and have 
     <lb/>
     it ratified by the Imperial Government, it 
     <lb/>
     does not lie in our power to change it by a 
     <lb/>
     simple resolution of this House. He dwelt 
     <lb/>
     strongly on his belief that we were the <choice><sic>repre<lb break="no"/>tative</sic><corr>representative</corr></choice> men of our constituencies, and that 
     <lb/>
     through us the people had a voice in this 
     <lb/>
     House. Well, if we were legislating for 
     <lb/>
     ourselves, and for our own people, under our 
     <lb/>
     Constitution as it stands, then I admit that 
     <lb/>
     we would be fully justified in carrying out 
     <lb/>
     any scheme that we might deem essential for 
     <lb/>
     the welfare of the province at large, or for any 
     <lb/>
     portion of it; but when he carries that 
     <lb/>
     principle so far as to say that we ought not to 
     <lb/>
     vote for having a measure of this kind— 
     <lb/>
     which will affect other provinces as well as 
     <lb/>
     our own—referred to the people, then, I say, 
     <lb/>
     he carries the principle to a most unwarrant<lb break="no"/>able length. (Hear, hear.) What can he 
     <lb/>
     advance in justification of such a course? 
     <lb/>
     He talks about it being unconstitutional. 
     <lb/>
     Why, they understand constitutional law in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, or ought to understand it as well 
     <lb/>
     as we do. But when we point to Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     Ministers tell us that that province does not 
     <lb/>
     make laws for us.

       the people of  New Brunswick, sir, are they so 
     <lb/>
    far behind the age as not to understand how 
     <lb/>  to manage their own affairs? We went down 
     <lb/>   to ask them to assist us to get out of our 
     <lb/> difficulties, though this object his, at first, 
     <lb/>somewhat disguised. When they began to 
     <lb/>realize that it was to save us that, the <choice><sic>Confor<lb break="no"/>ence</sic><corr>Conference</corr></choice> took place, and was not organized for 
     <lb/>the purpose of benefiting them, the people of 
     <lb/>that province, if not the Government, refused 
     <lb/> to recognise and support the procedings of 
     <lb/> the Conference, Now, if we had not the fact 
     <lb/>of the Lower Provinces having exercised their 
     <lb/>rights and privileges, we should have no 
     <lb/>chance whatever to appeal to precedents. And 
     <lb/>if the, loyal people and governments of the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces—people who are one day de<lb break="no"/>clared to be loyal and the next annexationists<lb/> 
               <lb/>and under American influence, according to<lb/>their being for or against this scheme-if<lb/> 
               <lb/>they do not know what are their rights, or 
     <lb/>in what manner to deal with this project, I 
     <lb/>think we had better teach them. I cannot 
     <lb/>help, however, feeling the conviction,after. 
     <lb/>the character given of them by the Hon. 
     <lb/>Minister of Agriculture, that it is just as 
     <lb/> well we have got rid of them. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>But if, on the contrary, they are an intel<lb break="no"/>ligent people, and possess an intelligent 
     <lb/>Government, and that Government has 
     <lb/>  adopted the course of referring that measure 
     <lb/>to the people, how can it be improper for us 
     <lb/>to advocate the same thing in Canada? 
     <lb/>Who are the hon. gentlemen that arrogate 
     <lb/> to themselves the right of telling us that 
     <lb/>we cannot exercise our privileges in this 
     <lb/>House, in voting in such a manner as we 
     <lb/>think best and most conducive to the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the people whom we represent ? 
     <lb/>Those honorable gentlement tell us that the 
     <lb/>motion of the hon. member for Peel is a 
     <lb/>most extraordinary one, in the face of the 
     <lb/>fact that the majority of these same gentle<lb break="no"/>men were voted out of office by this House 
     <lb/>only a short-time ago, and that since then no 
     <lb/>appeal has been made to the people. There 
     <lb/>  would be nothing very strange if they were 
     <lb/>  voted out again.  (Hear, hear.) The Hon. 
     <lb/>Attorney General told the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Peel, thought not in so many words, that he 
     <lb/>did not know what he was about ; and in the 
     <lb/>course of the same speech remarked that if     
     <lb/>he wanted an argumentative, clear-headed, 
     <lb/> methodical and able speech, he could not 
     <lb/>have chosen a better one than he delivered 
     <lb/>by the hon. member for Peel.  Now, I think 
     <lb/>that that is one of the coolest remarks I have 
     <lb/>ever heard from an attorny general in this<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     House. He rejoiced that the speech bore so  
     <lb/>
    strongly in opposition to the views of this side 
     <lb/>of the House, and then states that the hon. 
     <lb/>gehtleman did not really know the effect of 
     <lb/>his own motion. If the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Peel thinks that is flattering, then I must 
     <lb/>say that he  is easily satisfied. The hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman, however, I think, made out a 
     <lb/>very good case in favor of his amendment.  
     <lb/>His language may not, be such as we have 
     <lb/>frequently heard in this House during the  
     <lb/>past few days ; but it is such as we generally 
     <lb/>hear on the hustings. When honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen appear there previous to their 
     <lb/>election, they  have no hesitation in saying 
     <lb/>that, if elected, they will go to Parliament 
     <lb/>for the purpose of  carrying out the wishes 
     <lb/>of their constituents. I am sure my hon. 
     <lb/>friend from Peel has :often, and" warmly, 
     <lb/>denounced the invasion; of the rights of the 
     <lb/>Church of England ; the Clergy Reserves 
     <lb/>were being secularized, and I well remember 
     <lb/>that a motion was made in this House to the 
     <lb/>effect that before that measure should 
     <lb/>become law; it ought to be referred to the 
     <lb/>people ; though that was a measure that only 
     <lb/>concerned our own internal afiairs, we did 
     <lb/>not hear, at that time, a word about the 
     <lb/>unconstitutionality of referring it to the 
     <lb/>people. The Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>Council has often declared that no govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be supported which did not 
     <lb/>pledge itself to bring in a measure for 
     <lb/>granting representation according to popula<lb break="no"/>tion ; but it is infinitely worse to support  
     <lb/>a government which proposes to take 
     <lb/>away our Constitution, and at the same 
     <lb/>time deprive the people of having a voice in 
     <lb/>reference to it. My view of one of the 
     <lb/>duties of a representative is this : when a 
     <lb/>man goes voluntarily before the people, and  
     <lb/>tells them that he will vote against such and 
     <lb/>such measures, and then comes here and. 
     <lb/>votes in the contrary direction, it is his duty 
     <lb/>to resign ; for no man of spirit would stand 
     <lb/>up in this House after violating the prom<lb break="no"/>ises he had made to the people. My hon. 
     <lb/>friend the Hon. Attorney General West 
     <lb/>says it is not constitutional to take a vote 
     <lb/>in the way proposed by the honorable 
     <lb/>member for North Ontario. Sir, I am 
     <lb/>as anxious to maintain the Constitution 
     <lb/>of this country as any one can be ; but 
     <lb/>when a motion of this nature comes up, 
     <lb/>I care not how the vote is to be taken, it 
     <lb/>shall have my support. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>has violated the British Constitution in 
     <lb/>bringing in this measure, and as he has 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1012" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1012.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1012</fw>
           
     done so, I am prepared to vote in any man<lb break="no"/>ner in which the expression of the people 
     <lb/>
     can be had upon it, before we legislate away 
     <lb/>
     their rights and their Constitution. I am 
     <lb/>
     astonished to find that there is such a desire 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the members of this House to 
     <lb/>
     oppose the motion for submitting the ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the country.   It is said that there 
     <lb/>
     is something behind the scenes to account 
     <lb/>
     for such singular conduct. Of these we get 
     <lb/>
     glimpses from day to day. Some of those 
     <lb/>
     reasons are patent to every one. One of 
     <lb/>
     those is that the Coalition which has been 
     <lb/>
     formed out of the most incongruous mate<lb break="no"/>rials, is supported by the greatest medley of 
     <lb/>
     politicians anybody ever saw. Of course, it 
     <lb/>
     is to be supposed that we will have an elec<lb break="no"/>tion before another year is out. Members 
     <lb/>
     now supporting the Treasury benches, with 
     <lb/>
     some of whom I have worked for many 
     <lb/>
     years, have suffered very much from expensive 
     <lb/>
     elections through which they have been called 
     <lb/>
     upon to pass in that period. I know it is 
     <lb/>
     very unpalatable that they should have to go 
     <lb/>
     back again for reelection, after voting here 
     <lb/>
     against the express wishes of their constitu<lb break="no"/>ents. Under this Coalition arrangement 
     <lb/>
     they evidently expect that they will be able 
     <lb/>
     to go to their constituencies and be returned 
     <lb/>
     by acclamation, because the two extremes— 
     <lb/>
     abandoning their old principles—coalesced. 
     <lb/>
     But it is a vain hope, sir. Let the elections 
     <lb/>
     for North Ontario and the town of Niagara 
     <lb/>
     tell how unfounded is the expectation. The 
     <lb/>
     failure of the Hon. Provincial Secretary 
     <lb/>
     was the first failure, and I may here say 
     <lb/>
    that I was sorry to see the breach of faith 
     <lb/>committed towards him on the part of the 
     <lb/>conservatives of that riding; but I am 
     <lb/>happy to see that he has got over it very 
     <lb/>comfortably by obtaining another county, 
     <lb/>which I hope he may long be enabled to 
     <lb/>keep. Notwithstanding this, however, they 
     <lb/>yet cling to the vain hope of a triumph 
     <lb/>when they next go before the people; but 
     <lb/>I am very much mistaken if the indignant 
     <lb/>voice of several constituencies will not urge 
     <lb/>some strong candidate against each of them, 
     <lb/>nor have I a doubt that the fact that these 
     <lb/>gentlemen endeavor to secure themselves 
     <lb/>from going to the people now by voting 
     <lb/>away the Constitution and the rights of the 
     <lb/>people, will furnish many of them an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to find their political graves.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Sir, it has been my misfortune to 
     <lb/>have been nearly nineteen years of my 
     <lb/>political life in the cold shades of opposition 
     <lb/>but I am satisfied to stay an infinitely longer  
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     period on this side of the House, if that 
     <lb/>
     shall be the effect of my contending for the 
     <lb/>
     views which I have just expressed. I have 
     <lb/>
     always believed that I was here for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of representing the constituency which 
     <lb/>
     sent me, fund not for the purpose of mis<lb break="no"/>representing them. If I were satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     I did not properly represent my constituency 
     <lb/>
     on any leading question coming before this 
     <lb/>
     House, I would scorn to sit here a moment 
     <lb/>
     longer than was absolutely necessary, until 
     <lb/>
     I could do so by their approval. But, sir, 
     <lb/>
     are there not members here who know full 
     <lb/>
     well that their conduct has been condemned  
     <lb/>
     by their constituents in the most unmistak<lb break="no"/>able manner ? And yet these hon. members 
     <lb/>
     rise up and express their virtuous indigna<lb break="no"/>tion at our contending that the people 
     <lb/>
     should have a voice in reference to the  
     <lb/>
     adoption of this new Constitution.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOB1">MR. SCOBLE</persName>—Do you mean any honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman from Upper Canada ?

     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Well, Mr.  
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I do not desire to be personal,  
     <lb/>
     and, therefore, I shall make no pointed  
     <lb/>
     references ; but I see a number of gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     before me whom, I think, the cap will fit 
     <lb/>
     admirably. Sir, I think it is most monstrous 
     <lb/>
     that this House should refuse the people an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of expressing themselves before 
     <lb/>
     their Constitution is taken away from them. 
     <lb/>
     I am delighted that I have the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of voting for this motion. I vote for it 
     <lb/>
     because it is in accordance with the expres<lb break="no"/>sion of devotion to the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     people, which every honorable member feels 
     <lb/>
     when standing before his constituents. He 
     <lb/>
     has no hesitation, then, in declaring that he 
     <lb/>
     will seek to represent their views, instead of 
     <lb/>
     seeking to accomplish other objects than 
     <lb/>
     those which he has been delegated to pro<lb break="no"/>mote. If there has been one question more 
     <lb/>
     than another before this House for the last 
     <lb/>
     quarter of a century, upon which the views 
     <lb/>
     of the people ought to be clearly and dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly ascertained it is upon this proposal 
     <lb/>to destroy our Constitution ; and if gentle<lb break="no"/>men will vote against it; then I hope that 
     <lb/>at the next general election, the people will 
     <lb/>pass such a judgement upon them as will<lb/>prevent any such scheme  ever being pro<lb break="no"/>

     <persName ref="pers:FERG2">MR. T. R. FERGUSON</persName> said—I have 
     <lb/>
     listened very attentively to the discussion on 
     <lb/>
     this question, and it is certainly most singu<lb break="no"/>lar, as well as amusing, to hear the different 
     <lb/>
     views that have been expressed upon it by 
     <lb/>
     the advocates of the amendment. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel, I am certain, felt that 
     <lb/>
     his resolution was the most consistent and 
     <lb/>
     reasonable one that could have been well 
     <lb/>
     introduced on the subject. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Ontario, who seconded the 
     <lb/>
     motion, also, no doubt, thought it a very 
     <lb/>
     sensible one. I listened carefully to the 
     <lb/>
      arguments of both, and I find that they sup<lb break="no"/>ported the motion from very different points 
     <lb/>
     of view. The hon. member for Peel made 
     <lb/>
     a strong speech in favor of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation which has been adopted by 
     <lb/>
     this House, and he said he introduced his 
     <lb/>
     motion for the purpose of having the people 
     <lb/>
     vote upon it, and with the expectation that 
     <lb/>
     they would carry it by a very large majority. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for North Ontario took a 
     <lb/>
     very different view of the effect of the reso<lb break="no"/>lution, stating that he seconded it because he 
     <lb/>
     believed it would result in defeating the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I think the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member is quite mistaken. All I said 
     <lb/>
     was that I wished the people to have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of expressing themselves, so 
     <lb/>
     that we might ascertain whether or not they 
     <lb/>
     would prefer it to a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FERG2">MR. T. R. FERGUSON</persName>—I beg my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's pardon ; but that was not the object 
     <lb/>
     and aim the hon. gentleman had in view in 
     <lb/>
     seconding the motion. If his object was 
     <lb/>
     not to have the scheme rejected, then I 
     <lb/>
     cannot understand his language at all. .I 
     <lb/>
     seldom agree with the views of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council ; but on this 
     <lb/>
     occasion, I think he pointed out the 
     <lb/>
     inconsistencies of the hon. member for Peel 
     <lb/>
     in an excellent manner. But there are a 
     <lb/>
     few more left untouched, to some of which 
     <lb/>
     I will briefly allude. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Peel declared that his motion was designed 
     <lb/>
     to secure the approval of the people, and 
     <lb/>
     that it would result in their approval of the 
     <lb/>
     formation of a new nationality. The 
     <lb/>
     seconder of the motion supported it because 
     <lb/>
     it was designed to secure the condemnation 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme, and, prevent us from obtain<lb break="no"/>ing that new nationality. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel stated that he was in favor of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     having a dissolution of Parliament, so that 
     <lb/>
     a constitutional expression could be had 
     <lb/>
     through a general election. Now, for 
     <lb/>
     my own part, I doubt whether, if 
     <lb/>
     there were a dissolution of this House 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow, we would get a full, true and fair 
     <lb/>
     expression of opinion from the people at 
     <lb/>
     all. I believe that side-issues would creep 
     <lb/>
     in in every case—that the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party would hang together in most instances, 
     <lb/>
     and the Reform party do the same, and that 
     <lb/>
     numerous local questions would interfere 
     <lb/>
     with the results sought to be obtained. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from North Ontario declares 
     <lb/>
     himself in favor of having a direct vote of 
     <lb/>
     the people. Were it not that that is declar<lb break="no"/>ed an unconstitutional method, I should say 
     <lb/>
     it was the only true course to be adopted, 
     <lb/>
     because it is the only way of properly 
     <lb/>
     testing public opinion on any one measure. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel is one of the cleverest men in the 
     <lb/>
     province, but I must say that my experience 
     <lb/>
     with regard to his movements in Parliament 
     <lb/>
     is that he does not exhibit himself in any<lb break="no"/>thing like so clever or successful a manner 
     <lb/>
     as he does when pleading at the bar. I 
     <lb/>
     have never seen him taking a prominent 
     <lb/>
     position in this House, and playing his part 
     <lb/>
     in that position in a successful manner. If 
     <lb/>
     he had moved his amendment before the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions were adopted, I would have been 
     <lb/>
     able to have given him credit for sincerity, 
     <lb/>
     if not for ability, in advocating it ; but 
     <lb/>
     after the resolutions have been passed, 
     <lb/>
     he brings up an amendment to another 
     <lb/>
     motion that is evidently hostile to the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions. Well now, let us take a look at the 
     <lb/>
     assertions of the hon. member for Cornwall, 
     <lb/>
     and I think we will be able to see the incon<lb break="no"/>sistency still more clearly. The position he 
     <lb/>
     takes is, that if these resolutions are referred 
     <lb/>
     to the people, and are by them voted down, 
     <lb/>
     every honorable member who voted for them 
     <lb/>
     in this House must immediately resign his 
     <lb/>
     seat. Now, sir, what would be the result of 
     <lb/>
     that principle as affecting the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     who moved and the hon. member who 
     <lb/>
     seconded the amendment now in your hands ? 
     <lb/>
     Why, sir, instead of having them both on 
     <lb/>
     the floor of this House to carry out the views 
     <lb/>
     of the people, one of them certainly must 
     <lb/>
     leave, if the views of the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Cornwall are carried out. I think every 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman must see clearly that 
     <lb/>
     whatever way you view the positions taken 
     <lb/>
     by the mover and seconder of this amend<lb break="no"/>ment, their course bears a contradiction on 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="1014" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1014.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1014</fw>
            
     the very face of it. And what would be 
     <lb/>
     the result of a general election ? Those 
     <lb/>
     two honorable gentlemen, holding such dis<lb break="no"/>similar views with regard to the motion 
     <lb/>
     upon which they have agreed, would go to 
     <lb/>
     the country pulling different wires. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel will use his best 
     <lb/>
     endeavors to influence public opinion in such 
     <lb/>
     a manner that it will ratify the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     in favor of a Federal union, while the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who seconded the motion will go 
     <lb/>
     to the people with the very reverse idea. 
     <lb/>
     So you will find these two hon. gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     who have joined so cordially to bring this 
     <lb/>
     motion before the House, will disagree on 
     <lb/>
     every point the moment after it would be car<lb break="no"/>ried, and cause the utmost confusion among 
     <lb/>
     the people. I cannot understand the matter 
     <lb/>
     at all. I do not see how they can defend 
     <lb/>
     their consistencies, either before this House 
     <lb/>
     or before the country. There was not a 
     <lb/>
     single word said by the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council or the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West, with reference to the inconsistency of 
     <lb/>
     those two hon. gentlemen, to which every 
     <lb/>
     one in this House will not cordially assent. 
     <lb/>
     We voted by a large majority, the other night, 
     <lb/>
     in favor of those resolutions. I was in favor, 
     <lb/>
     when I came here, of having the question 
     <lb/>
     referred to the people; and I only wish that 
     <lb/>
     such could be yet done; but when I came to 
     <lb/>
     understand the emergencies by which we 
     <lb/>
     were surrounded, and saw that we were 
     <lb/>
     threatened with the loss of the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     treaty and the bonded system, in addition to 
     <lb/>
     the continuation of the passport system, and 
     <lb/>
     were also threatened with the putting of 
     <lb/>
     American gunboats on the lakes, and without 
     <lb/>
     access to the seaboard except upon and by 
     <lb/>
     sufferance of the United States Government, 
     <lb/>
     I came to the conclusion that it was impor<lb break="no"/>tant for us to take such steps as would pro<lb break="no"/>cure, in the shortest manner possible, the 
     <lb/>
     assistance of English money, English sol<lb break="no"/>diers and English gunboats for our defence, 
     <lb/>
     and that, therefore, there was the most urgent 
     <lb/>
     necessity for sending some members of the 
     <lb/>
     Government home to England, to bring those 
     <lb/>
     resolutions before the Imperial Parliament 
     <lb/>
     during the present session, and making such 
     <lb/>
     arrangements for our defence as it seems we 
     <lb/>
     must make. These were the reasons why I 
     <lb/>
     voted for a set of resolutions which, I am 
     <lb/>
     free to confess, I would not otherwise have 
     <lb/>
     supported. Having voted for them on Fri<lb break="no"/>day night, along with a large majority of the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House, with the full expect<lb break="no"/>ation that everything was to be hurried 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     through, and the session brought immediately 
     <lb/>
     to a close, so that the leading members of the 
     <lb/>
     Government could go on an important mis<lb break="no"/>sion to the Mother Country, I understood 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Peel to have voted with 
     <lb/>
     the same understanding. And what are we 
     <lb/>
     told now ? Why, that there is no necessity 
     <lb/>
     for haste in the matter at all ; that there 
     <lb/>
     ought to be a new election, occupying two 
     <lb/>
     months at least, before a return could be 
     <lb/>
     made. But is it seriously proposed that 
     <lb/>
     during all this time we are to remain in a 
     <lb/>
     defenceless state, and without any prospect 
     <lb/>
     of having any for another year? "Why, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman must see that the pro<lb break="no"/>posal bears such a contradiction on the very 
     <lb/>
     face of it, that he ought to withdraw it. 
     <lb/>
     These resolutions have been passed by this 
     <lb/>
     House, or they have not been passed at all. 
     <lb/>
     If they have been adopted by the Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada in a constitutional way, then in 
     <lb/>
     voting for this motion we would be only 
     <lb/>
     stultifying ourselves, mocking our constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, and insulting Her Majesty, for we 
     <lb/>
     would be putting ourselves in the most false 
     <lb/>
     and inconsistent position in which the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of any people ever placed them<lb break="no"/>selves, on this continent. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     know the honorable member for Peel laid 
     <lb/>
     down the doctrine before he voted for the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, that they ought to go to the 
     <lb/>
     people before their final consummation, and 
     <lb/>
     to that doctrine every one must assent; but 
     <lb/>
     when he voted for the resolutions, as we all 
     <lb/>
     did, on the ground that there was a necessity 
     <lb/>
     for their immediate adoption, I say it is 
     <lb/>
     clearly contradictory for him to bring up 
     <lb/>
     this motion after the resolution has been 
     <lb/>
     carried by so large a majority. I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     that he has thought fit to bring forward this 
     <lb/>
     motion at this stage of the proceedings, and 
     <lb/>
     I must say- and am sorry to have to say it 
     <lb/>
     too—that I think he has accomplished very 
     <lb/>
     little good for his party or for his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, since he has been in Parliament. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I voted for the resolutions because 
     <lb/>
     I saw there was a necessity for doing so, 
     <lb/>
     and after having thus voted cn Friday night, 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to nullify that vote on Mon— 
     <lb/>
     day night, by supporting the amendment 
     <lb/>
     which the honorable member has proposed, 
     <lb/>
     more to gratify his own notions, I fear, than 
     <lb/>
     to do the country good. It has been said— 
     <lb/>
     and very correctly said, I think—that if a 
     <lb/>
     new House should be elected, the members 
     <lb/>
     of that House would have to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     matter over, again and take another vote 
     <lb/>
     upon it. The honorable member for Corn<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="1015" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1015.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1015</fw>
          
     wall seems to desire that the question 
     <lb/>
     should be referred to the people, not by 
     <lb/>
     means of a general election, but in such 
     <lb/>
     a manner as to have a direct yea or nay 
     <lb/>
     upon it. Well, sir, if that mode were 
     <lb/>
     adopted, and the scheme were not sus<lb break="no"/>tained, most of the members of this House 
     <lb/>
     ought to go home at once and resign their 
     <lb/>
     seats. And what then? Why, sir, new 
     <lb/>
     elections would have to take place to fill 
     <lb/>
     the vacant seats, and the summer would 
     <lb/>
     be nearly gone before we should have re<lb break="no"/>turns. We should then have to explain 
     <lb/>
     matters to the newly-elected members in 
     <lb/>
     order to convince them that the measure is 
     <lb/>
     all right, and in all probability more than 
     <lb/>
     six months would transpire before we could 
     <lb/>
     record our votes upon it. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     think it would be most unadvisable to allow 
     <lb/>
     the motion now before the House to be ap<lb break="no"/>plied in either way. But, sir, I must say 
     <lb/>
     that unless the arrangements in respect to the 
     <lb/>
     local governments are made satisfactory to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada, I shall vote to 
     <lb/>
     cast them overboard. But when I look at 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the honorable gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     compose the Government are the ablest which 
     <lb/>
     both political parties could furnish, and went 
     <lb/>
     together with the approval of the large 
     <lb/>
     majority of their political followers, I think 
     <lb/>
     it is not our place to relieve them from the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility now resting upon them, of 
     <lb/>
     carrying out this measure in a manner that 
     <lb/>
     I hope will prove satisfactory to the people. 
     <lb/>
     If we took it out of their hands, we would be 
     <lb/>
     assuming a responsibility that properly per<lb break="no"/>tains to them ; and for my part, I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to leave the responsibility on their shoulders 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. If they will not do 
     <lb/>
     what is right for us, I shall take the liberty 
     <lb/>
     of recording any vote against them, and thus 
     <lb/>
     give them a practical expression of my 
     <lb/>
     opinion. (Cheers)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUNT2">HON. MR. HUNTINGTON</persName> said—I do 
     <lb/>
     not propose to occupy the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House by any lengthened remarks. I think 
     <lb/>
     it is most singular that so many honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the floor of this House should 
     <lb/>
     feel so deeply and be so anxious to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the subject upon which such great unanimity 
     <lb/>
     is said to prevail. It is strange that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen should be so full of the fire of 
     <lb/>
     speaking, that half a dozen are jumping to 
     <lb/>
     their feet at once to catch the Speaker's 
     <lb/>
     eye. (Laugher.) At a previous stage of 
     <lb/>
     the debate, I noted a number of points on 
     <lb/>
     which I desired to make some remarks, but 
     <lb/>
     I forbore. There are a few of them, how<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
     ever, that relate to the question before us 
     <lb/>
     and that, I think, ought to be brought under 
     <lb/>
     the notice of this House. I did not think 
     <lb/>
     it surprising, sir, that the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council should be the first to put in his 
     <lb/>
     oar this evening, on behalf of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. He is supposed to belong to a party 
     <lb/>
     that is deeply sensitive to public opinion, 
     <lb/>
     and the honorable gentleman himself has 
     <lb/>
     had some intimate relations with public 
     <lb/>
     opinion in Upper Canada for several years 
     <lb/>
     past; while the Honorable Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral East, who sits beside him, so far from 
     <lb/>
     caring about consulting the views of the 
     <lb/>
     country, is reported to have said at the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">dejeûner</hi> at Montreal that he did not consult 
     <lb/>
     anybody in making up his mind with regard 
     <lb/>
     to anything. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—That is 
     <lb/>
     quite correct. I do not consult anybody in 
     <lb/>
     making up my mind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUNT2">HON. MR. HUNTINGTON</persName>—I say that 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General East can afford 
     <lb/>
     to sit there and—I won't say despise—but 
     <lb/>
     disregard the views of the people, and 
     <lb/>
     arrogate to himself the right to know what 
     <lb/>
     is better for the people than they can possi<lb break="no"/>bly know themselves. But the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Oxford, when he came to put in 
     <lb/>
     his oar fairly, surprised me. I felt that he 
     <lb/>
     was entirely too severe upon my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend the member for Peel. It was easy to 
     <lb/>
     see that the strong feeling of friendship for the 
     <lb/>
     Government which he entertained prevented 
     <lb/>
     him from making his argument tell in favor 
     <lb/>
     of his position as strongly as he might have 
     <lb/>
     done. I admired the eloquence which ren<lb break="no"/>dered his speech so acceptable to the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, but I felt that he was . 
     <lb/>
     afraid of offending his friends in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. He seemed to select those hammers 
     <lb/>
     that would give the lightest blows. He ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that if an appeal to the people were 
     <lb/>
     taken, the honorable gentlemen on the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury benches would come back to their seats 
     <lb/>
     with, perhaps, even a more numerous follow<lb break="no"/>ing than now. There was one point of his 
     <lb/>
     argument that has remained unanswered. He 
     <lb/>
     said that in view of the position which the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation scheme occupied in the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, and in view of the strong expres<lb break="no"/>sion in its favor given by this House, there 
     <lb/>
     was no further need of haste — no necessity for 
     <lb/>
     pressing the resolutions further until the peo<lb break="no"/>ple should be consulted. That position has 
     <lb/>
     not been met, and cannot be met. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Sir, it is absurd to stand up, new, 
     <lb/>
     and declare that there is a panting, and a 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1016" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1016.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1016</fw>
            
     hungring and thirsting among the people for 
     <lb/>
     having this scheme put into immediate opera<lb break="no"/>tion. I do not mean to say that the scheme 
     <lb/>
     has not been talked of among the people, but 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Peel, who has been exten<lb break="no"/>sively abroad among the people, has told us 
     <lb/>
     that there is the greatest apathy in the pub<lb break="no"/>lic mind ; but, sir, that apathy does not exist 
     <lb/>
     among the people alone. I state it fearlessly, 
     <lb/>
     sir, before honorable gentlemen, without any 
     <lb/>
     fear of contradiction, that the greatest apathy 
     <lb/>
     exists in this House itself. I have seen the 
     <lb/>
     votes of honorable gentlemen counted in favor 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme, whom we all know have no 
     <lb/>
     faith in it, but who have been drawn into 
     <lb/>
     casting their vote for it by former party lean<lb break="no"/>ings. (Hear, hear.) Having come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that something must be done, and 
     <lb/>
     this being the only thing they had an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of doing, they recorded their votes for 
     <lb/>
     it. The faithlessness of the people has been 
     <lb/>
     well represented. Mr. SPEAKER, while the 
     <lb/>
     great leader of the Reform party finds it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to stand up here and throw dust in 
     <lb/>
     our eyes, by trying to make it appear that 
     <lb/>
     the people, to whose touch he has been so 
     <lb/>
     sensitive in times past, need not now be con<lb break="no"/>sulted, the Honorable Attorney General took 
     <lb/>
     a different course. He was asked for 
     <lb/>
     precedents, and told us that when vio<lb break="no"/>lent constitutional changes had been made 
     <lb/>
     in England, the precedents for the course 
     <lb/>
     proposed by this motion were founded. He 
     <lb/>
     talked to us about the union of Ireland, in 
     <lb/>
     connection with which the career of PITT—a 
     <lb/>
     career that was distinguished in Britain, but 
     <lb/>
     which was of such a character that, though 
     <lb/>
     signalized throughout Europe, it yet produced 
     <lb/>
     a reaction that caused England to fallback 
     <lb/>
     in the race of national progress for many 
     <lb/>
     years. The result of his course was such 
     <lb/>
     that some of the brightest names on English 
     <lb/>
     history left the reform principles to which 
     <lb/>
     they had been attached, and connected them<lb break="no"/>selves with the Pitt party, and the same 
     <lb/>
     will be the result here of the game now being 
     <lb/>
     played by honorable gentlemen opposite. 
     <lb/>
     This is the precedent which, in a British 
     <lb/>
     constitutional country of the nineteenth cen<lb break="no"/>tury, is brought up and used as a whip held 
     <lb/>
     over our backs. Why, sir, we have no 
     <lb/>
     French revolutions at this day. But the 
     <lb/>
    say we have an American revolution. We 
     <lb/>are told by Ministers themselves, and by 
     <lb/>speakers, under their cheers, that we have to 
     <lb/>choose between this scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>and annexation to a neighboring republic, and 
     <lb/>they talk to us as if there was no time to lose 
     <lb/>—that one or other will be accomplished 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     immediately. How do we know but it may 
     <lb/>
     happen while our Ministers are gone to Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and that when they return they will find 
     <lb/>
     the flag of the United States floating over their 
     <lb/>
     country. Sir, there is no more danger of any<lb break="no"/>thing of that kind happening now than there 
     <lb/>
     was when this Government was formed last 
     <lb/>
     spring. When the honorable and gallant 
     <lb/>
     knight at the head of the Government was 
     <lb/>
     called upon to form an Administration, and 
     <lb/>
     brought his Government before the House, he 
     <lb/>
     did not then hold up to us the danger of in<lb break="no"/>vasion, unless we supported his Government. 
     <lb/>
     The Government did not then inform us that 
     <lb/>
     if we did not form a Federal union we would 
     <lb/>
     be annexed to the United States. All these 
     <lb/>
     threats on their part have grown out of acci<lb break="no"/>dents that have happened to their policy since 
     <lb/>
     last June. But, Mr. SPEAKER, the game 
     <lb/>
     that is being played now is one that cannot 
     <lb/>
     but provoke a conservative reaction in this 
     <lb/>
     country. Do honorable gentlemen believe 
     <lb/>
     that it is really for the best interests of this 
     <lb/>
     country that so many honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     who entertained reform views, are found voting 
     <lb/>
     to do away with the elective principle in the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the Legislative Council—a 
     <lb/>
     principle that has been held sacred in the 
     <lb/>
     eyes of so vast a number of the people of 
     <lb/>
    Upper Canada, that to accomplish it has been 
     <lb/>the battle—cry of many honorable men in times 
     <lb/>past, <hi rendition="simple:italic">ab uno disce omnes?</hi> The Honorable 
     <lb/>Attorney General, as the leader of his party, 
     <lb/>may look with favor upon the conservative 
     <lb/>reaction which seems to await us. We can 
     <lb/>afford to go back to that dark period of Eng 
     <lb/>lish constitutional history, when Toryism, 
     <lb/>profiting by the unstable politics of France, 
     <lb/>ruled England for fifty years, created the 
     <lb/>public debt, and stifled the progress of free 
     <lb/>opinion. It is from this period that the Hon. 
     <lb/>Attorney General quotes precedents against 
     <lb/>an appeal to the people—a dark period, in 
     <lb/>which the rights of the people were sacrificed 
     <lb/>to a want of faith in them. Shall we copy 
     <lb/>such examples ? Shall we attempt to hold up 
     <lb/>the terrors of the American war—the dreaded 
     <lb/>instability of American institutions — to 
     <lb/>frighten ourselves into dread of our own peo<lb break="no"/>ple ? Shall we copy the reactionary abuses 
     <lb/>of the times of PITT, to the extent that we 
     <lb/>refuse to consult the people upon the great 
     <lb/>revolution proposed here? ( Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The people were surprised by the political 
     <lb/>earthquke which took place here last spring. 
     <lb/>They were astonished by what took place, 
     <lb/>but they were told that there was no risk for 
     <lb/>them ; that it was necessary for the defence 
     <lb/>of the country that these men should come 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1017" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1017.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1017</fw>
      
     together. And now, when the proposition is 
     <lb/>
     brought before this House to place the matter 
     <lb/>
     before the people, we are told that there are 
     <lb/>
     certain precedents against such a course, 
     <lb/>
     such as the union of Scotland and the union 
     <lb/>
     of Ireland, which I am sure must be parti<lb break="no"/>cularly strong in the view of my friend the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Minister of Agriculture. We are 
     <lb/>
     told that we must accept this scheme at once 
     <lb/>
     without a moment's delay, or it would slip 
     <lb/>
     through our fingers. I feel, sir, that this is 
     <lb/>
     a point which ought to be made—that the 
     <lb/>
     ground on which this motion is opposed, that 
     <lb/>
     the people having elected their representa<lb break="no"/>tives, they have a right to look to them. And 
     <lb/>
     if this country was annexed to the United 
     <lb/>
     States, if this Parliament is supreme, if it is 
     <lb/>
     able to upset one Constitution, why not an<lb break="no"/>other? The doctrine is a new one. It may 
     <lb/>
     be fortified by strong precedents, but it is 
     <lb/>
     not fortified by constitutional practice in 
     <lb/>
     this country—it is not fortified by the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this country, which is, that 
     <lb/>
     the representative is not elected to frame its 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. It is said by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for South Oxford that a number of 
     <lb/>
     elections have taken place, and that the people 
     <lb/>
     are in favor of the scheme. But what elections 
     <lb/>
     have taken place? There have been a few 
     <lb/>
     for the Upper House; but even the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for South Ontario, a gentleman who comes 
     <lb/>
     in for a Ministerial constituency represented 
     <lb/>
     formerly by the present Vice-Chancellor of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, even that honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     is defeated and another gentleman is elected 
     <lb/>
     in his place. That honorable gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     the first fruits of the elections, and he comes 
     <lb/>
     here and tells us that he pledged himself to 
     <lb/>
     his constituents that this subject should be 
     <lb/>
     appealed to the people—and more than that, 
     <lb/>
     he tells us that they were afraid he would 
     <lb/>
     support the Government on the details. It 
     <lb/>
     is an unhappy day for this country when it is 
     <lb/>
     found necessary to quote precedents from the 
     <lb/>
     most unpopular period in European history in 
     <lb/>
     support of the course that is being pursued. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUFR1">MR. JOSEPH DUFRESNE</persName>—I did not 
     <lb/>
     intend to say anything upon this matter, and 
     <lb/>
     I should abstain from doing so, were it not for 
     <lb/>
     a statement made by the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Lotbinière. He stated that parties in

     Canada upon this question were about equally

     of the people in Lower Canada look upon an

     election as an oath—they want to use it only 
     <lb/>
     as a matter of necessity—they look upon it as 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     an immorality. I know that there are certain 
     <lb/>
     parties in Lower Canada in favor of an elec<lb break="no"/>tion, but the bulk of the people are opposed 
     <lb/>
     to it. There are also a few honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men in this House who may be in favor of it, 
     <lb/>
     but in my opinion the are wrong. I can 
     <lb/>
     class those who are in favor of an election in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada—these are the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouges</hi>. Under 
     <lb/>
     the present circumstances, they say:—" We 
     <lb/>
     are only about fifteen or sixteen ; what differ<lb break="no"/>ence will it make if we loose five or six of our 
     <lb/>
     number; and who knows that the States will 
     <lb/>
     not come here in our country with a few 
     <lb/>
     thousand greenbacks and help us ?" (Laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) I only say this as a supposition. Then 
     <lb/>
     the second is the class who sell liquor in the 
     <lb/>
     day, and those who sell without a license- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     who are almost looked upon as public robbers. 
     <lb/>
     The third class are the drunkards—those who 
     <lb/>
     go on a spree for several days and pay nothing 
     <lb/>
     for it. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Every<lb break="no"/>one knows that the accounts are sent in and 
     <lb/>
     are paid. Of course these words are not 
     <lb/>
     applicable to any one in this House; but those 
     <lb/>
     are the only ones who are in favor of an elec<lb break="no"/>tion. The bulk of the people are opposed to 
     <lb/>
     it; they consider it as an immorality ; and if 
     <lb/>
     any one doubts that, I wish they would go out 
     <lb/>
     into my part of the country and inquire for 
     <lb/>
     themselves. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—The language 
     <lb/>
     used by the hon. member for North Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     on one or two points, requires some notice. 
     <lb/>
     He boldly asserted that he did not believe 
     <lb/>
     that there was any serious agitation in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada for constitutional changes. He 
     <lb/>
     boldly asserted that an arrangement could 
     <lb/>
     have been made, and that till it was made 
     <lb/>
     the people could get on. Now, here is the 
     <lb/>
     language he used some years ago. In his 
     <lb/>
     speech on the Address in 1862, the following 
     <lb/>
     occurs :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     I mean to say that the refusal of righteous de<lb break="no"/>mands will lead to unpleasant and unprofitable 
     <lb/>
     quarrels. The time has come when 300,000 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canadians will be heard on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     the House, and if this is not allowed, the results 
     <lb/>
     that will follow will be awful. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is the language of the gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     has charged us with making " highfaluting " 
     <lb/>
     speeches. I did address the meeting held in 
     <lb/>
     Toronto, and a more unanimous meeting, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, never was held in Toronto. I con<lb break="no"/>fined myself entirely to the matter under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion, and made no appeals of any kind. I 
     <lb/>
     leave that to the honorable member for North 
     <lb/>
     Ontario himself. Then he states again—in 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="1018" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1018.jpg"/>

     the debate of 1862 on representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation—" No man with Anglo-Saxon blood 
     <lb/>
     in his veins will submit to the present 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs." (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>
     yet he accuses us now of taking hasty 
     <lb/>
     action in this matter. When the MACDON<lb break="no"/>ALD-SICOTTE Administration was formed, he 
     <lb/>
     devoted himself to denouncing the Hon. Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary, who was then Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     of Crown Lands. He used all his power in 
     <lb/>
     abusing that gentleman, and he prophesied 
     <lb/>
     what the result would be when that gentle<lb break="no"/>man appeared again before the people of Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada. l gave my opinion plainly at 
     <lb/>
     the time, and I do not believe that any per<lb break="no"/>son used such strong language as the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman himself. The question had 
     <lb/>
     come to be one that must be settled in one 
     <lb/>
     way or the other. It was quite clear to me 
     <lb/>
     for one, and to the people of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     that the Federation project was the only thing 
     <lb/>
     we could have to remedy the state of affairs 
     <lb/>
     in which they were placed. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But I had forgotten one point in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the Coalition arrangements being made to 
     <lb/>
     carry on the public affairs. When the liber<lb break="no"/>al members held a meeting to consider the 
     <lb/>
     prepositions made by their Government, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member lor Cornwall attended and 
     <lb/>
     took an active part in the business of the 
     <lb/>
     meeting, and heartily approved of the pro<lb break="no"/>ject. He declined, it is true, to vote yea or 
     <lb/>
     nay on the first resolution, approving the policy 
     <lb/>
     proposed, but that was merely because the re<lb break="no"/>solution was so worded as to expressly approve 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. BROWN'S share in the perfecting of the 
     <lb/>
     arrangements made. This is proved by the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the second resolution, which was 
     <lb/>
     moved by the honorable member for Cornwall 
     <lb/>
     himself. (Hear, hear.) _ The motion was in 
     <lb/>
     the following terms—_" That the proposition 
     <lb/>
     for at least three members of the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     entering the Government be accepted." Mr. 
     <lb/>
     MACKENZIE of Lambton, moved in amend<lb break="no"/>ment—" That the proposition for three mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Opposition entering the Cabinet be 
     <lb/>
     rejected, and that the proposition for the 
     <lb/>
     settlement of our sectional difficulties receive 
     <lb/>
     an outside support." The amendment only 
     <lb/>
     received eleven votes ; the eloquence of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Cornwall carried the 
     <lb/>
     meeting against my resolution. That honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman also moved the third resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, as follows—"That it is all-important that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. BROWN should be one of the party to 
     <lb/>
     enter the Cabinet." Only three gentlemen- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     viz., Hon. Mr. BROWN and Messrs. BURWELL 
     <lb/>
     and SCRATCHERD—voted against this. Now, 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          
     sir, if the honorable member was sincere 
     <lb/>
     then, how are we to account for his course 
     <lb/>
     now ? (Hear, hear.) Was be deceiving us 
     <lb/>
     then, or is be speaking against himself now ? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Considering the part that 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman had in organizing the 
     <lb/>
     Government, it did seem very extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     that he should have repeatedly reproached 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen opposite with having 
     <lb/>
     formed a coalition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName>—Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">MR. A. MACKENZIE</persName>—Was it possible 
     <lb/>
     that he urged the formation of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with a view to destroy the liberals who 
     <lb/>
     had entered it ? I believed then that the best 
     <lb/>
     course to pursue was to give the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     Government a thorough outside support. I 
     <lb/>
     have always had a strong objection to party 
     <lb/>
     coalitions. I felt then, as I do now, that they 
     <lb/>
     may lead to later results not foreseen at the 
     <lb/>
     time, and all that I wished was that the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party should give their support to the 
     <lb/>
     Administration for the purpose for which it 
     <lb/>
     was formed, that support to cease when the 
     <lb/>
     object should be accomplished. The honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Cornwall thought differently, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not think it becomes that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man to get up now and denounce those hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen for the course they have taken. 
     <lb/>
     He is not able to say that he did not vote. 
     <lb/>
     He voted as here recorded, and with the 
     <lb/>
     desire that I have always had to have every<lb break="no"/>thing of this kind recorded to prevent future 
     <lb/>
     misunderstanding, I took the trouble to 
     <lb/>
     have a certified copy of the proceedings, from 
     <lb/>
     which I have just quoted. When any hon<lb break="no"/>orable member took that course in the caucus, 
     <lb/>
     I think he was clearly bound to adhere to the 
     <lb/>
     same course. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PARK2">DR. PARKER</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, 1 had 
     <lb/>
     some intention of voting for the resolution 
     <lb/>
     in your hands, sir, until I heard the speech 
     <lb/>
     of the mover, the hon. member for Peel; but 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman has quite convinced me that 
     <lb/>
     I ought not to do so. (Hear and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     He proved most conclusively that the pro<lb break="no"/>posed Confederation was in itself a most 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory and desirable measure, and that 
     <lb/>
     the internal state of these provinces, as well as 
     <lb/>
     the threatening aspect of foreign affairs, were 
     <lb/>
     conclusive reasons for its immediate adoption. 
     <lb/>
     Defences, he told us, were immediately re<lb break="no"/>quired, and that they could only be made 
     <lb/>
     effective by first uniting the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Accepting this argument and others advanced 
     <lb/>
     by that hon. member, the conclusion is that 
     <lb/>
     the necessity for Confederation is imperative 
     <lb/>
     and immediate. But, sir, how does this 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1019" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1019.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1019</fw>
           
     agree with the terms of his resolution, if we 
     <lb/>
     should adopt it, and this House be dissolved, 
     <lb/>
     and members sent to the country for election 
     <lb/>
     before the new House could adopt the 
     <lb/>
     measure ? The House of Commons would be 
     <lb/>
     dissolved, and the Imperial Parliament could 
     <lb/>
     not legislate on it for a year or more—(hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear)—so that by the course proposed, the 
     <lb/>
     country would still remain, for a year or two 
     <lb/>
     longer, exposed to the dangers and diffi<lb break="no"/>culties so eloquently described by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel. (Hear.) If that hon. 
     <lb/>
     member had voted against the previous 
     <lb/>
     question, and thereby asserted the right to 
     <lb/>
     amend or refer the Address before adoption, 
     <lb/>
     he could now very properly ask and claim 
     <lb/>
     our support to this resolution. But he not 
     <lb/>
     only voted for the previous question, but 
     <lb/>
     for the Address, and deliberately chose the 
     <lb/>
     present time to make this motion. Under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances, he at least has no claim 
     <lb/>
     upon the support of the House. (Hear) 
     <lb/>
     Having made a solemn contract with this 
     <lb/>
     House on the main question, he now turns 
     <lb/>
     round and seeks to upset the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     of his own making. His course is best 
     <lb/>
     explained by a simple illustration. Suppose 
     <lb/>
     four or five gentlemen had entered into an 
     <lb/>
     unanimous agreement, when one turns round 
     <lb/>
     and says, " I was and am in favor of all that 
     <lb/>
     has been done ; but unless you now attach 
     <lb/>
     this condition, I draw back and retire from 
     <lb/>
     the arrangement." (Hear.) That was con<lb break="no"/>duct 'which could not be approved either in 
     <lb/>
     public or private affairs. The position of 
     <lb/>
     the seconder of the resolution—the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Ontario—is entirely 
     <lb/>
     different, because he, like myself, asserted 
     <lb/>
     by his vote on the previous question, the 
     <lb/>
     desire to have the resolutions amended. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member for Peel told us, 
     <lb/>
     even to-day, that this he considered 
     <lb/>
     the proper time to place his motion before 
     <lb/>
     the House. The resolution itself is highly 
     <lb/>
     proper, and one for which I would have 
     <lb/>
     voted, had it been made before the adoption 
     <lb/>
     of the Address. (Hear.) Now it is en<lb break="no"/>tirely out of place. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario remarked just now, in the 
     <lb/>
     course of his speech, that this Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     if adopted, will soon have to be amended, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore, he said, we ought not to 
     <lb/>
     accept it. I entirely dissent from that 
     <lb/>
     opinion. Why, sir, the British Constitution 
     <lb/>
     is but a series of amendments made from 
     <lb/>
     time to time—a growth by successive amend<lb break="no"/>ments. The objection of my hon. friend is 
     <lb/>
     one of the main reasons why I am willing to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     accept this scheme. I believe it will 
     <lb/>
     admit of amendment as time goes on, so 
     <lb/>
     that it may be made to meet the changing 
     <lb/>
     wants and requirements of the people. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from North Ontario referred to 
     <lb/>
     the seductive influence of the breath of the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council, when breath<lb break="no"/>ed into the ears of members, and its magical 
     <lb/>
     efl'ects in relaxing the knees, and then, sir, he 
     <lb/>
     locked, by way, I presume, of application, at 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for West Elgin. (Loud laugh<lb break="no"/>ter.) Now I have always regarded the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for West Elgin as one of the most 
     <lb/>
     reliable members of this House. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, if my honorable friend looked more 
     <lb/>
     particularly in this direction, I have nothing 
     <lb/>
     to add to the reasons already given in expla<lb break="no"/>nation of my vote. The question before me 
     <lb/>
     was—" Should we adopt or reject the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions ?"—and agreeing with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel that something should be 
     <lb/>
     done immediately, I voted for them. I 
     <lb/>
     think it would be most outrageous if, after 
     <lb/>
     they have been sanctioned by a vote of this 
     <lb/>
     House, we were to nullify them by any 
     <lb/>
     subsequent proceedings. If the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     were to be referred to the people at all, it 
     <lb/>
     should have been before they received the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of this House. Are we to turn 
     <lb/>
     round to—day and reverse what we did on 
     <lb/>
     Saturday last ? I repeat, sir, that I think 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions should have gone to the 
     <lb/>
     country—and if my opinion had prevailed, 
     <lb/>
     they would have been referred—but not now, 
     <lb/>
     after their deliberate sanction by this House ; 
     <lb/>
     to do so would stultify the Legislature. Our 
     <lb/>
     duty is now, in my opinion, to carry them 
     <lb/>
     into effect in good faith, and not stand 
     <lb/>
     shilly-shallying — blowing hot and cold 
     <lb/>
     with the same breath. I, sir, stand 
     <lb/>
     by what I have done, and by what this 
     <lb/>
     House has done, and shall vote against 
     <lb/>
     the amendment of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Peel—(hear)—who, I think, occupies a most 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent position. (Hear, hear.) There 
     <lb/>
     is another point, sir, to which I desire to 
     <lb/>
     allude. The hon. member for Peel stated 
     <lb/>
     that he voted for the Address as a private 
     <lb/>
     individual—as he would have voted on the 
     <lb/>
     question if out of this House. Now, sir, 
     <lb/>
     no member can shield himself under such a 
     <lb/>
     subterfuge. No member can separate his 
     <lb/>
     private from his legislative character in this 
     <lb/>
     House. If the explanation of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel be the general doctrine 
     <lb/>
     and practice of Parliament, I should like to 
     <lb/>
    have it understood, because there are occa<lb break="no"/>sions when it would be very convenient to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="1020" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1020.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1020</fw>
          
     avail one's self of it. (Hear.) I look on this 
     <lb/>
     motion—I refer now to the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Peel, and except the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario—as an attempt to make a little 
     <lb/>
     capital at the expense of members who will 
     <lb/>
     save its supporters by voting it down. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Peel drew a fearful picture of 
     <lb/>
     our exposed and defenceless state—of the dark 
     <lb/>
     and threatening cloud gathering over us—of 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of setting our house in order 
     <lb/>
     by a union of these provinces. Now, sir, if 
     <lb/>
     I half agreed with him, I should never think 
     <lb/>
     of bringing in an amendment causing delay 
     <lb/>
     and continued exposure to increasing danger, 
     <lb/>
     but would go in strongly for the adoption of 
     <lb/>
     measures against such a state of things, the 
     <lb/>
     very first hour it was possible. This resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, from the time at which it is moved, sir, 
     <lb/>
     should be voted down at once. The House 
     <lb/>
     owes it to itself to give it no countenance 
     <lb/>
     at this stage of the proceedings. Had it 
     <lb/>
     been moved before the previous question, I 
     <lb/>
     would have voted for it ; but as it comes up 
     <lb/>
     after the adoption of the main resolutions, I 
     <lb/>
     will stand by the solemn and deliberate action 
     <lb/>
     we have taken—I will stand the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     of the House and vote against it. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     MR. RYMAL—Being one of the eight 
     <lb/>
     members from Upper Canada who voted 
     <lb/>
     against the resolutions of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Conference, and whose names, I expect, 
     <lb/>
     will long be cherished by the people 
     <lb/>
     of that section, I presume, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     that I may vote for the amendment now in 
     <lb/>
     your hands, without being charged with 
     <lb/>
     inconsistency, as some honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have been during this discussion. I should 
     <lb/>
     not, however, have risen to address you, sir, 
     <lb/>
     but for a personal matter that was drawn 
     <lb/>
     into this debate, in reference to myself and 
     <lb/>
     my connection with the constituency I have 
     <lb/>
     the honor to represent—-or misrepresent, as 
     <lb/>
     some people say. (Laughter, and hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) According to the doctrines held by 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General West, it would 
     <lb/>
     appear that after I had been elected to this 
     <lb/>
     House, I have no business to refer any 
     <lb/>
     matter for decision to or consult the feelings 
     <lb/>
     of the people who sent me, but to act as I 
     <lb/>
     thought best for their interests. Allow me 
     <lb/>
     to dissent from this doctrine ; but I have 
     <lb/>
     been obliged to exercise my own judgment, 
     <lb/>
     and I have done so honestly, independently, 
     <lb/>
     and fearlessly, irrespective of the conse<lb break="no"/>quences that may result to me, or of the 
     <lb/>
     half-uttered threats held out over me. These 
     <lb/>
     things, sir, have no influence over me ; I 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     shall pursue the course I think best for the 
     <lb/>
     interests of my country and of those who 
     <lb/>
     sent me here. (Hear, hear.) It matters 
     <lb/>
     little whether I enter Parliament again or 
     <lb/>
     not; but while I retain my position as one 
     <lb/>
     of the' representatives of the peeple, I shall 
     <lb/>
     act fearlessly. (Hear, hear.) I regret that 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. President of the Council, when 
     <lb/>
     speaking of my constituency and myself, 
     <lb/>
     should have seen fit to taunt me with and 
     <lb/>
     sneer at the narrow majorities by which I 
     <lb/>
     have upon occasions been returned to this 
     <lb/>
     House.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:RYMA1">MR. RYMAL</persName>—But I say yes; for, Mr.

     SPEAKER, I can distinctly recollect when an 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman, holding a high position 
     <lb/>
     in this Government, was twice actually de<lb break="no"/>feated—(hear, and laughter)—and I dare 
     <lb/>
     say that the support I have given that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has on some occasions contributed 
     <lb/>
     to the narrowness of my majorities. (Hear,

     SEVERAL HON. MEMBERS—That is

     the same thing as the last amendment.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     state it is the same thing, but they will see that 
     <lb/>
     it is not at all the same. This resolution does 
     <lb/>
     not propose to contradict or go back upon 
     <lb/>
     the previous action of the House, but to 
     <lb/>
     supplement it by asking that any act passed 
     <lb/>
     by the Imperial Parliament, founded on the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions of the Conference, may be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the House and to the country 
     <lb/>
     previous to its adoption. (Hear.) Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, this is a matter of great impor<lb break="no"/>tance, but I can now only state the purport 
     <lb/>
     of the resolution ; for, as I said before, I am 
     <lb/>
     not about to provoke a debate. This whole 
     <lb/>
     matter proceeds upon the theory that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada desire a change in their 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. Of course we know that the 
     <lb/>
     supreme sovereignty rests with the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Parliament—of course we know that the 
     <lb/>
     power to change our Constitution and re<lb break="no"/>model it in any way rests there—but we are 
     <lb/>
     proceeding on the assumption that the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament will acquiesce in our de<lb break="no"/>sire for a change, and in the nature of the 
     <lb/>
     change desired. Well, sir, the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the Treasury benches, having the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of the majority of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     presumably the confidence of the majority 
     <lb/>
     of the people also, are going to approach 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's Government in England and 
     <lb/>
     ask them to submit to the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment a change in the Constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     country; but, sir, these gentlemen have not 
     <lb/>
     explained to us precisely how these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions are to be translated into an Act of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
     Parliament—they have not explained to us 
     <lb/>
     which of these resolutions are to form part 
     <lb/>
     of our new Constitution, and which of them 
     <lb/>
     are to be carried out in some other way. 
     <lb/>
     But, Mr. SPEAKER, it will be of the last 
     <lb/>
     importance to the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     to know what their Constitution really is to 
     <lb/>
     be before its final enactment. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I would recall, sir, especially to hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men from Lower Canada, the experience of 
     <lb/>
     the past in reference to this matter. In 1852 
     <lb/>
     Mr. HINCK'S Government carried through 
     <lb/>
     this House an Address in favor of a change 
     <lb/>
     in the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     They sought, by that Address, a change in 
     <lb/>
     the Union Act, operating a change in the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the Legislative Council only. 
     <lb/>
     But instead of such a change in the Consti<lb break="no"/>tutional Act as was desired by the House, 
     <lb/>
     power was given to the Legislature to effect 
     <lb/>
     such a change, and along with that, the 
     <lb/>
     two-thirds clause of the Union Act was 
     <lb/>
     repealed—nobody to this day knows how. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) What assurance have we then— 
     <lb/>
     what assurance can we have—that a similar 
     <lb/>
     event will not occur now? Hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     from Lower Canada must have a vivid recol<lb break="no"/>lection of our own very recent experience in 
     <lb/>
     constitutional changes. The change actu<lb break="no"/>ally made in the Union Act in 1852 was one 
     <lb/>
     which was deprecated by all the representa<lb break="no"/>tives from Lower Canada—by the entire 
     <lb/>
     people of Lower Canada—and was brought 
     <lb/>
     about in a way which has never yet been 
     <lb/>
     satisfactorily explained. Well, sir, presum<lb break="no"/>ing that the people of this country are mak<lb break="no"/>ing for themselves a new Constitution-— 
     <lb/>
     recognising the power of the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to effect any such change as they 
     <lb/>
     may deem fit-—but also recognising the well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     known desire of the Imperial Parliament to 
     <lb/>
     meet our views in the matter—I propose 
     <lb/>
     that this House shall pray, in this Address, 
     <lb/>
     that any act founded on the resolutions of 
     <lb/>
     the Conference which met in Quebec in 
     <lb/>
     October last, may only be put in force on the 
     <lb/>
     prayer of both branches of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. With these few words, explana<lb break="no"/>tory of my resolution, I place it in your 
     <lb/>
     hands. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName>—I desire, as I did 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the amendment of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Peel, not to discuss at length the 
     <lb/>
     motion of my hon. friend the member for 
     <lb/>
     Chateauguay, but simply to explain the object 
     <lb/>
     of that motion in a few words. The House 
     <lb/>
     has just rejected an amendment, asking that 
     <lb/>
     an appeal should be made to the people of 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="1022" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1022.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1022</fw>
          
     this province before the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     is asked to legislate on the Address of this 
     <lb/>
     House. Now, the object of the amendment 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the hon. member for Chateau<lb break="no"/>guay is to ask that the Constitution adopted 
     <lb/>
     in England may not go into force until it 
     <lb/>
     shall have been submitted to the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     of this province, after the next general elec<lb break="no"/>tion, and until an Address shall have been 
     <lb/>
     adopted, asking that it be put in force. We 
     <lb/>
     ask the Imperial Government to-day, by the 
     <lb/>
     Address which has just been adopted, to sub<lb break="no"/>mit to the Imperial Legislature an act for the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. If, in place of Confederation, the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament were to establish a le<lb break="no"/>gislative union of the provinces, I ask those 
     <lb/>
     honorable members of this House who protest 
     <lb/>
     against a legislative union, how they are to 
     <lb/>
     present themselves before their electors—after 
     <lb/>
     having refused to consult them—if they also 
     <lb/>
     refuse to declare that they desire to consider 
     <lb/>
     the measure again when it is brought back to 
     <lb/>
     us, after passing the Imperial Parliament? 
     <lb/>
     All we ask by this motion is that the act 
     <lb/>
     which is to be passed may be submitted to 
     <lb/>
     our Legislature, and ratified and approved by 
     <lb/>
     this House, before it is definitely put in force 
     <lb/>
     —in short, we ask to be allowed to refuse the 
     <lb/>
     new Constitution if it should not suit us. 
     <lb/>
     We must not forget what occurred in 1856, 
     <lb/>
     when we asked the Imperial Parliament to 
     <lb/>
     change the constitution of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council, and to render it elective. Let it not 
     <lb/>
     be forgotten that they gave us a measure dif<lb break="no"/>ferent from that we had asked for. We were, 
     <lb/>
     it is true, empowered to render the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council elective, but, at the same time, a 
     <lb/>
     clause was struck out of the Act of Union, 
     <lb/>
     which clause declared that the basis of the re<lb break="no"/>presentation in the Legislative Assembly 
     <lb/>
     could not be changed without the concurrence 
     <lb/>
     of two-thirds of the members of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. And with that fact staring us in the 
     <lb/>
     face, what assurance have we to-day that the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government will not give us a le<lb break="no"/>gislative union, with representation based 
     <lb/>
     upon population, in place of a Confederation ? 
     <lb/>
    What is to prevent them from changing the 
     <lb/>clause relative to the Legislative Council, and 
     <lb/>applying to it also the principle of representa<lb break="no"/>tion based upon population ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Well, it is with a view of avoiding the possi<lb break="no"/>bility of any change of that nature that we 
     <lb/>now propose this amendment. There are 
     <lb/>many hon. members of this House who fear 
     <lb/>that in view of the refusal of the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to assent to this scheme, England may 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     give us a Confederation of the two Canadas. 
     <lb/>
     And I ask—when we find the Ministry telling 
     <lb/>
     us, over and over again, that it is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     necessary to effect a constitutional change, 
     <lb/>
     that the matter is urgent, that even one 
     <lb/>
     week's delay cannot be given, nor the time to 
     <lb/>
     discuss the amendments we desire to propose 
     <lb/>
     to the scheme ; that they must have a mea<lb break="no"/>sure at once, otherwise the most dreadful 
     <lb/>
     evils must ensue—I ask, is it to be fancied, 
     <lb/>
    for one moment, that the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will consent to force the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces into Confederation. And what is to 
     <lb/>prevent that Government from changing the 
     <lb/>scheme so as to make it applicable to the two 
     <lb/>Canadas alone ? (Hear, hear.) Here is what 
     <lb/>will happen, or at all events what may very 
     <lb/>well happen : when our Ministers reach Eng. 
     <lb/>land, and urge upon the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>the necessity for a change in the Constitution 
     <lb/>as regards Canada, that Government, seeing 
     <lb/>that the Lower Provinces do not desire Con<lb break="no"/>federation, will pass a measure for the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the two provinces, leaving to the 
     <lb/>Maritime Provinces the right to enter that 
     <lb/>Confederation whenever they think proper. 
     <lb/>That is very possible, and the only way to 
     <lb/>provide against such a contingency is to ad<lb break="no"/>dress Her Majesty, praying that any Imperial 
     <lb/>measure, relating to constitutional changes, 
     <lb/>may not take effect until it shall have been 
     <lb/>submitted to, and shall have received the 
     <lb/>ratification of, the Legislature of Canada. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.)

     SPEAKER, in reply to what the honorable

     <lb/>
     merely tell honorable members of this House 
     <lb/>
     that they need not take alarm at the appre<lb break="no"/>hensions and predictions of that honorable

     own name, and on behalf of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     that the delegates who go to England will 
     <lb/>
     accept from the Imperial Government no act 
     <lb/>
     but one based on the resolutions adopted by

     other. (Hear, hear.) I have pledged my

     <lb/>
     that effect, and I trust that my word of honor 
     <lb/>
     will have at least as much weight with this 
     <lb/>
     House and the country as the apprehensions 
     <lb/>
     of the honorable member for Hochelaga. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACF1">Mr. MACFARLANE</persName>—Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     had intended giving the reasons for the course 
     <lb/>
     I was taking prior to the last vote, and as I 
     <lb/>
     still desire to explain, the honorable member 
     <lb/>
    for Chateauguay has given me an opportunity 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="1023" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1023.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1028</fw>
            
     of doing so now. (Hear, hear.)  It certainly 
     <lb/>
     did require some courage to undertake to vote 
     <lb/>
     against the last amendment—a resolution 
     <lb/>
     which seems fair enough on the face of it. 
     <lb/>
     At first I was almost disposed to accept it, 
     <lb/>
     and it was not until I discovered its real 
     <lb/>
     bearing that I determined to vote against it. 
     <lb/>
     Honorable gentlemen will remember that, 
     <lb/>
     before the adoption of the resolutions, I was 
     <lb/>
     desirous that an appeal should be had to the 
     <lb/>
     people prior to the consummation of the vast 
     <lb/>
     scheme which they announce ; and with that 
     <lb/>
     object in view, my vote is recorded against 
     <lb/>
     your ruling, Mr. SPEAKER, on the appeal from 
     <lb/>
     your decision at the time an amendment was 
     <lb/>
     offered prior to their passage. This House 
     <lb/>
     having sustained you in the opinion you pro<lb break="no"/>nounced, nothing was then left for me, as one 
     <lb/>
     of the representatives of the people, but to 
     <lb/>
     decide whether we should adopt the policy of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation or ignore it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The latter I was not disposed to do, and the 
     <lb/>
     Government received my support on the final 
     <lb/>
     vote taken, declaring a union of the British 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces to be advisable. These 
     <lb/>
     resolutions having been passed, we are now 
     <lb/>
     called upon to pass an Address to Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty founded upon them. To this Address, 
     <lb/>
     and not to the resolutions, the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Peel offered his amendment, and to 
     <lb/>
     support that would have been the ignoring of 
     <lb/>
     my former vote, the declaring an Address 
     <lb/>
     different from the very resolutions upon which 
     <lb/>
     that Address is to be founded, the sacrificing 
     <lb/>
     of a great political scheme for the support of 
     <lb/>
     what might unexplained be considered a 
     <lb/>
     popular and legitimate motion, but which was 
     <lb/>
     in fact a motion subversive of the resolutions, 
     <lb/>
     and valueless, save as a means unfairly to be 
     <lb/>
     used as a weapon on a hustings. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     If the honorable member for Peel desired this 
     <lb/>
     amendment, and honorable members of this 
     <lb/>
     House, myself amongst the number, under<lb break="no"/>stood he was intrusted with the care of it, 
     <lb/>
     why did he not, as an old member of this 
     <lb/>
     House, as one conversant with its rules and 
     <lb/>
     its usages, submit it for our consideration 
     <lb/>
     prior to the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     moving the "previous question," and at a 
     <lb/>
     time when, by your ruling, Mr. SPEAKER, it 
     <lb/>
     would have been admissible. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Had he done so then, members could have 
     <lb/>
     voted upon the merits of the amendment. Now 
     <lb/>
     that the resolutions are passed, that privilege 
     <lb/>
     has ceased. After all the difficulties which 
     <lb/>
     have arisen in the management of the public 
     <lb/>
     affairs of this country, which have existed so 
     <lb/>
     long, and which, I may say, have brought 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     about the present Coalition, it was necessary 
     <lb/>
     that some alteration and some amendment 
     <lb/>
     should be made. We could not longer pro<lb break="no"/>ceed amidst the conflicting sentiments which 
     <lb/>
     pervaded this House, in the government of a 
     <lb/>
     people whose feelings were becoming as hos<lb break="no"/>tile as their representatives were antagonistic. 
     <lb/>
     And I ask what other solution acceptable to the 
     <lb/>
     two Canadas was to be had; what better scheme 
     <lb/>
     was to be adopted than that here submitted ? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The question of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is no new theory, so far as I am concerned; 
     <lb/>
     it is a plan which, during the short time I 
     <lb/>
     have taken an interest in public affairs, I have 
     <lb/>
     always felt disposed to support, as tending to 
     <lb/>
     our development as a country, and our inde<lb break="no"/>pendence and influence as a people; and after 
     <lb/>
     the declaration we made by our votes a few 
     <lb/>
     minutes ago, namely, that these resolutions 
     <lb/>
     should be adopted—after hearing too from 
     <lb/>
     members of the Government that they are 
     <lb/>
     not now prepared to submit to any alterations, 
     <lb/>
     and finding that the effect of not passing this 
     <lb/>
     Address, founded upon them, would virtually 
     <lb/>
     be to throw us back into the state of political 
     <lb/>
     chaos from which we have just emerged, I 
     <lb/>
     find another reason why I cannot support 
     <lb/>
     this or any other amendment. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
    Looking at the matter apart from these amend<lb break="no"/>ments, I am, with a reference to the past 
     <lb/>and a regard for the future, obliged to con<lb break="no"/>sider this question in a military as well as in 
     <lb/>a political and national point of view, and can<lb break="no"/>not but deem its consideration in this respect 
     <lb/>a necessity—placed as we are on the borders 
     <lb/>of a nation whose citizens are versed in the 
     <lb/>use of the arms with which their legions are 
     <lb/>now dealing death in the field—isolated as 
     <lb/>we are from the nation to which we owe our 
     <lb/>allegiance and which guards our rights, but 
     <lb/>whose acts might occasion our invasion, and 
     <lb/>subject as our territory is to be the battle<lb break="no"/>ground in the event of a difficulty between 
     <lb/>England and the States—it behoves us to 
     <lb/>combine our individual strength, give weight 
     <lb/>and concentration to our isolated influences, 
     <lb/>and thus enable us to join effectively with the 
     <lb/>Mother Country and repel with vigor any 
     <lb/>acts of hostility that might be taken against 
     <lb/>us. It is not by the continuation of things as 
     <lb/>they were, or by the renewal of the conflicting 
     <lb/>feelings which have existed between Upper 
     <lb/>and Lower Canada, that we are to add strength 
     <lb/>to our arms or lustre to our name ; it is not 
     <lb/>thus we are to develope our resources and give 
     <lb/>us the revenues requisite for our defence ; it 
     <lb/>is not thus we are to become a people capable 
     <lb/>of self-government and self-defence, should 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="1024" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-13_Page_1024.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1024</fw>
            
     England ever leave us to our own resources, 
     <lb/>
     and sever us from her list of colonies; but by 
     <lb/>
     the cementing of our local relations, by the 
     <lb/>
     concentration with us, under one government, 
     <lb/>
     of the vast territories of the North-West and 
     <lb/>
     the peopled provinces of the east, with one 
     <lb/>
     community of interest and one object of 
     <lb/>
     design, we will be enabled to place ourselves 
     <lb/>
     in a position in which we could maintain our 
     <lb/>
     independence of a foreign power, perpetuate 
     <lb/>
     our connection with Great Britain, and pre<lb break="no"/>serve our allegiance to its Sovereign; and 
     <lb/>
     should the time come when a severance of 
     <lb/>
     these relations should be requisite, the British 
     <lb/>
     people of America will not be a crippled chain 
     <lb/>
     of powerless and defenceless colonies, but a 
     <lb/>
     vast nation, with its sturdy farmers tilling the 
     <lb/>
     soil of the vast west, and its daring seamen 
     <lb/>
     gathering the wealth of its seaboard fisheries 
     <lb/>
     in the east, the one ready to defend our 
     <lb/>
     hearths at home, while the other protects our 
     <lb/>
     rights at sea, and both ever willing and able 
     <lb/>
     to stand by England in her hour of trouble 
     <lb/>
     and in her work of good. (Cheers.) I feel 
     <lb/>
     that now is the time for taking such steps if 
     <lb/>
     ever they are to be taken. If ever there was 
     <lb/>
     an occasion when it was necessary to remove 
     <lb/>
     the hostility existing between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, and cement their friendships 
     <lb/>
     —if ever there was a time when it was 
     <lb/>
     prudent to strengthen ourselves by a union 
     <lb/>
     with the other provinces, and place ourselves 
     <lb/>
     in a position of defence, it is the present, and 
     <lb/>
     I speak, 1 think, the sentiments of all Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, certainly of all that section of it 
     <lb/>
     where I reside, whem I say that there is but 
     <lb/>
     one feeling there in reference to this matter, 
     <lb/>
     and it is favorable to this proposed arrange<lb break="no"/>ment, favorable to this plan for the union of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. (Hear, hear.) Besides, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, though some of the details are ob<lb break="no"/>jectionable, I am not prepared to risk the loss 
     <lb/>
     of the principle which is admitted in these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, which is one that gives to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada what she has demanded for years, 
     <lb/>
     and gives it whether the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     accede to it or not; it is the recognition by 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada of Upper Canada's rights to 
     <lb/>
     an increased representation; it is the ac<lb break="no"/>ceding of that which Lower Canada has 
     <lb/>
     ever heretofore refused to grant, and I 
     <lb/>
     cannot, in cavelling at these details, which 
     <lb/>
     may hereafter be modified, jeopardise the 
     <lb/>
     attainment of the greater object and sacri<lb break="no"/>fice that which is here insured to us. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Again, notwithstanding the declara<lb break="no"/>tion of my honorable friend from South Has<lb break="no"/>tings, that this measure seals up the North-<lb break="yes"/>
            
            <cb/>
         West, I think, on the contrary, that it adds 
     <lb/>
     to the prospect of opening up that vast terri<lb break="no"/>tory. Before long we shall see population 
     <lb/>
     extending over these vast plains, across the 
     <lb/>
     basin of the Winnepeg and the valley of the 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, and thence to Vancouver, and 
     <lb/>
     all the sooner if this measure be adopted, 
     <lb/>
     supplying as it will a government for the 
     <lb/>
     encouragement of its settlement and the pro<lb break="no"/>tection of its settlers; for the country is as 
     <lb/>
     fertile and productive as our own province, 
     <lb/>
     and its domain as wide. To the north-west 
     <lb/>
     there lies beneath British sway, but as yet all 
     <lb/>
     unreclaimed, a vast and varied territory, the 
     <lb/>
     mineral and agricultural wealth of which no 
     <lb/>
     man can estimate, and the future products of 
     <lb/>
     which none can conceive—a territory offering 
     <lb/>
     the emigrant the choice of its fertile plains, 
     <lb/>
     and the miner the wealth of its hidden riches. 
     <lb/>
     Here, then, is the policy which tends to the 
     <lb/>
     settlement of this vast territory, the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of its immense resources, the opening 
     <lb/>
     up of its inexhaustible mines, and with it the 
     <lb/>
     creation of a new people, the establishment of 
     <lb/>
     increased revenues, and the extension of 
     <lb/>
     British influences and British power on this 
     <lb/>
     continent. And while developing our re<lb break="no"/>sources in the west, it gives an additional 
     <lb/>
     outlet for the roducts of that living mine of 
     <lb/>
     teeming wealt in the east—our fisheries— 
     <lb/>
     the protection and encouragement of which is 
     <lb/>
     as necessary as their wealth to us is inestim<lb break="no"/>able. (Hear, hear.) Believing, too, that 
     <lb/>
     this scheme will tend alike to our internal 
     <lb/>
     reform and improvement as Canadians, and 
     <lb/>
     the quieting of our political hostilities; that it 
     <lb/>
     will give us a larger field for our labors and 
     <lb/>
     an additional market for our products; that 
     <lb/>
     the connections in trade which it will procure 
     <lb/>
     will effect for as enhanced revenues and in<lb break="no"/>creased commerce, I, as a Canadian, am 
     <lb/>
     willing to adopt it even in this local and selfish 
     <lb/>
     sense; but I also see in it a broader policy 
     <lb/>
     with a wider field open for our energies and 
     <lb/>
     our capital—it is the first step towards es<lb break="no"/>tablishing on British territory a highway 
     <lb/>
     from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and thus 
     <lb/>
     procuring for us the carry' trade of Asia 
     <lb/>
     and the East with all the enriching revenues 
     <lb/>
     which it will insure and the labor it will 
     <lb/>
     employ. In short, Mr. SPEAKER, it is the 
     <lb/>
     policy of a great colonial combination, effec<lb break="no"/>tive alike in civil pursuits and military de<lb break="no"/>fence, adding strength to the Empire and in<lb break="no"/>fluencing the destinies of this great continent. 
     <lb/>
     For these reasons I voted against the last 
     <lb/>
     amendment, and for the same reasons I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to vote against this one also. (Hear.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—I rise, sir, 
     <lb/>
     to propose another amendment. (Signs of 
     <lb/>
     impatience.) I assure the House that I never 
     <lb/>
     knew a measure of anything like this import<lb break="no"/>ance go through with so few attempts to 
     <lb/>
     amend it. Nor do I rise for the mere purpose 
     <lb/>
     of putting my amendment on record, for I 
     <lb/>
     do feel that the views I am about to express, 
     <lb/>
     and which I have ever held since I have been 
     <lb/>
     a member of this House, may not commend 
     <lb/>
     themselves to any considerable number of 
     <lb/>
     hon. members. I have no desire that the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the Roman Catholic minority of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada shall be abridged, nor that the 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges of any other denomi<lb break="no"/>nation shall be interfered with in any respect. 
     <lb/>
     But I wish hon. members to bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     that the experience we have had in this 
     <lb/>
     country—not to allude to that of the neigh<lb break="no"/>boring States. proves that a denial of the 
     <lb/>
     right of the majority to legislate on any 
     <lb/>
     given matter has always led to grave con<lb break="no"/>sequences. I need only mention the Clergy 
     <lb/>
     Reserve question. This, it must be recol<lb break="no"/>lected, was forbidden to be legislated upon 
     <lb/>
     by the Union Act; yet it was the cause of 
     <lb/>
     fierce strife and legislation for many years. 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     The original Constitution of the United  
     <lb/>
     States prohibited the question of slavery 
     <lb/>
     from being interfered with by Congress; yet 
     <lb/>
     an agitation for its suppression was early 
     <lb/>
     commenced, and has at last terminated 
     <lb/>
     in civil war. (Hear.) The agitation of 
     <lb/>
     the Clergy Reserve question produced a 
     <lb/>
     rebellion in Upper Canada. I say, sir, that 
     <lb/>
     by making a constitutional restriction in re<lb break="no"/>spect to the schools of the minority, we are 
     <lb/>
     sowing the seeds from which will in the end 
     <lb/>
     arise a serious conflict, unless the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion be amended. The minority will be quite 
     <lb/>
     safe on a question relating to their faith and 
     <lb/>
     their education in a colony under the sway 
     <lb/>
     of the British Crown ; but if you expressly 
     <lb/>
     withdraw that question from the control of 
     <lb/>
     the majority, the rights of the minority will 
     <lb/>
     not be safe in either section of the province, 
     <lb/>
     if you distrust the action of the majority. 
     <lb/>
     It is our duty, sir, to see that a question 
     <lb/>
     which affects us so dearly as the education 
     <lb/>
     of our children —a question which has before 
     <lb/>
     now created no little excitement in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada—shall not be withdrawn from the 
     <lb/>
     management of the Local Legislature. We 
     <lb/>
     ought not to deprive them of a power which 
     <lb/>
     they will want to exercise, just because they 
     <lb/>
     are deprived of it, and provoke a desire on 
     <lb/>
     their part to alter the system. You may rely 
     <lb/>
     upon it other religious bodies will be sure 
     <lb/>
     to protest against any particular creed having 
     <lb/>
     special rights, or an exclusive monopoly of 
     <lb/>
     certain privileges, whatever they may be. I 
     <lb/>
     should be astonished if any one in this House 
     <lb/>
     would say, either to the Protestant minority in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada or to the Roman Catholic min<lb break="no"/>ority in Upper Canada—"You are not to trust 
     <lb/>
     to the justice of the majority." Have they 
     <lb/>
     ever known a country where the majority 
     <lb/>
     did not control affairs, and where the minority 
     <lb/>
     had not to submit ? Does not the majority 
     <lb/>
     rule and the minority submit in England 
     <lb/>
     and in France ? I have never heard of any 
     <lb/>
     state where this was not the case. The 
     <lb/>
     minority is safe against undue encroachment 
     <lb/>
     on its rights, and I am willing to trust to the 
     <lb/>
     sense of justice of the majority in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada to preserve the religious and edu<lb break="no"/>cational liberties of the Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada. I am now getting some<lb break="no"/>what advanced in years, and I am the more 
     <lb/>
     anxious to put my opinions on record, be<lb break="no"/>cause before long shall have the satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     of saying, though perhaps not on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     this House, that I protested against resolu<lb break="no"/>tions intended to prevent the free expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion by the majority of the people 
     <lb/>

     If hon. gentlemen think they are going 
     <lb/>
     to silence the bitter feelings which have been 
     <lb/>
     engendered in Upper Canada in consequence 
     <lb/>
     of the attempt to make permanent a certain 
     <lb/>
     system of education, they are much mistaken; 
     <lb/>
     and I desire to have the expression of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the members of this House on the 
     <lb/>
     subject, whether they think that the restric<lb break="no"/>tion in the proposed Constitution I have men<lb break="no"/>tioned is calculated to bring about harmony, 
     <lb/>
     and whether it is not better to let the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics of Upper Canada and the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants of Lower Canada protect themselves, or 
     <lb/>
     rather trust for protection to the sense of 
     <lb/>
     justice of their fellow-subjects. (Hear) 
     <lb/>
     MB. A. MACKENZIE— Sir, having 
     <lb/>
     already voted for the whole of these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions as part of the scheme, I cannot have 
     <lb/>
     any hesitation in voting against the amend<lb break="no"/>ment, but in doing so I desire to explain my 
     <lb/>
     position. (Hear, hear.) If the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Cornwall (Hon. J. S. MACDONALD) 
     <lb/>
     had shown the same zeal against the separate 
     <lb/>
     school system when he had the power to 
     <lb/>
     prevent legislation on that subject, he would 
     <lb/>
     have saved himself and the party which 
     <lb/>
     kept him in power some trouble. It seems 
     <lb/>
     curious that he who was so anxious to pro<lb break="no"/>mote the separate school system then should 
     <lb/>
     now be anxious in quite another direc<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear, hear.) This can only be done 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of party strife, to put 
     <lb/>
     as many of us Upper Canadians as he can 
     <lb/>
     in a false position ; but I can only tell 
     <lb/>
     him that I, having struggled as much 
     <lb/>
     as any one to prevent legislation tend<lb break="no"/>ing to break up our common school system, 
     <lb/>
     and having found my efforts utterly in<lb break="no"/>effectual, do not see that our position 
     <lb/>
     would be any worse if the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     are carried into law. (Hear) I formerly 
     <lb/>
     stated that I thought the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system would not prove very disastrous if it 
     <lb/>
     went no further. I do not now think they 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     will do much harm, if they remain in the 
     <lb/>
     same position as at present, and therefore, 
     <lb/>
     though I am against the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system, I am willing to accept this Con<lb break="no"/>federation, even though it perpetuates a 
     <lb/>
     small number of separate schools. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Under the present legislative union 
     <lb/>
     we are powerless in any movement for the 
     <lb/>
     abrogation of the separate system ; it is even 
     <lb/>
     very doubtful if we could resist the demands 
     <lb/>
     for its extension. (Hear, hear.) We will 
     <lb/>
     not be in any worse position under the new 
     <lb/>
     system, and in one respect we will have a 
     <lb/>
     decided advantage, in that no further change 
     <lb/>
     can be made by the separate school advocates. 
     <lb/>
     We will thus substitute certainty for uncer<lb break="no"/>tainty. I deeply regret that the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member should have thought it necessary 
     <lb/>
     for any purpose to move this resolution.
