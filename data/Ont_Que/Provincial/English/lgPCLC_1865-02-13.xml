            <!--<p>
     not in name alone. I should like to be fully 
     <lb/>
     informed as to whether an export duty is to 
     <lb/>
     be levied on coal in Nova Scotia, no matter 
     <lb/>
     whether it is intended for another part of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation or for a foreign country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—The royalty col<lb break="no"/>lected on coal in Nova Scotia is similar to the 
     <lb/>
     stumpage duty on timber in Canada, which is 
     <lb/>
     paid no matter where the timber is exported 
     <lb/>
     to. It may well be, therefore, that when coal 
     <lb/>
     is exported from Nova Scotia to another pro<lb break="no"/>vince it will contribute to the revenues of the 
     <lb/>
     Local Government of Nova Scotia. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—There are several 
     <lb/>
     other provisions in the proposed Constitution 
     <lb/>
     which seem to be ambiguous in their meaning, 
     <lb/>
     and before discussion upon them it would be 
     <lb/>
     well to have them fully explained. In the 
     <lb/>
     eleventh clause of the twenty-ninth resolution, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, it is declared that the General 
     <lb/>
     Parliament shall have power to make laws 
     <lb/>
     respecting " all such works as shall, although 
     <lb/>
     lying  wholly within any province, be specially 
     <lb/>
     declared by the acts authorizing them to be 
     <lb/>
     for the general advantage." It would appear 
     <lb/>
     from this, that works like the Welland canal, 
     <lb/>
     which yield a very large revenue, will be given 
     <lb/>
     over to the General Government ; and this 
     <lb/>
     being the case, surely this is a sufficient set- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     off, five times over, for the railways given by 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, without the annual subsidy 
     <lb/>
     proposed to be given to that province of 
     <lb/>
     $63,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. MACPHERSON—The cost of 
     <lb/>
     these works forms part of the public debt of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, which is to be borne in part by the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces under the Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will see that there are some works 
     <lb/>
     which, although local in their geographical 
     <lb/>
     position, are general in their character and 
     <lb/>
     results. Such works become the property 
     <lb/>
     of the General Government. The Welland  
     <lb/>
     canal is one of them, because, although it is 
     <lb/>
     local in its position, it is a work in which 
     <lb/>
     the whole country is interested, as the chief 
     <lb/>
     means of water communication between the 
     <lb/>
     western lakes and the sea. Other works, in 
     <lb/>
    the Lower Provinces, may be of the same 
     <lb/>character, and it is not safe to say that be<lb break="no"/>cause a certain work lies wholly in one pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>nince, it is not to belong to the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—I do not object to 
     <lb/>
     the General Government having the control 
     <lb/>
     of these works. It is, I believe, a wise pro<lb break="no"/>vision to place them under such control. But 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     22 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     I do say that it is unfair that an express stip<lb break="no"/>ulation should be made to pay one province a 
     <lb/>
     large sum per annum for certain works, while, 
     <lb/>
     at the same time, we throw in our public 
     <lb/>
     works, such as the Welland and St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     canals, without any consideration whatever. 
     <lb/>
     This, I think, is paying quite too much for 
     <lb/>
     the whistle. Then the answer of the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Crown Lands about the export 
     <lb/>
     duty on minerals in Nova Scotia is not at all 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory. Whatever dues may be levied 
     <lb/>
     on minerals in Canada—and Canada, although 
     <lb/>
     it may contain no coal, is rich in gold, silver, 
     <lb/>
     copper, iron, and other ores—in the shape of 
     <lb/>
     a royalty or otherwise, go to the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, while in Nova Scotia they ac<lb break="no"/>crue for the benefit of the Local Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. ROSS—No, they will not go to 
     <lb/>
     the General Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—Well, there is no<lb break="no"/>thing to the contrary in the resolutions, and 
     <lb/>
     you may depend upon it that whatever reve<lb break="no"/>nues the General Government may claim, 
     <lb/>
     under the proposed Constitution, will be fully 
     <lb/>
     insisted upon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—My honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend, referring a moment ago to the Welland 
     <lb/>
     and other canals, objected to certain works 
     <lb/>
     being considered as belonging to the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, because they are local in their 
     <lb/>
     geographical position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—I do not say that 
     <lb/>
     they should not go to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but what I do say is that they are a 
     <lb/>
     sufficient set-off for the works given by the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, without paying them a 
     <lb/>
     special sum from the general revenues of 
     <lb/>
     $63,000 per annum.

     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, as the question now under considera<lb break="no"/>tion involves a change in the constitution, not

     only of this House but of the whole of the

     discussion opened that were not before pro<lb break="no"/>perly understood. The question has not been 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently understood in the country, and 
     <lb/>
     even now I doubt whether the proposed 
     <lb/>
     changes are thoroughly comprehended, in both 
     <lb/>
     branches of the Legislature. Constitutions are 
     <lb/>
     not usually made in a day, and they should 
     <lb/>
     not be passed in a week ; they are matters of 
     <lb/>
     too grave a character. I trust, if we make a 
     <lb/>
     new Constitution, it will be one that will be 
     <lb/>
     sustained not for ten or twenty years, but for 
     <lb/>
     centuries. It is to be hoped that every change 
     <lb/>
     which is made will be of the right character, 
     <lb/>
     and in accordance with the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     country ; not such a change as will have to be 
     <lb/>
     repealed again in a few years.

     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—Will the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman make a motion on this subject, or 
     <lb/>
     shall we continue the debate without that 
     <lb/>
     motion ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>.—I have in my hand 
     <lb/>
     a resolution, which I propose to submit to the 
     <lb/>
     House shortly.
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—Does the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman intend to choke off discussion now ? 
     <lb/>
    Surely that is not desirable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     knows we do not desire to choke off discussion. 
     <lb/>
     If any persons are anxious that the discussion 
     <lb/>
     should be choked off, they are those who are 
     <lb/>
     desirous of pushing through this measure with 
     <lb/>
     undue haste. There are many reasons why 
     <lb/>
     the discussion of this question should be de<lb break="no"/>layed. First, its very great importance ; 
     <lb/>
     secondly, to enable us to obtain more informa<lb break="no"/>tion upon it. It is well known that very elo<lb break="no"/>quent and effective speeches have been made 
     <lb/>
     in the other branch of the Legislature, which 
     <lb/>
     have not yet been published in full, and with<lb break="no"/>out which we cannot so thoroughly understand 
     <lb/>
     what arguments are made in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     measure, as is desirable. I beg to move that 
     <lb/>
     this debate be adjourned for ten days. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MOOR1">HON. MR. MOORE</persName>—I agree with the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman who has made this motion that 
     <lb/>
     the question now before us is a very important 
     <lb/>
     one, and should be fully considered in all its 
     <lb/>
     bearings, both by this House and the people 
     <lb/>
     of the province at large. I think, with him, 
     <lb/>
     that we ought to have the benefit of the peru<lb break="no"/>sal of the able and eloquent speeches which 
     <lb/>
     have been made in the other branch of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, and in this branch also ; and inas<lb break="no"/>much as they have postponed the discussion in 
     <lb/>
     the other branch of the Legislature, I apprehend 
     <lb/>
     there would be nothing improper in our doing 
     <lb/>
     so too. Again, there are other contracting 
     <lb/>
     parties to this measure, viz., the Lower Prov<lb break="no"/>
         
         
            <cb/>
           
           inces, which are equally interested with our<lb break="no"/>selves. In Nova Scotia the Legislature, I 
     <lb/>
     understand, is in session, and by telegraphic 
     <lb/>
     communication, from day to day, we could 
     <lb/>
     ascertain the feeling of the people there. This 
     <lb/>
     would not at all retard the action of this 
     <lb/>
     House, for it is known that business is usually 
     <lb/>
     despatched with more rapidity here than in the 
     <lb/>
     other. Nothing, it seems to me, will be lost, 
     <lb/>
     but, on the contrary, much gained by a tem<lb break="no"/>porary postponement of the debate. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I desire to place my views on the 
     <lb/>
     whole subject before this House, but I desire 
     <lb/>
     to give them only after the matter has been 
     <lb/>
     calmly and deliberately discussed. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion is one which concerns us all. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think the discussion of it should be entered 
     <lb/>
     upon with any party spirit or any party feel<lb break="no"/>ing. Our interests are all the same, whether 
     <lb/>
     for weal or woe. If the measure be a good 
     <lb/>
     one—if the project for our Confederation be 
     <lb/>
     a salutary one—if it be a panacea for all the 
     <lb/>
     existing evils of our body politic—a little 
     <lb/>
     time given for reflection can do it no harm. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) When we come to the discussion of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, there are several important points 
     <lb/>
     to be cleared up. We have yet to ascertain 
     <lb/>
     the respective and relative powers of the 
     <lb/>
     federal and local governments, and it is desir<lb break="no"/>able that ample time should be given to the 
     <lb/>
     Government for the answering of questions 
     <lb/>
     upon this subject. Then we have to receive 
     <lb/>
     explanations about the export duty on coal 
     <lb/>
     and other minerals—whether this export duty 
     <lb/>
     is to be levied by or on behalf of the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government of Nova Scotia after Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and whether it is to be levied on all 
     <lb/>
     coal exported, or not upon coal exported to 
     <lb/>
     other sections of the proposed union. Again, 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the export duty on the lumber of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, is it to be applied, as I 
     <lb/>
     understand it, to the local revenue of that 
     <lb/>
     province ? Then, as to the stumpage duty 
     <lb/>
     on that portion of the Crown domain apper<lb break="no"/>taining to Lower Canada, is that to be applied 
     <lb/>
     to the purposes of the Local Government of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—I shall be very 
     <lb/>
     happy to give my hon. friend, from time to

     <lb/>
     to me that it would be profitable for the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—I shall be very 
     <lb/>
     brief in the remarks I have now to make to 
     <lb/>
     the House. I do not object to the objects of 
     <lb/>
               these resolutions, or to the measure <hi rendition="simple:italic">per se</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     but I do object to some of its details. I hope 
     <lb/>
     to see a union of the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Colonies effected, but what I am anxious for 
     <lb/>
     is that the conditions of the union may be so 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory and well considered, that there 
     <lb/>
     will not be embraced therein the seeds of 
     <lb/>
     future disruption, or anything that will give 
     <lb/>
     rise to a desire on the part of any of the prov<lb break="no"/>inces to separate from the union, or prevent 
     <lb/>
     other portions of British North America 
     <lb/>
     coming in hereafter and forming parts of this 
     <lb/>
     proposed Confederation. I hope we shall be 
     <lb/>
     some day a great British North American 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy, but that is the greater reason 
     <lb/>
     why the terms of the agreement should be of 
     <lb/>
     such a character that we can all, or nearly all, 
     <lb/>
     approve of them. We must bear in mind, 
     <lb/>
     also, that one reason why those who were 
     <lb/>
     heretofore the exponents of the views of two 
     <lb/>
     great political parties are all on one side at 
     <lb/>
     the present time, arises from the very peculiar 
     <lb/>
     circumstances in which the country has been 
     <lb/>
     placed for the last eight or ten years. Those 
     <lb/>
     who support this measure have given as reasons 
     <lb/>
     for it that we have had so many political 
     <lb/>
     crises, and the changes have been so varied, 
     <lb/>
     that it becomes necessary for some great con<lb break="no"/>stitutional change to be made. They have at the 
     <lb/>
     same time carefully enumerated the political 
     <lb/>
     changes that have taken place during the past 
     <lb/>
     four or five years. First we had the CARTIER- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     MACDONALD Administration, which was sus<lb break="no"/>tained in the Assembly by a very small 
     <lb/>
     majority for two or three sessions. Then we 
     <lb/>
    had the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government 
     <lb/>sustained by a very slim majority. Then the 
     <lb/>MACDONALD—DORION Government, scarcely any 
     <lb/>stronger, Then again the TACHE-MACDON<lb break="no"/>
      
      
            <cb/>
            
            
     ALD Government with an equally slim major<lb break="no"/>ity ;—so that we were really in a state of 
     <lb/>
     political crisis like that of a merchant, who, 
     <lb/>
     having suffered many losses in business affairs, 
     <lb/>
     yet, with his credit still good, at last becomes 
     <lb/>
     confused, and, incapable of exercising his judg<lb break="no"/>ment, launches into some scheme that proves 
     <lb/>
     ruinous, whereas calmness and deliberation 
     <lb/>
     might have retrieved his situation. We had 
     <lb/>
     three governments formed within as many 
     <lb/>
     years, each failing in turn to administer affairs 
     <lb/>
     to the satisfaction of the people. We had, in 
     <lb/>
     the TACHÉ-MACDONALD cabinet, a Finance 
     <lb/>
     Minister on whom a vote of censure of the most 
     <lb/>
     serious character was passed, which amounted 
     <lb/>
     to a vote of want of confidence in the whole 
     <lb/>
     Government. At that time we had in opposi<lb break="no"/>tion the gentleman who is now the President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council, who had contended for ten 
     <lb/>
     years for a change of the constitutional rela<lb break="no"/>tions between Upper and Lower Canada. He 
     <lb/>
     failed to accomplish his object. He could not 
     <lb/>
     consistently ally himself with his opponents 
     <lb/>
     without some new scheme to lay before the 
     <lb/>
     country. To form a government, he could 
     <lb/>
     not. The Finance Minister being condemned, 
     <lb/>
     the government was bound to reconstruct or 
     <lb/>
     resign. Each party desired to rule, but 
     <lb/>
     neither was able. Out of political adversity 
     <lb/>
     grew political desperation. It was called by 
     <lb/>
     some a political millennium, and perhaps it 
     <lb/>
     was ; but matters were just in that shape to 
     <lb/>
     induce parties to take up almost any new 
     <lb/>
     scheme, as in this case, in which I think they 
     <lb/>
     have gone on quite too rapidly. They have 
     <lb/>
     not deliberated sufficiently to propose a mea<lb break="no"/>sure of that mature character which the 
     <lb/>
     country had a right to expect. Perhaps as 
     <lb/>
     good a measure has been brought out as could 
     <lb/>
     have been, considering the short time that has 
     <lb/>
     elapsed, and the disadvantages under which 
     <lb/>
     they labored during the discussion of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. But it must be admitted that when 
     <lb/>
     this measure was agreed to by our Government, 
     <lb/>
     they adopted a hasty course. The country 
     <lb/>
     heard only one side of the question. (Hear) 
     <lb/>
     They had the great daily newspapers, the 
     <lb/>
     chief organs of public opinion of both politi<lb break="no"/>cal parties, all on their side, and there was only 
     <lb/>
     a small portion of the country press, and that 
     <lb/>
     not widely circulated, that gave the opposite 
     <lb/>
     side of the question. And so it has been 
     <lb/>
     going on up to the present time ; and now we 
     <lb/>
     have the scheme brought before us in 
     <lb/>
     its present shape. I consider that, under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances, it is our duty to give 
     <lb/>
     very serious attention to the question, before 
     <lb/>
     we adopt it as it is. (Hear, hear.) I fur<lb break="no"/>
       
       
            <pb n="164" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0164.jpg"/>
      <fw type="num">164</fw>
      
      
      ther think, and I know many others agree 
     <lb/>
     with me, that these resolutions may be amend<lb break="no"/>ed in some points, and yet without in the 
     <lb/>
     slightest degree endangering the whole scheme. 
     <lb/>
     But the Government say, "you must take the 
     <lb/>
     whole measure, or no part of it." I very 
     <lb/>
     much fear that the determination of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in this respect is, if I may so speak, 
     <lb/>
     father to their wish. That they have fallen 
     <lb/>
     in love with their scheme. It is their pet 
     <lb/>
     measure—their bantling—and they wish to 
     <lb/>
     get it through, without any amendment, 
     <lb/>
     just as it is. Suppose amendments are 
     <lb/>
     proposed that really can only affect Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and cannot affect our relations with the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces at all ; what reason is there that 
     <lb/>
     these amendments should not be made ? The 
     <lb/>
     Government can surely communicate with the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces, and get their assent. At the 
     <lb/>
     same time, while I am speaking on these parti<lb break="no"/>cular points, I must express my dissent from cer<lb break="no"/>tain other features of the resolutions, but they 
     <lb/>
     are features, I fear, that we can do nothing to 
     <lb/>
     alter now, for we shall be obliged, as the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment say, to adopt the whole of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions or none. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—That is the 
     <lb/>
    point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—Yes, that is the 
     <lb/>point in reference to certain of these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, but not with regard to others. Two 
     <lb/>years ago the Government of Canada had a 
     <lb/>conference with members of the governments 
     <lb/>of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and in 
     <lb/>that conference agreed that upon certain con<lb break="no"/>ditions, if the money could be obtained, with 
     <lb/>the guarantee of the home Government, at 
     <lb/>a certain rate of interest, the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railway should be built, and they further 
     <lb/>agreed that Canada should only have to pay 
     <lb/>five-twelfths of the cost, which was then esti<lb break="no"/>mated, as it was stated, at twelve millions of 
     <lb/>dollars. I believe, on good authority, that a 
     <lb/>company offered to build the road for twelve 
     <lb/>millions of dollars, and undertook to run it, 
     <lb/>without any additional charge, for twelve 
     <lb/>years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—It was three million 
     <lb/>
    pounds sterling, or fifteen millions of dollars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—Perhaps it was ; 
     <lb/>
     but let us suppose that the estimates should 
     <lb/>
     be as high as they are at present ; let us con<lb break="no"/>ceive the fact as possible that the company 
     <lb/>
     might fail to complete the road without more 
     <lb/>
     aid ; and that it might have cost as much as 
     <lb/>
     is now estimated, namely, eighteen millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars,—still Canada would only have had 
     <lb/>
     five-twelfths of this to pay. But here, in 
     <lb/>
           
           
            <cb/>
          
          
     the short space of two years, we have had 
     <lb/>
     such a change, such a sudden change, that one 
     <lb/>
     statesman of Canada, a man of very great in<lb break="no"/>fluence, and who now presides over the  adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of affairs in this country, the President 
     <lb/>
     of the Council, who opposed that scheme be 
     <lb/>
     cause it involved too large an expenditure for 
     <lb/>
     Canada to incur— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS6">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—He does not preside 
     <lb/>
     over the administration of affairs. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—We call president 
     <lb/>
     the man who presides, and he presides be<lb break="no"/>cause he is president — who opposed that 
     <lb/>
     scheme because it was alleged Canada was 
     <lb/>
     paying far more than her just proportion but is 
     <lb/>
     now in favor of it. Had it not been so strong<lb break="no"/>ly opposed by a man in such a position, and 
     <lb/>
     had the Government not been so weak, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve the scheme would have been carried out. 
     <lb/>
     He who opposed it was one who had been 
     <lb/>
     twenty years in public life ; his opinion was 
     <lb/>
     justly considered valuable, and many were 
     <lb/>
     disposed to agree with it. Had the ministry 
     <lb/>
     gone to the country then, taking the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railroad on their backs, I venture to 
     <lb/>
     say they would have been totally defeated. 
     <lb/>
     They would have had a large majority against 
     <lb/>
     them in Upper Canada, and I think a ma<lb break="no"/>jority against them in Lower Canada also. 
     <lb/>
     But how is it now ? Why, this Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway is to be built out of the funds of the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Government that is proposed to 
     <lb/>
     be established, so that instead of Canada hav<lb break="no"/>ing to pay only five-twelfths of the whole cost, 
     <lb/>
     she will have to pay ten-twelfths. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) This will involve five to seven millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars of an expense more than we had 
     <lb/>
     any occasion for incurring, for the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were all willing to have been responsi<lb break="no"/>ble for the rest, and there is very good rea<lb break="no"/>son why they should. The countries to be 
     <lb/>
     benefited by the Intercolonial Railway are 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but especi<lb break="no"/>ally the former. In that province there is an 
     <lb/>
     extensive wilderness, with some valuable tim<lb break="no"/>ber limits, if not much farming land, through 
     <lb/>
     which this road will have to pass, and every 
     <lb/>
     acre of land within twenty or thirty miles of 
     <lb/>
     the road will be largely increased in value. 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick would gain that advantage, 
     <lb/>
     while as for Nova Scotia, Halifax, its chief 
     <lb/>
     port, will be made an outlet by the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of the line, and will of course be largely 
     <lb/>
     benefited, so that they were only proposing 
     <lb/>
     what was fair and equitable ; but in coming 
     <lb/>
     down with a scheme which involves us in 
     <lb/>
     twice as great an expenditure as was formerly 
     <lb/>
     contemplated, they seem not to have been 
     <lb/>

     satisfied, unless we handed over to the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government our public works. These, hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, are of immense value to Canada. 
     <lb/>
     By imposing tolls on our canals to an extent 
     <lb/>
     which they would easily bear, and which 
     <lb/>
     would not prevent our carrying on the same 
     <lb/>
     immense trade as at present, we could readily 
     <lb/>
     raise half a million a year. The Welland 
     <lb/>
     canal alone has produced a revenue of $200,<lb break="no"/>000 a year. Well, all such sources of income 
     <lb/>
     are to be thrown into the hands of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government, while New Brunswick is to give 
     <lb/>
     us a railway which only pays three-eighths of 
     <lb/>
     one per cent. over its working expenses. This 
     <lb/>
     small sum, remember too, is what is paid now 
     <lb/>
     —two or three years after the construction of 
     <lb/>
     the line—but when the rolling stock gets out 
     <lb/>
     of repair, the rails want renewing, and other 
     <lb/>
     matters usual after a railroad has been some<lb break="no"/>time working have to be attended to—the 
     <lb/>
     expense of the line to the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     will constantly increase. The road will be a 
     <lb/>
     drag ; and I say to hon. gentlemen that we 
     <lb/>
     are opening an account without knowing when 
     <lb/>
     it will be closed. (Cheers.) By engaging in 
     <lb/>
     the construction of the Intercolonial Railway, 
     <lb/>
     and the assumption of the New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and Nova Scotia lines, we are entering upon 
     <lb/>
     indefinite liabilities—the whole being non<lb break="no"/>paying property in which we shall find a heavy 
     <lb/>
    bill of expense. (Hear, hear.) Then, as if 
     <lb/>not satisfied with this, we are giving a sort of 
               <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Regium donum</hi> of $63,000 for ten years to the 
     <lb/>Province of New Brunswick. Again, we are 
     <lb/>to purchase for $160,000 a year the mines 
     <lb/>and minerals and Crown lands of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. Now, I venture to say, we shall not 
     <lb/>realize $40,000 a year out of these minerals 
     <lb/>and Crown lands. We have a large mining 
     <lb/>country ourselves, which we find no very 
     <lb/>fertile source of revenue, and though it is 
     <lb/>true we have no coal in Canada, we can 
     <lb/>get that from Nova Scotia by paying an export 
     <lb/>duty and the cost of freight. In the face of 
     <lb/>these disadvantages we are entering a union 
     <lb/>which, by judicious management, might have 
     <lb/>been brought about without involving us in 
     <lb/>this immense expense. As I said before, I 
     <lb/>desire to see a union, but I want to see it 
     <lb/>effected on fair terms. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
     <lb/>in regard to the increased trade which it 
     <lb/>is said we are likely to get after the union 
     <lb/>is effected, I think there will be much disap<lb break="no"/>pointment. It strikes me that it will be 
     <lb/>almost impossible to alter the present course 
     <lb/>of trade, except by imposing duties on articles 
     <lb/>imported from other countries. The Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>colonial Railway will be too long, and there<lb break="no"/>
          
          
            <cb/>
         
         fore freight by it will be too expensive to 
     <lb/>
    divert trade, unless it is run by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment at the cost of the country, and people 
     <lb/>are allowed to carry their goods almost free of 
     <lb/>charge. It can hardly be expected that we 
     <lb/>shall send breadstuffs over this railway. Even 
     <lb/>now it is not pretended that the railway can 
     <lb/>bring breadstuffs down as far as Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS6">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—They get them by water 
     <lb/>in the autumn, and store them for winter use. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName>—They will be able 
     <lb/>in winter time to get their supplies cheaper at 
     <lb/>St. John or Halifax by water than by the 
     <lb/>Intercolonial Railroad. If they are to buy 
     <lb/>our produce, there must be some pecuniary 
     <lb/>inducement, for they will not give us half a 
     <lb/>dollar a barrel more because the flour comes 
     <lb/>from Upper Canada ; and what that induce<lb break="no"/>ment is to be I fail to understand, unless it 
     <lb/>be the effect of a heavy customs duty on 
     <lb/>foreign breadstuffs. As the channel of trade 
     <lb/>now is, the Lower Provinces can buy their 
     <lb/>flour cheaper in Boston and New York than 
     <lb/>in Canada, and would it be right to compel 
     <lb/>their people to take our produce at a greater 
     <lb/>cost than they can purchase elsewhere ? It 
     <lb/>has been said that they consume $4,000,000 
     <lb/>worth of breadstuffs in a year, and many other 
     <lb/>articles that might be produced or manufac<lb break="no"/>tured in great part in Canada, and is it likely 
     <lb/>the 60,000 fishermen of Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>Brunswick will consent to have a duty of 20 
     <lb/>per cent., or any other high duty imposed on 
     <lb/>breadstuffs, for the sole purpose of driving 
     <lb/>them out of the American and into the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian markets ? (Hear, hear.) I question 
     <lb/>whether they are not apprehending a difficulty 
     <lb/>of this kind now, and on that account unwil<lb break="no"/>ling to accept all the inducements we have 
     <lb/>held out ; unwilling to take the revenue we 
     <lb/>have offered them ; unwilling to yield to the 
     <lb/>temptations put before them ; because they 
     <lb/>are afraid of the imposition of duties on 
     <lb/>breadstuffs, to which they would be liable if 
     <lb/>they were to place themselves in the power of 
     <lb/>a country represented by so large a vote in the 
     <lb/>General Government as Canada will have. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Leaving this question of trade, 
     <lb/>we come to the consideration of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of this House. Now, no one has petitioned  
     <lb/>against the continuance of the elective system 
     <lb/>—no one has complained that it does not work 
     <lb/>satisfactorily. We do not see that many of 
     <lb/>the elected members are so very much inferior 
     <lb/>to the nominated members of this House— 
     <lb/>there has been no serious ground for fearing a 
     <lb/>dead-lock—yet there is to be a change in 
     <lb/>the constitution of the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>

     in conformity, we are told, with the desire of  
     <lb/>
    the Lower Provinces. But we must look a 
     <lb/>little further than this. If you canvass the 
     <lb/>views of the honorable gentlemen who repre<lb break="no"/>sented this province at the great Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion meeting, you will find that most of them 
     <lb/>were inclined beforehand to concur in the 
     <lb/>views of the representatives of the eastern 
     <lb/>provinces, for they have always entertained 
     <lb/>views in opposition to the elective principle as 
     <lb/>applied to this House. They acted quite con<lb break="no"/>sistently, but it does not follow that they are 
     <lb/>right in making this change. We know that 
     <lb/>in former times, when our Legislative Council 
     <lb/>was nominated by the Crown, difficulties did 
     <lb/>arise. In old times, bills passed by the As<lb break="no"/>sembly were thrown out almost by the hun<lb break="no"/>dred.

     the system of appointment there is another 
     <lb/>
     evil—the government of the day is particular 
     <lb/>
     in appointing those who are political friends 
     <lb/>
     of their own, and have aided them either 
     <lb/>
     at elections or in ways which may not be 
     <lb/>
     very creditable. (Laughter.) My honorable

     friend (Hon. Mr. CRAWFORD) may laugh, 
     <lb/>
     but if he reflects he will remember that he has 
     <lb/>
     himself known men in high positions whose

     career was not creditable in all particulars. 
     <lb/>
     However patriotic and anxious to discharge 
     <lb/>
     their duties rightly they might be, their views 
     <lb/>
     were sometimes warped by circumstances. 
     <lb/>
     Looking across the ocean, my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     will remember that during the Administration 
     <lb/>
     of WILLIAM PITT, who wielded almost the 
     <lb/>
     sole control of Parliament in England for 
     <lb/>
     seventeen years, he appointed, during this 
     <lb/>
     period, 140 members to the House of Lords, 
     <lb/>
     subservient to his own wishes and intent on 
     <lb/>
     carrying out his views. I will just read to 
     <lb/>
     this House a short extract relating to him, 
     <lb/>
     written by a man capable of judging. In 
     <lb/>

     When Mr. PITT had been eight years in power 
     <lb/>
     he had created between sixty and seventy Peers,

     the greater part of whom owed their elevation to

     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman acknowledges his 
     <lb/>
     determination to reward his political support<lb break="no"/>ers. Is this the way to obtain an independent 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature, one that will operate 
     <lb/>
     as a wholesome check on hasty legislation ? 
     <lb/>
     Those who receive favors from a political party 
     <lb/>
     are not likely to turn their backs upon that 
     <lb/>
     party. I think we are not likely, under any 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, to have a more independent 
     <lb/>
     House under the proposed system than we 
     <lb/>
     now have, or one which will better advance 
     <lb/>
     the interests of the country. If you wish to 
     <lb/>
     raise the elective franchise, for elections to 
     <lb/>
     the Upper House—if you would confine their 
     <lb/>
     election to voters on real estate of $400 as<lb break="no"/>sessed value, and tenants holding a lease-hold 
     <lb/>
     of $100 annual value, and thus place these 
     <lb/>
     elections out of the reach of a mere money in<lb break="no"/>fluence that may sometimes operate upon the 
     <lb/>
     masses—if you think this body is not suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently conservative—let them be elected by a 
     <lb/>
     more conservative portion of the community— 
     <lb/>
     that portion which has the greatest stake in 
     <lb/>
     the community—but do not strike out the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle altogether. The late Duke 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     in the Empire, and whose opinions are very

     valuable on this point, wrote as follows to the

     Nor do I think it any way objectionable, but 
     <lb/>
     the contrary, that the Council (as in Canada,

     is obviated (or intended to be so) by providing

     <lb/>
     the country, you might rely on their not being 
     <lb/>
     too vacillating, but on their proving a proper, 
     <lb/>
     healthy and valuable check on the lower 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Some honorable gentlemen have urged that 
     <lb/>
     the people should not elect their representa<lb break="no"/>tives to the Upper House, because it involves 
     <lb/>
     a very great expense on the part of the elect<lb break="no"/>ed, and because they cannot judge who is 
     <lb/>
     worthy of their confidence so well as the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the day. Now, I argue that if 
     <lb/>
     the people are unfit to choose members of this 
     <lb/>
     House, the are unfit to choose members of 
     <lb/>
     the other House too. If three counties united 
     <lb/>
     are not able to make a good selection, how 
     <lb/>
     can one-third part of that constituency make 
     <lb/>
     a good one ? And with regard to the corrupt 
     <lb/>
     influences that may be brought to bear, will it 
     <lb/>
     be for a moment said that a large constit<lb break="no"/>uency of three counties can be as easily cor<lb break="no"/>rupted as a constituency composed of only one 
     <lb/>
     county ? I think not. I think a more inde<lb break="no"/>pendent vote is brought to bear on the elec<lb break="no"/>tion of a member of the Upper House than of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower. Yet the members of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     House want to assume the power of dictating 
     <lb/>
     who shall compose the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     A few years ago, at the general elections, 
     <lb/>
     when two men were running, though they 
     <lb/>
           
           
            <cb/>
          
          
     were both conservative, we always found one 
     <lb/>
     taking the ground that no money should be 
     <lb/>
     spent by the Government of the day without 
     <lb/>
     the consent of Parliament, and all the liberal 
     <lb/>
     party, without exception, took that view; yet 
     <lb/>
     now we find that as some of these men have 
     <lb/>
     got into the Government they have unlimited 
     <lb/>
     confidence in the wisdom of the Executive; 
     <lb/>
     they say our very Constitution can be amend<lb break="no"/>ed within a period of six months without the 
     <lb/>
     people having anything to say about it; they 
     <lb/>
     now think governments can do no wrong. Of 
     <lb/>
     course, this is in accordance with human nature 
     <lb/>
     —what they themselves do must bo right; 
     <lb/>
     they themselves can do no wrong. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) To sum up, honorable gentlemen, I 
     <lb/>
     complain that this arrangement for bringing 
     <lb/>
     about the Confederation of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces is being made on terms 
     <lb/>
     of great disadvantage to Canada, that a fair 
     <lb/>
     agreement has not been settled upon as be<lb break="no"/>tween the several colonies. I complain that 
     <lb/>
     in making such an arrangement with the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces, the constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     House should have been interfered with ; and 
     <lb/>
     I complain, finally, of the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the whole measure is being forced through 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature, without first being submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the people for their sanction; and I 
     <lb/>
     cannot but feel that these proposed changes 
     <lb/>
     so rashly adopted, carry with them the 
     <lb/>
     seeds of their early dissolution—a result 
     <lb/>
     that all should regret who desire the perma<lb break="no"/>nent consolidation and well-being of these col<lb break="no"/>onies. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. McCREA</persName>—Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, so much has already been said on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the Confederation of the British 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces during the course of this 
     <lb/>
     debate, which has now occupied the House 
     <lb/>
     for several days, both here and in the Assem<lb break="no"/>bly, by the ablest men in the province, that I 
     <lb/>
     do not hope to add anything of great weight 
     <lb/>
     or importance to what has been urged on the 
     <lb/>
     question now submitted to our consideration ; 
     <lb/>
     still, I feel that I should neither do justice to 
     <lb/>
     my constituents, who have sent me here, nor 
     <lb/>
     to myself, if I do not upon this occasion 
     <lb/>
     state, with what force I may, the reasons which 
     <lb/>
     induced me to give my hearty approval to this 
     <lb/>
     measure for the Confederation of all these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces under one government, upon the basis 
     <lb/>
     of these resolutions which Ministers have laid 
     <lb/>
     upon the table of this House. Very much 
     <lb/>
     has been said, by almost every speaker who 
     <lb/>
     has preceded me, upon the importance of the 
     <lb/>
     subject now before us, and the consequent 
     <lb/>
     responsibility which attaches itself to every 
     <lb/>

           <fw type="num">168</fw>
           
           
     individual member of this Honorable House 
     <lb/>
     for the course which he may adopt. I quite 
     <lb/>
     concur with honorable gentlemen that the 
     <lb/>
     present juncture in our again is big with the 
     <lb/>
     future destiny of our country, and that our 
     <lb/>
     fate for weal or woe depends upon the course 
     <lb/>
     we shall now pursue, and I, for one, feel not 
     <lb/>
     the slightest desire to shift one single atom of 
     <lb/>
     the burthen of that responsibility from my 
     <lb/>
     shoulders. I am fully prepared to assume it 
     <lb/>
     at once upon the merits of the scheme as it is 
     <lb/>
     evolved in these resolutions, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     wish to shield myself behind either an ad<lb break="no"/>journment, such as has been proposed by my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend the member or the division 
     <lb/>
     of King, and which, I am glad to say, has 
     <lb/>
     just been rejected by an unmistakable vote of 
     <lb/>
     this House, or the larger motion, of which my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Niagara has given no<lb break="no"/>tice, for an appeal to the people, and to which 
     <lb/>
     I shall presently again refer. An objection 
     <lb/>
               has been taken <hi rendition="simple:italic">in limine</hi> by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member from Niagara to the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the Conference which sat at Quebec, that they 
     <lb/>
     were, in the first place, self-appointed ; and, in 
     <lb/>
     the second place, that the great principle of 
     <lb/>
     representation based upon population was not 
     <lb/>
     carried out, because although the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces possessed each, and even collectively, 
     <lb/>
     a much smaller population than Canada, yet 
     <lb/>
     they had a much larger number of members 
     <lb/>
     in the Congress than we had. As to the first 
     <lb/>
     objection, of their being self-appointed or self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     constituted, some one had to take the initia<lb break="no"/>tive in the matter, and no one had better au<lb break="no"/>thority than the different governments to say 
     <lb/>
     who should represent their respective pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in the Conference. Will honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen contend that the delegates were self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     appointed when they were appointed by the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry of the day, who are responsible to 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Assembly, which, in its turn, 
     <lb/>
     is responsible to the people at large ? Then, 
     <lb/>
     as to the second objection, that the numbers 
     <lb/>
     were unequal, the honorable gentleman ought 
     <lb/>
     to know that the principle of representation 
     <lb/>
     by population does not apply to the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence in the same way that it does to the re<lb break="no"/>presentation in this and the other House of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament. Here the vote of every individ<lb break="no"/>ual member counts upon a division on an 
     <lb/>
    question, and so numbers become of the 
     <lb/>utmost importance. But in the Conference 
     <lb/>the votes were counted by provinces, and not 
     <lb/>by single votes, so that it was impossible that 
     <lb/>any one province could be swamped by the 
     <lb/>others by reason of their having a larger re<lb break="no"/>presentation. The only affect of an undue 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
        
        
     representation from any province would be to 
     <lb/>
     increase the difficulty the delegates from that 
     <lb/>
     one would have in agreeing among themselves 
     <lb/>
     to any single proposition, or to the proposi<lb break="no"/>tions as a whole, and it could not, in any 
     <lb/>
     way, work any injustice to the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I have no doubt the Conference found 
     <lb/>
     their greatest difficulty in bringing the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of each section to agree among them<lb break="no"/>selves. (Hear, hear, from the <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     CAMPBELL</persName>.) If the delegates from any 
     <lb/>
     province felt that they could not agree to 
     <lb/>
     any of the questions submitted to them, 
     <lb/>
     they had but to say so, and the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, so far as they were concerned, 
     <lb/>
     would have been at an end. The argument 
     <lb/>
     of unfair representation is, therefore, quite 
     <lb/>
     fallacious. There could really be no danger 
     <lb/>
     from the number of representatives not being 
     <lb/>
     in proportion, so long as each province had 
     <lb/>
     the power of protecting itself from any injus<lb break="no"/>tice. which might be attempted to be perpe<lb break="no"/>trated against it by the others. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It has also been objected that the present Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian Administration was formed upon the 
     <lb/>
     avowed policy of forming a Federal union 
     <lb/>
     between Upper and Lower Canada only, and 
     <lb/>
     that the Government has exceeded their con<lb break="no"/>stitutional powers by substituting an union of 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces instead of what they had 
     <lb/>
     promised. Do we not all remember that the 
     <lb/>
     avowed policy of the Government was a Fed<lb break="no"/>eral union of these provinces, I mean Upper 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada first, leaving it open to 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces and the colonies of 
     <lb/>
     the great west to fall into the union when<lb break="no"/>ever they might find it their interest to do 
     <lb/>
     so? Ministers, no doubt, had not the slight<lb break="no"/>est idea that the larger scheme could be ac<lb break="no"/>complished as soon if not sooner than the 
     <lb/>
     smaller one. I told my constituents, on com<lb break="no"/>ing before them for re-election, that there was 
     <lb/>
     an urgent necessity for a different union be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada from that 
     <lb/>
     which now exists, and that there was not time 
     <lb/>
     to include the Lower Provinces in the first 
     <lb/>
     scheme. But the movement has outrun my 
     <lb/>
     expectation, and I believe that of every 
     <lb/>
     member of the House. And is the House to 
     <lb/>
     reject the larger scheme when it is the easiest 
     <lb/>
     of accomplishment, simply because it had a 
     <lb/>
     secondary place in the ministerial programme? 
     <lb/>
     I think the Charlottetown Conference was a 
     <lb/>
     good opportunity, and that the Government 
     <lb/>
     has acted wisely in putting themselves in com<lb break="no"/>munication with it, and in taking up the 
     <lb/>
     whole union first. But the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber from the Wellington Division complains 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <pb n="169" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0169.jpg"/>
       <fw type="num">169</fw>
       
       
     that sufficient time has not been given to the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the resolutions by the Con<lb break="no"/>ference, and cites the case of the American 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, when its framers took, I (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. MCCREA) know not how many months 
     <lb/>
     longer than our own Conference. But the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member should recollect that we 
     <lb/>
     had all their experience. We could com<lb break="no"/>mence where they left off. Their work was 
     <lb/>
     ready to our hands. We had also the ex<lb break="no"/>perience of the working of their Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, and knew what to avoid. Besides, the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member should recollect that we 
     <lb/>
     live in an age of railroads and lightning tel<lb break="no"/>egraphs, of which the revolutionary fathers 
     <lb/>
     knew nothing ; and there is no doubt that 
     <lb/>
     speed in travelling and communication has a 
     <lb/>
     great deal to do in quickening the perceptions of 
     <lb/>
     mankind. Instead of its being made a ground of 
     <lb/>
     accusation against the Government that they 
     <lb/>
     have accomplished so much in so short a time, it 
     <lb/>
     ought rather to redound to their credit. And yet 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for the Niagara Division 
     <lb/>
     complains that the measure was not infallible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I did not make that 
     <lb/>
     complaint. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. MCCREA</persName>—Well, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said that it ought to have been " as infal<lb break="no"/>lible as fallible men could make it," and that 
     <lb/>
     "it should do complete justice to all and injus<lb break="no"/>tice to none." I took down the exact words of 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman at the time, and if 
     <lb/>
     the last words do not imply infallibility, they 
     <lb/>
     certainly come very near it. I venture to 
     <lb/>
     assert that if the honorable gentleman were 
     <lb/>
     employed to draw up a simple document of a 
     <lb/>
     few pages, without the interference of any one 
     <lb/>
     to control him, and should refer it to the 
     <lb/>
     revision of any competent person, it would 
     <lb/>
     be found subject to some criticism. How 
     <lb/>
     much less then must we expect a State docu<lb break="no"/>ment like this, the work of so many hands— 
     <lb/>
     where so many conflicting elements were to be 
     <lb/>
     reconciled—where so much had to be insisted 
     <lb/>
     upon on one side and resisted on the other— 
     <lb/>
     should do complete justice to all and injustice to 
     <lb/>
     none, according to the notions of my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend from Niagara ? The wonder is, 
     <lb/>
     not that some fault can be found, but that the 
     <lb/>
     opponents of the measure can find so little. 
     <lb/>
     But it is a little singular that all the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who have yet spoken against the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     of the Conference have declared themselves 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Confederation, and yet, by their 
     <lb/>
     motions and their speeches, they are doing 
     <lb/>
     everything in their power to delay and embar<lb break="no"/>rass the measure—certainly a very left-handed 
     <lb/>
     way of showing their support. Honorable 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
         
         
     members argue against the details from both 
     <lb/>
     a Canadian and the Maritime point of view, 
     <lb/>
     and still tell us they are favorable to Con<lb break="no"/>federation. Some honorable members declare 
     <lb/>
     that the question is not opposed in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada because it is not understood. It is 
     <lb/>
     certainly paying a very poor compliment to 
     <lb/>
     the intelligence of their constituents. The 
     <lb/>
     question has been propounded by eminent 
     <lb/>
     statesmen both in the old country and on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the Atlantic both time and again since 
     <lb/>
     the commencement of the present century, 
     <lb/>
     and has been in the minds of the people ever 
     <lb/>
     since. The reason why it has not been con<lb break="no"/>summated is that no opportunity has ever 
     <lb/>
     presented itself like the present. It had but 
     <lb/>
     to be mentioned to take complete possession of 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the people. Out of thirteen 
     <lb/>
     elections for both branches of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     which have taken place in Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     since the scheme of union has been proposed, 
     <lb/>
     every single one, with but one exception, has 
     <lb/>
    resulted in its favor ; and out of six elections 
     <lb/>for members of this House, whose original 
     <lb/>term of office had expired, four, my own 
     <lb/>among the number, I am glad to say, were by 
     <lb/>acclamation—I believe chiefly on account of 
     <lb/>their declared sentiments in favor of the 
     <lb/>scheme. But it is a little inconsistent, I 
     <lb/>cannot help saying, that at the same time some 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen complain of the ignor<lb break="no"/>ance of Upper Canada on the details of the 
     <lb/>measure—by their votes the other day they 
     <lb/>refused to allow five hundred extra copies of the 
     <lb/>resolutions to be printed for the use of mem<lb break="no"/>bers, that they might distribute them among 
     <lb/>their constituents, proclaiming their ignorance, 
     <lb/>and yet withholding the means of information. 
     <lb/>But honorable gentlemen attempt to frighten 
     <lb/>us with the expenses of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railway ; and my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>Niagara, arguing from the eastern provincial 
     <lb/>point of view, declared they would remember 
     <lb/>the Grand Trunk frauds, and avoid a union 
     <lb/>with those who had perpetrated them. The 
     <lb/>Grand Trunk used to be made an excellent 
     <lb/>stalking horse for gentlemen to ride into Par<lb break="no"/>liament upon, and so pleased have honorable 
     <lb/>members become with the seat, that even after 
     <lb/>having arrived here, they find it very difficult 
     <lb/>to dismount. My honorable friend from the 
     <lb/>division of King, has just now told us that 
     <lb/>we Upper Canadians, by the scheme proposed 
     <lb/>by Ministers, will be compelled to pay ten- 
     <lb break="yes"/>twelfths the cost of the railway. Well, I 
     <lb/>thought I had read the resolutions with a 
     <lb/>great deal of care, and I did not remember 
     <lb/>anything which said a single word about the 
     <lb/>
       
       
    
            <pb n="170" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0170.jpg"/>
      <fw type="num">170</fw>
      
      
     proportionate expense, or about the expense at 
     <lb/>
     all. But, thinking I might be mistaken, I 
     <lb/>
     have taken the trouble to turn them up, and 
     <lb/>
     find there is not one word in them about the 
     <lb/>
     railway except the following. It will be 
     <lb/>
     found in the sixty-eighth resolution, and reads 
     <lb/>
     thus :—" The General Government shall secure 
     <lb/>
     without delay the completion of the Interco<lb break="no"/>lonial Railway, from Riviere du Loup through 
     <lb/>
     New Brunsmck to Truro, in Nova Scotia." 
     <lb/>
     Is there anything here about Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     having to pay ten-twelfths of the expense ? 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REES1">HON. MR. REESOR</persName> said he had not de<lb break="no"/>clared that by the resolutions Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     should pay ten-twelfths, but that upon calcu<lb break="no"/>lation, taking into account numbers and reve<lb break="no"/>nue, that would be the effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. MCCREA</persName>—Well, I take the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman's explanation. Does he 
     <lb/>
     wish to enter into a compact with the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces by which we shall not pay our 
     <lb/>
     fair proportion of our expenses according to 
     <lb/>
     our numbers and our means ? Is he so unjust 
     <lb/>
     as to ask so unfair an advantage ? The fact is, 
     <lb/>
     that the talk about the expenses and stringing 
     <lb/>
     together long rows of figures, is only calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to bewilder and frighten the friends of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme. Three millions of dollars a year, 
     <lb/>
     exclaims the member for Niagara, without 
     <lb/>
     making it very plain how, will be added to our 
     <lb/>
     expense for all time to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—More than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. MCCREA</persName>—More than that. 
     <lb/>
     Well, what of that ? The amount of debt is 
     <lb/>
     nothing to him who has the means and is wil<lb break="no"/>ling to pay. It is only unpleasant to the 
     <lb/>
     bankrupt who cannot pay, and to the miser 
     <lb/>
     who hates to part with his gold. Some one has 
     <lb/>
     said that it was a very great drawback to the 
     <lb/>
     morals and prosperity of London, that there 
     <lb/>
     should be fifty-thousand thieves within its 
     <lb/>
     walls. But it was well replied, that it was 
     <lb/>
     rather a source of congratulation that the 
     <lb/>
     metropolis should be able to support so many. 
     <lb/>
     So instead of regretting that we shall have 
     <lb/>
     so much to pay, we ought rather to rejoice 
     <lb/>
     that we shall be able to pay it. Instead of 
     <lb/>
     complaining that in the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     railway, we shall have to pay ten-twelfths, 
     <lb/>
     according to the estimate of my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from the division of King, it ought to 
     <lb/>
     be rather a source of pride and satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     to us that we have a large population and 
     <lb/>
     greater resources than our eastern neighbors. 
     <lb/>
     I am as much opposed to needless and extra<lb break="no"/>vagant expenditures as any member of this 
     <lb/>
     honorable House, but if the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway has become a necessity, we must 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <cb/>
      
      
     not be afraid to undertake it. I am free 
     <lb/>
     to admit there was much needless waste 
     <lb/>
     and expenditure in the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk Railway, but I question whether 
     <lb/>
     there is a single honorable member of this 
     <lb/>
     House who would to-day, if he could, place 
     <lb/>
     us back where we were before the first sod 
     <lb/>
     was turned in that great undertaking. If 
     <lb/>
     war be imminent between us and the United 
     <lb/>
     States, and actually ensues, the railway will 
     <lb/>
     become an absolute military necessity. And 
     <lb/>
     who can tell but that, at any moment, the 
     <lb/>
     turning of a hand, looking at what has 
     <lb/>
     already happened, we may not be launched 
     <lb/>
     into the very midst of a war. It is, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve, very well known, that as soon as it was 
     <lb/>
     learned in Washington that the St. Alban's 
     <lb/>
     raiders had escaped through the bungling and 
     <lb/>
     incompetency, to say the least of it, of the 
     <lb/>
     Montreal officials, the first order of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SEWARD was one of non-intercourse, but it 
     <lb/>
     was afterwards modified to the passport sys<lb break="no"/>tem. What, honorable gentlemen, would have 
     <lb/>
     been our situation had that order been sent 
     <lb/>
     out, and what guarantee have we that it may 
     <lb/>
     not be sent out at any moment ? But my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Niagara says that the 
     <lb/>
     union of these provinces would not tend to 
     <lb/>
     strengthen our means of defence if, unfortu<lb break="no"/>nately, we should be invaded by the United 
     <lb/>
     States forces, because our frontier would be 
     <lb/>
     extended more than in proportion to the in<lb break="no"/>crease of our numbers. Does not every one 
     <lb/>
     know that it is the settled conviction of the 
     <lb/>
     military authorities of the States that their 
     <lb/>
     mistake in the last war was invading these 
     <lb/>
     provinces in different places at the same time, 
     <lb/>
     and that, in the event of a second war, their 
     <lb/>
     policy will be to concentrate all their strength 
     <lb/>
     on some one given point—Montreal for in<lb break="no"/>stance ? And will my honorable friend con<lb break="no"/>tend that the union and the railway will not 
     <lb/>
     enable us to concentrate a greater force, and 
     <lb/>
     more rapidly, on whatever point danger may 
     <lb/>
     be threatened, and also that they will not 
     <lb/>
     enable us to obtain aid from the British 
     <lb/>
     troops more quickly at any season of the 
     <lb/>
     year ? Then, as to the commercial necessity 
     <lb/>
     of the railway, it does seem to me plain that 
     <lb/>
     when our own Grand Trunk has a connection 
     <lb/>
     with Halifax ; when the Cunard and other 
     <lb/>
     steamers will discharge their valuable freight 
     <lb/>
     and their passengers destined for the far 
     <lb/>
     west at Halifax ; when Toronto will be 
     <lb/>
     brought, in point of time, as near to London 
     <lb/>
     and Liverpool as New York ; it must not only 
     <lb/>
     increase the business of the Grand Trunk, 
     <lb/>
     but also the business of the railways in Nova 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <pb n="171" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0171.jpg"/>
       <fw type="num">171</fw>
       
       
     Scotia and New Brunswick, which are to be 
     <lb/>
     made the property of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. When the connection becomes com<lb break="no"/>plete there must be a mutual advantage to all. 
     <lb/>
     I believe the child is now born in Canada who 
     <lb/>
     will live not only to see an Intercolonial but an 
     <lb/>
     Interoceanic Railway, if this scheme of union 
     <lb/>
     shall be honestly and fairly carried out. The 
     <lb/>
     necessity of the railway has time and again 
     <lb/>
     been admitted by the several governments of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, but, owing to a want of some 
     <lb/>
     power to control all, and a natural jealousy of 
     <lb/>
     each other, together with our own political 
     <lb/>
     differences, the scheme for its construction has 
     <lb/>
     always fallen through. When visiting the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces last summer, I told our 
     <lb/>
     friends there that the railway could only be 
     <lb/>
     had by a union—the union first, and the 
     <lb/>
     railway was sure to follow. I come now to 
     <lb/>
     consider the amendment of my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from the Wellington Division, and to 
     <lb/>
     which, according to the strict rules of debate, 
     <lb/>
     this discussion should have been confined ; but 
     <lb/>
     I have taken the same course as honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have preceded me have done, 
     <lb/>
     namely , to consider the whole scheme. The 
     <lb/>
     amendment brings up the question of members 
     <lb/>
     being appointed for life by the Crown, or 
     <lb/>
     elected for a term of years by the people. I 
     <lb/>
     am among those of the reform party who 
     <lb/>
     think that making the members of this House 
     <lb/>
     elective was a step in the wrong direction ; 
     <lb/>
     and though I am free to admit that but for 
     <lb/>
     the elective principle having been applied to 
     <lb/>
     this House, I should never have had the honor 
     <lb/>
     of a seat within its walls, yet I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     re-affirm that opinion on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House by my voting, as I shall do, against 
     <lb/>
     this amendment of my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Wellington, and to sanction a return to the 
     <lb/>
     nomination of members for life by the Crown, 
     <lb/>
     under the advice of Ministers responsible to 
     <lb/>
     the people through the Legislative Assembly. 
     <lb/>
     I deny that the extension of the elective 
     <lb/>
     principle to this House was ever sought for, 
     <lb/>
     or petitioned for by the people at the time of 
     <lb/>
     its consummation. It is quite true, honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, that before the union of Upper 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada, and during the palmy 
     <lb/>
     days of the Family Compact and the irrespon<lb break="no"/>sibility of the Government, when the Assembly 
     <lb/>
     had no control over the Executive, except by 
     <lb/>
     stopping the supplies, the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     was chosen for the mere purpose of opposing 
     <lb/>
     the public will, and they did it most effectually. 
     <lb/>
     Every measure calculated to elevate the people 
     <lb/>
     and promote their best interests was sure to 
     <lb/>
     be tomahawked, as the phrase went, by that 
     <lb/>
           
           
            <cb/>
        
        
     very obstructive body. Short-sighted politi<lb break="no"/>cians of those days, who did not very well 
     <lb/>
     understand the working of the British Consti<lb break="no"/>tution, fancied the only remedy was by making 
     <lb/>
     this House elective. But the memorable 
     <lb/>
     resolutions of the 3rd September, 1841, at 
     <lb/>
     Kingston, established the true British principle 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government, and I maintain 
     <lb/>
     that since that time the people never demanded 
     <lb/>
     that this House should be made elective. I 
     <lb/>
     apprehend that my conservative friends and I, 
     <lb/>
     who agree with each other on this point—the 
     <lb/>
     nomination of members to this House—come 
     <lb/>
     to the same conclusion by a very different 
     <lb/>
     process of reasoning. They hold that the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle applied to this branch of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament gives too much power to the 
     <lb/>
     people, while I, on the other hand, argue that 
     <lb/>
     they have not by it as quick and as sharp a 
     <lb/>
     remedy against a stubborn Council as they had 
     <lb/>
     under the system of nomination. The great 
     <lb/>
     beauty of the old system was the promptness 
     <lb/>
     with which at the critical moment it could be 
     <lb/>
     brought to bear, and the history of its opera<lb break="no"/>tions, both in this country and in England, 
     <lb/>
     clearly shews its superiority. My honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from the division of King has cited the 
     <lb/>
     case of the greatest commoner of England, 
     <lb/>
     the celebrated WILLIAM PITT, having ap<lb break="no"/>pointed so many members to the House of 
     <lb/>Lords within the first few months of his 
     <lb/>ministerial career. Did not PITT at that 
     <lb/>time command the confidence of the people of 
     <lb/>England ? Does not my honorable friend 
     <lb/>know, if he has read the history of those times, 
     <lb/>that this great statesman steadily refused to 
     <lb/>accept office until he saw that public opinion 
     <lb/>was ripe for his schemes ? And was not PITT, 
     <lb/>at the commencement of his parliamentary 
     <lb/>career, the great advocate of parliamentary 
     <lb/>reform ? It is true that subsequent causes, 
     <lb/>over which he had no control, led him to 
     <lb/>pursue a very different course. What if at 
     <lb/>the times of the achievements by the people 
     <lb/>of those two great victories of civil an reli<lb break="no"/>gious liberty in England, I mean Catholic 
     <lb/>emancipation and the passage of the Reform 
     <lb/>Bill, the Crown, through its ministers respon<lb break="no"/>sible to the House of Commons and the 
     <lb/>English nation, had not had power to coerce 
     <lb/>the Lords into consent, but had been 
     <lb/>obliged to wait for two years for the doubt<lb break="no"/>ful issue of a certain number of elections. 
     <lb/>Such have been my opinions with regard to 
     <lb/>the comparative merits of the nominative and 
     <lb/>elective principles as applied to this House, 
     <lb/>and I have not hesitated to express them 
     <lb/>among my constituents, both before and since. 
     <lb/>
        
        
    
            <pb n="172" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0172.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">172</fw>
          
     they honored me with this seat. I admit that 
     <lb/>
     the proposed system is not the same as the old 
     <lb/>
     one, because it limits the numbers, and to this 
     <lb/>
     limitation I have the most serious objections ; 
     <lb/>
     but I am not going to hazard the success of 
     <lb/>
     the union scheme, as I sincerely believe I 
     <lb/>
     would, by voting for the amendment, but I 
     <lb/>
     shall take it as it is, with the hope and belief 
     <lb/>
     that in the new Parliament, when the union is 
     <lb/>
     consummated, the constitution of this House 
     <lb/>
     may be set right. Honorable gentlemen seem to 
     <lb/>
     talk as if this scheme and the Imperial Act to be 
     <lb/>
     founded upon it, are finalities. I do not look 
     <lb/>
     upon any human act as a finality, and I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt a way will be found by which this 
     <lb/>
     amendment may be made. Was not the Consti<lb break="no"/>tutional Act of 1840 amended ? And will 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen tell us that the act to be 
     <lb/>
     founded upon these resolutions cannot be 
     <lb/>
     amended in the same way ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LETE1">HON. MR. LETELLIER</persName>—Will the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman tell us how the Act of 1840 
     <lb/>
     was amended ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. McCREA</persName>—Does the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member from Grandville not remember the 
     <lb/>
     increase of members in the representation of 
     <lb/>
     the other House, in 1853, and the amendment 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution of this House in 1856, 
     <lb/>
     the very question I am now debating ? Surely 
     <lb/>
     these measures were amendments of that act, 
     <lb/>
     and who knows but under the new Constitu<lb break="no"/>tional Act—the favorite measure of my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend—the election of members of this 
     <lb/>
     House, may not again be resorted to, if the 
     <lb/>
     nominative principle shall not be found to work 
     <lb/>
     well ? But let us examine for a moment what 
     <lb/>
     the amendment of my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Wellington is intended to effect. It will be 
     <lb/>
     seen by referring to the amendment itself, that 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman proposes that the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House from Canada and from 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces shall have a different 
     <lb/>
    origin or, as it were, a different parentage, 
     <lb/>elected by the people with us, and appointed 
     <lb/>by the Crown from the eastern provinces. I 
     <lb/>take it that it is very desirable that in what<lb break="no"/>ever way the members of this House may 
     <lb/>be chosen, there should be uniformity in the 
     <lb/>system. By the honorable gentleman's plan we 
     <lb/> shall have one-third of the members from 
     <lb/>below representing the Crown, and two-thirds 
     <lb/>from above, representing the people ; a curious 
     <lb/>sort of incongruity which I think should by 
     <lb/>all means be avoided. I may be answered 
     <lb/>that our present House is constituted in that 
     <lb/>very way ; but honorable gentlemen must re<lb break="no"/>member that the life members are not the 
     <lb/>sole representatives of any particular section 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <cb/>
           
           
     of the province, but are chosen indiscrimin<lb break="no"/>ately from all parts of the province. This is 
     <lb/>
     not likely to lead to a sectional collision like 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of my honorable friend, and be 
     <lb/>
     sides that, the appointment of life members 
     <lb/>
     in this House is not to be continued after the 
     <lb/>
     seats of the present members shall have be<lb break="no"/>come vacant from any cause whatever. I 
     <lb/>
     think the scheme of my honorable friend the 
     <lb/>
     most objectionable of all. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member from Niagara has given us notice 
     <lb/>
     that he intends to move a resolution to the 
     <lb/>
     House that this question shall be delayed 
     <lb/>
     until an appeal shall be had to the people—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is quite mistaken. I have given notice

     through a dissolution of the other House and 
     <lb/>
     a new election ? Surely the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man does not mean to shelter himself from 
     <lb/>
     the legitimate consequences of his resolution 
     <lb/>
     by its technical phraseology. It certainly 
     <lb/>
     comes with a very bad grace and taste from 
     <lb/>
     any member of this House to propose a dis<lb break="no"/>solution of Parliament and send the members 
     <lb/>
     of the Assembly packing to their constituents 
     <lb/>
     to undergo the wear, tear, expenses and tur<lb break="no"/>moil of an election, while we can sit here 
     <lb/>
     firmly in our seats, and with folded hands 
     <lb/>
     look quietly on. As to the true state of public 
     <lb/>
     opinion upon this important subject in this 
     <lb/>
     province, it will be time enough to consider 
     <lb/>
     it, when my honorable friend from Niagara 
     <lb/>
     comes to press his resolution. If our own 
     <lb/>
     political situation required a remedy, I think 
     <lb/>
     this union is an excellent opportunity, but I 
     <lb/>
     do not mean to urge that our own political 
     <lb/>
     exigency should be the only reason for the 
     <lb/>
     union. We should settle our own political 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. But that and everything else 
     <lb/>

          <fw type="num">173</fw>
          
          
     
    seems to conspire to this union. The immi<lb break="no"/>nence of war with the United States, the cer<lb break="no"/>tainty of the abrogation of the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>Treaty, the danger of non-intercourse, the op<lb break="no"/>portunity of the Charlottetown Convention, 
     <lb/>and the consequent necessity of the Intercol<lb break="no"/>onial Railway—all point to this Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion.  But the expense is the bugbear of the 
     <lb/>opponents of this scheme.  If the great social 
     <lb/>and political interests of the country are to be 
     <lb/>served, if we are to have laid broad and deep 
     <lb/>in the hearts of the people the foundations of 
     <lb/>a great nationality, as my honorable friend 
     <lb/>from Wellington has expressed it, the finan<lb break="no"/>cial part of the scheme is but a secondary 
     <lb/>consideration.  To-day , the balance of advan<lb break="no"/>tage may be against us ; to-morrow , it may be 
     <lb/>in our favor.  Who can say , when the railway 
     <lb/>shall be established, and when by the union 
     <lb/>we shall have incited new enterprises and 
     <lb/>energies, and developed the whole resources of 
     <lb/>the eastern provinces, with whom the finan<lb break="no"/>cial balance may rest ?  I cannot close my 
     <lb/>remarks better than by saying, that had a 
     <lb/>union of all these provinces existed in fact as 
     <lb/>it has existed in the minds of statesmen since 
     <lb/>the commencement of the present century, 
     <lb/>the man who, in the face of our present criti<lb break="no"/>cal position, with civil war raging in our 
     <lb/>vicinity, and even national war threatening 
     <lb/>ourselves, should now propose to dissolve that 
     <lb/>union and scatter us again into disjointed 
     <lb/>fragments, would be looked upon as an enemy 
     <lb/>to his Queen and a traitor to his country.

     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, a French journal in Montreal, in report<lb break="no"/>ing the proceedings of a meeting recently held 
     <lb/>
     at Berthier, to consider the proposed project 
     <lb/>
     of the Confederation of Canada and the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, and to which meeting, in the 
     <lb/>
     capacity of representative of the division in 
     <lb/>
     which the count is situated, I was invited, 
     <lb/>
     stated that I had expressed myself against that 
     <lb/>
     project, and I therefore take this, the first op<lb break="no"/>portunity, of declaring that the journal in 
     <lb/>
     question was in error, and that I did not so 
     <lb/>
     express myself.  I did, however, say at that 
     <lb/>
     meeting, that there were provisions in the 
     <lb/>
     project upon which I could not look with a 
     <lb/>
     favorable eye, but that I could not then pro<lb break="no"/>nounce an opinion, but would wait until I 
     <lb/>
     came to Parliament, when I expected the 
     <lb/>
     details would be placed before the members 
     <lb/>
     fully and in good faith.  I must, however, 
     <lb/>
     say, honorable gentlemen, that in this I have 
     <lb/>
     been much disappointed, for until now, the 
     <lb/>
    information so much desired and asked for has 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
         
         
     not been supplied, and the House is left in the 
     <lb/>
     dark in respect of several important matters 
     <lb/>
     upon which it is asked to decide.  For in<lb break="no"/>stance, it was stated in the resolutions, that 
     <lb/>
     means would be taken to effectually protect 
     <lb/>
     the minorities and preserve to them the rights 
     <lb/>
     they now possess, but we were not informed 
     <lb/>
     as to what those rights were, or as to the means 
     <lb/>
     to be used for preserving them untouched and 
     <lb/>
     unimpaired.  If we had known what these 
     <lb/>
     means would be, we would have come pre<lb break="no"/>pared to assent to, or to dissent from them, in 
     <lb/>
     an intelligent manner, and to express our 
     <lb/>
     opinions as we ought to do, but this informa<lb break="no"/>tion was not vouchsafed. I understand that 
     <lb/>
     a bill, to assure to the Protestants of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada the uninterrupted possession and en<lb break="no"/>joyment of their rights, is to be brought down 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    and passed before the scheme of Federation 
     <lb/>itself is fully adopted and sanctioned ; but I 
     <lb/>have not heard that any similar measure is to 
     <lb/>be passed in favor of the Roman Catholics of 
     <lb/>Upper Canada.  I have no objection, what<lb break="no"/>ever, to grant to the Protestants of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, for all future time, the rights they 
     <lb/>now enjoy, or any other rights and guarantees 
     <lb/>which may be deemed reasonable and equit— 
     <lb/>able, but I cannot vote to adopt the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions until I am informed whether the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholics of the west are to be dealt with in 
     <lb/>the same manner. By refusing us informa<lb break="no"/>tion on this important subject, the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has placed us in a false position, from 
     <lb/>which, I think, it is their duty to extricate 
     <lb/>us. I shall not now address myself to the in<lb break="no"/>quiry of whether the Confederation scheme be 
     <lb/>really desirable or not, but cannot help saying 
     <lb/>that the long-standing difference between the 
     <lb/>two sections of the province might have been 
     <lb/>arranged, if during the last difficult y between 
     <lb/>the respective parties the leading men on 
     <lb/>either side had been willing to sink their per<lb break="no"/>sonal differences and make mutual conces<lb break="no"/>sions. But as it is of no use now to refer to 
     <lb/>that subject, I will not argue the matter fur<lb break="no"/>ther. I maintain again, however. that the 
     <lb/>House has a right to expect the Government 
     <lb/>will give us all the information in respect of 
     <lb/>the details of the Confederation scheme as 
     <lb/>may be necessary to understand thoroughly all 
     <lb/>its provisions. My opinion is, that as much 
     <lb/>power as possible should have been entrusted 
     <lb/>to the local governments, and as little as is 
     <lb/>consistent with the functions it will have to 
     <lb/>discharge to the Central Government, and my 
     <lb/>reason for entertaining this opinion is, that 
     <lb/>the Supreme Government, with its power of 
     <lb/>purse and its control of the armies, will always 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <pb n="174" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0174.jpg"/>

     be more disposed to stretch its prerogatives 
     <lb/>
     and to trench upon the domain of the local 
     <lb/>
     governments than to narrow down and retain 
     <lb/>
     its authority. The scheme then, in my opin<lb break="no"/>ion, is defective in that it inverts this order 
     <lb/>
     and gives to the General Government too much 
     <lb/>
     power and to the local governments too little. 
     <lb/>
     As it is now, if the scheme goes into opera<lb break="no"/>tion, the local governments will be in danger 
     <lb/>
               of being crushed (<hi rendition="simple:italic">écrasés</hi>) by the General 
     <lb/>
     Government. The tendency of the whole 
     <lb/>
     scheme seems to be one of political retrogres<lb break="no"/>sion instead of advancement.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—Hear! hear!

     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—I am glad the Hon.

     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—Ah ! but it is 
     <lb/>
     exactly the contrary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—Then I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     not to obtain his approval—(laughter)—but 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless I hold that the policy disclosed 
     <lb/>
     in the scheme is a backward policy. I want 
     <lb/>
     to progress, I want to see the country advance, 
     <lb/>
     I want to see the liberties of the country un<lb break="no"/>folding and expanding ; but instead of this 
     <lb/>
     our rulers are narrowing them down and re<lb break="no"/>stricting their free exercise. (Hear.) They 
     <lb/>
     are now proposing to take away the elective 
     <lb/>
     principle in its application to this Chamber, and 
     <lb/>
     that too, without even having received a peti<lb break="no"/>tion or sign of any kind from the people that 
     <lb/>
     such is their wish. If this is not a policy of 
     <lb/>
     retrogression I can hardly imagine what would 
     <lb/>
     be. I was not sent here to assist in doing 
     <lb/>
     any such thing, and am not aware that there 
     <lb/>
     has been any evidence of a desire in the 
     <lb/>
     country for a return to the old mode of ap<lb break="no"/>pointment by the Crown. I am not aware 
     <lb/>
     of one complaint, or of any dissatisfaction 
     <lb/>
     whatever with the present constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, and I therefore regard it 
     <lb/>
     as not a little strange that a few gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     without mission or warrant, should have de<lb break="no"/>vised such a change, and should be trying to 
     <lb/>
     press it upon the Legislature and the country. 
     <lb/>
    I cannot say what is the general feeling in 
     <lb/>the public mind in favor of a Confederation 
     <lb/>of Canada and the Maritime Provinces, and 
     <lb/>so far, perhaps, from being opposed to it per<lb break="no"/>sonally, I would be glad if it could be accom<lb break="no"/>plished upon principles I can approve. I do 
     <lb/>not wish, however, to see the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments crushed under a great central power, 
     <lb/>and I am sure the people cannot wish, and do 
     <lb/>not wish, to give up the principle of election 
     <lb/>in respect of this House. They had fought 
     <lb/>too long for the privilege to do that, and one 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
         
         
     thing  was quite clear, we were not sent to 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to destroy our present Constitution. 
     <lb/>
     There is a great difference between making 
     <lb/>
     machinery work and breaking it to peices, 
     <lb/>
     and I maintain that we were elected to legis<lb break="no"/>late within the Constitution, not to legislate 
     <lb/>
     away the Constitution. When I was elected 
     <lb/>
     I expected to go back to my constituents to 
     <lb/>
     give them an account of the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     I had fulfilled the duty entrusted to me, not 
     <lb/>
     to take advantage of my position to provide 
     <lb/>
     for myself a seat for life. No, my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents never gave me this right, nor was any 
     <lb/>
     elected member entrusted with it, and who<lb break="no"/>ever assume to vote away the liberties of the 
     <lb/>
     people in this manner, betray their man<lb break="no"/>date. If it was desired that the people should 
     <lb/>
     surrender this right they should have been 
     <lb/>
     informed of such desire in good time, so that 
     <lb/>
     they might have considered the question ; but 
     <lb/>
     without warning them, or consulting them, 
     <lb/>
     this most highly-prized principle was bartered 
     <lb/>
     away to the Lower Provinces for a Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation which could not last. The Hon. Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Crown Lands had told the House 
     <lb/>
     that the repartition of Lower Canada accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the present electoral divisions had been 
     <lb/>
     retained for the purpose of protecting the 
     <lb/>
     British population of Lower Canada. I think 
     <lb/>
     that if, with the retaining these electoral divi<lb break="no"/>sions the elective principle was also retained, the 
     <lb/>
     French population of Lower Canada would 
     <lb/>
     also find in it their protection. For then 
     <lb/>
     each division would be free to choose for its 
     <lb/>
     representative in the Federal Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council a man attached to the institutions 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, while, in giving the nom<lb break="no"/>ination of the legislative councillors to the 
     <lb/>
     Federal power, the latter would be at liberty 
     <lb/>
     to choose whomsoever it thought proper, and, 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately— a circumstance which I do 
     <lb/>
     not anticipate, but which may occur — the 
     <lb/>
     General Government, when formed, might be 
     <lb/>
     surrounded by coteries inimical to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada interests, and be led by them to 
     <lb/>
     choose members for the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     hostile to the views of Lower Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     consider, therefore, an elective Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council in the Confederation as essential to 
     <lb/>
     the interests of Lower Canada. Nothing is 
     <lb/>
     gained politically by the scheme any more 
     <lb/>
     than financially. The honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Niagara has abundantly proved that all the 
     <lb/>
     results to Canada would be a sacrifice of <choice><sic>prin<lb break="no"/>ples</sic><corr>principles</corr></choice> and of money. To assure the advan 
     <lb/>
     to themselves of the scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     the, Lower Provinces had stipulated first for 
     <lb/>
     the construction of the Intercolonial Railway, 
     <lb/>

     and we would in consequence have to expend 
     <lb/>
     twenty millions for that object, besides pay<lb break="no"/>ing $63,000 a year to New Brunswick for ten 
     <lb/>
     years, and $150,000 a year to Newfoundland

     forever. To be sure, m the latter case we

     would have the produce of the mines of that

     <lb/>
     the value of those mines, how much they 
     <lb/>
     would be worth to us?

     which would probably throw some light upon

     <lb/>
     be taken as good evidence in the case. It

     There is no part of the whole surface, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to my present impression, which deserves

     am extremely anxious to know whether there 
     <lb/>
     is any documentary evidence of the existence 
     <lb/>
     of the pretended riches of Newfoundland, in 
     <lb/>
     woods, mines and public lands.

     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member may go on ; in the course of the de<lb break="no"/>bate he will receive satisfactory information. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—Very well ; but I 
     <lb/>
     see by the statistics, on the contrary, that 
     <lb/>
     there is no timber on the island beyond what 
     <lb/>
     is necessary for the building of the huts or 
     <lb/>
     cabins of the fishermen who inhabit it, and 
     <lb/>
     that there is no land fit for cultivation belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the Crown; and, as to mines, I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe any ofieial exploration has been made 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain their existence in the island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—It is a well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     ascertained fact that there are mines in the 
     <lb/>
     Island of Newfoundland of great value. As 
     <lb/>
     to the grant of $150,000 yearly subsidy, I 
     <lb/>
     must observe to the honorable member that it 
     <lb/>
     was intended to make up for the revenue 
     <lb/>
     given up by Newfoundland to the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, amounting at resent to $400,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—Another reason 
     <lb/>
     why I cannot approve of the plan of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, as it is now presented to us, is that I 
     <lb/>
     consider it as a retrograde step in the <choice><sic>politi<lb break="no"/>tical</sic><corr>political</corr></choice> progress of the country. The spirit of 
     <lb/>
     modern society is to give to the people as 
     <lb/>
     much litical liberty as possible; and it is 
     <lb/>
     my be ief that by this plan of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     we shall sacrifice whatever liberty is already 
     <lb/>
     messed by the people of this country. 
     <lb/>
    When I expressed this idea, a short time 
     <lb/>since, the Honorable Premier seemed to give 
     <lb/>an ironical assent to it, as if he considered 
     <lb/>my notions exaggerated. I am bound to tell 
     <lb/>him that I neither love nor approve of mob- 
     <lb break="yes"/>rule any more than he does, but I have always 
     <lb/>held as a political principle, that as much 
     <lb/>political liberty as possible should be conceded 
     <lb/>to the masses, combined always with a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment strong enough to maintain order and 
     <lb/>administer the laws ; and herein I consider that 
     <lb/>I conform to the principles of modern society, 
     <lb/>without giving in to the dictates of demagogy. 
     <lb/>I am favorable to democracy, but not to dema<lb break="no"/>gogy, and in this sense I spoke. I say, then, 
     <lb/>that in taking from the people for all time, 
     <lb/>the right which they acquired after long 
     <lb/>struggles of electing members to this ll case, 
     <lb/>we are retrograding, making a step backward, 
     <lb/>and I am sure the people will not look upon 
     <lb/>this project with a favorable eye. We are 
     <lb/>

     told that Confederation is become necessary 
     <lb/>
     for the defence of the country. For one 
     <lb/>
     moment I will admit that it might increase 
     <lb/>
     our means of defence, but that is assuredly no 
     <lb/>
     reason for urging the adoption of the measure, 
     <lb/>
     as now attempted to be done. With Con<lb break="no"/>federation, neither the number of men in the 
     <lb/>
     several provinces, nor the pecuniary resources 
     <lb/>
     now at their disposal, will be increased. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot see what vast increase of strength this 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is to give forthwith, for England 
     <lb/>
     is fully entitled at this moment to dispose, 
     <lb/>
     without let or hindrance, of all the resources, 
     <lb/>
     both in men and money, possessed by the 
     <lb/>
     colony, just as well as she will be after 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is effected. That is therefore 
     <lb/>
     no reason to make us urge on the adoption of 
     <lb/>
     the measure, especially as we risk nothing by 
     <lb/>
     giving the people time to study, examine and 
     <lb/>
     understand the new Constitution of which we 
     <lb/>
     are desirous to make them a present. They 
     <lb/>
     tell us that the Intercolonial Railway is to be 
     <lb/>
     a military road. But if it be so, how happens 
     <lb/>
     it that nobody has thought of another part of 
     <lb/>
     the country in which a military road is much 
     <lb/>
     more called for. I can hardly believe that 
     <lb/>
     anybody can be serious in this, while they 
     <lb/>
     overlook the real military road which would be 
     <lb/>
     wanted in the event of hostilities,—I mean a 
     <lb/>
     railway between Quebec and Montreal, on the 
     <lb/>
     north shore of the River St. Lawrence. In 
     <lb/>
     order to render the Intercolonial Railway of 
     <lb/>
     any avail as a military road, the North Shore 
     <lb/>
     Railway must also be built, for the present 
     <lb/>
     road on the south shore may be easily cut 
     <lb/>
     and occupied by the enemy. Leaving Quebec 
     <lb/>
     it takes the direction of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and leaving Montreal it takes the same direc<lb break="no"/>tion to meet the other branch at Richmond. 
     <lb/>
     In case of war the Americans would have 
     <lb/>
     but a short distance to advance to take 
     <lb/>
     ssession of either one or the other of these 
     <lb/>
     branches. I shall now proceed to examine 
     <lb/>
     whether the plan of Confederation is really 
     <lb/>
     what it seems to be. I hear it said that Con<lb break="no"/>federation, as it is proposed, will be a Federal 
     <lb/>
     union—but it seems to me that it will be rather 
     <lb/>
     a Legislative union, at least as far as regards 
     <lb/>
     the most important interests of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The 29th section of the scheme submitted to 
     <lb/>
     us says: " The Federal Parliament shall have 
     <lb/>
     the power of making laws for the peace, the 
     <lb/>
     well-being, and the good government of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederate provinces, and in particular in 
     <lb/>
     respect of the following matters." The powers 
     <lb/>
     of the Federal Government will be in reality 
     <lb/>
     unlimited. The fact of the enumeration of 
     <lb/>
    these thirty-seven heads does not in the least 
     <lb/>
         
         
            <cb/>
         
         
         restrain the power of the Federal Government 
     <lb/>from legislating on everything. The excep<lb break="no"/>tions are few. I would ask the Honorable 
     <lb/>Premier, for instance, whether the Federal 
     <lb/>Government has not the power to enact that 
     <lb/>marriage is a civil contract ? He cannot deny 
     <lb/>it, and I do not believe that that clause will 
     <lb/>in any way suit Lower Canada. In a matter 
     <lb/>of divorce, I consider that the power of legis<lb break="no"/>lating upon it ought to be vested in the 
     <lb/>Federal Government ; but as to the passing 
     <lb/>of a marriage set, we have the authority of 
     <lb/>the past to convince us that Lower Canada 
     <lb/>will never be satisfied with what is proposed 
     <lb/>in the plan of Confederation. On a former 
     <lb/>occasion, when a member of the Parliament 
     <lb/>of Canada moved to enact that marriage 
     <lb/>should be made a civil contract, all the mem<lb break="no"/>bers for Lower Canada voted against the 
     <lb/>motion, and the whole country was opposed 
     <lb/>to it. I shall also inquire whether the Federal 
     <lb/>Government will not have the right to enact 
     <lb/>that religious corporations shall no longer 
     <lb/>exist in the country, or that they shall not be 
     <lb/>allowed to hold real property, except what is 
     <lb/>absolutely necessary for their lodging accom<lb break="no"/>modation. According to the resolutions which 
     <lb/>have been submitted to us, the Federal Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would certainly have this right. It 
     <lb/>has been said that article 15 of the 43rd 
     <lb/>resolution replies to this objection, but I can 
     <lb/>see nothing in that article which restricts the 
     <lb/>right of the Federal Government to legislate 
     <lb/>on this matter. The 43rd resolution defines 
     <lb/>the powers of the local governments, and arti<lb break="no"/>cle 15 of that resolution declares that they 
     <lb/>may make laws respecting "property and 
     <lb/>civil rights, excepting those portions thereof 
     <lb/>assigned to the General Parliament." That 
     <lb/>article reserves to the local legislatures nothing 
     <lb/>relative to religious corporations, and the 
     <lb/>Federal Government would have full power to 
     <lb/>decree that those corporations shall not hold 
     <lb/>immovable property. The supreme power is 
     <lb/>that which has the right to legislate upon, 
     <lb/>and regulate the existence of, the corporations 
     <lb/>in question, and they can only possess civil 
     <lb/>rights so long as the Government permits them 
     <lb/>to exist. The same might be said of most of 
     <lb/>the institutions to which Lower Canada is 
     <lb/>attached. I am therefore right in saying that, 
     <lb/>so far as those things which Lower Canada 
     <lb/>most holds to are concerned, Confederation is 
     <lb/>in fact a Legislative union, because upon the 
     <lb/>Federal Government is conferred the right of 
     <lb/>legislating upon those subjects which Lower 
     <lb/>Canada holds most dear. It appears to me 
     <lb/>that it is the more important not to proceed 
     <lb/>
        
        
            <pb n="177" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0177.jpg"/>

     so rapidly as it is proposed to do, because it is 
     <lb/>
     extremely difficult to foresee what will be the 
     <lb/>
     bearing of the platform which it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     to erect. I have just cited the rights which 
     <lb/>
     Confederation would confer upon the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government in respect of certain points ; but 
     <lb/>
     there are other interests which may perhaps 
     <lb/>
     he imperilled by this measure—I will cite, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, the rights of the creditors of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. Mr. OLIVIER</persName>—I see nothing of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—All the details are 
     <lb/>
     not included in the resolutions ; but as to 
     <lb/>
     the balance of $5,000,000 which will have to 
     <lb/>
     be divided between Upper and Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and which constitutes the difference between 
     <lb/>
     the $62,000,000 of debt which will be assumed 
     <lb/>
     by the Confederation, and the $67,000,000 
     <lb/>
     which Canada owes, a division will be made 
     <lb/>
     before Parliament is dissolved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. Mr. OLIVIER</persName>—I understood that 
     <lb/>
     the debts were to be divided and that the in<lb break="no"/>demnity to the seigniors, for instance, for the 
     <lb/>
     abolition of the Seigniorial Tenure was to be 
     <lb/>
     imposed entirely on Lower Canada. If there 
     <lb/>
     are any verbal explanations beyond what is 
     <lb/>
     contained in the resolutions, I am quite wil<lb break="no"/>ling to receive them from the Government, 
     <lb/>
     but that is just the reason why we should not 
     <lb/>
     be in a hurry to adopt these resolutions until 
     <lb/>
     we have those explanations, for it might be 
     <lb/>
     dangerous not to have all these questions 
     <lb/>
     settled before voting for Confederation ; who 
     <lb/>
     can say whether we can settle them as well after 
     <lb/>
     as before ? These promises of explanations 
     <lb/>
     shew that, since all the facts are not submitted, 
     <lb/>
     we may easily mistake the meaning of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions which we are called upon to adopt. 
     <lb/>
     In any case, I certainly see nothing in these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions which gives the seigniors the 
     <lb/>
     guarantee of the Confederation as security for 
     <lb/>
     their claim, and I can only judge of the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions by what they contain, especially in the 
     <lb/>
     absence of any explanation o the details. 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of Finance (Hon. Mr. Galt) 
     <lb/>
     stated that the debt due to the seigniors 
     <lb/>
     would fall on Lower Canada alone, and this 
     <lb/>
     does not agree exactly with what the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister has just said. As I said a short time 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     
     
     ago, when speaking of the school question, I 
     <lb/>
     would not vote for a Constitution which would 
     <lb/>
     not confer on the Catholics of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     the same advantages as are possessed by the 
     <lb/>
     Protestants of Lower Canada, and I consider 
     <lb/>
     that this is a matter that should be settled 
     <lb/>
     before taking a vote on the resolutions, for 
     <lb/>
     when Confederation is once voted it may 
     <lb/>
     easily happen that we shall not be able to 
     <lb/>
     obtain what is promised us now. We there<lb break="no"/>fore are in a position which may make us 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice the minority of Upper Canada by 
     <lb/>
     voting Confederation now, or make us vote 
     <lb/>
     against a principle which we might perhaps 
     <lb/>
     accept, if we were acquainted with all its 
     <lb/>
     details. For my part, I acknowledge that I 
     <lb/>
     would not cause the plan of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     which is proposed to us to miscarry, if it is 
     <lb/>
     possible to make it just, acceptable and useful 
     <lb/>
     to all parties. But for this I will not sacri<lb break="no"/>fice the interests of a portion of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion. Another point upon which we require  
     <lb/>
     explanations, and respecting which we have 
     <lb/>
     none, is that relating to the constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     local governments. Now, for instance, some 
     <lb/>
     journals which usually express the views and 
     <lb/>
     opinions of the present Government, have 
     <lb/>
     stated that in all the local governments the 
     <lb/>
     system of responsibility of the ministers to 
     <lb/>
     the people or their representatives would not 
     <lb/>
     exist, but that an irresponsible system would 
     <lb/>
     be substituted for it. I ask which of you 
     <lb/>
     would accept such a system, and what part 
     <lb/>
     of the people  would approve of such an altera<lb break="no"/>tion in our political institutions? You are 
     <lb/>
     told " vote for the plan submitted to you, and 
     <lb/>
     the details will be explained to you at a later 
     <lb/>
     period." But at a later period neither Upper 
     <lb/>
     nor Lower Canada will be master of the posi<lb break="no"/>tion, and able to obtain the system of govern<lb break="no"/>ment which may suit them, should that 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon them not meet their views. 
     <lb/>
     But, yet once more, why hurry you so much ? 
     <lb/>
     Why, for instance, should this House be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to sit twice a-day on this question 
     <lb/>
     before even its details are known ? Why de<lb break="no"/>part from our custom of examining matters in 
     <lb/>
     a calm and deliberate manner. Certainly, up 
     <lb/>
     to the present time, not one valid reason has 
     <lb/>
     been given to justify the hurry in which it is 
     <lb/>
     proposed to carry this measure. Mention has 
     <lb/>
     indeed been made of defence, but this is no 
     <lb/>
     valid reason, for it is perfectly well known 
     <lb/>
     that all the resources of Canada are now at 
     <lb/>
     the disposal of England in case of need ; this 
     <lb/>
    precipitate action is then neither justified nor 
     <lb/>justifiable. I ask whether we know the plan 
     <lb/>of Confederation which is submitted to us, 
     <lb/>
         
         
    
            <pb n="178" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0178.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">178</fw>
            
            
     and, unfortunately, I must answer my ques<lb break="no"/>tion in the negative. Surprise has been ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in certain quarters at the opposition 
     <lb/>
     which has arisen to this measure after all the 
     <lb/>
     advantages which we were promised should 
     <lb/>
     result from it. Thus it was said that under 
     <lb/>
     Confederation we should obtain coal from 
     <lb/>
     Nova  Scotia without having any duty to pay. 
     <lb/>
     This reasoning might appear to carry a cer<lb break="no"/>tain amount of force with it, but I must say 
     <lb/>
     that it is in fact captions, for we find at the 
     <lb/>
     present day that we can indeed get this coal, 
     <lb/>
     but  by paying the export duty exactl like 
     <lb/>
     foreign countries. Would there, then, be no 
     <lb/>
     real free trade between the different parts of 
     <lb/>
    the same Confederation ? Would the position 
     <lb/>of the provinces, in this respect, remain as it 
     <lb/>is to-day ? The proof of what I state here is 
     <lb/>found in Hon. Mr. GALT'S speech to his con<lb break="no"/>stituents:— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In Nova Scotia a considerable revenue was de<lb break="no"/>rived from a royalty on coal mines, and its repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives at the conference stated that if the 
     <lb/>
     General Government imposed an export duty on 
     <lb/>
     coal it would annihilate one of their most import<lb break="no"/>ant resources, and, therefore, Nova Scotia has 
     <lb/>
     been allowed to regulate herself the export duty

     and the result, as regards ourselves,  is to 
     <lb/>
     leave us still in the same position if we must 
     <lb/>
     pay the duty in order to get the coal of that 
     <lb/>
     province. The argument based on the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we could obtain coal from Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     without paying an import duty, is thus de<lb break="no"/>stroyed, since the duty will still exist. I 
     <lb/>
     have already stated that the plan submitted 
     <lb/>
     for our approval is exceedingly complex, and 
     <lb/>
     that it is not easy to forsee the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     that will arise between the local governments 
     <lb/>
     and the Federal Government. It may, per<lb break="no"/>haps, be asserted that these difficulties cannot 
     <lb/>
     be very serious, inasmuch as the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments will not possess any large powers ; but 
     <lb/>
     if it is designed to make them real govern<lb break="no"/>ments, and not mere municipalities,  they may 
     <lb/>
     be opposed to the Central Government on a 
     <lb/>
     host of questions. Take, for instance, the 
     <lb/>
     question of the fisheries. Article 17, of the 
     <lb/>
     29th resolution, gives to the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment the power of legislating on the " sea 
     <lb/>
     coast and inland fisheries." Under the 8th 
     <lb/>
     article of the 43rd resolution, the local 1egis  
     <lb/>
    latures will also have the right  of legislating 
     <lb/>on the "sea coast and inland fisheries." Thus 
     <lb/>
      
      
            <cb/>
        
        
     the local legislatures and the Federal Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture will have the right to legislate on the 
     <lb/>
     same subjects. And if the laws they make 
     <lb/>
     are in opposition the one to the other, what 
     <lb/>
     will be the result? And this may well hap<lb break="no"/>pen, for we know that in the Gulf, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, there are fisheries which are of the 
     <lb/>
     highest importance for the people  of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, as well as for the people  of the ad<lb break="no"/>joining colonies, of which the latter have 
     <lb/>
     taken possession, and sought to   exclude our 
     <lb/>
     people from them. Now,  the Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Lower Canada made laws to protect 
     <lb/>
     its subjects and insure to them the right to 
     <lb/>
     these fisheries, would it not be in the power 
     <lb/>
     of the Federal Government to interfere and 
     <lb/>
     prevent it? And if this were to happen, 
     <lb/>
     would it not give rise to endless antipathies 
     <lb/>
     and struggles between the two governments ? 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada would not suffer such an inter<lb break="no"/>ference without feeling it very strongly; and 
     <lb/>
     what I have just said with reference to the fish<lb break="no"/>eries might also occur with reference to a large 
     <lb/>
     number of questions. And it is quite evident 
     <lb/>
     that if the Local Government, acting in the 
     <lb/>
     interests of a province, were arrested in its 
     <lb/>
     action by the Federal Government, the people 
     <lb/>
     would take sides with their Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and become disaffected towards the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—This question 
     <lb/>
     of the fisheries is, no doubt, divided between 
     <lb/>
     the local governments and the Federal Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but it is evident, that in order that 
     <lb/>
     justice may be done to each part of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration in an impartial manner, the general 
     <lb/>
     legislation must be left to the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, while the application of the internal de<lb break="no"/>tails within the limits of the fisheries of a pro<lb break="no"/>vince, must be left to the local legislatures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—The argument I 
     <lb/>
     have brought forward, with reference to fish<lb break="no"/>eries, is applicable to other questions, and is 
     <lb/>
     merely to show that the present plan is com<lb break="no"/>plex, that there are conflicting interests in the 
     <lb/>
     different colonies, and that the settlement of 
     <lb/>
     them, in one sense or in another, might be 
     <lb/>
     productive of discontent in the country, and 
     <lb/>
     create a spirit of dissatisfaction among the 
     <lb/>
     people. Some one has said that this project 
     <lb/>
     is viewed favorably in England, and that for 
     <lb/>
     that reason we ought to accept it in order to 
     <lb/>
     prevent the evil consequences that might anse 
     <lb/>
     from our opposition to the project. For my 
     <lb/>
     part, I do not believe that England would in<lb break="no"/>sist so strongly on the details as they are in<lb break="no"/>sisted on here, but I believe her esire is, 
     <lb/>
     that the plan should be just and acceptable, 
     <lb/>
          
          
            <pb n="179" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0179.jpg"/>
    
    <fw type="num">179</fw>
    
     and that it should be thoroughly understood 
     <lb/>
     by the people before it is adepted; she is less 
     <lb/>
     anxious to enforce the details of the project 
     <lb/>
     than to see the people of the provinces content 
     <lb/>
     and satisfied with it. If a large portion of 
     <lb/>
     the people were opposed to the project, I do 
     <lb/>
     not think that England would approve of 
     <lb/>
     forcing this project upon them without giving 
     <lb/>
     time to examine it or to pronounce upon it. 
     <lb/>
     The opinion of the country upon this plan is, 
     <lb/>
     to-day, quite unknown. I am quite aware 
     <lb/>
     that certain members can vote in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     project with the certainty of their course 
     <lb/>
     meeting the approval of their constituents; for 
     <lb/>
     instance, those whose elections have taken 
     <lb/>
     place since the plan was submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     country. But in those parts of the country 
     <lb/>
     where no elections have taken place, it is im<lb break="no"/>possible to say that the people will be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     or that they will endorse the action of their 
     <lb/>
     representatives in voting for Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     because we have not been enabled to make it 
     <lb/>
     known. Thus when my constituents invited 
     <lb/>
     me to a public meeting to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     subject, I was compelled to admit that I 
     <lb/>
     could not tell them what the plan of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was; that I could not communicate 
     <lb/>
     it to them, because the resolutions I had 
     <lb/>
     received were private. I also told them that 
     <lb/>
     I did not wish to form my opinion before 
     <lb/>
     hearing the discussion and learning the de<lb break="no"/>tails; but to-day we are refused the details, 
     <lb/>
     and the adoption of the project is pressed 
     <lb/>
     without affording us time to study it as it is. 
     <lb/>
     An attempt will probably be made to injure 
     <lb/>
     us in the opinion of our electors if we vote 
     <lb/>
     against this project, and we shall be accused 
     <lb/>
     of having opposed Confederation; but I trust 
     <lb/>
     the people will see that we cannot vote for a 
     <lb/>
     thing with which we are not acquainted, and 
     <lb/>
     that we shall have their approval in the course 
     <lb/>
     we shall adopt. When the project of Con<lb break="no"/>federation is submitted to the English Par— 
     <lb/>
     liament, they will take it for granted that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country approve of it; but 
     <lb/>
     they will never suppose that the measure has 
     <lb/>
     been forced upon the people without affording 
     <lb/>
     them the opportunity of pronouncing for or 
     <lb/>
     against it. But there is another thing; it is 
     <lb/>
     not surprising that this project should be 
     <lb/>
     looked upon with a favorable eye in England, 
     <lb/>
     for public opinion is composed specially of 
     <lb/>
     that of the industrial and commercial classes, 
     <lb/>
     and it is the interest of those classes to favor 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. But let us well consider wheth<lb break="no"/>er the interests of those classes is ours also. 
     <lb/>
     I consider that our resent political course 
     <lb/>
     should be to see to the  interests of the agri<lb break="no"/>
        
        
        
            <cb/>
       
       
     culture, the trade and the industry of our 
     <lb/>
     country ,before laboring to build up that of 
     <lb/>
     English traders and artisans. If by Confed<lb break="no"/>eration we unite provinces, the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     which find it their interest to have a very low 
     <lb/>
     tariff adopted, it might very well happen that 
     <lb/>
     the agricultural interest of Canada might not 
     <lb/>
     find itself so well off, and in such a case what 
     <lb/>
     would be the result? The result would be 
     <lb/>
     that we should very soon have an enormous 
     <lb/>
     debt, and that, should the customs revenue 
     <lb/>
     not suffice to meet it and provide for the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, the deficit would have to be made 
     <lb/>
     up by means of direct taxation, which would 
     <lb/>
     weigh upon the agriculture and industry of 
     <lb/>
     the country. If we have a tariff of twenty 
     <lb/>
     per cent., it protects the industry of our na<lb break="no"/>tive land, and is a source of revenue where<lb break="no"/>with to provide for the public expenditure; 
     <lb/>
     but if we make it too low, real property will 
     <lb/>
     suffer, for on it will be laid the burthen im<lb break="no"/>posed to meet the deficit. Confederation 
     <lb/>
     would appear to me to be very costly, for 
     <lb/>
     money is scattered on all sides in handfuls. 
     <lb/>
     Thus it is proposed to construct the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway, which will cost at least $20<lb break="no"/>000,000; to Upper Canada is given $16,000,<lb break="no"/>000 to improve its canals; $150,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     is given to Newfoundland, as a compensation 
     <lb/>
     for mines which perhaps do not exist, and 
     <lb/>
     $63,000 to New Brunswick; and after all 
     <lb/>
     this the Local and Federal Governments have 
     <lb/>
     the power conferred on them of adding new 
     <lb/>
     taxes to those which already exist in order to 
     <lb/>
     meet the expenditure; and I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     whatever but that they will avail themselves 
     <lb/>
     of that permission. All this is deserving of 
     <lb/>
     consideration, and these are reasons which 
     <lb/>
     should induce the Government to submit the 
     <lb/>
     question to the people, instead of wishing 
     <lb/>
     to have it decided at once; for, even allow<lb break="no"/>ing the measure to be absolutely a good one, 
     <lb/>
     the people will always regard it with mis<lb break="no"/>trust if it is thrust upon them. What! we 
     <lb/>
     are told that we are perhaps on the eve of 
     <lb/>
     a war with our neighbors, and we run the risk 
     <lb/>
     of dissatisfying the people by imposing a system 
     <lb/>
     upon them to which they are perhaps opposed. 
     <lb/>
     It is not only in the district of Montreal that 
     <lb/>
     the submission of the question to the people is 
     <lb/>
               called for—the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi> says that the 
     <lb/>
     people ought to be consulted, and appears 
     <lb/>
     to me to be most reasonable. For my part, I 
     <lb/>
     am in favor of an appeal to the people, and I 
     <lb/>
     cannot approve of Confederation being thrust 
     <lb/>
     upon them without their being consulted. 
     <lb/>
     Let it be well understood, if it is wished that 
     <lb/>
     the population should make sacrifices for its 
     <lb/>
    
    
            <pb n="180" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-13_Page_0180.jpg"/>
     <fw type="num">180</fw>
     
     
     government in case of war, we must not begin 
     <lb/>
     by rendering them discontened and disafected. 
     <lb/>
     Let a fair and equitable system of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion be proposed, and let the people have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of examining into it and approv<lb break="no"/>ing of it, and then no man will shrink from 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of making the greatest sacrifices 
     <lb/>
     to defend the Constitution which has been 
     <lb/>
     freely accepted by the people. It may be said 
     <lb/>
     that the people would be compelled to march 
     <lb/>
     at the point of the bayonet ; but the risk of 
     <lb/>
     such a course is great, for the arm is but 
     <lb/>
     feeble when it is not animated by the heart, 
     <lb/>
     and to defend a country effectually the heart 
     <lb/>
     of the people must be in the cause. The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister stated that the-object of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was to strengthen the monarchical 
     <lb/>
     principle in this country. I do not see that 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary to confer upon the Crown greater 
     <lb/>
     privileges than it already possesses in England 
     <lb/>
     itself. In England the members of the ease 
     <lb/>
     of Lords are not appointed by the Crown ; 
     <lb/>
     succession in the peerage goes down hereditary 
     <lb/>
     from father to son ; but here it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     that the members of the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>
     which bod corresponds to the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords, should be selected by the Crown. Why 
     <lb/>
     should this be ? Why go beyond what is 
     <lb/>
     done in England itself? Is it that the Crown 
     <lb/>
     complains that it has not sufficient power here ? 
     <lb/>
     As to the statement that it is proposed to 
     <lb/>
     establish in America, by means of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, a counterpoise to the influence and power 
     <lb/>
     of the United States, I would ask whether 
     <lb/>
     that would not in itself constitute the best 
     <lb/>
    pretext which the Government of the United 
     <lb/>States could wish for upon which to declare 
     <lb/>war against us. At the present time, I am 
     <lb/>not of opinion that the American people are 
     <lb/>desirous of seeking a quarrel with us; just 
     <lb/>now the have quite enough to attend to. 
     <lb/>But if their Government should think it to 
     <lb/>their interest to declare war against England, 
     <lb/>the best pretext which they could bring for<lb break="no"/>ward to excite the American people against 
     <lb/>us would certainly be this pretended counter<lb break="no"/>poise which it is sought to establish. It is 
     <lb/>well known that the MONROE doctrine is a 
     <lb/>principle to which all the people of the United 
     <lb/>States are attached, and, should we give them 
     <lb/>an opportunity, they would avail themselves 
     <lb/>of it to put that doctrine into practice. Since 
     <lb/>Confederation does not in reality increase the 
     <lb/>strength of the colonies, why should we give 
     <lb/>umbrage to the Government of the United 
     <lb/>States, and provide them with the means of 
     <lb/>animating their people against us in case of 
     <lb/>the breaking out of hostilities? If the means 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
           
           
     for the defence of the country were increased, 
     <lb/>
     I would say, let us throw aside all these con<lb break="no"/>siderations, but such, in my opinion, is not 
     <lb/>
     the case. In conclusion, I would implore the 
     <lb/>
     Government to grant to the people the time 
     <lb/>
     and the opportunity of convincing themselves 
     <lb/>
     that the Constitution which it has prepared is 
     <lb/>
     agood one, and that it has really been planned 
     <lb/>
     with a view to their interests ; and, in that 
     <lb/>
     case, I predict that when the time for defence 
     <lb/>
     comes, the people will march like one man. 
     <lb/>
     But if it is intended to thrust it upon them 
     <lb/>
     by main force, and without consulting them, 
     <lb/>
     we must not, we cannot, expect them to defend 
     <lb/>
     their land with the like zeal. I consider that 
     <lb/>
     this demand is no more than just, both to 
     <lb/>
     ourselves and to the people whom we represent. 
     <lb/>
     So far as I myself am concerned, I 'd not 
     <lb/>
     come here to fight against Confederation and 
     <lb/>
     destroy it at any price, but I certainly will 
     <lb/>
     not vote for it without being acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     it in all its details. (Cheers)

     TUESDAY, February 14, 1865. 
     <lb/>
     HON. Sir N. F. BELLEAU said—Hon. 
     <lb/>
    gentlemen, the discussion on the scheme of 
     <lb/>Confederation has already been protracted, 
     <lb/>and little really remains to be said, for all 
     <lb/>the objections to the scheme have been 
     <lb/>made by the one side and replied to by the 
     <lb/>other. I may, however, be permitted to 
     <lb/>offer a few remarks on one or two of the ob<lb break="no"/>jections which were urged again yesterday. 
     <lb/>For the last three years the country has 
     <lb/>witnessed a state of things which by many 
     <lb/>persons has been designated governmental 
     <lb/>anarchy. Government after government in 
     <lb/>rapid succession have grasped the helm of 
     <lb/>state. A state of conflict existed between 
     <lb/>political parties which was hourly on the 
     <lb/>increase; a conflict which threatened to 
     <lb/>arrest the progress of public business, and 
     <lb/>which drew the minds of our statesmen to 
     <lb/>consider whether any means could be adopted' 
     <lb/>to remedy this state of things. The men 
     <lb/>of influence throughout the country at 
     <lb/>length decided to unite, and have come to 
     <lb/>the conclusion that a remedy was to be 
     <lb/>found in a Confederation of the British 
     <lb/>American Provinces. It is not to be won<lb break="no"/>dered at that this plan should have attracted 
     <lb/>the attention of the present Administration, 
     <lb/>for it was not a new one, and the question 
     <lb/>had already been brought before the country 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
