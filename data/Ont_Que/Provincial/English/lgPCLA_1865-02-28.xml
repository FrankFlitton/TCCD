     HON. MR. CAMPBELL—Before the 
     <lb/>
     House rises, I desire to submit a statement 
     <lb/>
     of the revenue of the Island of Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward, which has come into my hands since 
     <lb/>
     the close of the debate on the proposed union 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and the Lower Provinces. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Niagara seemed to take 
     <lb/>
     exception to what I said in relation to that 
     <lb/>
     particular point, and I am therefore happy 
     <lb/>
     to be able to satisfy the hon. member that 
     <lb/>
     what I then stated is fully sustained by the 
     <lb/>
     authentic return now before me. I hold in 
     <lb/>
     my hand a " Report of the Comptroller of 
     <lb/>
     Customs and Sundry Statistics " of that 
     <lb/>
     colony for the year 1863, which shows that 
     <lb/>
     the total revenue of the island for that year 
     <lb/>
     was £61,688 14s. 4d., island currency, equal 
     <lb/>
     to £41,125 16s. 3d., sterling, an increase 
     <lb/>
     over the previous year of nearly 35 per cent. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member seemed to think it impos<lb break="no"/>sible that such a sum as I had stated should 
     <lb/>
     have been raised, and suggested that a great 
     <lb/>
     part must have come from local sources. 
     <lb/>
    Well, the amount derived from excise and 
     <lb/>duties on imports for 1863 was £46,057 6s. 
     <lb/>7d., island currency, from the post office 
     <lb/>£1,590, and from custom house office fees, 
     <lb/>£71 9s. 9d. ; together £47,718 16s. 4d., 
     <lb/>island currency, or about £32,000, sterling, 
     <lb/>equal to $156,000 or thereabouts. There 
     <lb/>are a good many other items of revenue, but 
     <lb/>I have selected these three, as those certain 
     <lb/>to come into the treasury of the General 
     <lb/>Government, and there may be others. But 
     <lb/>it will be seen that these alone would make 
     <lb/>up the sum I gave as the revenue of the 
     <lb/>island, which would be available for the 
     <lb/>general purposes of the Confederation.

     HON. MR. CURRIE—I did not question 
     <lb/>
     the correctness of the figures of the Honor<lb break="no"/>able Commissioner of Crown Lands, but I felt 
     <lb/>
     and expressed some surprise at the sum, 
     <lb/>
     which, when compared with former years, 
     <lb/>
     exhibited, as I thought, an almost incredible 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     increase. Will the Honorable Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     state what proportion of these imports was 
     <lb/>
     foreign, and what came from the provinces it 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to unite, as after the union no 
     <lb/>
     revenue would of course be derived from the 
     <lb/>
     latter ?

            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. CAMPBELL—There are ta<lb break="no"/>bles shewing the imports and exports, and 
     <lb/>
     the imports from the following places were 
     <lb/>
     in 1863 :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     United Kingdom ............ £122,880 5 6 1/2 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia ................ 66,890 11 5 1/2 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick ............. 19,975 3 11 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland .............. 1,865 15 3 
     <lb/>
     Bermuda and West Indies. . . . 3,969 5 7 
     <lb/>
     Saint Pierre ................ 292 11 3 
     <lb/>
     Canada .................... 6,152 8 3 
     <lb/>
     Magdalene ................. 302 3 0 
     <lb/>
     United States ............... 71,103 0 8 
     <lb/>
     Total, sterling ........ £293,431 4 11 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Taking from the above the imports from 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and Canada, amounting to £94,883 18s. 
     <lb/>
     10d., the balance of nearly £200,000 was 
     <lb/>
     all foreign, and such as would pay duty to 
     <lb/>
     the General Government. The exports were 
     <lb/>
     £209,472 9s. 6d, to which was to be added 
     <lb/>
     the value of 24,991 tons of shipping built in 
     <lb/>
     the island, which at £5 sterling per ton, was 
     <lb/>
     equal to £124,955, and raised the credit side 
     <lb/>
     of the sheet to £334,427 9s. 6d., against 
     <lb/>
     £293,431 4s 11d to the debit side, thus 
     <lb/>
     shewing a balance in favor of the colony in 
     <lb/>
     1863 of £40,996 4s. 7d. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>

     [The honorable member here handed the

     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName> , continuing his speech 
     <lb/>
     from yesterday, said—Mr. SPEAKER, when 
     <lb/>
     the kindness of the House permitted me to 
     <lb/>
     resume my seat last evening, I was comparing 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional system of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy with the Constitution of the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States primarily, and with that of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain secondarily. I had gone over several 
     <lb/>
     leading points of comparison ; and it will he 
     <lb/>
     in the recollection of the House, no doubt, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="513" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0513.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">513</fw>
            <p>
     that I had compared the composition of our 
     <lb/>
     proposed House of Commons with that of 
     <lb/>
     the House of Representatives of the United 
     <lb/>
     States ; and I endeavored to shew, and I 
     <lb/>
     think I had shewn, that we were departing 
     <lb/>
     altogether from the principles upon which 
     <lb/>
     the British House of Commons is constituted, 
     <lb/>
     and taking up <hi rendition="simple:italic">mal à propos</hi>, and unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately, the least inviting features of the 
     <lb/>
     composition of the American House of 
     <lb/>
     Representatives. It is proposed to adopt 
     <lb/>
     here a plan which has a direct tendency to 
     <lb/>
     place on the floor of our House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     a number of provincial delegations, and not a 
     <lb/>
     number of independent members of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. The tendency is therefore towards a 
     <lb/>
     system antagonistic to, and inconsistent 
     <lb/>
     with, those principles on which the British 
     <lb/>
     Constitution reposes. With provincial 
     <lb/>
     delegations, rather than members of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, on the floor of the Federal Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     we are not likely to have that political 
     <lb/>
     longevity, whether of men or parties, with<lb break="no"/>out which the British system of government 
     <lb/>
     can hardly exist. Turning then to the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council, and comparing its 
     <lb/>
     constitution with that of the Senate of the 
     <lb/>
     United States—the principles governing 
     <lb/>
     the former are diametrically opposite to those 
     <lb/>
     on which the latter is founded. The Senate 
     <lb/>
     of the United States forms an excellent 
     <lb/>
     federal check upon the House of Represent<lb break="no"/>atives, partly owing to the way in which it 
     <lb/>
     is constituted, and partly on account of the 
     <lb/>
     powers given to it, and which are not pro<lb break="no"/>posed to be given to our Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     All that can be said of it is, that it is pro<lb break="no"/>posed to be constituted upon almost the 
     <lb/>
     worst principles that could have been adopt<lb break="no"/>ed. It seems as if it were so constituted for 
     <lb/>
     the mere purpose of leading to a dead-lock. 
     <lb/>
     The members of it are not to represent our 
     <lb/>
     provinces at all, but are to be named by the 
     <lb/>
     Federal power itself, for life, and in numbers 
     <lb/>
     to constitute a pretty numerous body, but 
     <lb/>
     without any of the peculiar functions wisely 
     <lb/>
     assigned to the Senate of the United States. 
     <lb/>
     In fact, the federal battle that must be 
     <lb/>
     fought will have to be fought in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons and in the Executive Council, 
     <lb/>
     very much more than in the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council. Turning then to the Executive 
     <lb/>
     Council, I had shown that it is a necessary 
     <lb/>
     consequence of the proposed system, that 
     <lb/>
     we are to have not merely a House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons cut up into sections, but also an Exe<lb break="no"/>cutive Council cut up in the same unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate way. You can get nothing else in the 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
          
     nature of a real federal check. Your federal 
     <lb/>
     problem will have to be worked out around 
     <lb/>
     the table of the Executive Council. But 
     <lb/>
     this principle, which must enter into the 
     <lb/>
     formation of the Executive Council, is clear<lb break="no"/>ly inconsistent with the principle of the 
     <lb/>
     British Constitution, which holds the whole 
     <lb/>
     Cabinet jointly responsible for every act of the 
     <lb/>
     Government. In our present union of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadas, we have latterly gone upon the 
     <lb/>
     plan of having almost two ministries. The 
     <lb/>
     plan urged upon our acceptance purposes 
     <lb/>
     the experiment of six or more sections in 
     <lb/>
     the Executive Council, instead of the two 
     <lb/>
     that we have found one too many. Among 
     <lb/>
     the difficulties that will grow out of that 
     <lb/>
     plan is this, the absolute necessity of either 
     <lb/>
     having an Executive Council that will be ridi<lb break="no"/>culously too numerous, or else one that will 
     <lb/>
     represent the different provinces in sections 
     <lb/>
     entirely too small. From this comparison 
     <lb/>
     of these three leading features, I had passed 
     <lb/>
     on to consider the relations of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government with the several provinces, 
     <lb/>
     comparing them with the relations subsist<lb break="no"/>ing between the United States Government 
     <lb/>
     and the governments of the several states of 
     <lb/>
     the American Union. The several states of 
     <lb/>
     the neighboring republic commenced their 
     <lb/>
     existence as states with all their constitu<lb break="no"/>tions constructed on the same general plan 
     <lb/>
     as that of the United States, and in fact the 
     <lb/>
     same republican principles underlie all their 
     <lb/>
     governmental institutions, municipal, state 
     <lb/>
     and federal. But it is here proposed, that 
     <lb/>
     while we are to start with a system of gen<lb break="no"/>eral government, part British, part republi<lb break="no"/>can, part neither, it is to be an open ques<lb break="no"/>tion, left to the decision of each separate 
     <lb/>
     province, what kind of local constitution is 
     <lb/>
     to be constructed for itself. Each province 
     <lb/>
     must, of course, have an elective chamber, 
     <lb/>
     but as to a second chamber, that is to be as 
     <lb/>
     each local legislature may see fit. Some, 
     <lb/>
     probably, will have it elective, while others 
     <lb/>
     may dispense with it entirely. Then, looking 
     <lb/>
     to the appointment of the lieutenant-gov<lb break="no"/>ernors, and the tenure by which they are to 
     <lb/>
     hold office, it becomes about as clear as day that 
     <lb/>
     you cannot carry on responsible government 
     <lb/>
     in the provinces, but must have in them all 
     <lb/>
     a system that is neither British nor repub<lb break="no"/>lican, and that, I believe, will be found to 
     <lb/>
     be totally unworkable. Turning to the 
     <lb/>
     assignment of powers to the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the one hand, and the local or 
     <lb/>
     provincial governments on the other, we 
     <lb/>
     meet again with the unhappy contrast be<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <pb n="514" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0514.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">514</fw>
            <p>tween the wisdom displayed on that point 
     <lb/>
     in the Constitution of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and the lack of wisdom in the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     proposed for adoption here. There is, in 
     <lb/>
     the United States' system, a clear and dis<lb break="no"/>tinct line drawn between the functions of 
     <lb/>
     the general and state governments. Some 
     <lb/>
     may not like the idea of state sovereignty, 
     <lb/>
     and many may wish that more power had 
     <lb/>
     been given to the General Government. But 
     <lb/>
     this much is plain, that it is not proposed to 
     <lb/>
     allow anything approaching to state sove<lb break="no"/>reignty here. We have not even an intelli<lb break="no"/>gible statement as to what powers are to be 
     <lb/>
     exercised by the general, and what by the 
     <lb/>
     local legislatures and governments. Several 
     <lb/>
     subjects are specifically given to both ; many 
     <lb/>
     others are confusedly left in doubt between 
     <lb/>
     them ; and there is the strange and anomalous 
     <lb/>
     provision that not only can the General 
     <lb/>
     Government disallow the acts of the provin<lb break="no"/>cial legislatures, and control and hamper and 
     <lb/>
     fetter provincial action in more ways than 
     <lb/>
     one, but that wherever any federal legislation 
     <lb/>
     contravenes or in any way clashes with pro<lb break="no"/>vincial legislation, as to any matter at all 
     <lb/>
     common between them, such federal legis<lb break="no"/>lation shall override it, and take its place. 
     <lb/>
     It is not too much to say that a continuance 
     <lb/>
     of such a system for any length of time 
     <lb/>
     without serious clashing is absolutely im<lb break="no"/>possible. This is in effect so declared in the 
     <lb/>
     despatch of Her Majesty's Colonial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     and it is clearly pointed out in the London 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> and in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. It 
     <lb/>
     seems as if our statesmen had sought to 
     <lb/>
     multiply points of collision at every turn. 
     <lb/>
     Then as to the non provision of a permanent 
     <lb/>
     seat of government, and the arrangements 
     <lb/>
     contemplated for the judiciary, we find still 
     <lb/>
     more of the same sort of thing ; and as to 
     <lb/>
     the extraordinary pains that seem to have been 
     <lb/>
     taken to throw up a great wall or hedge round 
     <lb/>
     those institutions of Lower Canada which 
     <lb/>
     of late have been giving us no trouble to 
     <lb/>
     speak of—as to the extraordinary pains, I say, 
     <lb/>
     that seem to have been taken to put a wall 
     <lb/>
     around those institutions, and to give every 
     <lb/>
     possible guarantee about them on this side 
     <lb/>
     and on that ; why, this very machinery, prov<lb break="no"/>ided for the mere purpose of inducing people 
     <lb/>
     to agree to the scheme, who would not other<lb break="no"/>wise countenance it, is calculated, at no very 
     <lb/>
     distant day, to cause the cry to resound 
     <lb/>
     throughout the land—"To your tents, O, 
     <lb/>
     Israel !" (Hear, hear.) I had reached this 
     <lb/>
     point of my argument, when I was com<lb break="no"/>pelled to throw myself on the indulgence of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the House. There is just one consideration 
     <lb/>
     connected with these matters to which I 
     <lb/>
     have been alluding, that I wish to revert to 
     <lb/>
     in few words, because I believe it escaped 
     <lb/>
     me, in part at least, last night. A marked 
     <lb/>
     difference between the history of the United 
     <lb/>
     States just before they framed their consti<lb break="no"/>tution, and our late history, is this : the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the Constitution of the United 
     <lb/>
     States followed immediately upon their suc<lb break="no"/>cessful war of independence. The men who 
     <lb/>
     adopted it had just gone shoulder to 
     <lb/>
     shoulder through the severest trial that 
     <lb/>
     could have been given to their patience and 
     <lb/>
     other higher qualities. Their entire com<lb break="no"/>munities had been, you may say, united as 
     <lb/>
     one man, in the great struggle through 
     <lb/>
     which they had passed, and were then 
     <lb/>
     equally united in their hopes as to the 
     <lb/>
     grand results which their new system was 
     <lb/>
     to bring forth. They had tried the system 
     <lb/>
     of mere confederation, and were agreed that 
     <lb/>
     it was inadequate to meet the wants of their 
     <lb/>
     situation. They were all trying to remove 
     <lb/>
     the evils that they felt and apprehended 
     <lb/>
     from it, and to build up a great nationality 
     <lb/>
     that should endure in the future. That was 
     <lb/>
     the position they occupied. Ours is some 
     <lb/>
     thing very different indeed. We have 
     <lb/>
     not gone through an ordeal such as 
     <lb/>
     that through which they had so proudly 
     <lb/>
     passed. On the contrary, we have ended, 
     <lb/>
     temporarily ended at any rate, a series 
     <lb/>
     of struggles it is true, but struggles of a 
     <lb/>
     very different kind ; struggles that have 
     <lb/>
     just pitted our public men one against 
     <lb/>
     another, and to some extent, I am sorry to 
     <lb/>
     say, even our faiths and races against each 
     <lb/>
     other. (Hear, hear.) For one, I do believe 
     <lb/>
     that these struggles—of the latter class I 
     <lb/>
     mean—were dying out, but for these contem<lb break="no"/>plated changes, which are threatening to 
     <lb/>
     revive them. But, however that may be 
     <lb/>
     struggles there have been amongst us, of 
     <lb/>
     which we have no cause to be proud ; things 
     <lb/>
     have occurred since the union of which we 
     <lb/>
     ought to be ashamed, if we are not. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Of this kind are the only struggles 
     <lb/>
     that we have had ; and when, from such a 
     <lb/>
     past and present, we are told to start with 
     <lb/>
     the idea, so to speak, of at once creating 
     <lb/>
     and developing the character of a new 
     <lb/>
     and united nation, under institutions 
     <lb/>
     giving us a something short of indepen<lb break="no"/>dence, and at the same time any quantity of 
     <lb/>
     matters about which to dispute and come to 
     <lb/>
     trouble, we may as well not shut our eyes to 
     <lb/>
     the fact, that we start with but poor omens 
     <lb/>
            <pb n="515" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0515.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">515</fw>
           
     of success. (Hear, hear.) But I have to 
     <lb/>
     turn now, Mr. SPEAKER, to another branch 
     <lb/>
     of my comparison—the financial ; and here, 
     <lb/>
     I may at once give the House an assurance, 
     <lb/>
     which I am sure it will be glad to have, that 
     <lb/>
     I will not trouble it with more figures than 
     <lb/>
     are absolutely necessary to my explanation of 
     <lb/>
     the views I have to present, and that I will 
     <lb/>
     not give a single figure as to which there 
     <lb/>
     can be the possibility of a controversy. The 
     <lb/>
     contrast between the financial system as a 
     <lb/>
     whole, with which the framers of the United 
     <lb/>
     States Constitution started, and the financial 
     <lb/>
     system with which it is proposed we shall 
     <lb/>
     start, is as salient as it is possible for the 
     <lb/>
     human intellect to conceive ; and further the 
     <lb/>
     contrast between this proposed financial sys<lb break="no"/>tem, and the financial system of England, is 
     <lb/>
     just as salient too. The framers of the United 
     <lb/>
     States Constitution started with the principle, 
     <lb/>
     that between the United States and the several 
     <lb/>
     states there should be no financial dealings 
     <lb/>
     at all. They were to have separate financial 
     <lb/>
     systems, separate treasuries, separate debts 
     <lb/>
     —all absolutely distinct. And ever since 
     <lb/>
     the time when the unhappy attempt on the 
     <lb/>
     part of Great Britain to tax the colonies was 
     <lb/>
     given up, almost as absolute a line of demar<lb break="no"/>cation between the Imperial finances and 
     <lb/>
     treasury and the colonial finances and trea<lb break="no"/>suries, has been maintained. We have had 
     <lb/>
     our own separate finances and our own sepa<lb break="no"/>rate treasury, with which the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government has had nothing to do. The 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government may have gone, and 
     <lb/>
     may still go, to some expense on provincial 
     <lb/>
     behalf ; but the British principle is, that 
     <lb/>
     Imperial finance is as distinct from the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial, as in the United States Federal 
     <lb/>
     finance is from that of any state. Now, the sys<lb break="no"/>tem proposed here for our adoption is not this 
     <lb/>
     of entire and simple separation of the federal 
     <lb/>
     from the provincial treasuries, but a system 
     <lb/>
     of the most entire and complex confusion 
     <lb/>
     between them. One has to think a good 
     <lb/>
     deal upon the subject, and to study it pretty 
     <lb/>
     closely to see precisely how the confusion 
     <lb/>
     is going to operate ; but there it is, unmistak<lb break="no"/>ably, at every turn. I do not mean to say 
     <lb/>
     that under all the circumstances of the case 
     <lb/>
     something of this sort was not unavoidable. 
     <lb/>
     In the course of debate the other day, I 
     <lb/>
     remember a remark was thrown across the 
     <lb/>
     floor of the House upon this point and the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Minister of Finance in effect said : 
     <lb/>
     " Yes, indeed, and it would have been a very 
     <lb/>
     pleasant thing for gentlemen opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, if it had thrown upon the provinces a 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     necessity of resorting to direct taxation." 
     <lb/>
     Of course, in the mere view of making the 
     <lb/>
     scheme palatable, it was clever to make 
     <lb/>
     the Federal treasury pay for provincial 
     <lb/>
     expenditure ; but the system that had need 
     <lb/>
     be established should bear testimony, not to 
     <lb/>
     cleverness, but to wisdom. Is the system 
     <lb/>
     proposed for our acceptance as good, then, as 
     <lb/>
     statesmen ought to and would have made it ? 
     <lb/>
     I think not ; and the extraordinary thing is, 
     <lb/>
     that it is brought out with a flourish of 
     <lb/>
     trumpets, on the ground that in some unde<lb break="no"/>scribable way it is to work most economically ! 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Well, to test it, I will take it 
     <lb/>
     up in three points of view—first, as to assets ; 
     <lb/>
     next, as to debts and liabilities ; and, lastly, 
     <lb/>
     as to revenues. As to the asset part of the 
     <lb/>
     question, the tale is soon told. The assets 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces, speaking generally, are of 
     <lb/>
     very little commercial value. They are 
     <lb/>
     much like the assets of an insolvent trader, 
     <lb/>
     with lots of bad debts upon his books ; it is of 
     <lb/>
     small consequence to whom or how they are 
     <lb/>
     assigned. The general principle upon which 
     <lb/>
     the scheme proceeds, is to give the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government the bulk of these assets. The 
     <lb/>
     only exceptions of any consequence—I am 
     <lb/>
     not going into the details of the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     but still I must present to the House so 
     <lb/>
     much of detail as to show that I am making 
     <lb/>
     no rash statement, not borne out by facts—the 
     <lb/>
     only important exceptions, I say, to this rule 
     <lb/>
     are those I am about to notice. Certain proper<lb break="no"/>ties such as penitentiaries, prisons, lunatic asy<lb break="no"/>lums, and other public charitable institutions, 
     <lb/>
     and other buildings and properties of the 
     <lb/>
     kind, which, together with those I have just 
     <lb/>
     mentioned, may be characterized as excep<lb break="no"/>tional properties, are to be assigned by the 
     <lb/>
     general to the provincial governments. 
     <lb/>
    Also, with the exception of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>the several provinces are to take the public 
     <lb/>lands, mines, minerals and royalties in each, 
     <lb/>and all assets connected with them—in com<lb break="no"/>mon parlance, their territorial revenues. 
     <lb/>The General Government is, however, to 
     <lb/>have the mines, minerals and public lands of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland, paying for them of course. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Then, Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>Canada are severally to have those assets 
     <lb/>which are connected with the debts, reserved 
     <lb/>for payment by them respectively ; but these 
     <lb/>will not be worth much, and I shall not take 
     <lb/>the trouble of saying much about them. It 
     <lb/>is enough to know that the proportion of the 
     <lb/>debts to be assumed by the two has not yet, 
     <lb/>for some reason, been stated, and that the 
     <lb/>assets connected with them amount to very 
     <lb/>
    
            <pb n="516" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0516.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">516</fw>
          
     little. Further, I am not quite sure that I 
     <lb/>
     am right, but I understood the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General for Lower Canada, the other night, 
     <lb/>
     to intimate that the seigniory of Sorel is to 
     <lb/>
     be somehow a provincial asset of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. If that is not to be the case I will 
     <lb/>
     pass on ; but if it is, perhaps the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will say so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—I will 
     <lb/>
     speak on that subject at another time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Then, I am to take it 
     <lb/>
     for granted, I suppose, that it is not to be a 
     <lb/>
     provincial asset? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER</persName>—I will 
     <lb/>
     not interrupt the hon. gentleman now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     did suppose that I should have had an 
     <lb/>
     immediate answer as to whether this seig<lb break="no"/>niory is to be a provincial asset or not; but 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman does not seem inclined 
     <lb/>
     to give any information upon the point. By 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions it is provided, that all 
     <lb/>
     ordnance properties are to be taken by the 
     <lb/>
     General Government ; and I never heard but 
     <lb/>
     that the seigniory of Sorel is an ordnance 
     <lb/>
     property. But from the statement made 
     <lb/>
     here the other day, it would seem that 
     <lb/>
     although this printed document purports to 
     <lb/>
     be the scheme, it does not give us true in<lb break="no"/>formation on this point. The wording of 
     <lb/>
     the 55th resolution is, that the " property 
     <lb/>
     transferred by the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     and known as ordnance property " is to 
     <lb/>
     belong to the General Government; if any 
     <lb/>
     part of it is really a provincial asset, it must 
     <lb/>
     become so by one of those explanations or 
     <lb/>
     glosses which we are not allowed to insert 
     <lb/>
     in the instrument now, but are to take our 
     <lb/>
     chance of for some future time. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Passing over the mystery that seems to 
     <lb/>
     hang over the subject, I refer then to a mat<lb break="no"/>ter about which there can be no mistake. 
     <lb/>
     There certainly cannot be a doubt that the 
     <lb/>
     lands, mines, and minerals of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     are to be a Federal asset ; and there is not 
     <lb/>
     any doubt either that the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will have to pay $150,000 a year for 
     <lb/>
     them. It is perfectly certain that these 
     <lb/>
     lands will cost that money; and it is per<lb break="no"/>fectly certain, I think, that the administration 
     <lb/>
     of them will also cost a certain amount of 
     <lb/>
     trouble and dispute, as to the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which it is to be carried on. But if human 
     <lb/>
     nature remains human nature, we may rea<lb break="no"/>sonably and probably surmise that they will 
     <lb/>
     not yield so great a revenue to the General 
     <lb/>
     Government as is by some thought. We 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
       
     shall have Newfoundland delegations in the 
     <lb/>
     Commons House, and in the other House ; 
     <lb/>
     and in order to keep them in anything like 
     <lb/>
     good humor, and to enable the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor of Newfoundland to carry on his 
     <lb/>
     government with anything like ease and com<lb break="no"/>fort, their lands, mines and minerals will 
     <lb/>
     have to be administered, not with a view to 
     <lb/>
     Federal revenue—even though to that end 
     <lb/>
     they are costing the direct payment of 
     <lb/>
     $150,000 a year— but with a view to New<lb break="no"/>foundland popularity. In fact, I think it 
     <lb/>
     will be found that the management of these 
     <lb/>
     properties will be carried on more with a 
     <lb/>
     view to the development and profit of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, than for an profit of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada. Every man, 
     <lb/>
     woman and child—from the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor downwards—connected with New<lb break="no"/>foundland, will regard it as a fit article of 
     <lb/>
     political faith, that they must he worked 
     <lb/>
     with a special view to the great future of 
     <lb/>
     that great country. And the consequence 
     <lb/>
     will be many little passages between the 
     <lb/>
     province and the Federal Government, not 
     <lb/>
     advantageous to the latter, but illustrative of 
     <lb/>
     the way in which governments too often 
     <lb/>
     have to deal with things for which they 
     <lb/>
     have had to pay. Well, sir, I pass to the 
     <lb/>
     matter of the debts ; and these, it must be 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged are rather more important 
     <lb/>
     than the assets. (Hear, hear.) There is 
     <lb/>
     no mistake about that; though there might 
     <lb/>
     seem to be a mistake about the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     on this subject, were you to take their letter 
     <lb/>
     only. The sixtieth resolution says that the 
     <lb/>
    General Government shall assume all the 
     <lb/>debts and liabilities of each province; while 
     <lb/>the sixty-first has it, that part of our 
     <lb/>Canadian debt is to be borne by Upper and 
     <lb/>Lower Canada respectively. In a sense, I 
     <lb/>will presently explain. I think the sixtieth 
     <lb/>resolution about tells the truth, or rather, I 
     <lb/>ought to say, falls short of it. But it 
     <lb/>requires one to work the oracle out. to follow 
     <lb/>the calculation through, in order to see 
     <lb/>that it does so, that these debts will indeed 
     <lb/>all—and more than all—fall, directly or 
     <lb/>indirectly, on the Federal Government. 
     <lb/>Meantime, on our way to that part of my 
     <lb/>argument, I set it down that under the 
     <lb/>sixty-first resolution there is an amount 
     <lb/>of reserved debt which, in a certain man<lb break="no"/>ner, is to fall on Upper and Lower Canada 
     <lb/>respectively. Pretty much as it was just 
     <lb/>now in the ordnance property, so here, 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="517" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0517.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">517</fw>
      
     we cannot get an intelligible answer as to 
     <lb/>
     what these reserved debts are, as against  
     <lb/>
     either  province, or what the assets are 
     <lb/>
     that each is to take as an  offset to them. 
     <lb/>
     But, for the purpose of constituting the 
     <lb/>
     stated debt of the future Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada, we are told, are 
     <lb/>
     to throw into it an amount of $62,500,000, 
     <lb/>
     the surplus of their debt being nominally left 
     <lb/>
     to he borne by themselves, after they shall 
     <lb/>
     have become confederated ; Nova Scotia, on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, is to be allowed to increase 
     <lb/>
     her debt to $8,000,000 ; and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Prince Edward Island are to throw in 
     <lb/>
     theirs at the nominal figure they stand at 
     <lb/>
     now. But, by an ingenious contrivance, 
     <lb/>
     the aggregate real debt of the country 
     <lb/>
     is to be, in effect, a good deal more 
     <lb/>
     than the aggregation of these figures would 
     <lb/>
     give. Upper and Lower Canada, to begin 
     <lb/>
     with, as we have seen, are,  besides, separately 
     <lb/>
     to pretend to bear the weight of their con<lb break="no"/>siderable excess of debt over the $62,500,000, 
     <lb/>
     or $25 a head, allowed under this arrange<lb break="no"/>ment. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     should they not increase their debts to be 
     <lb/>
     assumed up to this figure of $25 a head, are 
     <lb/>
     to be paid interest at five percent  on any 
     <lb/>
     amount of shortcoming in that behalf they 
     <lb/>
     may be guilty of. And Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island are to be paid in<lb break="no"/>terest at the same rate, on the amount to 
     <lb/>
     which their smaller debts fall short of this 
     <lb/>
     same normal $25 allowance. For practical 
     <lb/>
     purposes, therefore, the debts of the four 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces are thus brought up to this 
     <lb/>
     standard level. The Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     is to pay interest on them to that tune—if 
     <lb/>
     not to creditors of those provinces, then to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces themselve. And we are to start 
     <lb/>
     with a clear, practical debt of $25 a head 
     <lb/>
     for every man, woman, and child in the 
     <lb/>
      Confederacy. Incurred or not, we start with 
     <lb/>
     it as due, and pay accordingly. And there 
     <lb/>
       are besides, those amounts of debt left nom<lb break="no"/>inally to the charge of Upper Canada, as to 
     <lb/>
     which I shall have a word more to say shortly. 
     <lb/>
     Meantime, I proceed to our third head—of 
     <lb/>
     revenues. And here, the first and most 
     <lb/>
     striking fact is, that the  Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     is to make yearly grants, payable, by the 
     <lb/>
     way, semi-annually and in advance, to each 
     <lb/>
     province, in proportion to its population as 
     <lb/>
      shown by the census of l861, and at the rate 
     <lb/>
      of 80 cents a head. And the way in which 
     <lb/>
      this 80 cents a head apportionment is come at, 
     <lb/>
     is in itself somewhat edifying. According 
     <lb/>
     to the statements  made here by Ministers, 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
         
     the Finance Ministers of the several pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were invited at the Conference to 
     <lb/>
     come forward with a statement of their 
     <lb/>
     respective wants. Of course their state<lb break="no"/>ments were to be framed with a due regard 
     <lb/>
     to economy. Such things are always to be 
     <lb/>
     done economically. This is a diplomatic 
     <lb/>
     phrase, of which we understand here the 
     <lb/>
     full meaning ; and I was not at all surprised 
     <lb/>
     to hear, that however economically the 
     <lb/>
     statements  were made out,  they had to be 
     <lb/>
     cut down. Whether they are said to have 
     <lb/>
     been cut down once or twice, or oftener, I 
     <lb/>
     do not distinctly recollect.  But last, after 
     <lb/>
     having been duly cut down,  they were found 
     <lb/>
     to require this grant or subvention, at the 
     <lb/>
     rate of 80 cents a head all round—subject 
     <lb/>
     always to deduction as against the Canadas, 
     <lb/>
     and to additions in favor of the four 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces, as we shall presently 
     <lb/>
     see. With less, the provinces could not 
     <lb/>
     get on at the rate thought necessary, unless 
     <lb/>
     by levying undesired taxes.  Well, besides 
     <lb/>
     these subventions, the provinces (all but 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland) are to have the proceeds of 
     <lb/>
     their lands, mines and minerals ; and New<lb break="no"/>foundland is to have, instead, the further 
     <lb/>
     grant from the Federal treasury, of $150,000 
     <lb/>
     a year, forever. They may all, further, 
     <lb/>
     derive some more indirect revenue from 
     <lb/>
     licenses of various sorts ; and Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     may add to these an exceptional, and ex<lb break="no"/>ceptionable, export duty on coal and other 
     <lb/>
     minerals ; and New Brunswick, the like on 
     <lb/>
     lumber. Besides which, on the mere ground 
     <lb/>
     that she cannot do without it, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick is to have a further Federal grant of 
     <lb/>
     $63,000 a  year for ten years ; unless, indeed, 
     <lb/>
     in the event of her not augmenting her debt 
     <lb/>
     to the full amount, in which case, any payment 
     <lb/>
     made to her of interest on that score is 
     <lb/>
     to be deducted from the $63,000—a shrewd 
     <lb/>
     hint, by the way, that she had not best be 
     <lb/>
     too economical—and, lastly, all are to have 
     <lb/>
      the precious right of direct taxation, and the 
     <lb/>
     higher privilege of borrowing without limit. 
     <lb/>
     The Federal power is to have, of course, the 
     <lb/>
     right to tax in all sorts of ways, the special 
     <lb/>
     export duties made over to New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and  Nova Scotia, alone excepted. Now, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, taking this whole arranage<lb break="no"/>ment together, I must repeat that I see 
     <lb/>
     in it no principle but one. The provinces 
     <lb/>
     are to be able to carry on their opera<lb break="no"/>tions according to their supposed probable 
     <lb/>
     future exigencies, without danger of direct, 
     <lb/>
     that is to say, oppressive or new taxation. 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, engineers say that the mea<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="518" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_518.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">518</fw>
            
     sure of strength of a fortified place is 
     <lb/>
     the strength of its weakest part. And 
     <lb/>
     this principle is here applied to our provinces 
     <lb/>
     in a financial point of view. The need of 
     <lb/>
     the neediest is made the measure of the aid 
     <lb/>
     given to all. The most embarrassed is to 
     <lb/>
     have enough for its purposes, and the rest are 
     <lb/>
     to receive, if not exactly in the same ratio, 
     <lb/>
     at least so nearly up to the mark as that they 
     <lb/>
     shall all be satisfied; while, on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, the debts of all the provinces are to be, 
     <lb/>
     for all practical ends, raised to the full level 
     <lb/>
     of the most indebted. To show this, sir, 
     <lb/>
     another word or two as to the amount of the 
     <lb/>
     promised subventions to Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. This is to be, as we have seen, 
     <lb/>
     only the 80 cents a head, less some deduction, 
     <lb/>
     I care not what, for the purpose of my pre<lb break="no"/>sent argument; but there is no doubt, I say, 
     <lb/>
     that they are to receive less than the 80 cents, 
     <lb/>
     because the excess of their debt over $62,<lb break="no"/>500,000, though thrown on them, will have to 
     <lb/>
     be guaranteed, and the interest on it will have 
     <lb/>be paid by the Federal Government, and<lb/>
    that interest will be deducted by the Federal 
     <lb/>Government from the subventions payable to 
     <lb/>them respectively. The Lower Provinces, on 
     <lb/>the other hand, as we have also seen, are 
     <lb/>really to get more. Well now, suppose for the 
     <lb/>moment the arrangement had been, for the 
     <lb/>Confederation to assume at once the whole 
     <lb/>debt of Canada, and accordingly to pay pro<lb break="no"/>portionably larger amounts of interest to the 
     <lb/>other provinces. The two Canadas would 
     <lb/>then have needed, exactly, so much the less 
     <lb/>of nominal subvention, and the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces too. The cost to the Federal treasury, 
     <lb/>in the whole, would still have been exactly 
     <lb/>what it is. Indirectly, therefore, I say that 
     <lb/>for all practical purposes there is thrown upon 
     <lb/>the General Government the whole amount of 
     <lb/>the past debts of these provinces, and more; 
     <lb/>and the whole burden, too, of the carrying on 
     <lb/>of the machinery of government, both Federal 
     <lb/>and Provincial; unless, indeed, any of the 
     <lb/>provinces should see fit hereafter to undertake 
     <lb/>what I may call extraordinary expenditure, 
     <lb/>and to defray it themselves. I do not think 
     <lb/>they will. It would involve direct taxation. 
     <lb/>And I think they can do better. But for all 
     <lb/>this part of the plan, sir, it is like the rest, 
     <lb/>framed on the mere idea of making things 
     <lb/>pleasant—the politician idea of anyhow win<lb break="no"/>ning over interests or parties for to-day—not 
     <lb/>on any statesmanlike thought as to its future 
     <lb/>working and effects. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, with this outline of the sys<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     tem, I should be glad to know where the 
     <lb/>
     prospect of economy of administration is to be 
     <lb/>
     found. The Honorable Finance Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the future Federal Government will have to 
     <lb/>
     do—what? To come with a budget, not 
     <lb/>
     merely to cover the outlay of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government—that is of course—but with a 
     <lb/>
     budget to cover also all that I may call the 
     <lb/>
     normal outlay, the intended outlay, the fore<lb break="no"/>seen outlay of all the provinces. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The Minister of Finance—if any 
     <lb/>
     there is—of the province, unless he chooses 
     <lb/>
     to outrun the constable; unless, with his lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant-governor and local government and le<lb break="no"/>gislature, he chooses to spend more than he 
     <lb/>
     can get out of the Federal Government, by 
     <lb/>
     this system, or by that nice modification of it 
     <lb/>
     which is pretty sure to be soon thought of, 
     <lb/>
     and to which I shall by and by advert, need 
     <lb/>
     have no budget at all. He knows he is to 
     <lb/>
     have about so much from his lands, mines 
     <lb/>
     and minerals, so much from licenses and 
     <lb/>
     so forth, so much from the Federal Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, so many thousand or hundred 
     <lb/>
     thousand dollars in all; and he will of course 
     <lb/>
     make the best he can of that. And by the 
     <lb/>
     way, it is a remarkable fact in this connec<lb break="no"/>tion, that we find that with one accord those 
     <lb/>
     who are undertaking to speak to the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent provinces in support of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     are agreed in each telling the people of his 
     <lb/>
     own province what a first-rate bargain has 
     <lb/>
     been made for it. (Hear, hear.) My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Hochelaga read us an extract the 
     <lb/>
     other night from a speech of Hon. Mr. TIL<lb break="no"/>LEY, of New Brunswick, in which that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman cyphered out, perfectly to his satis<lb break="no"/>faction, and to that of many who heard him, 
     <lb/>
     that New Brunswick is guaranteed an excess 
     <lb/>
     over her real needs, of $34,000 a year. If I 
     <lb/>
     am not mistaken, the Hon. Solicitor General for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada undertook since, in this House, 
     <lb/>
     to shew us that some $200,000 or more a- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     year beyond hers, is in the same way secured 
     <lb/>
    to Lower Canada; even though she does 
     <lb/>not receive the full 80 cents a head. I 
     <lb/>think I remember that the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>the Council—though I have not yet got the 
     <lb/>report of his speech to refresh my memory— 
     <lb/>made it a point that really Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>as well as Lower Canada, is comfortably off 
     <lb/>in this respect. One hears too, I think, of 
     <lb/>the same song in Nova Scotia; and in Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island certainly, we have the advo<lb break="no"/>cates of Confederation telling the people 
     <lb/>there—" You, too, have got a capital bargain, 
     <lb/>you have so much more to spend, according 
     <lb/>
    
            <pb n="519" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0519.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">519</fw>
        
     to this arrangement, than you ever had before." 
     <lb/>
     A strange comment on that earnest desire for 
     <lb/>
     economy, which is claimed to have dictated 
     <lb/>
     the whole of these arrangements.  (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If that was the intention, the per<lb break="no"/>formance has fallen far short of it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And before I go further, there 
     <lb/>
     occurs to me this consideration, arising out 
     <lb/>
     of this state of things—out of this abun<lb break="no"/>dance, not to say plethora, that is meant to 
     <lb/>
     characterize the provincial exchequers, what<lb break="no"/>ever may be the case with the Federal 
     <lb/>
     exchequer under the system—one considera<lb break="no"/>tion, I say, connected with this, which should 
     <lb/>
     not be lost sight of when we are talking about 
     <lb/>
     the application of anything in the least like 
     <lb/>
      responsible government to our provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     never yet heard of an elected  legislative body 
     <lb/>
     that had much control over a government, 
     <lb/>
     unless it had hold of the strings of a purse 
     <lb/>
     from which the government wanted to get 
     <lb/>
     something. In the old days, before responsi<lb break="no"/>ble government was thought of—in the days 
     <lb/>
      when casual and territorial revenues gave 
     <lb/>
     provincial governments all they wanted, or a 
     <lb/>
     little more—provincial legislatures had mighty 
     <lb/>
     little to do with government, and, if they 
     <lb/>
     complained of a grievance, were little likely 
     <lb/>
     to be listened  to. It was even the same long 
     <lb/>
     before at home. When the English Crown 
     <lb/>
     had its abundance of resources, English kings 
     <lb/>
     cared little for their parliaments. But when 
     <lb/>
     their resources were exhausted, and they could 
     <lb/>
     not borrow easily, and had to ask for taxes, 
     <lb/>
     then the House of Commons began to acquire 
     <lb/>
     power, and, in course of time, became the 
     <lb/>
     body it is now. I shall be surprised if we do 
     <lb/>
     not find, in the event of this Confederation 
     <lb/>
      taking place, that for some time our pro<lb break="no"/>vincial legislatures, whether they consist of 
     <lb/>
     one chamber or of two, will be less powerful 
     <lb/>
     for good than many would wish to have 
     <lb/>
     them, that the machine of state will not be 
     <lb/>
      altogether driven by their means. But there 
     <lb/>
     is another result, about which there can 
     <lb/>
     be no question. With one accord, not in 
     <lb/>
      Newfoundland merely—I was hinting a little 
     <lb/>
     while ago at what would be the case of 
     <lb/>
      Newfoundland, as to its lands, mines and 
     <lb/>
       minerals - not there only, but in all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces - the provincial governments  will, in 
     <lb/>
      a quiet way, want money, and the provincial 
     <lb/>
      legislators and people will want it yet more ; 
     <lb/>
      grants for roads and bridges, for schools, for 
     <lb/>
      charities, for salaries, for contingencies of the 
     <lb/>
      legislative body—for all manner of ends they 
     <lb/>
     will be wanting money, and where is it to 
     <lb/>come from ? Whether the constitution of<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     the Provincial Executive savors at all of re<lb break="no"/>sponsible government or not, be sure it will 
     <lb/>
     not be anxious to bring itself more under the 
     <lb/>
     control of the legislature, or to make itself 
     <lb/>
     more odious than it can help, and the easiest 
     <lb/>
     way for it to get money will be from the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government. I am not sure, either, but 
     <lb/>
     that most members of the provincial legisla<lb break="no"/>tures will like it that way the best. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It will not be at all unpopular, 
     <lb/>
     the getting of money so. Quite the contrary. 
     <lb/>
     Gentlemen will go to their constituents with 
     <lb/>
     an easy conscience, telling them : " True, we 
     <lb/>
     had not much to do in the Provincial Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and you need not ask very closely 
     <lb/>
     what else we did ; but I tell you what, we 
     <lb/>
     got the Federal Government to increase the 
     <lb/>
     subvention to our province by five cents a 
     <lb/>
     head, and see what this gives you—$500 to 
     <lb/>
     that road—$1000 to that charity—so much 
     <lb/>
     here, so much there. That we have done ; 
     <lb/>
     and have we not done well ? " (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am afraid in many constituencies the ans<lb break="no"/>wer would be; " Yes, you have done well ; 
     <lb/>
     go and do it again." I am afraid the provin<lb break="no"/>cial constituencies, legislatures and executives 
     <lb/>
     will all show a most calf-like appetite  for the 
     <lb/>
     milking of this one most magnificient  govern<lb break="no"/>ment cow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—There will 
     <lb/>
     be more municipal loan funds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—Yes, that is one of the 
     <lb/>
     analogies, and there is another even nearer. 
     <lb/>
     Years ago, we in Canada said we would for ever 
     <lb/>
     give a certain fixed sum per annum for an edu<lb break="no"/>cation fund. It was to be divided, in a cer<lb break="no"/>tain ratio, between Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     But from time to time, as the census shewed 
     <lb/>
     changes of their relative population, the divi<lb break="no"/>sion was to be altered. In a little while this 
     <lb/>
     alteration of ratio gave Lower Canada less 
     <lb/>
     money and Upper Canada more. " Oh! but," 
     <lb/>
     said the Administration, " we cannot do that 
     <lb/>
     with Lower Canada. After having had distrib<lb break="no"/>uted to her so many thousands a year, she could 
     <lb/>
     not stand having ever so much less. No, no ; 
     <lb/>
     we cannot do that. What shall we do, then ? 
     <lb/>
     In our estimates we will put in a vote for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, just to keep her figure up to 
     <lb/>
     the mark of what she has been receiving. 
     <lb/>
     And what then ? Why, of course, we must 
     <lb/>
     add a vote for Upper Canada in the same pro<lb break="no"/>portion, just to take her so much further beyond 
     <lb/>
     her former figure. " (Hear, hear.) To be 
     <lb/>
     sure, I do find, with reference to this subven<lb break="no"/>tion, a pleasant little expression, which one 
     <lb/>
     wishes may be carried out. It is to be " in 
     <lb/>
     ull." " Such aid shall be <hi rendition="simple:italic">in full settlement</hi>   
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="520" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0520.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">520</fw>
         
     of all future demands upon the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for local purposes, and shall be paid 
     <lb/>
     half-yearly, in advance, to each province." 
     <lb/>
     Yes, sir, so the text runs. But suppose our<lb break="no"/>selves in the time of our first, or second, or 
     <lb/>
     third Federal Cabinet, consisting of its six or 
     <lb/>
     more sections, of course ; and, for the sake of 
     <lb/>
     my argument, I will suppose a great deal, 
     <lb/>
     that every one of these sections controls com<lb break="no"/>fortably the delegations from its own province 
     <lb/>
     in the two Houses of Parliament, that the 
     <lb/>
     machine is working beautifully, that there is 
     <lb/>
     no lieutenant-governor crusty, no provin<lb break="no"/>cial administration kicking over the traces, 
     <lb/>
     and no provincial legislature giving any 
     <lb/>
     other trouble than by its anxiety to be well 
     <lb/>
     paid. I will suppose even that this halcyon 
     <lb/>
     state of things has gone on for some time. 
     <lb/>
     But one or two or more of the provinces begin 
     <lb/>
     to feel that they cannot do without having  
     <lb/>
     more money. And the pressure will be such 
     <lb/>
     upon the Provincial Legislature and upon the 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant-Governor, and upon the delegations 
     <lb/>
     to the General Legislature, and upon the 
     <lb/>
      section of the Federal Executive representing 
     <lb/>
     each such province, that it never can be long 
     <lb/>
     resisted ; there will be trouble if it is, and 
     <lb/>
     things must be kept pleasant. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     One mode—the most obvious, though the 
     <lb/>
     least scientific—will be just to increase the sub<lb break="no"/>vention from eighty to eighty-five, or even to 
     <lb/>
     eighty-two or eighty-one cents a head. 
     <lb/>
     An additional cent a head from the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Exchequer would be an object—a few cents 
     <lb/>
     a head would be a boon. Or suppose the 
     <lb/>
     demand took this form : suppose the people 
     <lb/>
     —say of Upper or Lower Canada—should 
     <lb/>
     say, " Those Newfoundlanders are getting 
     <lb/>
      $150,000 a year for their lands, mines, and 
     <lb/>
     minerals ; and the Federal Government is 
     <lb/>
     positively administering those lands, mines, 
     <lb/>
     and minerals, not for Federal profit, but more 
     <lb/>
     for the advantage of  that province than we 
     <lb/>
     find we can administer our own ; the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, therefore, must take our lands, 
     <lb/>
     mines, and minerals, and give us also an 
     <lb/>
     equivalent." That is one way of doing the 
     <lb/>
     thing ; and, when the time comes for making 
     <lb/>
     that sort of demand, depend upon it that it 
     <lb/>
     will sound singularly reasonable in the ears of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces whose representatives shall make 
     <lb/>
     it ; and if two or three provinces shall join in 
     <lb/>
     the demand, my word for it, the thing will 
     <lb/>
     soon be done. The same sort of thing may be 
     <lb/>
     looked for in reference to the New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     timber export duty and the Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     mineral export duty. Here is one form of 
     <lb/>
     the cry that may be raised—" You give these 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
       
     exceptional privileges to New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>
     Nova  Scotia ; give them, or some equiva<lb break="no"/>lent, to us also." With common ingenuity 
     <lb/>
     lots of such cries may be nicely got up. But 
     <lb/>
     for everything so given, much or little, to what<lb break="no"/>ever province, you will have to do the like 
     <lb/>
     for all the rest, and the figure will be alarming 
     <lb/>
     before you get to the end. And even this is 
     <lb/>
     not all. Not only will you have  these com<lb break="no"/>paratively direct demands—more or less in<lb break="no"/>geniously, but always irresistibly—made, but 
     <lb/>
     you will have demands made in a more indi<lb break="no"/>rect form which it will be yet easier to carry, 
     <lb/>
     from their consequences not being so clearly 
     <lb/>
     seen, and which will therefore be still worse 
     <lb/>
     in their effects. I speak of that tremendous 
     <lb/>
     catalogue of outlays which may be gone into 
     <lb/>
     without the appearance of a grant to any par<lb break="no"/>ticular province—the costly favors which may 
     <lb/>
     be done in respect of inter-provincial ferries, 
     <lb/>
     steamship lines between or from the provinces,  
     <lb/>
     railways between or through the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     telegraph lines, agriculture, immigration, 
     <lb/>
     quarantine, fisheries, and so forth. There 
     <lb/>
     will be claims of every description under all 
     <lb/>
     these heads ; and besides them there will be 
     <lb/>
     the long roll of internal improvements of all 
     <lb/>
     kinds, whether for the benefit of one or of 
     <lb/>
     more than one of the provinces. For any 
     <lb/>
     local work in which it can be at all pretended 
     <lb/>
     that it is of general interest, pressure may be 
     <lb/>
     brought to bear upon the General Government 
     <lb/>
     and Legislature, and whenever one province 
     <lb/>
     succeeds in getting any such grant, every 
     <lb/>
     other province must be dealt with in the same 
     <lb/>
     way. Compensation must be made all round, 
     <lb/>
     and no human intellect can estimate the 
     <lb/>
     degree of extravagance that before long must 
     <lb/>
     become simply inevitable. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Sir, with our Upper and Lower Canada we 
     <lb/>
     have had pretty good proof of this. We 
     <lb/>
     know that whenever anything has had to be 
     <lb/>
     done for one section of this province, it has 
     <lb/>
     constantly been found necessary to do some 
     <lb/>
     thing of the same or of some other kind for 
     <lb/>
     the other. If either needed anything very 
     <lb/>
     badly, then the ingenuity of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance had to be exercised to discover some<lb break="no"/>thing else of like value to give the other. In 
     <lb/>
     one word, unless I am more mistaken than I 
     <lb/>
     think I can be, these local governments will 
     <lb/>
     be pretty good daughters of the horse-leech, 
     <lb/>
     and their cry will be found to be pretty often 
     <lb/>
     and pretty successfully—" Give, give, give! " 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, there is very little need for our dealing 
     <lb/>
     with considerations of this kind as to a future  
     <lb/>
     about which one may be thought to be in 
     <lb/>danger of drawing more or less upon imagin<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="num">521</fw>
        
      ation. We have in these resolutions a some<lb break="no"/>thing that is to come upon us, one may say, 
     <lb/>
     at once ; I allude to the expenditure  for 
     <lb/>
     our defences - the Intercolonial Railway - the  
     <lb/>
      opening of communication with the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     West - and the enlargement of our canals. 
     <lb/>
     There is no doubt that all these new sources 
     <lb/>
     of outlay are immediately contemplated. 
     <lb/>
     Their cost is not given us; it could not be 
     <lb/>
     given with any safety to the scheme. I do 
     <lb/>
     not pretend to say, sir, but that some of these 
     <lb/>
     expenditures are necessary ; and this I am 
     <lb/>
     even prepared to say as to one of them — 
     <lb/>
     the outlay for defences—that every province 
     <lb/>
     of the empire is bound to do its full share 
     <lb/>
     towards its own defence. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     never gave a vote or expressed an opinion in 
     <lb/>
     any other sense. I was always ready with 
     <lb/>
     my vote for that purpose.  (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But looking at the great outlay, I may say 
     <lb/>
     the enormous outlay here understood to be 
     <lb/>
     contemplated, I confess I cannot approach the 
     <lb/>
     subject in this connection without a feeling of 
     <lb/>
     misgiving. I can quite understand our going 
     <lb/>
     to the full limit  of our means for all the ex<lb break="no"/>pense that is necessary for the thorough main<lb break="no"/>tenance of our militia on an efficient footing 
     <lb/>
     as to instruction and otherwise ; but when we 
     <lb/>
     hear of Imperial engineers, with Imperial 
     <lb/>
     ideas as to cost, laying out grand permanent 
     <lb/>
      works of defence, then I confess I am much 
     <lb/>
      inclined to think that we had need try to 
     <lb/>
      practice what economy we can in that direc<lb break="no"/>tion.  (Hear, hear.) Then, as regards the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial  Railway, we have in these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions a very blind tale indeed. " The Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government shall secure, without delay, 
     <lb/>
     the completion of the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>
     from Rivière du Loup, through New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, to Truro in Nova Scotia"— and this 
     <lb/>
     quite irrespectively of the expense. The 
     <lb/>
     vague pledge is, that the General Government 
     <lb/>
     shall at any cost secure the immediate com<lb break="no"/>pletion of this work. As to its commercial or 
     <lb/>
     military advantages, I have not a great idea of 
     <lb/>
     them. I believe there has been much exagger<lb break="no"/>ation as to both. Unless with a strong force to 
     <lb/>
     defend it, in a military point of view, it 
     <lb/>
     would be of just no use at all. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     For my own part, as I have often said, I 
     <lb/>
     heartily wish to see the road built ; but un<lb break="no"/>less we can get it done upon terms within our 
     <lb/>
     means, we had better do without it a little 
     <lb/>
     longer, and develop what other means of 
     <lb/>
     communication are at our command. While 
     <lb/>
    I want to see the thing done, I am not pre<lb break="no"/>pared for the declaration I find in these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, that, <hi rendition="simple:italic">coûte que coûte</hi>, we will at once 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     have it. I doubt the policy of that way of 
     <lb/>
     dealing. (Hear, hear.) Viewed in its politi<lb break="no"/>cal aspects, the work is as much an Imperial 
     <lb/>
     as a provincial work ; is one for which we 
     <lb/>
     have a right to look for aid from the Empire. 
     <lb/>
     I know it is said the Empire is going to aid 
     <lb/>
     us. Well, for a long time we held this lan<lb break="no"/>guage : if the Imperial Government and the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces between them will combine 
     <lb/>
     to do the rest, we are ready with lands and 
     <lb/>
     subsidies, in a certain proportion and to a 
     <lb/>
     certain limited amount. It is unfortunate, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, that that proposal led to no 
     <lb/>
     result. I should have been glad to have ob<lb break="no"/>tained it on such terms, and even would have 
     <lb/>
     bid up the limit to the utmost extent of our 
     <lb/>
     means. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—That offer is 
     <lb/>
     extant yet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—I know it is, but those 
     <lb/>
     since made have left it out of sight. In 1862 
     <lb/>
     the start was made to a larger and not limited 
     <lb/>
     outlay—five-twelfths of an unstated whole— 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain to reduce the cost by endorsing 
     <lb/>
     for us to a stated figure. I regretted that 
     <lb/>
     scheme ; but still it was better for us than 
     <lb/>
     what is now being forced upon us. By this 
     <lb/>
     last scheme, Canada will have to bear some 
     <lb/>
     nine-twelfths—it has been said ten-twelfths— 
     <lb/>
     but some nine-twelfths, at any rate. In fact, 
     <lb/>
     the bulk of the burden is to fall on us; and 
     <lb/>
     it is significant, though I dare say that the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen who drew up this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion did not mean it, that it seems to let the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government off from its guarantee. 
     <lb/>
     This is no mere criticism of mine ; my atten<lb break="no"/>tion was drawn to the point by the article in 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> from which I was 
     <lb/>
     quoting last night. That writer—who is not 
     <lb/>
     a nobody, you may depend upon it—remarks, 
     <lb/>
     in  effect, that from the wording of this reso<lb break="no"/>lution, the honorable gentlemen of the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence do not seem to be holding to the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     guarantee. Should it not be given, the cost 
     <lb/>
     to us will be frightfully increased. And this 
     <lb/>
     it had not need be. For the honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who are running us into it might do well 
     <lb/>
     to remember the past. We had the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk railway  offered us for what was called 
     <lb/>
     next to nothing. The guarantee we were to 
     <lb/>
     give was not for much ; and it was well 
     <lb/>
     secured ; and we were assured it was not 
     <lb/>
     meant to be made use of—was more a form 
     <lb/>
     than a reality. Yet the guarantee was used and 
     <lb/>
     extended, and made a gift of ; every estimate 
     <lb/>
     failed ; the cry ever since has been for more, 
     <lb/>
     more ; and the whole concern is now in such 
     <lb/>
     a state as to be threatening us day by day 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="522" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0522.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">522</fw>
        
     with yet larger demands on the public purse 
     <lb/>
     than ever, to keep it going. Well,  sir, I pass 
     <lb/>
     on from these  heavy outlays for permanent de<lb break="no"/>fences, and the Intercolonial Railway ; and I 
     <lb/>
     read in these resolutions that " the communi<lb break="no"/>cations with the North-Western territory, 
     <lb/>
     and the improvements required for the de<lb break="no"/>velopment of the trade of the Great West with 
     <lb/>
     the seaboard, are regarded by this Conference 
     <lb/>
     as subjects of the highest importance to the 
     <lb/>
     Federated Provinces, and shall be prosecuted 
     <lb/>
     at the earliest possible period that the state 
     <lb/>
     of the finances will permit." Well, sir, we 
     <lb/>
     are told that this last phrase is synonymous 
     <lb/>
     with those unqualified words, "without de<lb break="no"/>lay," that are used as to the Intercolonial. 
     <lb/>
     I am reminded of a saying current in the 
     <lb/>
     days of Lord SYDENHAM, who was a good 
     <lb/>
     deal in the habit of  wanting work done faster 
     <lb/>
     than the workers liked, and of whom it used 
     <lb/>
     to be said that all he ordered had to be done 
     <lb/>
     "immediately, if not sooner." (Hear, hear, 
     <lb/>
     and laughter.)  I take it, the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway is to be done " immediately, if not 
     <lb/>
     sooner," and these other improvements are 
     <lb/>
     to wait till "immediately, if not later." They 
     <lb/>
     are to be prosecuted as soon as the state of 
     <lb/>
     the finances will permit. I know some hon. 
     <lb/>
    gentlemen think that will be very soon, but 
     <lb/>if so, there must be most extraordinary 
     <lb/>means taken to borrow or otherwise raise 
     <lb/>money. (Hear, hear.) Nothing can be 
     <lb/>vaguer than the intimation given as to what 
     <lb/>these works are to be. The communications 
     <lb/>with the Great North-Western territory, 
     <lb/>where are they to begin ; what are they to 
     <lb/>be; and where are they to end ? And the 
     <lb/>other improvements to be carried out—the 
     <lb/>communications with the seaboard—the 
     <lb/>enlargement of the canals—how much en<lb break="no"/>largement, sir, and of how many and what 
     <lb/>canals ? An honorable friend near me says 
     <lb/>canal enlargement is or should be productive. 
     <lb/>No doubt, but at what rate ? I remember 
     <lb/>reading in a Lower Province paper the other 
     <lb/>day of a late speech of Hon. Mr. TILLEY's, 
     <lb/>in which he said that at the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence they went into a calculation of the pro<lb break="no"/>ductive value of the entire outlay of these 
     <lb/>provinces upon productive public works, 
     <lb/>and found them to be yielding an average 
     <lb/>of one and an eighth of one per cent., 
     <lb/>or something like that, of yearly return upon 
     <lb/>their cost. I admit there may be in the 
     <lb/>widening of these canals a something of pro<lb break="no"/>ductiveness ; but to say that it will be anything 
     <lb/>like proportionate to the outlay, is absurd. 
     <lb/>
 
            <cb/>
            
     But what I am coming back to is this—we 
     <lb/>
     are to go at once into the outlay of the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, and we are to go into this 
     <lb/>
     other, too ; but yet, almost beyond the shadow 
     <lb/>
     of a doubt, these canals and other communi<lb break="no"/>cations with the west—which western politi<lb break="no"/>cians think they are to get as their equivalent 
     <lb/>
     —are to be held back a  bit.  I forgot to bring 
     <lb/>
     here an extract from a late speech of Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Tilley's, in which he plainly said that an 
     <lb/>
     immediate carrying on of these western works 
     <lb/>
     did not enter into the calculations of the 
     <lb/>
     Conference, that the Intercolonial was unmis<lb break="no"/>takably to be put through at once ; but that 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Province delegates gave no promise 
     <lb/>
     of the like prosecution of these other works 
     <lb/>
     as the price of that. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>An Hon. MEMBER—Where  do you find 
     <lb/>
     that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—It is quoted in a late 
     <lb/>
     number of the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi>;  and if any<lb break="no"/>one will bring me the fyle of that paper from 
     <lb/>
     below, I will read the words with pleasure.  
     <lb/>
     Now, Mr.  Speaker, I am raising no question 
     <lb/>
     of any one's sincerity upon this question. 
     <lb/>
     The politicians of the eastern provinces, I 
     <lb/>
     have no doubt, are thoroughly in earnest in 
     <lb/>
     their demand for the construction of the  
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial road, and are quite willing to 
     <lb/>
     have the western improvements begun about 
     <lb/>
     as soon as they can be ; and I am quite sure 
     <lb/>
     that the friends of this scheme in the west  
     <lb/>
     want their western works instantly gone on 
     <lb/>
     with. I even believe they both think they 
     <lb/>
     will get what they want ; but I am surprised 
     <lb/>
     at their credulity, for I do not see how they 
     <lb/>
     can. I believe they are deceiving themselves 
     <lb/>
     and their friends with the bright pictures 
     <lb/>
     their fancy has been painting, and that my 
     <lb/>
      western friends, at any rate, are doomed to 
     <lb/>
     some disappointment. Whenever a Federal 
     <lb/>
     Parliament shall meet, I fancy it will become 
     <lb/>
     a question of grave interest whether or not 
     <lb/>
     the state of the finances will admit of the 
     <lb/>
     construction of all these works ; and if not, 
     <lb/>
     then what is to be done first—and how— 
     <lb/>
     and when ? And as I have shown, unless 
     <lb/>
     the six majorities are pretty much agreed, 
     <lb/>
     there will be no great deal done in any 
     <lb/>
     hurry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD2">Hon. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—That is 
     <lb/>
     worse than the double majority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—Yes, three times as 
     <lb/>
     bad, to say the least. Well, suppose the 
     <lb/>
     financiers of the Lower Provinces, having 
     <lb/>
     before their eyes the fear of direct taxation by 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Parliament, should come to the 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="523" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0523.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">523</fw>
         
     conclusion that it will not signify for a few 
     <lb/>
     years, whether these western works are begun 
     <lb/>
     at once or not ; and should propose to sit 
     <lb/>
     down first a little, and count the cost. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD2">Hon. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—Insist on 
     <lb/>having a survey made, for instance, first ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>     Mr. DUNKIN—Well yes, that would 
     <lb/>probably be insisted upon before they would 
     <lb/>consent to commit themselves further to the 
     <lb/>undertaking. Suppose, then, Lower Canada 
     <lb/>to go with the Lower Provinces for staving 
     <lb/>off this commencement of these works, how 
     <lb/>will it fare with Upper Canada's demand for 
     <lb/>them ? And what will not be the indignation 
     <lb/>of the people of Upper Canada at being tied 
     <lb/>to, and controlled by the non-progressive 
     <lb/>people of the east ? Or, suppose that Upper 
     <lb/>and Lower Canada should agree, and the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces be seriously angry, at any 
     <lb/>over-caution eastward, or over-rashness 
     <lb/>westward ; would not they too, so left 
     <lb/>out in the cold, be making things quite 
     <lb/>unpleasant ? Or again, suppose the more 
     <lb/>eastern and the western interests should 
     <lb/>continue to push on both plans, careless of 
     <lb/>cost, and that Lower Canada, for fear of 
     <lb/>direct taxation, should hold back in earnest, 
     <lb/>would that make no trouble ? Is not any 
     <lb/>one of these suppositions more probable 
     <lb/>than the cool assumption, over which western 
     <lb/>gentlemen are so happy, that when the time 
     <lb/>comes all interests will instantly work to<lb break="no"/>gether, and by magic do everything, east and 
     <lb/>west, at once ? But, be this as it may, sir, 
     <lb/>on all three accounts—defences, Intercolonial 
     <lb/>road and western works—we are sure of 
     <lb/>cost, as well as of disputes, in plenty. And 
     <lb/>there is, besides, a fourth. I shall have 
     <lb/>occasion to shew presently that we are going 
     <lb/>to be called upon to spend money for yet 
     <lb/>another kindred purpose, and a large amount 
     <lb/>too—and this, as a part of this scheme. 
     <lb/>Our star of empire is to wing its way west<lb break="no"/>ward ; and we are to confederate everything in 
     <lb/>its track, from Newfoundland to Vancouver's 
     <lb/>Island, this last included. But, between us 
     <lb/>and it, there lies the Hudson Bay territory. 
     <lb/>So, of course, we must acquire that for 
     <lb/>confederation purposes ; and the plan is, 
     <lb/>that before we get it we shall have to pay 
     <lb/>for the elephant—though, after we get him, 
     <lb/>we may find him costly and hard to keep. 
     <lb/>It will not be dificult to prove that this is 
     <lb/>contemplated by the promoters of this scheme. 
     <lb/>Between railways and canals, and western 
     <lb/>extension, before we get the scheme carried 
     <lb/>out in all its contemplated amplitude, we 
     <lb/>shall have bled pretty well, and seen some 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
        
     sights that we have hardly yet learnt to 
     <lb/>
     anticipate. (Hear, hear.) Well, with this 
     <lb/>
     certain prospect before us of a gigantic 
     <lb/>
     outlay, what is the prospect for a gigantic 
     <lb/>
     income ?

            <p>A MEMBER—Oh, never mind that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—I quite understand that 
     <lb/>
     many hon. gentlemen take little thought of 
     <lb/>
     where money is to come from, if only it is to 
     <lb/>
     be spent as they wish. But, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     before I go further, I am handed the fyle of 
     <lb/>
    the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leader</hi>, and, with the leave of 
     <lb/>
     the House, I will read from it the extracts 
     <lb/>
     from Hon. Mr. Tilley's speech to which I 
     <lb/>
     was referring some minutes ago. This jour<lb break="no"/>nal refers to it as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
          Mr.  Tilley, we are sorry to say, does not give 
     <lb/>
     us much hope of the speedy enlargement of our 
     <lb/>
     canals. He laughs at the idea of his opponent 
     <lb/>
     quoting Mr. Brown as authority that this work is 
     <lb/>
     to be undertaken at once. " The Conference," says 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Tilley, "agreed to build the railroad without 
     <lb/>
     delay, the canals as  soon as the state of the finances 
     <lb/>
     will  permit." But he ridicules the idea that the 
     <lb/>
     finances will be held at once to admit of this 
     <lb/>
     being done." Canada," says Mr. Tilley, "could 
     <lb/>
     not have been brought into the union on a promise 
     <lb/>
     to build her canals, for the railroad will cost 
     <lb/>
      $12,000,000, which added to the $22,000,000  
     <lb/>
     for canals, would be an amount far above what 
     <lb/>
     they could have gained them for without Confe<lb break="no"/>deration." 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
         Such is Hon. Mr. Tilley's style of remark, and 
     <lb/>
     I do not think it is at all encouraging to the 
     <lb/>
     very sanguine view of the scheme taken by 
     <lb/>
     some western politicians. It is presumable 
     <lb/>
     that he will take Newfoundland, Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island and Nova Scotia with him, 
     <lb/>
     and along with them he will get much of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. If I should have the honor 
     <lb/>
     of a seat in the House, they may depend 
     <lb/>
     upon it, I shall do what I can to get them 
     <lb/>
     fair play. But I repeat, I do not expect to 
     <lb/>
     see them satisfied with the result. Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, however this may be, there is going to 
     <lb/>
     be, at any rate, an immense amount of money 
     <lb/>
     required, come from whence it may. Where 
     <lb/>
     is it to come from ? We cannot shut our eyes 
     <lb/>
     to the fact, that the customs tariff must come  
     <lb/>
     down. ( Hear.) There are no two ways about 
     <lb/>
     that. Our  tariff is much higher than those 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Provinces ; and the advocates 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation there have to assure people 
     <lb/>
     that their tariffs will not be materially raised, 
     <lb/>
     in order to get any sort of hearing for the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. To tell them that the  tariff of 
     <lb/>
       Canada is to be that of the Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     would be to ruin the chances of getting a 
     <lb/>
     favorable reception for it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">524</fw>
          
     We are marching fast and steadily towards 
     <lb/>
     free trade. We must meet the views of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Lower Provinces, who are hos<lb break="no"/>tile to high  tariffs, and the demand of the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial authorities that we should not tax 
     <lb/>
     their manufactures so heavily as—in their 
     <lb/>
     phrase—almost to deprive them of our mar<lb break="no"/>ket. It was distinctly and officially stated 
     <lb/>
     the other day, in Newfoundland, that assur<lb break="no"/>ance had been given to the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland that the views of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Government are unmistakably in this 
     <lb/>
     direction. And I do not think there is any 
     <lb/>
     mistake about that, either. To shew how 
     <lb/>
     peeple at home, too, expect our tariff to come 
     <lb/>
     down, I may refer to the speech of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hambury Tracy, in seconding the Address 
     <lb/>
     in answer to the Speech from the Throne, in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons the other day. He 
     <lb/>
     could not stop, after saying generally that he 
     <lb/>
     was pleased with this Confederation move<lb break="no"/>ment, without adding that he trusted it would 
     <lb/>
     result in a very considerable decrease in the 
     <lb/>
     absurdly high and hostile tariff at present 
     <lb/>
     prevailing in Canada. I have not here the 
     <lb/>
     exact words, but that was their purport. 
     <lb/>
     Well, if the customs tariff is to come down 
     <lb/>
     largely, we must look for a decrease of 
     <lb/>
     revenue. I am free to admit that a 
     <lb/>
     reduction of the tariff on certain articles, 
     <lb/>
     or even some measure of reduction all 
     <lb/>
     round, might be no material loss, or might 
     <lb/>
     even be a gain, to the revenue— in 
     <lb/>
     ordinary or prosperous times, that is to say. 
     <lb/>
     But when the object of reducing the tariff  
     <lb/>
     is to meet other exigencies than those of 
     <lb/>
     revenue, one can hardly hope to get such a 
     <lb/>
     tariff as shall give us the largest revenue 
     <lb/>
     attainable. And besides, no one can deny 
     <lb/>
     that we are about entering upon a time, 
     <lb/>
     commercially speaking, that may be termed 
     <lb/>
     hard. We have had, for some time past, 
     <lb/>
     pretty heavy importations, and our best in<lb break="no"/>formed and shrewdest commercial men tell 
     <lb/>
     us that we are going to have,  for some time 
     <lb/>
     to come, pretty light importations. We are 
     <lb/>
     not to have a plethoric purse, even under 
     <lb/>
     ordinary drafts upon it, for some years.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">Hon. Mr. HOLTON</persName>—The hard time is  
     <lb/>
     come now.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—Yes, it is come, or is close  
     <lb/>
     on us, and it rather threatens to last. And if, 
     <lb/>
     with this state of things before us, to oblige 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial authorities and the  Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, under pressure of an inevitable state 
     <lb/>
     necessity, we are to reduce our customs 
     <lb/>
     rates, or any number of them, below what I 
     <lb/>
     may call their figure of largest productive<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
      ness, then surely it is little to say that we 
     <lb/>
     cannot look forward to an increase in the 
     <lb/>
     revenue, or even to a continuance of our 
     <lb/>
     present income, and it is rather strange that 
     <lb/>
     we should be called upon, withal, at the  
     <lb/>
     same time so to change our whole system as 
     <lb/>
     to involve ourselves in the enormous extra 
     <lb/>
     vagances here contemplated. No taxing 
     <lb/>
     scheme can ever meet the case. Nothing 
     <lb/>
     can be looked to, but a device of borrowing 
     <lb/>
     without limit—the incurring of an amount 
     <lb/>
     of debt that, in interest and sinking fund, 
     <lb/>
     must prove to be simply unendurable here<lb break="no"/>after. (Hear, hear.) But, in fact, we can<lb break="no"/>not even borrow to any large amount 
     <lb/>
     unless under false pretenses. We cannot 
     <lb/>
     borrow without telling tales of our con<lb break="no"/>dition, resources and expectations, that 
     <lb/>
     will in the end he found out to be lies. 
     <lb/>
     We must awaken hopes in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     money lenders abroad, that cannot but prove 
     <lb/>
     delusive—the memory of which must work 
     <lb/>
     us hereafter an aggravation of punishment 
     <lb/>
     that we shall then scarcely need. And when 
     <lb/>
     that time of reckoning shall have come, then 
     <lb/>
     staggering under the load, without credit at 
     <lb/>
     home or abroad, the country will have to 
     <lb/>
     choose whether it will have heavy direct tax<lb break="no"/>ation—for heavy such taxation then must be 
     <lb/>
     —or have recourse to more or less of re<lb break="no"/>pudiation ; or even run some risk of both. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, if ever that time shall come, the public 
     <lb/>
     men of that day and the people on whom the 
     <lb/>
     burthen will then press, will not bless the 
     <lb/>
     memory of those who held out the false hopes 
     <lb/>
     and inducements under which it is now sought 
     <lb/>
     to decoy us into wild expenditure and crushing 
     <lb/>
     debt. (Hear, hear.) Well, Mr. Speaker,  
     <lb/>
     I now pass to another branch of my subject 
     <lb/>
     altogether. There is a further salient con<lb break="no"/>trast between the American system and the 
     <lb/>
     system proposed for our adoption. The 
     <lb/>
     people of the United States, when they 
     <lb/>
     adopted their Constitution, were one of the  
     <lb/>
     nations of the earth. They formed their 
     <lb/>
     whole system with a view to national ex<lb break="no"/>istence. They had fought for their inde<lb break="no"/>pendence, and had triumphed ; and still in 
     <lb/>
     the flush of their triumph, they were laying 
     <lb/>
     the foundations of a system absolutely na<lb break="no"/>tional. Their Federal Government was to 
     <lb/>
     have its relations with other nations, and was 
     <lb/>
     sure to have plenty to do upon entering the 
     <lb/>
     great family of nations. But we—what are 
     <lb/>
     we doing ? Creating a new nationality, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the advocates of this scheme. I 
     <lb/>
    hardly know whether we are to take the 
     <lb/>phrase for ironical, or not. Is it a reminder 
     <lb/>

            <pb n="525" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0525.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">525</fw>
          
     that in fact we have no sort of nationality 
     <lb/>
     about us, but are unpleasantly cut up into a 
     <lb/>
     lot of struggling nationalities, as between 
     <lb/>
     ourselves ? Unlike the people of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, we are to have no foreign relations to 
     <lb/>
     look after, or national affairs of any kind ; 
     <lb/>
     and therefore our new nationality, if we could 
     <lb/>
     create it, could be nothing but a name. I 
     <lb/>
     must say that according to my view of the 
     <lb/>
     change we ought to aim at, any idea of Fed<lb break="no"/>eration that we may entertain had need take 
     <lb/>
     an Imperial direction. Whenever changing 
     <lb/>
     our institutions, we had need develope and 
     <lb/>
     strengthen—not merely maintain, but main<lb break="no"/>tain, develope and strengthen—the tie, not 
     <lb/>
     yet Federal as it ought to be, between us 
     <lb/>
     and the parent state. (Hear, hear.) It is 
     <lb/>
     the entire Empire that should be federalized, 
     <lb/>
     and cemented together as one, and not any 
     <lb/>
     mere limited number of its dependencies here 
     <lb/>
     or there. A general, or so called federal 
     <lb/>
     government, such as we are here proposing 
     <lb/>
     to create, will most certainly be in a false po<lb break="no"/>sition. As I said just now, the Federal Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the United States was to take its 
     <lb/>
     place in the great family of the nations of the 
     <lb/>
     earth ; but what place in that family are we 
     <lb/>
     to occupy ? Simply none. The Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government will be the head of the Empire as 
     <lb/>
     much as ever, and will alone have to attend 
     <lb/>
     to all foreign relations and national matters ; 
     <lb/>
     while we shall be nothing more than we 
     <lb/>
     are now. Half-a-dozen colonies federated 
     <lb/>
     are but a federated colony after all. In<lb break="no"/>stead of being so many separate provinces 
     <lb/>
     with workable institutions, we are to be one 
     <lb/>
     province most cumbrously organised—nothing 
     <lb/>
     more. How many grades of government are we 
     <lb/>
     going to have under this system ? The Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government, the one great head of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire ; then this Federal Government ; then 
     <lb/>
     our lot of provincial governments ; below them 
     <lb/>
     again, our county municipalities, and, still 
     <lb/>
     below these, our township and other local mu<lb break="no"/>nicipalities. (Hear, hear.) We have thus 
     <lb/>
     five different sets of governmental machinery, 
     <lb/>
     and of these five there is just one too many 
     <lb/>
     in my judgment. You might as well make 
     <lb/>
     six while you are about it, and interpolate be<lb break="no"/>tween our provincial and county governments 
     <lb/>
     a district governmental machinery. If we did 
     <lb/>
     that we should be doing a thing not a whit 
     <lb/>
     more absurd than we propose to do now, in 
     <lb/>
     erecting a new piece of such machinery be<lb break="no"/>tween the Imperial and provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ments. We do not want a third municipal 
     <lb/>
     government, because there is nothing for it to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     do ; and when we propose to create a Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government between the Imperial and Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial, we are equally proposing to create a 
     <lb/>
     something which, having nothing of its own 
     <lb/>
     to do, must find work by encroaching on the 
     <lb/>
     functions of the Imperial and provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernments in turn, with no place among na<lb break="no"/>tions, no relations with other countries, no 
     <lb/>
     foreign policy ; it will stand in just the same 
     <lb/>
     position towards the Imperial Government as 
     <lb/>
     Canada now stands in, or as Upper or Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada before the union used to occupy. 
     <lb/>
     That intermediate work of government which 
     <lb/>
     is now done by the Province of Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     Province of New Brunswick, the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, the Province of Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island and the Province of Newfoundland, is 
     <lb/>
     to be done, part by the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     and part by the provinces. The work is sim<lb break="no"/>ply divided that is now done by the provin<lb break="no"/>cial legislatures and governments, and in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion there is no use in this subdivision of 
     <lb/>
     work at all. You are putting this fifth wheel 
     <lb/>
     to the coach, merely to find out that a misfit<lb break="no"/>ting odd wheel will not serve any useful pur<lb break="no"/>pose, nor so much as work smoothly with the 
     <lb/>
     other four. (Hear, hear.) Your Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government will occupy about as anomalous 
     <lb/>
     a position between the Imperial and provin<lb break="no"/>cial governments as I showed, last night, will 
     <lb/>
     be occupied by your lieutenant governors 
     <lb/>
     between the Federal authority and the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Both will be out of place, and to find 
     <lb/>
     themselves in work they must give trouble. I 
     <lb/>
     do not see how they can do good, but I do 
     <lb/>
     see how they can do any quantity of harm. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The real difficulty in our po<lb break="no"/>sition is one that is not met by the machinery 
     <lb/>
     here proposed. What is that difficulty ? In 
     <lb/>
     the larger provinces of the empire we have 
     <lb/>
     the system of responsible government thor<lb break="no"/>oughly accorded by the Imperial Government, 
     <lb/>
     an thoroughly worked out ; and the difficul<lb break="no"/>ty of the system that is now pressing, or 
     <lb/>
     ought to be, upon the attention of our states<lb break="no"/>men is just this—that the tie connecting us 
     <lb/>
     with the Empire, and which ought to be a 
     <lb/>
     federal tie of the strongest kind, is too slight, 
     <lb/>
     is not, properly speaking, so much as a federal 
     <lb/>
     tie at all. These provinces, with local respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, are too nearly in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of independent communities ; there is not 
     <lb/>
     enough of connection between them and the 
     <lb/>
     parent state to make the relations between 
     <lb/>
     the two work well, or give promise of lasting 
     <lb/>
     long. There is in the machinery too much 
     <lb/>
     of what may be called the centrifugal ten<lb break="no"/>
        
            <pb n="526" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0526.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">526</fw>
         dency. (Hear, hear.) All the great pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are flying off too much, attending too 
     <lb/>
     exclusively to mere local considerations, 
     <lb/>
     too little to those of the general or Imperial 
     <lb/>
     kind. And at home, as we seem to be flying 
     <lb/>
     off, they, too, are thinking of us and of the 
     <lb/>
     interests they and we have in common less 
     <lb/>
     and less. What is wanting, if one is to look 
     <lb/>
     to the interest of the Empire, which is really 
     <lb/>
     that of all its parts— what is wanting, as I 
     <lb/>
     have said, is an effective federalization of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire as a whole, not a subordinate federa<lb break="no"/>tion here or there, made up out of parts of it. 
     <lb/>
     I have neither time nor strength to-night to 
     <lb/>
     go fairly into the question of how this thing 
     <lb/>
     should be done ; but a few words more as to 
     <lb/>
     that, I must be pardoned for. Until latterly 
     <lb/>
     in Canada we have not had, and some colo<lb break="no"/>nies have not now, I believe, a Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Militia. Even we have not as yet, in our 
     <lb/>
     Cabinet, a minister to attend to what may be 
     <lb/>
     called Imperial affairs. It is not the business 
     <lb/>
     of any minister, nor is it even distinctly recog<lb break="no"/>nized as that of the Ministry as a whole, in any 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces, to attend to what is really 
     <lb/>
     at the present juncture the most important part 
     <lb/>
     of our whole public business—the regulation 
     <lb/>
     of affairs between them and the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country. I know it may be said this is in 
     <lb/>
     the hands of the Governor. So are other 
     <lb/>
     things. But for them, we see the need of his 
     <lb/>
     having advisers. And as to this, if a Cabinet 
     <lb/>
     leaves it wholly to him, that practically 
     <lb/>
     amounts to its neglecting these affairs alto<lb break="no"/>gether. Let me go back to a point or two in 
     <lb/>
     the history of affairs in Canada within the re<lb break="no"/>collection of all honorable gentlemen. In 
     <lb/>
     1862, when the then Militia Bill was before the 
     <lb/>
     House, it was asked over and over again by 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen of the Opposition, what communica<lb break="no"/>tions, if any, had been received from the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government in respect of the defence of 
     <lb/>
     this province ; and the answer invariably was, 
     <lb/>
     that there had been none, none known to the 
     <lb/>
     Administration, as an administration. Now, 
     <lb/>
     if there had then been an officer—the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary, the Minister of Militia, or 
     <lb/>
     any other member of the Government— 
     <lb/>
     whose duty it had been and was to attend to 
     <lb/>
     that important branch of the public service ; 
     <lb/>
     if the relations between the Mother Country 
     <lb/>
     and this province had been known to be in his 
     <lb/>
     charge, such an answer as that could never 
     <lb/>
     have been given, nor the second reading of 
     <lb/>
     that bill lost in consequence. The other night, 
     <lb/>
     when the Raid Prevention and Alien Bill was 
     <lb/>
     before the House, we did receive the intima<lb break="no"/>tion that the Mother Country desired legisla<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
        
     tion of that kind at our hands ; and it passed 
     <lb/>
     accordingly. But that intimation was then 
     <lb/>
     given us exceptionally. There is a large 
     <lb/>
     class of questions springing up continually 
     <lb/>
     which affect Imperial interests and Imperial 
     <lb/>
     views as well as our own, and we ought to 
     <lb/>
     have—and if our connection with the Empire 
     <lb/>
     is to last, we must have—this department of 
     <lb/>
     our public affairs attended to by a regularly 
     <lb/>
     appointed Minister of the Crown here, who, 
     <lb/>
     whenever occasion requires, may explain them 
     <lb/>
     and who shall be responsible to this Home. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, nobody denies that the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General is the channel of communication 
     <lb/>
     between us and the Imperial Government. 
     <lb/>
     He is the Queen's representative and servant, 
     <lb/>
     and his communications with the Home Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment must be of the most confidential 
     <lb/>
     character, except in so far he may see fit 
     <lb/>
     to make them known. But fully admitting 
     <lb/>
     this, still besides these communications of 
     <lb/>
     this character which he may, have and indeed 
     <lb/>
     at all times must have unrestrictedly with 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government, there should be 
     <lb/>
     —and, if our Imperial relations are to be 
     <lb/>
     maintained, there must be—a further class of 
     <lb/>
     communications between the two governments, 
     <lb/>
     as to which the Governor should be advised by 
     <lb/>
     a minister whose particular duty it should be 
     <lb/>
     to manage affairs between the Mother Country 
     <lb/>
     and ourselves, and to be in effect a local ad<lb break="no"/>viser, as to such matters, of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     advisers of the Crown in England. In one 
     <lb/>
     word, we have got to develope the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     phase, so to speak, of our provincial system ; 
     <lb/>
     to find the means of keeping our policy and 
     <lb/>
     that of the Mother Country in harmony ; and 
     <lb/>
     if we do not, we cannot long keep up our con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Empire. If this were done— 
     <lb/>
     if we had in our several provincial adminis<lb break="no"/>trations some member charged with this de<lb break="no"/>partment of the public service, as latterly we 
     <lb/>
     have come to have one charged with the cog<lb break="no"/>nate subject of the militia and defence of 
     <lb/>
     the country—if these ministers of Imperial 
     <lb/>
     relations made periodical visits home, so as 
     <lb/>
     there to meet one another and such members 
     <lb/>
     of the Imperial Government or others as the 
     <lb/>
     Crown might charge to meet and confer with 
     <lb/>
     them—if there were thus organised, some sort 
     <lb/>
     of advisory colonial council upon the precedent 
     <lb/>
     (so far, of course, as the analogy might hold) 
     <lb/>
     of the Council for East Indian Affairs lately 
     <lb/>
     created—if, I say, something in this way were 
     <lb/>
     done, then indeed we should be developing 
     <lb/>
     our Imperial relations in the proper direction, 
     <lb/>
     taking at least a step—the first and hardest— 
     <lb/>
     towards the framing of that Imperial feder<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="527" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0527.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">527</fw>
         
     ation of which we so stand in need. But there 
     <lb/>
     is no provision of that kind in the system here 
     <lb/>
    proposed ; there is no apparent contemplation 
     <lb/>of a step of that kind in connection with this 
     <lb/>step. On the contrary, this step is all in the 
     <lb/>wrong direction. We are here proposing to 
     <lb/>create in this part of the Queen's dominions 
     <lb/>a mere sub-federation, so to speak, tending, 
     <lb/>so far as it tends to anything, towards the 
     <lb/>exclusion of this kind of provision. This 
     <lb/>other machinery to which I have been allud<lb break="no"/>ing, Mr. SPEAKER, if we had had it a few 
     <lb/>years ago, would have been of extreme useful<lb break="no"/>ness. Suppose we had had something of that 
     <lb/>kind when the Rebellion Losses Bill was 
     <lb/>passed, when so much excitement was thereby 
     <lb/>created in the country. Suppose that then 
     <lb/>when the indignation of a large class was con<lb break="no"/>centrating itself against Lord ELGIN for his 
     <lb/>supposed purpose of assenting to that bill, he 
     <lb/> could have said—" It is idle for you, as you 
     <lb/>must see, to require me to listen to you against 
     <lb/>the advice of my constitutional advisers ; but 
     <lb/>you know there is a tribunal at home, to 
     <lb/>which you may appeal from that advice, 
     <lb/>where you will be heard and they, and from 
     <lb/>which you may be sure of justice if you have 
     <lb/>been aggrieved or injured here." Sir, if it had 
     <lb/>been possible for the Governor General to have 
     <lb/>given such an answer at that time to the angry 
     <lb/>remonstrances of those who opposed that mea<lb break="no"/>sure, the Parliament House would not have 
     <lb/>been burnt, nor would we have had to deplore 
     <lb/>the long train of consequent disturbances and 
     <lb/>troubles which then and ever since have 
     <lb/>brought so much discredit and mischief to the 
     <lb/>country. Take another case. If such ma<lb break="no"/>chinery had existed when the fishery treaty 
     <lb/>with France was entered into by the Imperial 
     <lb/>Government, conditioned upon the consent of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland, no such anomalous proceeding 
     <lb/>could have taken place. For the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of Newfoundland  and of the rest of these 
     <lb/>provinces would at once have shown the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government that it would not meet ap<lb break="no"/>proval in that colony, nor indeed for that 
     <lb/>matter anywhere else in British America. 
     <lb/>Great Britain would have been saved from en<lb break="no"/>tering into a treaty that—as matters went— 
     <lb/>had to be disallowed, with some discredit to 
     <lb/>the Empire, and some risk of a rupture of 
     <lb/>its friendly relations with a foreign power. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOB1">MR. SCOBLE</persName>—Does not the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons afford that machinery ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—The House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     knows very little, and cares much less, about 
     <lb/>
     our local affairs. (Hear, hear.) I say, if 
     <lb/>
     there had then been a Colonial Council at 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     home, where representatives of the different 
     <lb/>
     provincial administrations might have met 
     <lb/>
     and advised with any of Her Majesty's minis<lb break="no"/>ters, there would have been no difficulty. It 
     <lb/>
     would have disposed of any number of other 
     <lb/>
     questions more satisfactorily than they have  
     <lb/>
     been disposed of. The north-eastern bound<lb break="no"/>ary question with the States, for instance, 
     <lb/>
     would never have been settled in a way so 
     <lb/>
     little accordant with our views and interests ; 
     <lb/>
     and the question of the western boundary 
     <lb/>
     would have been settled sooner and better, also. 
     <lb/>
     Take another illustration. When the diffi<lb break="no"/>culty arose between this country and Eng<lb break="no"/>land about our tariff, when the Sheffield man<lb break="no"/>ufacturers sought to create a feeling at home 
     <lb/>
     against us, because we, mainly to raise re<lb break="no"/>venue, placed duties higher than they liked 
     <lb/>
     on importations of manufactured goods, if 
     <lb/>
     any such machinery had been in operation, no 
     <lb/>
     such wide-spread and mischievous misappre<lb break="no"/>hension as to our acts and purposes could 
     <lb/>
     have arisen, as ever since has been prevalent in 
     <lb/>
     England, and even on the floor of the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons. In fact, I repeat that without 
     <lb/>
     some such system, I do not see how our re<lb break="no"/>lations with the Empire can be maintained 
     <lb/>
     on a satisfactory footing. It is just the want 
     <lb/>
     of it that is leading so many at home now to 
     <lb/>
     think us in a transition state towards separa<lb break="no"/>tion and independence , when, in truth, we 
     <lb/>
     have such need to prove to them that we are 
     <lb/>
     in a transition state towards a something very 
     <lb/>
     different indeed — the precise antipodes of 
     <lb/>
     separation. (Hear, hear.) Sir, I was say<lb break="no"/>ing that in this scheme there is no such con<lb break="no"/>servative tendency as this—nothing indica<lb break="no"/>tive of a set purpose to develope, strengthen 
     <lb/>
     and perpetuate our connection with the Em<lb break="no"/>pire. That end we might indeed better gain 
     <lb/>
     without than with this extra machinery of 
     <lb/>
     local federation ; for disguise it how you may, 
     <lb/>
     the idea that underlies this plan is this, and 
     <lb/>
     nothing else—that we are to create here a 
     <lb/>
     something—kingdom, viceroyalty, or princi<lb break="no"/>pality—something that will soon stand in the 
     <lb/>
     same position towards the British Crown that 
     <lb/>
     Scotland and Ireland stood in before they 
     <lb/>
     were legislatively united with England ; a some<lb break="no"/>thing having no other tie to the Empire than 
     <lb/>
     the one tie of fealty to the British Crown—a 
     <lb/>
     tie which in the cases, first, of Scotland, and 
     <lb/>
     then of Ireland, was found, when the pinch 
     <lb/>
     came, to be no tie at all ; which did not 
     <lb/>
     restrain either Scotland or Ireland from courses 
     <lb/>
     so inconsistent with that of England as to 
     <lb/>
     have made it necessary that their relations 
     <lb/>
     should be radically changed, and a legislative 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="528" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0528.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">528</fw>
           
     union formed in place of a merely nominal 
     <lb/>
     union. Suppose you do create here a kingdom 
     <lb/>
     or a principality, bound to the Empire by this 
     <lb/>
     shadow of a tie, the day of trial cannot be far 
     <lb/>
     distant, when this common fealty will be found 
     <lb/>
     of as little use in our case as it was in theirs ; 
     <lb/>
     when, in consequence, the question will force 
     <lb/>
     itself on the Empire and on us between entire 
     <lb/>
     separation on the one hand, and a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union on the other. But a legislative union of 
     <lb/>
     British America with the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     must be, in the opinion of, one may say, every<lb break="no"/>body at home and here, a sheer utter impos<lb break="no"/>sibility ; and when the question shall come to 
     <lb/>
     be whether we are so to be merged in the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom or are to separate entirely 
     <lb/>
     from it, the answer can only be—"At what<lb break="no"/>ever cost, we separate." Sir, I believe in my 
     <lb/>
     conscience that this step now proposed is one 
     <lb/>
     directly and inevitably tending to that other 
     <lb/>
     step ; and for that reason—even if I believed, 
     <lb/>
     as I do not, that it bid fair to answer ever so 
     <lb/>
     well in the other respects—because I am an 
     <lb/>
     Englishman and hold to the connection with 
     <lb/>
     England, I must be against this scheme. Sup<lb break="no"/>pose now, on the other hand, this scheme 
     <lb/>
     were not to go into operation, there would be 
     <lb/>
     no earthly difficulty in working out, with this 
     <lb/>
     Canada of ours, the other plan I have been 
     <lb/>
     suggesting for the placing of our relations 
     <lb/>
     with the Empire on a better footing. Nor 
     <lb/>
     would there probably be any material difficulty 
     <lb/>
     either in bringing about a legislative union of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces, or in developing a 
     <lb/>
     very near approach to free trade, or indeed 
     <lb/>
     absolute free trade between us and them. I 
     <lb/>
     know there are those who say that this mock 
     <lb/>
     Federal union is necessary in order to our 
     <lb/>
     getting that free trade with those provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, as to that, all I care to say is this, 
     <lb/>
     that for a number of years past we have had 
     <lb/>
     a near approach to free trade with the United 
     <lb/>
     States—a foreign country ; and I imagine we 
     <lb/>
     can have it with the Lower Provinces as well, 
     <lb/>
     without any very great difficulty. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I say again, we had far better hold 
     <lb/>
     firmly to the policy of thus maintaining and 
     <lb/>
     strengthening our union with the parent state, 
     <lb/>
     than let ourselves, under whatever pretext, be 
     <lb/>
     drawn into this other course, which must in<lb break="no"/>evitably lead to our separation from the Em<lb break="no"/>pire. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     there is still another point of view in which 
     <lb/>
     this scheme requires to be considered. The 
     <lb/>
     people of the United States, when they framed 
     <lb/>
     their institutions, were not only starting as a 
     <lb/>
     nation—they were so starting with no dan<lb break="no"/>gerous neighbor-nation near them. If we are 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
        
     to take the step now urged upon us, not only 
     <lb/>
     are we to be something less than a nation, but 
     <lb/>
     we are to be this with a very dangerous 
     <lb/>
     neighbor-nation indeed. In this connection I 
     <lb/>
     may be allowed to read a few words. The 
     <lb/>
     thirtieth resolution says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The General Government and Parliament shall 
     <lb/>
     have all powers necessary or proper for perform<lb break="no"/>ing the obligations of the Federated Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     as part of the British Empire, to foreign coun<lb break="no"/>tries, arising under treaties between Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain and such countries. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     It is quite right that the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should have such powers ; but the very 
     <lb/>
     fact of our having to make a reservation of 
     <lb/>
     this kind, is an unpleasant recognition of 
     <lb/>
     the fact, in itself the reverse of encouraging , 
     <lb/>
     of the all darkening neighborhood of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. It is a most singular thing 
     <lb/>
     that we are required on the one hand to go into 
     <lb/>
     this union on this very account—for downright 
     <lb/>
     dread of the United States—and yet that on the 
     <lb/>
     other, we are as confidently assured of our own 
     <lb/>
     immense resources, are told that we are so 
     <lb/>
     wonderfully great and wonderfully rich, that 
     <lb/>
     we are something like—I don't know whether 
     <lb/>
     we are not—the third or fourth power, or 
     <lb/>
     maritime power, one or other, in the world. 
     <lb/>
     Really, I would not undertake to say how 
     <lb/>
     great we are, or are not, according to honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen. They startle one. I had 
     <lb/>
     no idea how great we were! (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But yet, with all this wonderful magnificence 
     <lb/>
     and greatness, we are told we positively must 
     <lb/>
     not, for very fear of the United States—for 
     <lb/>
     fear of their power—for fear of their hos<lb break="no"/>tility, we must not any longer stay disunited, 
     <lb/>
     but must instantly enter into this so-ealled 
     <lb/>
     union. Just as if either their power or their 
     <lb/>
     hostility towards us—taking that to be their 
     <lb/>
     feeling—would be lessened by our doing so. 
     <lb/>
     Just as if they would not be only the more 
     <lb/>
     jealous of us and hostile to us, for our setting  
     <lb/>
     ourselves up ostentatiously as their rivals. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In this connection, it does 
     <lb/>
     seem to me that we have more than one 
     <lb/>
     question to answer. Many honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men appear to think they have done all that 
     <lb/>
     need be done, when they have answered to 
     <lb/>
     their own satisfaction the one question, 
     <lb/>
     What is the amount of our resources ? 
     <lb/>
     Starting with the vastness of our territory, 
     <lb/>
     they go into all kinds of statements as to 
     <lb/>
     our trade and so forth, multiplying ton<lb break="no"/>nage impossibly, adding together exports and 
     <lb/>
     imports—those of the Intercolonial trade 
     <lb/>
     and all. I only wonder they do not, on the 
     <lb/>
     same principle, calculate our inter-county and 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="529" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0529.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">529</fw>
           
     our inter-township tradings, or our dealings 
     <lb/>
     between cities and county, adding exports 
     <lb/>
     and imports of course all round, and so 
     <lb/>
     proving that we have done more trade than all 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the world put together ; unless, 
     <lb/>
     indeed, they were to count up the trade 
     <lb/>
     of the rest of the world by the same 
     <lb/>
     rule ; and then to be sure they would find out 
     <lb/>
     that, after all, the rest of the world do more 
     <lb/>
     business, are more populous, richer, and 
     <lb/>
     stronger, than we. The question is not sim<lb break="no"/>ply, What are our own resources ? We must 
     <lb/>
     supplement it with a second—What are they 
     <lb/>
     comparatively ? And especially, what are 
     <lb/>
     they as compared with those of the United 
     <lb/>
     States ? And while we are asking this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, we may as well not take it for granted as 
     <lb/>
     a fact, that the larger our country the strong<lb break="no"/>er we must be. Suppose we are to be four 
     <lb/>
     millions of people in a country as large as 
     <lb/>
     Europe or larger. I wish to Heaven we were 
     <lb/>
     four millions of people—with all the adjacent 
     <lb/>
     unexposed territory you will—but in a coun<lb break="no"/>try smaller than England. Why, sir, New 
     <lb/>
     England alone has more population and re<lb break="no"/>sources, all told, than the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada together ; and with her 
     <lb/>
     compactness and advantage of position, she 
     <lb/>
     could alone, presumably, beat both.

     good dog, but Holdfast is a better." Then, 
     <lb/>
     there is the State of New York, which would 
     <lb/>
     certainly be more than a match for Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada—and New York is but one of several 
     <lb/>
     states conterminous with Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Who in his senses, sir, thinks of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces as able, of themselves, to hold 
     <lb/>
     their own against New England, New York 
     <lb/>
     and the rest of the tier of states along our 
     <lb/>
     frontier ? And yet we are talked to as if 
     <lb/>
     Confederation were about to make us the 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     third or fourth power, or maritime power in 
     <lb/>
     the world ! But what I was saying more 
     <lb/>
     particularly was, that too much of territory, 
     <lb/>
     and above all too much of exposed frontier, 
     <lb/>
     does not increase our strength, but lessens 
     <lb/>
     it. Ours is the ' long thin line of red," 
     <lb/>
     which is not so well able to receive a charge 
     <lb/>
     as the solid square.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—That is not the com<lb break="no"/>parison. We are continually hearing of 
     <lb/>
     what Confederation is to do for ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     how it is going to make us a great power in 
     <lb/>
     the world. It is going to do nothing of the 
     <lb/>
     kind. But again—and here is a third ques<lb break="no"/>tion that in this connection we have got to 
     <lb/>
     answer—how is the temper of the United 
     <lb/>
     States going to be affected, on the one hand, 
     <lb/>
     by the policy here urged on us, of what I 
     <lb/>
     may call hostile independent effort—effort 
     <lb/>
     made on our part, with the avowed object of 
     <lb/>
     setting ourselves up as a formidable power 
     <lb/>
     against them ; or on the other hand, by a 
     <lb/>
     policy such as I have been urging, of un<lb break="no"/>obtrusive development of our institutions in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the British Empire ? In 
     <lb/>
     which of the two cases are they likely to be 
     <lb/>
     the more amiable, or, (which is perhaps more 
     <lb/>
     to the point), the less aggressive or practically 
     <lb/>
     unamiable, as our neighbors? Besides, 
     <lb/>
     there comes up still another question. What 
     <lb/>
     is to be the attitude of Great Britain under 
     <lb/>
     either of these two suppositions? As I have 
     <lb/>
     said, the question is, first, as to our own 
     <lb/>
     resources ; next, as to the comparative re<lb break="no"/>sources of the United States ; then, as to 
     <lb/>
     their attitude and temper towards us, upon 
     <lb/>
     one or other of these two suppositions ; then, 
     <lb/>
     as to the attitude and temper of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, in reference to each of these suppo<lb break="no"/>sitions ; and lastly, as to the reaction (so to 
     <lb/>
     speak) upon ourselves, of these respective 
     <lb/>
     attitudes of the two countries in either case. 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">530</fw>
          
     If, sir, we are thinking to give other peeple 
     <lb/>
     the idea, that by uniting ourselves together 
     <lb/>
     in any such way as this, we are going to make 
     <lb/>
     ourselves able to take care of ourselves, we 
     <lb/>
     are merely humbugging ourselves, and try<lb break="no"/>ing to humbug others. The people of the 
     <lb/>
     United States are stronger than we are, and 
     <lb/>
     are known so to be ; and if we are to hold our 
     <lb/>
     own against or beside them, it can only be 
     <lb/>
     by remaining strongly, avowedly, lastingly, 
     <lb/>
     attached to Great Britain. This is the 
     <lb/>
     firm conclusion I have come to ; and I 
     <lb/>
     believe it is the conclusion to which any 
     <lb/>
     one who will give his thoughtful attention 
     <lb/>
     to the subject must come also. And I 
     <lb/>
     must and do protest against the notion 
     <lb/>
     which seems to prevail among the advo<lb break="no"/>cates of this scheme, that somehow or other 
     <lb/>
     it is going so to increase our power, as 
     <lb/>
     to make us a formidable neighbor of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. The danger is, of its making 
     <lb/>
     that peeple more jealous of us and more 
     <lb/>
     hostile towards us than before. And if, 
     <lb/>
     besides that, it is going to give them and 
     <lb/>
     the people of England, or either of them, 
     <lb/>
     the idea that as a result of it we are 
     <lb/>
     to care less for the connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Empire than before—that under it we 
     <lb/>
     are before long to go alone, it is going to 
     <lb/>
     commit us to about the saddest fatal mis<lb break="no"/>take that a people ever made. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, I must apologize for the 
     <lb/>
     length to which I have wearied the House. 
     <lb/>
     (Cries of " Go on !") I have gone through, 
     <lb/>
     as well as I could, the leading points of my 
     <lb/>
     arguments, so far ; and have indicated a 
     <lb/>
     number of points of contrast between this 
     <lb/>
     system and that of the United States. I trust 
     <lb/>
     I have not been too prolix in my attempts to 
     <lb/>
     shew that the Constitution now offered for 
     <lb/>
      our acceptance presents machinery entirely 
     <lb/>
     unlike that of the United States, and entirely 
     <lb/>
     unlike that of the British Empire—that it 
     <lb/>
     is inconsistent with either—that so far from 
     <lb/>
     its proffering to us all the advantages of both 
     <lb/>
     and the disadvantages of neither, it rather 
     <lb/>
     presents to us the disadvantages of both and 
     <lb/>
     the advantages of neither ; that so far from 
     <lb/>
     its tending to improve our relations either 
     <lb/>
     with the Mother Country or with the 
     <lb/>
     United States, it holds out to us very 
     <lb/>
     little prospect indeed for the future, in 
     <lb/>
     either of these respects. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I shall not attempt to review my argument 
     <lb/>
     on these heads, for I do not think that to 
     <lb/>
     anyone at all willing to reflect, what I have 
     <lb/>
     advanced can require to be proved more 
     <lb/>
     fully. If I am not entirely wrong, the only 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     way in which this proposed machinery can 
     <lb/>
     be got to work at all, will be by an aggrega<lb break="no"/>tion, so to speak, in the first Federal Cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     of the leading men of the different existing 
     <lb/>
     provincial administrations.  The attempt 
     <lb/>
     must be made to combine the six majorities, 
     <lb/>
     so as to carry on an administration in har<lb break="no"/>mony with the understood wishes of the six 
     <lb/>
     several provinces, irrespectively of every 
     <lb/>
     consideration of principle, or of sound far<lb break="no"/>seeing policy. I do not see how, although 
     <lb/>
     this thing may be done at starting, it can be 
     <lb/>
     carried on—I was going to say, for any 
     <lb/>
     length of time—I might say, for any time, 
     <lb/>
     long or short, unless by a system of the 
     <lb/>
     most enormous jobbery and corruption. 
     <lb/>
     Whenever any sore spot shall show itself— 
     <lb/>
     and we may rely on it, there will be more 
     <lb/>
     than one such show itself very soon—then 
     <lb/>
     feuds and divisions of the worst sort will 
     <lb/>
     follow, and the machinery will no longer 
     <lb/>
     work. Unfortunately, there are in it none 
     <lb/>
     of those facilities for harmonious workings, 
     <lb/>
     none of those nice adaptations by which 
     <lb/>
     the stronger power is so tempered as 
     <lb/>
     not to fall too harshly on the weaker. 
     <lb/>
     Just so long as the majorities in all the 
     <lb/>
     different provinces work cordially together, 
     <lb/>
     well and good. But they cannot possibly 
     <lb/>
     work harmoniously together long ; and so 
     <lb/>
     soon as they come into collision, there 
     <lb/>
     comes trouble, and with the trouble, the 
     <lb/>
     fabric is at an end. (Hear, hear.) For 
     <lb/>
     myself, I am decidedly of opinion that our 
     <lb/>
     true interest is to hold this machinery 
     <lb/>
     over, to consider it carefully, to see 
     <lb/>
     if something better cannot be devised. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I am sure there can. But 
     <lb/>
     instead of that, we are called upon emphati<lb break="no"/>cally and earnestly at once to throw aside all 
     <lb/>
     considerations to the contrary, and to adopt 
     <lb/>
     the measure ; and we are at the same time 
     <lb/>
     told, in unmistakable language, that we posi<lb break="no"/>tively cannot—must not—shall not—change 
     <lb/>
     a single word of it. Various considerations 
     <lb/>
     are urged upon us for this unseemly haste ; 
     <lb/>
     considerations connected with the attitude 
     <lb/>
     of the United States, with Great Britain, 
     <lb/>
     with the Lower Provinces, and with our own 
     <lb/>
     domestic affairs. With the permission of 
     <lb/>
     the House, I will touch as briefly as I can 
     <lb/>
     on these four classes of considerations, and 
     <lb/>
     then cease longer to weary the House. I 
     <lb/>
     begin, then, with the considerations connected 
     <lb/>
     with the attitude of the United States, which 
     <lb/>
     are urged upon us as reasons why we should 
     <lb/>
     rush into this measure of Confederation. To 
     <lb/>
     some extent I have already incidentally 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="531" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0531.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">531</fw>
     
     touched on these in another connexion ; but 
     <lb/>
     they call for some further notice, and in 
     <lb/>
     giving it them, I will try not to repeat myself. 
     <lb/>
     Judging from much of the language which 
     <lb/>
     we have heard on the floor of this House, one 
     <lb/>
     would suppose we must be on the verge of a 
     <lb/>
     war with the United States. For my part, I 
     <lb/>
     believe nothing of the kind. But if we 
     <lb/>
     were, would it be at all the right thing for 
     <lb/>
     us to abstain from the more pressing ques<lb break="no"/>tions of our defences and the organization of 
     <lb/>
     the militia, and to be instead discussing here 
     <lb/>
     these plans of a Federal Union, Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Constitutions, and I know not what ? These 
     <lb/>
     we are called upon, I admit, to discuss 
     <lb/>
     in a tremendous hurry, to settle off-hand, in 
     <lb/>
     workable or unworkable shape, nobody seem<lb break="no"/>ing to know or to care which, everybody 
     <lb/>
     professing to hope that all will come right 
     <lb/>
     in the end, whether he thinks it will or not. 
     <lb/>
     But, sir, I say again, if war were imminent 
     <lb/>
     with the United States, the one question for 
     <lb/>
     us would be the state of our defences, the 
     <lb/>
     organization of our militia, how much Eng<lb break="no"/>land can do for us, how much we can do for 
     <lb/>
     ourselves, how much England and we, each 
     <lb/>
     of us, are to undertake to do together. That 
     <lb/>
     is not the question at the present time at 
     <lb/>
     all, and I therefore take it that the outcry 
     <lb/>
     raised in connection with this scheme, about 
     <lb/>
     our defences and the militia, is just so much 
     <lb/>
     buncombe. (Hear, hear.) If honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite believed in it, I am cer<lb break="no"/>tain that the pressing question would be 
     <lb/>
     taken up first. Further, if such danger 
     <lb/>
     were not even pretty far  off, I for one 
     <lb/>
     would be disposed to think that the tak<lb break="no"/>ing up now of this other class of ques<lb break="no"/>tions comes a little late in the day. With  
     <lb/>
      any near, real danger of war with the 
     <lb/>
     United States, it would be quite too late 
     <lb/>
     for us to be sitting here, gravely discussing 
     <lb/>
     a political union, to be consummated months 
     <lb/>
     hence, at soonest, and then only to lead to 
     <lb/>
     the construction of railways which will take 
     <lb/>
     years, and defences which cannot be put in 
     <lb/>
     order for months or years,  to future 
     <lb/>
     developments of all kinds, which it will take 
     <lb/>
      years on years to carry out. If war, I say, 
     <lb/>
     is imminent, these ulterior undertakings, 
     <lb/>
     though begun now, would be begun all too 
     <lb/>
     late. Whenever there is such danger, our 
     <lb/>
     defence will not be found in the making of 
     <lb/>
      federal or other constitutions, or in paper 
     <lb/>
      display of any kind, but must be found in 
     <lb/>
       the strong arms and determined courage of 
     <lb/>
     our peeple, responding earnestly to the call 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>

     of the Mother Country, and backed with all 
     <lb/>
     the power she can bring to bear upon the 
     <lb/>
     conflict. Supposing that time come, we 
     <lb/>
     have plenty of governing machinery for 
     <lb/>
     that defence. We do not need, in order 
     <lb/>
     to it, a viceroy and court,  and lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     governors, and all the complicated political 
     <lb/>
     apparatus of this scheme. We could get 
     <lb/>
     along just as well under our present system, 
     <lb/>
     and I think better. Certainly, if modified 
     <lb/>
     as I have indicated it might be—if improved 
     <lb/>
     by the better development of our relations 
     <lb/>
     to the Empire—the system which would 
     <lb/>
     thence result would be as good as that here 
     <lb/>
     offered for our acceptance—indeed, would be 
     <lb/>
     much better. But, sir, the real danger is 
     <lb/>
     not of war with the United States. It is 
     <lb/>
     from what I may call their pacific hostility 
     <lb/>
     —from trouble to be wrought by them within 
     <lb/>
     this  country—trouble to arise out of refusal of 
     <lb/>
     reciprocity—repeal of the bonding system— 
     <lb/>
     custom-house annoyances—passport annoy<lb break="no"/>ances ; from their fomenting difficulties 
     <lb/>
     here, and taking advantage of our local 
     <lb/>
     jealousies ; from the multiplied worries 
     <lb/>
     they may cause us by a judicious alternation 
     <lb/>
     of bullying and coaxing, the thousand inci<lb break="no"/>dents which may easily be made to happen if 
     <lb/>
     things are not going on quite well in this 
     <lb/>
     country, and the people and government of the 
     <lb/>
     States are minded to make us feel the conse<lb break="no"/>quences of our not getting on quite so well as 
     <lb/>
     we might. Whether the union of the States 
     <lb/>
     is restored or not, this kind of thing can go on. 
     <lb/>
     The danger is, that either the whole United 
     <lb/>
     States, or those portions of the United States 
     <lb/>
     which are near us, and which are really stronger 
     <lb/>
     than we are, and enterprising enough and am<lb break="no"/>bitious enough, and not very fond of us, and 
     <lb/>
     not at all fond of the Mother Country, not at 
     <lb/>
     all unwilling to strike a blow at her and to 
     <lb/>
     make us subservient to their own interest and 
     <lb/>
     ambition—the danger is, I say, that the United 
     <lb/>
     States, or those portions of the United States 
     <lb/>
     near us, may avail themselves of every oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to perplex us, to embroil us in trouble, 
     <lb/>
     to make us come within the disturbing in<lb break="no"/>fluences of their strong local attraction.— 
     <lb/>
     Now, to pretend to tell me that the United 
     <lb/>
     States or the Northern States, whichever you 
     <lb/>
     please, are going to be frightened, from a 
     <lb/>
     policy of that kind, by our taking upon our<lb break="no"/>selves great airs, and forming ourselves into a  
     <lb/>
     grand Confederation, is to tell me that their 
     <lb/>
     people are, like the Chinese, a people to be 
     <lb/>
     frightened by loud noises and ugly grimaces. 
     <lb/>
      (Laughter.) I do not believe they are. They 
     <lb/>
    
            <pb n="532" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0532.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">532</fw>
      
     are not to be frightened by any union we can 
     <lb/>
     make here. They have among them politi<lb break="no"/>cians, to say the least, quite as bold, shrewd 
     <lb/>
     and astute as any we have here. The dan<lb break="no"/>ger will just be that of our having agitation 
     <lb/>
     of our own going on here, and internal troubles, 
     <lb/>
     while these annoyances on the part of our 
     <lb/>
     neighbors across the border are being multi<lb break="no"/>plied upon us ; and that England may at the 
     <lb/>
     same time be feeling that the tie between her 
     <lb/>
     and us is more or less relaxed, and that wrong 
     <lb/>
     and humiliation put upon us do not concern 
     <lb/>
     her so much as they would have done when 
     <lb/>
     our connection with her was practically more 
     <lb/>
     intimate. In and before 1840, after the 
     <lb/>
     troubles which had been distracting Canada 
     <lb/>
     were put down, it was declared, and perfectly 
     <lb/>
     well understood, that the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     was simply determined to hold on to the con<lb break="no"/>nection with this country. And the know<lb break="no"/>ledge of that expressed determination gua<lb break="no"/>ranteed us a pretty long term of comparative 
     <lb/>
     feedom from annoyances and trouble of the 
     <lb/>
     kind to which I have been referring. If, 
     <lb/>
     now, a different idea is to prevail—if the no<lb break="no"/>tion is to go abroad that we are, by creating 
     <lb/>
     ourselves into a new nationality, to be some<lb break="no"/>what less connected with the Empire than 
     <lb/>
     these provinces heretofore have been, then I 
     <lb/>
     do apprehend that a very different future is 
     <lb/>
     before us, and that in all sorts of ways, by 
     <lb/>
     vexations of all kinds, by the fomenting of 
     <lb/>
     every trouble within our own borders, whether 
     <lb/>
     originating from abroad, or only reacted on 
     <lb/>
     from abroad, we shall be exposed to dangers 
     <lb/>
     of the most serious kind. And, therefore, so 
     <lb/>
     far from seeing in our relations towards the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States, any reason why we should assume a 
     <lb/>
     position of semi-independence, an attitude of 
     <lb/>
     seeming defiance towards them, I find in them 
     <lb/>
     the strongest reason why, even while regard<lb break="no"/>ing, or affecting to regard them as little as 
     <lb/>
     possible, we should endeavor to make all the 
     <lb/>
     world see that we are trying to strengthen 
     <lb/>
     our union with the Mother Country—that 
     <lb/>
     we care far less about a mere union with 
     <lb/>
     neighboring provinces, which will frighten no 
     <lb/>
     one in the least, but that we are determined to 
     <lb/>
     maintain at all hazards and draw closer, that 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Mother Country which 
     <lb/>
     alone, so long as it lasts, can and will protect 
     <lb/>
     us from all serious aggression. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     But we are told that, on account of a variety 
     <lb/>
    of considerations connected with the state of 
     <lb/>opinion at home, and out of deference to that 
     <lb/>opinion, we must positively carry out this 
     <lb/>scheme. Well, there are two or three ques<lb break="no"/>tions to be answered here. What is that 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     opinion at home ? What is it worth ? And 
     <lb/>
     what sort of lesson does it teach us ? There 
     <lb/>
     are some distinctions which, in my judgment, 
     <lb/>
     must be drawn with reference to this. There 
     <lb/>
     are different phases of opinion prevailing at 
     <lb/>
     home, which must be taken into account. I 
     <lb/>
     have great respect for some home opinions. 
     <lb/>
     Many things they know in England much 
     <lb/>
     better than we do. Some things they do not 
     <lb/>
     know so well. They do not know so much 
     <lb/>
     about ourselves as we do ; and they 
     <lb/>
    do not occupy their minds so much with that 
     <lb/>class of questions which relate merely to our 
     <lb/>interests, as we at any rate ought to do ; and 
     <lb/>on these matters I am not sure that we shall 
     <lb/>act wisely if we yield at once to the first ex<lb break="no"/>pressions of opinion at home. But now, sir, 
     <lb/>what is the opinion at home, or rather, what 
     <lb/>are the opinions entertained at home, with 
     <lb/>reference to this measure ? Of course, I do 
     <lb/>not intend to weary the House with a long 
     <lb/>detailed statement on this subject. But I 
     <lb/>must say this—and I do not think that any 
     <lb/>one who knows anything at all about it will 
     <lb/>contradict what I state—there is at home a 
     <lb/>considerably numerous, and much more loud- 
     <lb break="yes"/>speaking than numerous, class of politicians 
     <lb/>who do not hesitate to say that it is not for 
     <lb/>the interest of England to keep her colonies 
     <lb/>at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOB1">MR. SCOBLE</persName>—Not numerous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DUNK1">MR. DUNKIN</persName>—Well, I think they are ra<lb break="no"/>ther numerous and pretty influential, and they 
     <lb/>
     make a good deal of stir ; and some of them 
     <lb/>
     being in pretty high places, there is danger 
     <lb/>
     that their views may exercise a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     influence upon public opinion at home. There 
     <lb/>
     are many influences at work at home, tending 
     <lb/>
     to the prevalence of the idea that the sooner 
     <lb/>
     the colonies leave the Mother Country, the 
     <lb/>
     better—and especially that the sooner these 
     <lb/>
     colonies leave the Mother Country, the better. 
     <lb/>
     There is a very exaggerated notion at home of 
     <lb/>
     danger to the peace of the Empire from the 
     <lb/>
     maintenance of British supremacy in this part 
     <lb/>
     of the world. That is the fact ; and there is no 
     <lb/>
     use in our shutting our eyes to it. We may 
     <lb/>
     just as well take it, uncomfortable and hard 
     <lb/>
     fact as it may be. If we choose to tell our<lb break="no"/>selves it is not the fact, we are only hum<lb break="no"/>bugging ourselves. (Hear, hear.) That is 
     <lb/>
     one point, as regards public opinion in 
     <lb/>
     England. Another is, as to the appreciation, 
     <lb/>
     at home, of this particular scheme. I take 
     <lb/>
     it, that what we are told on this head by 
     <lb/>
     those who urge this scheme upon us, 
     <lb/>
     about opinion at home, amounts to this 
     <lb/>
     —that at home this scheme is regarded 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="533" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0533.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">533</fw>

     with very great favor, that we are ex<lb break="no"/>pected to adopt it, and that if we do not 
     <lb/>
     adopt it, it will be the better for us with 
     <lb/>
     reference to home public opinion. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     questions for us are: What is the opinion at 
     <lb/>
     home about this scheme ? What is the opin<lb break="no"/>ion entertained in high quarters as to its 
     <lb/>
     goodness or badness ; and if there is an opin<lb break="no"/>ion in favor of the scheme being adopted, 
     <lb/>
     from what considerations does that opinion, to 
     <lb/>
     a great extent, prevail ? I am not going into 
     <lb/>
     these questions minutely, but I must be al<lb break="no"/>lowed to make a remark or two as to the 
     <lb/>
     opinion expressed by Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with regard to this scheme. I have a1<lb break="no"/>ready, to some extent, alluded to the dispatch 
     <lb/>
     of the Colonial Secretary ; but in this con<lb break="no"/>nection, I must allude to it a little further. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is clear from that dis<lb break="no"/>patch that the Colonial Secretary wrote under 
     <lb/>
     these impressions : first of all, he was under 
     <lb/>
     the idea that this scheme had been drawn up 
     <lb/>
     by the representatives of every province, 
     <lb/>
     chosen by the respective governors, without 
     <lb/>
     distinction of party. That was not quite the 
     <lb/>
     case. There were representatives from the 
     <lb/>
     two leading parties in each of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, but it was not so as regarded Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. (Hear, hear.) The Colonial Se<lb break="no"/>cretary was, besides, evidently under the im<lb break="no"/>pression that when these gentlemen came to<lb break="no"/>gether, they gave the matters before them the 
     <lb/>
     most mature deliberation. He says :—" They 
     <lb/>
     have conducted their deliberations with patient 
     <lb/>
      sagacity, and have arrived at unanimous con<lb break="no"/>clusions on questions involving many difficul<lb break="no"/>ties." The " patient sagacity " was exercised 
     <lb/>
     for seventeen or nineteen days, and the " un<lb break="no"/>animous  conclusions " were, after all, certainly 
     <lb/>
    not unanimous. The Secretary goes on to 
     <lb/>say :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         Her Majesty's Government have given to your 
     <lb/>
     despatch and to the resolutions of the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, their most deliberate consideration. They 
     <lb/>
     have regarded them as a whole, and as having 
     <lb/>
     been designed by those who framed them, to 
     <lb/>
      establish as complete and perfect a union of the 
     <lb/>
     whole, into one government, as the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     of the case, and a due consideration of existing 
     <lb/>
      interests would admit. They accept them, there<lb break="no"/>fore, as being in the deliberate judgment of those 
     <lb/>
     best qualified to decide upon the subject, the 
     <lb/>
    best framework of a measure to be passed by 
     <lb/>the Imperial Parliament for attaining that most 
     <lb/>desirable result. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

    
   
            <p>
        Her Majesty's Government thus take for 
     <lb/>
     granted a " deliberate " examination, which 
     <lb/>
    most unquestionably never has been given to 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
       
     this crude project. Now, with all this, with 
     <lb/>
     the impression that men of all parties had 
     <lb/>
     here acted in combination, when in truth they 
     <lb/>
     have done no such thing ; that patient sagac<lb break="no"/>ity had been expended on the framing of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, when in truth there was nothing of 
     <lb/>
     the kind ; that the conclusions were unani<lb break="no"/>mously arrived at, which again was not the 
     <lb/>
     fact ; with all this, Her Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     have only come to the point of giving a very 
     <lb/>
     general, and, as any one who reads the dis<lb break="no"/>patch can see, a very qualified approval of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme. First, an objection is raised as to 
     <lb/>
     the want of accurate determination of the 
     <lb/>
     limits between the authority of the Central 
     <lb/>
     and that of the local legislatures. I will not 
     <lb/>
     read the words, as I read them last night, but 
     <lb/>
     no one can read the dispatch without seeing 
     <lb/>
     that the language of the Colonial Secretary on 
     <lb/>
     that point is the language of diplomatic disap<lb break="no"/>proval. (Hear, hear.) Though he gives a gen<lb break="no"/>eral approval, he criticises and evidently does 
     <lb/>
     not approve. He sees an intention, but calls 
     <lb/>
     attention to the fact that that intention is not 
     <lb/>
     clearly and explicitly expressed. He then 
     <lb/>
     goes on and makes another objection—the 
     <lb/>
     financial. His language is this :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         Her Majesty's Government cannot but express 
     <lb/>
     the earnest hope, that the arrangements which 
     <lb/>
     may be adopted in this respect may not be of 
     <lb/>
     such a nature as to increase—at least in any con<lb break="no"/>siderable degree—the whole expenditure, or to 
     <lb/>
     make any material addition to the taxation, and 
     <lb/>
     thereby retard the internal industry, or tend to 
     <lb/>
     impose new burdens on the commerce of the 
     <lb/>
    country. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     The hope that it will not be is the diplomatic 
     <lb/>
     way of hinting a fear that it may be. When 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's Government is driven  to 
     <lb/>
     "hope" that these arrangements will not in<lb break="no"/>crease in any considerable degree the whole 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, or make any material addition 
     <lb/>
     to taxation, and thereby retard internal indus<lb break="no"/>try, or tend to impose new burdens on the 
     <lb/>
     commerce of the country, it is perfectly clear 
     <lb/>
     that they see that in the scheme which makes 
     <lb/>
     them tolerably sure it will. And then we 
     <lb/>
     have a third objection :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         Her Majesty's Government are anxious to lose 
     <lb/>
     no time in conveying to you their general ap<lb break="no"/>proval of the proceedings of the Conference. 
     <lb/>
     There are, however, two provisions of great im<lb break="no"/>portance which seem to require revision. The 
     <lb/>
     first of these is the provision contained in the 
     <lb/>
      44th resolution, with respect to the exercise of 
     <lb/>
    the prerogative of pardon.  
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is emphatically declared to be entirely 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="534" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0534.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">534</fw>
           
     wrong. And then comes the fourth objection : 
     <lb/>
     "The second point which Her Majesty's Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment desire should be reconsidered"—and 
     <lb/>
     this phrase is positively, so far as words can 
     <lb/>
     give it, a command on the part of Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government that it shall be recon<lb break="no"/>sidered :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The second point which Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment desire should be reconsidered is the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the Legislative Council. They appre<lb break="no"/>ciate the considerations which have influenced the 
     <lb/>
     Conference in determining the mode in which 
     <lb/>
     this body, so important to the constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, should be composed. But it appears 
     <lb/>
     to them to require further consideration whether, 
     <lb/>
     if the members be appointed for life, and their 
     <lb/>
     number be fixed, there will be any sufficient 
     <lb/>
     means of restoring harmony between the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council and the popular Assembly, if it 
     <lb/>
     shall ever unfortunately happen that a decided 
     <lb/>
     difference of opinion shall arise between them. 
     <lb/>
     These two points, relating to the prerogative of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown and the Constitution of the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Chamber have appeared to require distinct and 
     <lb/>
     separate notice.

            <p>
     Is not that a pretty emphatic dissent ? 
     <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Questions of minor consequence and matters of 
     <lb/>
     detailed arrangement may properly be reserved 
     <lb/>
     for a future time, when the provisions of the bill

            <p>
     So, sir, there are more objections still which 
     <lb/>
     the Colonial Secretary has not stated. He 
     <lb/>
     gives a general sanction, but specifies four 
     <lb/>
     matters, two of which he distinctly says must 
     <lb/>
     be altered, and the other two he does not ap<lb break="no"/>prove of, and he says that other matters— 
     <lb/>
     too numerous, I suppose, to specify—must be 
     <lb/>
     reserved for remark at a future time. Well, 
     <lb/>
     just at the time that this despatch made its 
     <lb/>
     appearance, there was an article in the London 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, a passage from which I will read in 
     <lb/>this connection, though it may seem to bear 
     <lb/>on a somewhat different branch of the question 
      <lb/>from that with which I am just more parti<lb break="no"/>cularly dealing. The London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, referring 
     <lb/>to this despatch, makes use of these expres<lb break="no"/>sions, and I beg the attention of the House to 
     <lb/>them, because they give the key-note of a 
     <lb/>great deal of the public opinion at home with 
     <lb/>reference to this matter :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     It is true we are not actually giving up the 
     <lb/>
     American colonies,—nay, the despatch we are 
     <lb/>
     quoting does not contain the slightest hint that 
     <lb/>
     such a possibility ever crossed the mind of the 
     <lb/>
     writer ; but yet it is perfectly evident—and there 
     <lb/>
     is no use in concealing the fact—that the Con<lb break="no"/>federation movement considerably diminishes the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty which would be felt by the colonies in 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     separating from the Mother Country. Even now

     state formidable from the numbers of its hardy 
     <lb/>
     and energetic population, and capable, if so 
     <lb/>
     united, of vigorously defending the territories it 
     <lb/>
     possesses. A few years will add greatly to that 
     <lb/>
     population, and place Canada, Hochelaga, 
     <lb/>
     Acadia, or by whatever other name the Con<lb break="no"/>federacy may think fit to call itself, quite out of the 
     <lb/>
     reach of invasion or conquest. Such a state would 
     <lb/>
     not only be strong against the Mother Country 
     <lb/>
     under the impossible supposition of our seeking to 
     <lb/>
     coerce it by force, but it might be separated from 
     <lb/>
     us without incurring the disgrace of leaving a 
     <lb/>
     small and helpless community at the mercy of 
     <lb/>
     powerful and warlike neighbors.

     Here, then, is the somewhat less diplomatic 
     <lb/>
     utterance of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, on the occasion of the 
     <lb/>
     appearance of this despatch. It is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     true that no hint was given officially, when 
     <lb/>
     this scheme was sent home, that it contem<lb break="no"/>plated separation. Perfectly true, that in the 
     <lb/>
     answer there is no hint that separation is con<lb break="no"/>templated. But it is perfectly true, also, that 
     <lb/>
     the leading journal instantly sees in it, and 
     <lb/>
     seizes at, the possibility-first, of its greatly 
     <lb/>
     facilitating our going—and, secondly, of its 
     <lb/>
     greatly facilitating, on the part of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, the letting of us go. I shall come 
     <lb/>
     back to this branch of the subject presently, 
     <lb/>
     after I shall have quoted from a much more 
     <lb/>
     important expression of public opinion than 
     <lb/>
     any article in the Times. Meantime, I must 
     <lb/>
     refer to the language of Her Majesty's Speech 
     <lb/>
     from the Throne. It has been read during 
     <lb/>
     this debate already, and has been read as if 
     <lb/>
     it contained the most emphatic approval 
     <lb/>
     possible of this whole scheme—so emphatic 
     <lb/>
     an approval, that even to assume to discuss it 
     <lb/>
     now would seem to amount almost to treason. 
     <lb/>
     This language, of course, it is needless to say, 
     <lb/>
     is that of Her Majesty's Imperial advisers, 
     <lb/>
     and is to be read in connection with what 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's Government have said about 
     <lb/>
     this plan in the Colonial Secretary's des<lb break="no"/>patch—that before it is passed into an 
     <lb/>
     enactment, it will require a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     revision. We may be told here that the 
     <lb/>
     document before us is a treaty, on which not 
     <lb/>
     a line or letter of amendment can be made 
     <lb/>
     by us. But Her Majesty's Government 
     <lb/>
     clearly understand that they are not bound 
     <lb/>
     by it, and that they are to alter it as much 
     <lb/>
     as they please. They won't give the pardon<lb break="no"/>ing power to these lieutenant governors ; they 
     <lb/>
     won't constitute the Legislative Council in 
     <lb/>
     this way ; they won't look with indifference 
     <lb/>
     to the incurring of unheard-of expenses, and 
     <lb/>
     the hampering of commerce which they 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="535" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0535.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">535</fw>
            
     consider to be implied in this scheme. No, 
     <lb/>
     they are to look into this thing, to look into 
     <lb/>
     the details of what they evidently think to 
     <lb/>
     be a pretty crude scheme ; while we, who 
     <lb/>
     are most interested, are required by our 
     <lb/>
     local rulers not to look into it at all, but 
     <lb/>
     just to accept it at their hands as a 
     <lb/>
     whole. The language addressed from 
     <lb/>
     the Throne to the Imperial Parliament 
     <lb/>
     is this : " Her Majesty has had great satis<lb break="no"/>faction in giving Her sanction "—to what ? 
     <lb/>
     —"to the meeting of a conference of dele<lb break="no"/>gates from the several North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, who, on invitation from Her 
     <lb/>
      Majesty's Governor General, assembled at 
     <lb/>
     Québec." Certainly ; we knew that before ; 
     <lb/>
     they assembled without Her Majesty's sanc<lb break="no"/>tion, but they got her sanction afterwards to 
     <lb/>
     their having so assembled. " These dele<lb break="no"/>gates adopted resolutions having for their 
     <lb/>
     object a closer union of those provinces 
     <lb/>
     under a central government. If those reso<lb break="no"/>lutions shall be approved by the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislatures, a bill will be laid before you for 
     <lb/>
     carrying this important measure into effect" 
     <lb/>
     —not for giving full effect to the details of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, but for carrying the measure— 
     <lb/>
     the closer union—in the shape the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Government may give it, into effect. That 
     <lb/>
     is all. (Hear, hear.) Take this along with 
     <lb/>
     the despatch of the Colonial Secretary. If 
     <lb/>
     it is a declaration that this thing is a treaty, 
     <lb/>
     which may not be amended by us without 
     <lb/>
     flying in the face of Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I do not understand the meaning of 
     <lb/>
     words. (Hear, hear.) In connection with 
     <lb/>
     the Speech from the Throne, we had, the 
     <lb/>
     other night, some notice taken, on the floor 
     <lb/>
     of this House, of language used in discuss<lb break="no"/>ing the address in the Imperial Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     Lords Claremont, Houghton, Granville 
     <lb/>
     and Derby had something to say in respect 
     <lb/>
     of this scheme in the House of Lords ; as 
     <lb/>
     also, Mr. Hanbury Tracy in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons. I do not attach great weight to 
     <lb/>
     what was there said, because there really 
     <lb/>
     was little said any way, and that little could 
     <lb/>
     not indicate any great amount of knowledge 
     <lb/>
     upon the subject treated. However, I will 
     <lb/>
     quote first what the mover of the address, 
     <lb/>
     the Earl of Claremont, said. After refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the war in New Zealand, he went 
     <lb/>on :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         My Lords, although these operations in India, 
     <lb/>
     New Zealand, and Japan, are matters of more or 
     <lb/>
     less interest or concern to the nation, and, as 
     <lb/>
      such, are fully deserving of notice, yet they are 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     small in comparison to the importance of the 
     <lb/>
     probable change in the constitution of our North 
     <lb/>
     American Colonies. Since the declaration of 
     <lb/>
      independence by the colonies, since known as 
     <lb/>
     the United States of America, so great a scheme 
     <lb/>
     of self-government, or one shadowing forth 
     <lb/>
     so many similar and possible changes, has not 
     <lb/>
     occurred. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Now, I cannot read this sentence with<lb break="no"/>out asking what analogy there is between 
     <lb/>
     this project and the declaration of inde<lb break="no"/>pendence. Why should these resolutions 
     <lb/>
     suggest to any one's mind the declara<lb break="no"/>tion of independence ? Did the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who signed these resolutions in order to 
     <lb/>
     authenticate them—pledge their lives and 
     <lb/>
     fortunes, and I don't know what besides, to 
     <lb/>
     anything, or risk anything, by appending 
     <lb/>
     their signatures to the document? Was it a 
     <lb/>
     great exercise of political heroism? Why, 
     <lb/>
     the men who signed the declaration of 
     <lb/>
     independence qualified themselves in the 
     <lb/>
     eyes of the Imperial Government for the 
     <lb/>
     pleasant operations of heading and hanging. 
     <lb/>
     They knew what they were about. They 
     <lb/>
     were issuing a rebel declaration of war. But 
     <lb/>
     this is a piece of machinery, on the face of it 
     <lb/>
     at least, to perpetuate our connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country ! Why then does it suggest 
     <lb/>
     the idea that so great a scheme of self-gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, or one shadowing forth so many 
     <lb/>
     similar and possible changes, " hardly ever 
     <lb/>
     before occurred ?" It is because there is, 
     <lb/>
     underlying the speaker's thought, just that 
     <lb/>
     idea of the anti-colonial school in England, 
     <lb/>
     that we are going to slip away from our con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Mother Country ; and in this 
     <lb/>
     respect, therefore, it seems to him that it is like 
     <lb/>
     the declaration of independence. The re<lb break="no"/>maining sentence indicates a curious misap<lb break="no"/>prehension as to the present posture of this 
     <lb/>
     question. " If the delegates of these several 
     <lb/>
     colonies finally agree to the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     framed by their committee, and if these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions be approved by the several legis<lb break="no"/>latures of the several colonies, Parliament 
     <lb/>
     will be asked to consider and complete this 
     <lb/>
     federation of our Northern American pos<lb break="no"/>sessions." The noble lord, the mover of the 
     <lb/>
     Address, seems to take the resolutions for a 
     <lb/>
     mere report of a committee which (on their 
     <lb/>
     way here) had yet to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the delegates ! Next, I turn 
     <lb/>
     to the language of Lord Houghton, the 
     <lb/>
     seconder of the Address ; and from his lips 
     <lb/>
     too, we have an almost distinct utterance of 
     <lb/>
     the idea of our coming independence. He 
     <lb/>
     says :—

         That impulse which inclines small states to bind 
     <lb/>
     themselves together for the purpose of mutual 
     <lb/>
     protection and for the dignity of empire, has 
     <lb/>
     shewn itself in two remarkable examples, of 
     <lb/>
     which I may be permitted to say a few words. In 
     <lb/>
     Europe it has manifested itself in the case of 
     <lb/>
     Italy, which is not, indeed, alluded to in any part 
     <lb/>
     of Her Majesty's speech, because it is an accom<lb break="no"/>plished fact of European history. A convention 
     <lb/> has lately taken place between the Emperor of 
     <lb/>the French and the King of Italy, in which Eng<lb break="no"/>land can take no other interest than to hope that 
     <lb/>it may redound to the prosperity of the one and 
     <lb/>the honor of the other. At any rate, one great 
     <lb/>advantage has been accomplished. With his 
     <lb/>capital in the centre of Italy it is no longer pos<lb break="no"/>sible to talk of Victor Emmanuel as King of 
     <lb/>Piedmont. He is King of Italy, or nothing. On 
     <lb/>the other side of the Atlantic the same impulse- 
     <lb break="yes"/>[that same impulse, which, in the case of Italy, 
     <lb/>the speaker characterizes as aiming at the 
     <lb/>dignity of empire]—the same impulse had man<lb break="no"/>ifested itself in the proposed amalgamation of 
     <lb/>the northern provinces of British America. I 
     <lb/>heartily concur in all—[the all being as we 
     <lb/>have just seen, not much]—that has been 
     <lb/>said by my noble friend the mover of this ad<lb break="no"/>dress in his laudation of that project. It is, 
     <lb/>my lords, a most interesting contemplation 
     <lb/>that that project has arisen, and has been 
     <lb/>approved by Her Majesty's Government. It is 
     <lb/>certainly contrary to what might be considered 
     <lb/>the old maxims of government in connection 
     <lb/>with the colonies, that we should here express 
     <lb/>—and that the Crown itself should express- 
     <lb break="yes"/>satisfaction at a measure which tends to bind 
     <lb/>together, in almost independent power, our colo<lb break="no"/>nies in North America. We do still believe that 
     <lb/>though thus banded together, they will recognize 
     <lb/>the value of British connection, and that while 
     <lb/>they will be safer in this amalgamation, we shall 
     <lb/>be as safe in their fealty. The measure will no 
     <lb/>doubt, my lords, require much prudent considera<lb break="no"/>tion and great attention to provincial suscepti<lb break="no"/>bilities.

     I repeat, Mr. Speaker, there is in this

      quotation a second pretty-plainly-expressed 
     <lb/>
     anticipation of our nearly approaching inde<lb break="no"/>pendence. We are supposed, by one of 
     <lb/>
     these noble lords, to be taking a step analo<lb break="no"/>gous to that taken by the authors of the 
     <lb/>
     Declaration of Independence ; and by the

     other, to be moved by the same impulse of

     empire that has been leading to the estab<lb break="no"/>lishment of the Kingdom of Italy.

     is a case of want of correct information,

     and not the only one of its kind. And now, 
     <lb/>
     sir, for Lord Derby's remarks, which also 
     <lb/>
     have been quoted here. Certainly, they are 
     <lb/>
     in a  different, and to my mind a more satis<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     factory, tone ; but they are suggestive, for all 
     <lb/>
     that, of an idea that is unwelcome. After 
     <lb/>
     remarking on certain passages indicative, in 
     <lb/>
     his view, of unfriendly feeling on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the United States towards Great Britain and 
     <lb/>
     towards us—their threatened abrogation of 
     <lb/>
     the reciprocity treaty, arming on the lakes, 
     <lb/>
     and so forth—Lord Derby says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         Under these circumstances I see with additional 
     <lb/>
    satisfaction—[Meaning of, course, though cour<lb break="no"/>tesy may have disallowed the phrase, "less dis<lb break="no"/>satisfaction," for he certainly did not see those 
     <lb/>other matters with any satisfaction at all]— 
     <lb/>I see with additional satisfaction the announce<lb break="no"/>ment of a contemplated  important step. I mean the 
     <lb/>proposed Federation of the British American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. (Hear, hear.) I hope I may regard that 
     <lb/>Federation as a measure tending to constitute a 
     <lb/>power strong enough, with the aid of this country, 
     <lb/>which I trust may never be withdrawn from those 
     <lb/>provinces, to acquire an importance which, 
     <lb/>separately, they could not obtain. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>If I saw in this Federation a desire to separate 
     <lb/>from this country, I should think it a matter of 
     <lb/>much more doubtful policy and advantage ; but 
     <lb/>I perceive with satisfaction, that no such wish is 
     <lb/>entertained. Perhaps it is premature to discuss, 
     <lb/>at present, resolutions not yet submitted to the 
     <lb/>different provincial legislatures, but I hope I see 
     <lb/>in the terms of that Federation an earnest desire 
     <lb/>on the part of the provinces to maintain for 
     <lb/>themselves the blessing of the connection with 
     <lb/>this country, and a determined and deliberate 
     <lb/>preference for monarchical over republican insti<lb break="no"/>tutions.

            <p>(Hear, hear.) Now, what I have to say is 
     <lb/>this, that while I think no man ought to find

     <lb/>they are yet the utterances of a statesman  
     <lb/>who betrays in those utterances at least, as 
     <lb/>they sound to me, a certain amount of 
     <lb/>scarcely-concealed apprehension. When a 
     <lb/>man in the position of Lord Derby, master 
     <lb/>of the whole art of expression, speaks at once 
     <lb/>so hypothetically and so guardedly, falls back

     <lb/>never be," "<hi rendition="simple:italic">I hope</hi> I see," and so forth, one 
     <lb/>feels that there is an under-current of 
     <lb/>thought, not half concealed by such expres<lb break="no"/>sions, to the effect that there is too much 
      <lb/>danger of the very things <hi rendition="simple:italic">so hoped</hi> and

     scheme towards separation, his hope and trust 
     <lb/>
     to the contrary, would either have been 
     <lb/>
     unuttered, or would have been uttered in 
     <lb/>
     another tone. I am well enough satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that Lord DERBY himself has not the most 
     <lb/>
     remote idea of falling in with the views of 
     <lb/>
     the  so-called colonial reformers in England, 
     <lb/>
     who desire to see the colonies pay for every 
     <lb/>
     thing or be cast off ; but he knows the hold 
     <lb/>
     that their views have gained at home, and he 
     <lb/>
     speaks accordingly. And there is no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     sir, that this feeling has been got up in Eng<lb break="no"/>land to an extent very much to be regretted. 
     <lb/>
     In this connection I have yet to notice some 
     <lb/>
     passages—and I shall deal with them as 
     <lb/>
     briefly as I can—from the very important 
     <lb/>
     article I quoted last night, which is contained 
     <lb/>
     in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> for January, and 
     <lb/>
     which, I am sorry to say, expresses this feel<lb break="no"/>ing in the strongest possible form. But 
     <lb/>
     before citing them, I am bound to say that I 
     <lb/>
     by no means believe the views they express 
     <lb/>
     are universally or even generally entertained 
     <lb/>
     at home. I do believe, though, that they are 
     <lb/>
     entertained by many, and that there is much 
     <lb/>
     danger of their doing a vast deal of mischief. 
     <lb/>
     That they are loudly avowed, does not admit 
     <lb/>
     of doubt ; and when we find them set forth 
     <lb/>
     in the pages of so influential an organ of 
     <lb/>
     opinion as the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, the case 
     <lb/>
     assumes a very serious aspect. There are 
     <lb/>
     other passages in the article to the same 
     <lb/>
      effect as those I am about to read, and which 
     <lb/>
     might, perhaps, be quoted with advantage, 
     <lb/>
     did time allow. Well,  here is one occurring 
     <lb/>
     early in the article :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         There are problems of colonial policy the solu<lb break="no"/>tion of which cannot, without peril, be indefinitely 
     <lb/>
     delayed; and though Imperial England is doing 
     <lb/>
     her  best to keep up  appearances in the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of her five an forty dependencies, the 
     <lb/>
     political links which once bound them to each

     other and to their common centre are evidently 
     <lb/>
     worn out. Misgivings haunt the public mind as 
     <lb/>
     to the stability of an edifice which seems to be 
     <lb/>
     founded on a reciprocity of deception, and 
     <lb/>
     only to be shored up for the time by obsolete 
     <lb/>
     an meaningless traditions.

            <p>
     When an utterance like this finds its way 
     <lb/>
     into the pages of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>,  a 
     <lb/>
     review which more than almost any other 
     <lb/>
     may be held to speak in the name of a large 
     <lb/>
      class of the ablest  statesmen of England, we 
     <lb/>
      have reason to ask what it is all tending to. 
     <lb/>
     I never in my life felt more pain in reading 
     <lb/>
      anything political, than I felt in reading 
     <lb/>
      this article ; and I never discharged a more

      painful duty than  I am endeavoring to dis<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     charge at this moment, in commenting on 
     <lb/>
     it. But truth is truth, and must be told. 
     <lb/>
     A little farther on, the same writer pro<lb break="no"/>ceeds :—

         It is not unnatural that the desire to maintain 
     <lb/>
     a connection with the power and wealth of the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country should be stronger on the side of 
     <lb/>
     the colonies than it is on that of the British public, 
     <lb/>
     for they owe almost ever thing to us, and we 
     <lb/>
     receive but little from them. Moreover, the 
     <lb/>
     existing system of colonial  government enables 
     <lb/>
     them to combine all the advantages of local in<lb break="no"/>dependence with the strength and dignity of 
     <lb/>
     a great empire. But the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     in the meantime has to decide, not as of old, 
     <lb/>
     whether Great Britain is to tax the colonies, 
     <lb/>
     but to what extent the colonies are to be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to tax Great Britain—a question which

         It is scarcely surprising that any project which 
     <lb/>
     may offer a prospect of escape from a political  
     <lb/>

     But one meaning can be put upon all this. 
     <lb/>
     In the opinion of the writer, England does 
     <lb/>
     not believe that these provinces are worth 
     <lb/>
     anything to her, while the connection with 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country is worth all to us ; and

     she would hail with satisfaction any way of

     escape from the obligations and dangers

     that we are said to cast upon her. I go on 
     <lb/>
     a little further, and I find what are his

        A very important question, on which these 
     <lb/>
     papers afford no information, is that relating to 
     <lb/>
     the future condition of those territories and de<lb break="no"/>pendencies of the Crown in North America, which 
     <lb/>
     are not included within the present boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     the five provinces. We allude more particularly 
     <lb/>
     to the territories now held by the Hudson's Bay 
     <lb/>
     Company, under the Crown, by charter or lease. 
     <lb/>
     The Crown is doubtless bound to take care that

     the interest of its grantees—[it never seems to

     <lb/>

     this territory which this writer has been

        Probably,  the best and most equitable solution

     would be the cession of the whole region to the

        The result of these proposals, if carried into

     effect, would be the creation of a new state in 
     <lb/>
     North America, still retaining the name of a 
     <lb/>
     British dependency,  comprising an area about 
     <lb/>
     equal to  that of Europe, a population of about 
     <lb/>
     four millions, with an aggregate revenue in ster<lb break="no"/>ling of about two millions and a half, and carrying 
     <lb/>
     on a trade (including exports, imports and inter<lb break="no"/>colonial commerce) of about twenty-eight

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
          What we have to fear, and if possible to guard 
     <lb/>
     against, is the constant peril of a three-fold con<lb break="no"/>flict of  authority implied in the very existence of 
     <lb/>
     a federation of dependencies retaining, as now 
     <lb/>
     proposed, any considerable share of intercolonial

     independence.

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Rather a suggestive hint, and which, further 
     <lb/>
     on, is expanded and emphasized thus :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         If, as has been alleged, a legislative union is 
     <lb/>
     unattainable, because inconsistent with due secu<lb break="no"/>rities for the rights guaranteed to the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, by treaty or by the Quebec Act, and 
     <lb/>
     Federation is therefore the only alternative, the 
     <lb/>
     vital question for the framers of this Constitution 
     <lb/>
     is how the inherent weakness of all federations 
     <lb/>
     can in this instance be cured, and the Central 
     <lb/>
     Government armed with a sovereignty which may 
     <lb/>
     be worthy of the name. It is the essence of all 
     <lb/>
     good governments to have somewhere a true 
     <lb/>
     sovereign power. A sovereignty which ever 
     <lb/>
     eludes your grasp, which has no local habitation, 
     <lb/>
     provincial or imperial, is in fact no government 
     <lb/>
     at all. Sooner or later the shadow of authority 
     <lb/>
     which is reflected from an unsubstantial political 
     <lb/>
     idea must cease to have power among men. It 
     <lb/>
     has been assumed by those who take a sanguine 
     <lb/>
     view of this political experiment, that its authors 
     <lb/>
     have  steered clear of the rock on which the 
     <lb/>
      Washington Confederacy has split. But if the 
     <lb/>
     weakness of the Central Government is the rock 
     <lb/>
     alluded to, we fear that unless in clear water and 
     <lb/>
     smooth seas, the pilot who is to steer this new 
     <lb/>
     craft will need a more perfect chart than the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions of the Quebec Conference afford, to 
     <lb/>
      secure him against the risks of navigation.

     So far, then, according to the writer of this 
     <lb/>
     article, we have three points settled. He 
     <lb/>
     considers, and those for whom he writes and 
     <lb/>
     speaks consider, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>  
     <lb/>
     makes known that it considers—first, that the 
     <lb/>
     retention of these colonies is so manifestly dis<lb break="no"/>advantageous to the parent state, that it would 
     <lb/>
      puzzle any statesman to find any reason for 
     <lb/>
     keeping us ; next, that a result of this mea<lb break="no"/>sure is to be the early carrying through by 
     <lb/>
     us of undertakings too vast now for England 
     <lb/>
     not to shrink from ; and thirdly, that the 
     <lb/>
     measure itself, viewed as a machinery of 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     government for ourselves, is not going to 
     <lb/>
     work well. There is still a fourth point. 
     <lb/>
     The measure embodies a proffer of fealty to 
     <lb/>
     the British Crown—and with no hint but 
     <lb/>
     that such fealty, and the correlative duty of 
     <lb/>
     protection, are meant both of them to be 
     <lb/>
     perpetual. How does our writer treat of 
     <lb/>
     this ? He says :—

         If the Quebec project were to be regarded as in

     <lb/>

     (Hear, hear.)  Well. Mr. Speaker, I can 
     <lb/>
     only say that if these are the opinions 
     <lb/>
     which honorable gentlemen opposite are 
     <lb/>
     disposed to " hear, hear" approvingly, they 
     <lb/>
     are not mine. I find in them an unmis<lb break="no"/>takable proof that there is an important 
     <lb/>
     party at home who take up this measure, 
     <lb/>
     and hope to see it carried through with the 
     <lb/>
     mere view to its being a step to absolute 
     <lb/>
     independence on our part, and a cutting of 
     <lb/>
     the tie between these provinces and the 
     <lb/>
     parent state.  (Hear, hear.) Sir, I look upon 
     <lb/>
     the early cutting of that tie as a certain 
     <lb/>
     result of this measure ; and of that again, I 
     <lb/>
     hold the inevitable result to be our early 
     <lb/>
     absorption into the republic south of us—the 
     <lb/>
     United States, or the Northern States, be 
     <lb/>
     which it may. (Hear, hear.) It cannot be, 
     <lb/>
     that we can form here an independent state 
     <lb/>
     that shall have a prosperous history. I say

      again, I am far from believing that this idea 
     <lb/>
     of separation is by any means the dominant 
     <lb/>
     opinion at home ; but I am sure it is enter<lb break="no"/>tained by a prominent school of English 
     <lb/>
     politicians. (Cries of " Name, name.") It is 
     <lb/>
     easy to call for names ; but there are too many ; 
     <lb/>
     one can't go over the names of a whole school. 
     <lb/>
     I indicate them well enough when I give 
     <lb/>
     them the well-known name of the Goldwin- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Smith school. There are influential men 
     <lb/>
     enough, and too many, among them — 
     <lb/>
     (Renewed cries of " Name.") Well then, I 
     <lb/>
     rather think Mr. Cobden, Mr. Bright, 
     <lb/>
     and any number more of the Liberal party, 
     <lb/>
     belong to this school—in fact, most of 
     <lb/>
     what are known as the Manchester school. 
     <lb/>
     But, joking apart,  if honorable gentlemen in 
     <lb/>
     their simplicity believe that utterances of the 
     <lb/>
     kind I have been reading appear in the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> without significance, their 
     <lb/>
     simplicity passes mine. I read these utter<lb break="no"/>ances, in connection with those of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> 
     <lb/>
     and of any quantity of other English journals, as 
     <lb/>
     representing the views of an influential portion 
     <lb/>
     of the British public, views which have such 
     <lb/>
     weight with the Imperial Government as may 
     <lb/>
     go some way to account for the acceptance— 
     <lb/>
     the qualified acceptance—which this scheme 
     <lb/>
     has met with at their hands. It is recom<lb break="no"/>mended at home—strongly recommended, just 
     <lb/>
     on this account, by those who there most 
     <lb/>
     favor it—as a great step towards the inde<lb break="no"/>pendence of this country. Now, I am not 
     <lb/>
     desirous that our acceptance of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     should go home to be cited (as it would be) 
     <lb/>
      to the people of England, as a proof that we 
     <lb/>
     so view it—a proof that we wish to be 
     <lb/>
     separated from the Empire. I am quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied separation will never do. We are 
     <lb/>
     simply sure to be overwhelmed the instant 
     <lb/>
     our neighbors and we differ, unless we have 
     <lb/>
     the whole power of the Mother Country to 
     <lb/>
     assist us. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SCOB1">Mr. SCOBLE</persName>—We shall have it.

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—I think we shall, if we 
     <lb/>
     maintain and strengthen our relations with 
     <lb/>
     the parent state ; but I do not think we shall, 
     <lb/>
     if we adopt a scheme like this, which must 
     <lb/>
     certainly weaken the tie between us and the 
     <lb/>
     Empire. Our language to England had bet<lb break="no"/>ter be the plain truth—that we are no beg<lb break="no"/>gars, and will shirk no duty ; that we do not 
     <lb/>
     want to go, and of ourselves will not go ; that 
     <lb/>
     our feelings and our interests alike hold us to 
     <lb/>
     her ; that, even apart from feeling, we are not 
     <lb/>
     strong enough, and know our own weakness, 
     <lb/>
     and the strength of the power near us ; and 
     <lb/>
     that the only means by which we can possibly 
     <lb/>
  
            <cb/>
   
     be kept from absorption by that power, is 
     <lb/>
     the maintaining now—and for all time that 
     <lb/>
     we can look forward to—of our con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Mother Land. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We are told, again, that  there are 
     <lb/>
     considerations connected with the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which make it necessary for us to 
     <lb/>
     accept this measure, that it is a solemn treaty 
     <lb/>
     entered into with them. Well, a treaty, I 
     <lb/>
     suppose, implies authority on the part of those 
     <lb/>
     who framed  it to enter into it. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CART2">Hon. Atty. Gen. CARTIER</persName>—We are

     —much less is it provincial approval—of 
     <lb/>
     what they did at that meeting. At most, the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions are not a treaty, but the mere draft 
     <lb/>
     of an agreement come to between those gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen.

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—Well, it is a draft of a

     <lb/>
     not meet your approval, you can dispossess us

     bound ; and it is very doubtful whether the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Lower Provinces will not reject 
     <lb/>
     it. I am quite satisfied that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada ought not to accept it, and I am not 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="541" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0541.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">541</fw>
          
     so very sure but that before the play is played 
     <lb/>
     out to the end, they will refuse to accept it, 
     <lb/>
      especially the people of Lower Canada, where, 
     <lb/>
     if it is carried at all, it will be by a very 
     <lb/>
     small majority. (Hear, hear.) But the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Cartier) has 
     <lb/>
     come over to my ground that it is not a 
     <lb/>
     treaty, but only the draft of a treaty, subject 
     <lb/>
     to the disapproval of the House and country. 
     <lb/>
     Taking it, however, as a treaty merely be<lb break="no"/>tween those who entered into it, I am dis<lb break="no"/>posed to make one admission, that it has one 
     <lb/>
     quality such as often attaches to treaties 
     <lb/>
     entered into by duly constituted plenipoten<lb break="no"/>tiaries, and that is, that there seem to be some 
     <lb/>
     secret articles connected with it. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CART2">Hon. Atty. Gen. Cartier</persName>—The gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who entered into it represented their 
     <lb/>
     governments, and the governments of all the 
     <lb/>
      provinces were represented. It is therefore a 
     <lb/>
     treaty between these provinces, which will 
     <lb/>
     hold good unless the Government is ousted by 
     <lb/>
     a vote of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:DUNK1">Mr. DUNKIN</persName>—The honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     does not, I suppose, forget that when this 
     <lb/>
     Government was formed there was a distinct 
     <lb/>
     declaration made, that until the plan they 
     <lb/>
     might propose should have been completed in 
     <lb/>
     detail and laid before Parliament, Parliament 
     <lb/>
     was not to be held committed to it in any 
     <lb/>
     way. (Hear, hear.) But I was going on to 
     <lb/>
     something else, and I cannot allow myself to be 
     <lb/>
     carried back. I was saying  that, assimilating 
     <lb/>
     this to a treaty like some other treaties, it 
     <lb/>
     seems to have secret articles in it. I find 
     <lb/>
     that one of the gentlemen who took part in

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
         He occupied a very unenviable  position. He

            <p>
     There were secrets of the scheme that he was 
     <lb/>
     not free to speak of. And we, too, find here that 
     <lb/>
     there are secrets ; many matters as to which 
     <lb/>
     we may ask as much as we like, and can get 
     <lb/>
     no information.  But the main point I was 
     <lb/>
     coming to is this. Call this thing what you 
     <lb/>
     like—treaty or whatever you  please—it is 
     <lb/>
     not dealt with in the Lower Provinces at 
     <lb/>
     all in the way in which it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     to deal with it here. The Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     we think, are smaller political communities 
     <lb/>
     than ourselves. Their legislative councils, 
     <lb/>
     their Houses of Assembly, we do not call quite 
     <lb/>
     so considerable as our own. We are in the 
     <lb/>
     habit of thinking that among the legislative 
     <lb/>
     bodies in the British Empire, we stand num<lb break="no"/>ber two ; certainly a great way behind the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, but having no other body 
     <lb/>
     between us and them in point of importance. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The Lower Provinces, I say, 
     <lb/>
     are not so big as we are, and yet how differ<lb break="no"/>ently has our Parliament been treated from 
     <lb/>
     the way in which their smaller parliaments 
     <lb/>
     have been. And the apology, the reason as<lb break="no"/>signed why we are treated as we are, is, that 
     <lb/>
     this thing is a binding treaty, if not yet be<lb break="no"/>tween the provinces, at least between the 
     <lb/>
     governments of the other provinces  and the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. But how does the 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia address 
     <lb/>
     his houses of parliament ? " It is not my pro<lb break="no"/>vinces," says he, " and I have no mission to 
     <lb/>
     do more than afford you the amplest and freest 
     <lb/>
     scope for the consideration of a proposal " 
     <lb/>
     —he does not call it a treaty—he calls it 
     <lb/>
     merely " a proposal, which seriously involves 
     <lb/>
     your own prospects." I suppose it does ; but, 
     <lb/>
     so far from calling it a treaty, he does not 
     <lb/>
     call it even an agreement.

     This, sir, is all that the Government of Nova 
     <lb/>
    Scotia ask the Legislature of that province to 
     <lb/>say. And I do not think that this course of 
     <lb/>theirs exactly indicates that they think they 
     <lb/>have made a treaty by which they must stand 
     <lb/>or fall, and to every letter and line of which 
     <lb/>they must force their Legislature to adhere. 
     <lb/>If they do regard it in that light, they have 
     <lb/>a very indirect way of expressing their ideas. 
     <lb/>But this is not the case merely in Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     tia. In Prince Edward Island, every one 
     <lb/>
     knows the Government is not bringing this 
     <lb/>
     down as a treaty; in New Brunswick every<lb break="no"/>body knows that the Government has been 
     <lb/>
     more or less changed since the Conference, 
     <lb/>
     that a general election is going on, and that 
     <lb/>
     a great deal will depend on the doubtful re<lb break="no"/>sult of that election. Every one knows that 
     <lb/>
     the matter is in a very  different position in 
     <lb/>
     every one of the Lower Provinces from what 
     <lb/>
     it is in here ; that there is none of this talk 
     <lb/>
     about a treaty anywhere but here. I would 
     <lb/>
     like, however, by the way, to draw the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House for a moment to a case 
     <lb/>
     in which there undoubtedly was a treaty. I 
     <lb/>
     speak of the proceedings which eventuated 
     <lb/>
     in the union between England and Scotland. 
     <lb/>
     In the reign of Queen Anne, at the instance 
     <lb/>
     of the two legislatures, then respectively in<lb break="no"/>dependent—of England on the one hand, 
     <lb/>
     and of Scotland on the other—Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     appointed commissioners to represent each of 
     <lb/>
     her two states, and they framed what were 
     <lb/>
     declared to be articles of a treaty. They 
     <lb/>
     took months to frame those articles ; and 
     <lb/>
     twice in the course of their proceedings Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty came down to assist personally at 
     <lb/>
     their deliberations. Their meeting was au<lb break="no"/>thorized by acts of Parliament ; they were 
     <lb/>
     named by Her Majesty; they deliberated for 
     <lb/>
     months; and the Queen attended their de<lb break="no"/>liberations twice. And after they had en<lb break="no"/>tered into this treaty—so called on the face 
     <lb/>
     of it—the Parliament of Scotland departed 
     <lb/>
     from it and insisted on changes which were 
     <lb/>
     approved of by the Parliament of England, 
     <lb/>
     and the treaty as thus changed went into op<lb break="no"/>eration. In both parliaments the bills to 
     <lb/>
     give  effect to it passed through every stage ; 
     <lb/>
     originated in Committee of the Whole, and 
     <lb/>
     had their first, second and third readings. 
     <lb/>
     All was done with the utmost formality ; 
     <lb/>
     and yet there was there unmistakably a 
     <lb/>
     treaty solemnly made beforehand. Here we 
     <lb/>
     have an affair got up in seventeen days 
     <lb/>
     by thirty-three gentlemen who met without 
     <lb/>
     the sanction of the Crown, and only got that 
     <lb/>
     sanction afterwards. The document they 
     <lb/>
     agreed upon is full of oversights, as the Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Secretary states, and as everyone knows 
     <lb/>
    who has read it. Yet our Government regard 
     <lb/>it as a sacred treaty—though no one but 
     <lb/>themselves so  regards it—and want to give 
     <lb/>it a sacredness which was not claimed even 
     <lb/>for that treaty between England and Scotland. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I am at last very near the 
     <lb/>close of the remarks I have to offer to the 
     <lb/>House ; but I must say a few words as to the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="543" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0543.jpg"/>

     domestic consideration urged to force us into<lb/>this scheme.  We are asked, " What are you 
     <lb/>
     going to do ? You must do something. Are 
     <lb/>
     you going back to our old state of dead-lock ?"  
     <lb/>
      At the risk of falling into an unparliamentary 
     <lb/>
     expression, I cannot help saying that I am re<lb break="no"/>minded of a paragraph I read the other day 
     <lb/>
     in a Lower Province paper, in which the 
     <lb/>
     editor was dealing with this same cry, which 
     <lb/>
      seems to be raised in Nova Scotia as well as 
     <lb/>
     here—the cry that something must be done, 
     <lb/>
     that things cannot go on as they are. I have 
     <lb/>
     not his words here, but their general effect  
     <lb/>
      was this—" Whenever," says he, " I hear this 
     <lb/>
     cry raised, that something must be done, I 
     <lb/>
     suspect there is a plan on foot to get some<lb break="no"/>thing very bad done. Things are in a bad 
     <lb/>
     way—desperate, may be. But the remedy 
     <lb/>
      proposed is sure to be desperate. I am put 
     <lb/>
      in mind of a story of two boys who couldn't 
     <lb/>
      swim, but by ill luck had upset their canoe in 
     <lb/>
     deep water, and by good luck had got on the 
     <lb/>
      bottom of it. Says the big boy to the little 
     <lb/>
      one, ' Tom, can you pray ?' Tom confessed  
     <lb/>
      he could not call to mind a prayer suited to 
     <lb/>
     the occasion. ' No, Bill,' says he, ' I don't 
     <lb/>
     know how.' Bill's answer was earnest, but 
     <lb/>
      not parliamentary. It contained a past partici<lb break="no"/>ple which I won't repeat. It was, ' Well, 
     <lb/>
     something must be done—and that—soon !' " 
     <lb/>
      (Laughter.) Now, seriously, what do hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen mean when they raise here 
     <lb/>
     this cry that " something must be done ?" 
     <lb/>
     ls it seriously meant that our past is 
     <lb/>
     so bad that positively, on pain of politi<lb break="no"/>cal annihilation, of utter and hopeless 
     <lb/>
     ruin, of the last, worst consequences, we must 
     <lb/>
     this instant adopt just precisely this scheme ? 
     <lb/>
     If that is so, if really and truly those politi<lb break="no"/>cal institutions which we were in the habit of 
     <lb/>
      saying we enjoyed, which, at all events, we 
     <lb/>
     have been living under and, for that matter, 
     <lb/>
     are living under now, if they have worked so 
     <lb/>
     ill as all that comes to, or rather if we have 
     <lb/>
     worked them so ill, I think we hold out poor 
     <lb/>
     encouragement to those whom we call upon to 
     <lb/>
     take part with us in trying this new experi<lb break="no"/>ment. We Canadians have had a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union and worked it close upon five and twen<lb break="no"/>ty years, and under it have got, it is said, into 
     <lb/>
      such a position of embarrassment among our<lb break="no"/>selves, are working our political institutions 
     <lb/>
     so very badly, are in such a frightful fix, that, 
     <lb/>
     never mind what the prospects of this parti<lb break="no"/>cular step may be, it must positively be taken ; 
     <lb/>
     we cannot help it, we cannot stay as we are, 
     <lb/>
     nor yet go back, nor yet go forward, in any  
     <lb/>
     course but just this one.  (Hear, hear.) If 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
    
     this thing is really this last desperate remedy<lb/>for a disease past praying for, then indeed I <lb/>am desperately afraid, sir, that it will not suc<lb break="no"/>ceed. The hot haste with which gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     are pressing it is of ill omen to the deceived 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, to our deceived sister pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and to our most miserably deceived 
     <lb/>
     selves. But the truth is that we are in no such 
     <lb/>
     sad case ; there is no fear of our having to go 
     <lb/>
     back to this bugbear past ; we could not do it 
     <lb/>
     if we would. Things done cannot be undone. 
     <lb/>
     In a certain sense, whatever is past is irrevo<lb break="no"/>cable, and it is well it should be. True we 
     <lb/>
     are told by some of the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the Treasury benches that their present 
     <lb/>
     harmony is not peace, but only a sort of armed 
     <lb/>
     truce, that old party lines are not effaced, nor 
     <lb/>
     going tobe. Well, sir, if so, suppose that 
     <lb/>
     this scheme should be ever so well dropped, 
     <lb/>
     and then that some day soon after these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen should set themselves to the job of 
     <lb/>
     finding out who is cuckoo and who hedge- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     sparrow in the government nest that now shel<lb break="no"/>ters them all in such warm quiet, suppose 
     <lb/>
     there should thus soon be every effort made 
     <lb/>
     to revive old cries and feuds—what then ? 
     <lb/>
     Would it be the old game over again, or a 
     <lb/>
     variation of it amounting to a new one ? For 
     <lb/>
     a time at least, sir, a breathing time that hap<lb break="no"/>pily cannot be got over, those old cries and 
     <lb/>
     old feuds will not be found  to be revivable as 
     <lb/>
     of old. Even representation by population 
     <lb/>
     will be no such spell to conjure with—will fall 
     <lb/>
     on ears far less excitable. It has been adopt<lb break="no"/>ed by any number of those who might other<lb break="no"/>wise be the likeliest to run it down. It will 
     <lb/>
     be found there might be a worse thing in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of many. Give it a new name and 
     <lb/>
     couple it with sufficient safeguard against 
     <lb/>
     legislation of the local stamp being put 
     <lb/>
     through against the vote of the local ma<lb break="no"/>jority — the principle tacitly held so, and 
     <lb/>
     found to answer in the case of Scotland 
     <lb/>
     —and parliamentary reform may be found 
     <lb/>
     no such bug-bear to speak of after all. And 
     <lb/>
     as for the bug-bears of the personal kind, 
     <lb/>
     why, sir, after seeing all we have seen of the 
     <lb/>
     extent to which gentlemen can set aside or 
     <lb/>
     overcome them when occasion may  require, it 
     <lb/>
     is too much to think they will for some little 
     <lb/>
     time go for so very much. Like it or not, 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen, for a time, will have to 
     <lb/>
     be to some extent busy with a game  that shall 
     <lb/>
     be not quite the old one. The friends of this 
     <lb/>
     project, Mr. Speaker, never seem  to tire of 
     <lb/>
     prophesying to us smooth things, if only it is 
     <lb/>
     once first adopted. To every criticism on 
     <lb/>
     its many and manifest defects, the ready an<lb break="no"/>
           
            <pb n="544" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-28_Page_0544.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">544</fw>
       swer is, that we do not enough count upon 
     <lb/>
     men's good sense, good feeling, forbearance, 
     <lb/>
     and all that sort of thing. But, sir, if the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of this scheme is so to improve our 
     <lb/>
     position, is to make everything so smooth, 
     <lb/>
     to make all our public men so wise, so pru<lb break="no"/>dent, and so conscientious, I should like to 
     <lb/>
     know why a something of the same kind may 
     <lb/>
     not by possibility be hoped for, even though 
     <lb/>
     this project should be set aside. If we are to 
     <lb/>
     be capable of the far harder task of working 
     <lb/>
     out these projected unworkable political in<lb break="no"/>stitutions, why is it that we must be incap<lb break="no"/>able of the easier task of going on without 
     <lb/>
     them ? I know well that in all time the tem<lb break="no"/>per of those who do not think has been to put 
     <lb/>
     faith rather in the great thing one cannot do, 
     <lb/>
     than in the smaller thing one can. " If the 
     <lb/>
     prophet had bid thee do some great thing, 
     <lb/>
     wouldest thou not have done it? " And here 
     <lb/>
     too, air, as so often before, if the truth must 
     <lb/>
     be told, the one thing truly needed is what 
     <lb/>
     one may call the smaller thing—not perhaps 
     <lb/>
     easy, but one must hope not impossible—the 
     <lb/>
     exercise by our public men and by our people 
     <lb/>
     of that amount of discretion, good temper and 
     <lb/>
     forbearance which sees something larger and 
     <lb/>
     higher in public life than mere party struggles 
     <lb/>
     and crises without end; of that political saga<lb break="no"/>city or capacity, call it which you will, with 
     <lb/>
     which they will surely find the institutions 
     <lb/>
     they have to be quite good enough for 
     <lb/>
     them to use and quietly make better, with<lb break="no"/>out which they will as surely find any 
     <lb/>
     that may anyhow be given them, to be 
     <lb/>
     quite bad enough for them to fight over 
     <lb/>
     and make worse.- Mr. SPEAKER, I feel that 
     <lb/>
     I have taken up a great deal of the time of 
     <lb/>
     the House, and that I have presented but 
     <lb/>
     imperfectly the views I am anxious to impress 
     <lb/>
     upon it as to this great question. But for 
     <lb/>
     sheer want of strength, I might have felt it 
     <lb/>
     necessary, at whatever risk of wearying the 
     <lb/>
     House, to go into some matters more thor<lb break="no"/>oughly, and more especially into that branch 
     <lb/>
     of the subject which relates to what I may 
     <lb/>
     call the alternative policy I myself prefer to 
     <lb/>
     this measure, and would wish to see adopted 
     <lb/>
     and carried out. As it is, I have but to say 
     <lb/>
     in conclusion, while warmly thanking the 
     <lb/>
     House for the attention and patience with 
     <lb/>
     which it has for so many hours listened to 
     <lb/>
     me, that I have said nothing but what I 
     <lb/>
     firmly believe, and felt myself bound to say, 
     <lb/>
     and that I trust the sober good sense of the 
     <lb/>
     people of these provinces, after full reflection 
     <lb/>
     and discussion, will decide rightly upon this 
     <lb/>
     the largest question by far that has ever been 
     <lb/>
     before them for decision. (Cheers)

            </p>
            <p>MR. ARCHAMBEAULT—In rising on 
     <lb/>this occasion, sir, my intention is not to 
     <lb/>occupy the attention of the House for a 
     <lb/>long time, nor to discuss the merits of the 
     <lb/>measure which is now before us. I intend 
     <lb/>merely to explain my own motives for the 
     <lb/>vote which I shall give, and this I shall do 
     <lb/>as briefly as possible. I am bound to ac<lb break="no"/>knowledge at once that when I arrived in 
     <lb/>Quebec, at the commencement of the session, 
     <lb/>I was opposed to the plan of Confederation, 
     <lb/>and so strongly opposed to it, that I was 
     <lb/>fully determined to vote against it. But 
     <lb/>alter a more serious consideration of the 
     <lb/>question, and after hearing the explanations 
     <lb/>which have been afforded to us of the 
     <lb/>scheme of the Government, I have arrived 
     <lb/>at the conviction that I had decided, if not 
     <lb/>wrongly, at least hastily, and that I ought 
     <lb/>not to aid in the rejection of the measure, 
     <lb/>merely because it did not quite coincide 
     <lb/>with all my opinions. After listening to 
     <lb/>the discussion, and the explanations of the 
     <lb/>members of the Administration, I perceived 
     <lb/>that the plan was one of compromise and 
     <lb/>could not, therefore, be adapted to suit all 
     <lb/>views, nor shaped even to meet those of the 
     <lb/>men who framed it. I can understand that 
     <lb/>those persons who are opposed to any degree 
     <lb/>of Confederation, and who would rather 
     <lb/>have representation based on poulation or 
     <lb/>the annexation of Canada to the United 
     <lb/>States, may be opposed to the project of the 
     <lb/>Government, and reject it accordingly ; but 
     <lb/>those who, like myself, are not opposed to it ' 
     <lb/>under any circumstances, and are capable of 
     <lb/>appreciating the necessity of it at the present 
     <lb/>conjuncture, together with the advantages it 
     <lb/>may produce to the country, ought not, can<lb break="no"/>not, I think, reject it, only because some of 
     <lb/>its details are not exactly to their mind. It 
     <lb/>is our business first to enquire whether some 
     <lb/>constitutional changes are not necessary, 
     <lb/>and none I think will deny that they are. 
     <lb/>The political leaders of the two parties into 
     <lb/>which this House is divided, have acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged this as a necessity. It remains, 
     <lb/>therefore, only to consider what changes 
     <lb/>should be made. The members of the 
     <lb/>Government have decided this question, and 
     <lb/>proposed a Confederation of all the Provinces 
     <lb/>
