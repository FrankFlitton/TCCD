<!-- GL, 2016-11-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

   <!--<p>
     be applied to that outlay, the absence of such 
     <lb/>
     expenditure ought to be a subject of regret 
     <lb/>
     in the community, and not of rejoicing. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In this view let us look at 
     <lb/>
     the immense extent of territory that stretches 
     <lb/>
     away west of Upper Canada. The reason 
     <lb/>
     why we have not been able to assume posses<lb break="no"/>sion of that territory and open it up to the 
     <lb/>
     industry of the youth of this country who, 
     <lb/>
     in consequence of the want of some such 
     <lb/>
     field for the employment of their energies, 
     <lb/>
     have been obliged to go off to the States in 
     <lb/>
     thousands, especially to those states possess<lb break="no"/>ing the boundless resources of the great 
     <lb/>
     North-West, is because there sources of Can<lb break="no"/>ada—great as they have been, considering the 
     <lb/>
     disadvantages under which she has labored<lb break="no"/>have been inadequate for the development of 
     <lb/>
     this district. Now, one of the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme before the House refers to this 
     <lb/>
     same question, and I believe that one of the 
     <lb/>
     first acts of the General Government of 
     <lb/>
     the United Provinces will be to enter into 
     <lb/>
     public obligations for the purpose of opening 
     <lb/>
     up and developing that vast region, and of 
     <lb/>
     making it a source of strength instead of a 
     <lb/>
     burden to us and to the Mother Country also. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.)  Looking, however, to the 
     <lb/>
     whole question of expense, I must say that if 
     <lb/>
     the benefits of Confederation are to be weighed 
     <lb/>
      against the loss of three or four hundred 
     <lb/>
     thousand dollars, the House had better care<lb break="no"/>fully consider whether the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country will not accept the former at such 
     <lb/>
     comparatively trifling cost—whether they will 
     <lb/>
     not feel that a union with a million of their 
     <lb/>
     fellow colonists is worth much more to them 
     <lb/>
     than any mall pecuniary question of this 
     <lb/>
     kind that may arise. (Hear, hear.) I trust 
     <lb/>
      the House will not permit the question to be 
     <lb/>
     judged of in a small, contracted manner. I 
     <lb/>
     trust it will keep in view the desire the country 
     <lb/>
     manifests for the utmost possible development 
     <lb/>
     of its resources. Let us endeavor by this 
     <lb/>
     measure to afford a better opening than we 
     <lb/>
     now possess for the industry and intelligence 
     <lb/>
     of the people. Let us seek by this scheme 
     <lb/>
     to give them higher and worthier objects of 
     <lb/>
     ambition. Let us not reject the scheme with 
     <lb/>
     the bright prospect it offers of a nobler future 
     <lb/>
     for our youth, and grander objects for the 
     <lb/>
     emulation of our public men. Let us not re<lb break="no"/>fuse it on small questions of detail, but judge 
     <lb/>
     it on its general merits. Let us not lose sight 
     <lb/>
     of the great advantages which union offers 
     <lb/>
     because there may be some small matters 
     <lb/>
     which, as individuals, we may not like. Let 
     <lb/>
      us trust that this machinery, however faulty 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     it may be, will yet under Providence open up 
     <lb/>
     for this country a happy career ; while at the 
     <lb/>
     same time the House must not forget that it 
     <lb/>
     will for ever remove the great and crying evils 
     <lb/>
     and dissensions which have existed in Canada 
     <lb/>
     for the last ten years, and which have threat<lb break="no"/>ened to plunge the country into the most dis- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     asterous and lamentable state of discord and 
     <lb/>
     confusion. (Cheers.) Surely this last fact 
     <lb/>
     alone will commend the project to the House. 
     <lb/>
     It should induce the Legislature and the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to make every allowance for the men who 
     <lb/>
    have been engaged in the work, and lead 
     <lb/>them to approach the result of their labors 
     <lb/>as now submitted, not in a hypercritical spirit 
     <lb/>so that the public mind may be led astray on 
     <lb/>mere matters of detail. Let the House frank<lb break="no"/>ly and kindly look at it as a great measure 
     <lb/>brought down for the purpose of relieving 
     <lb/>the country from distress and depression, and 
     <lb/>give it that consideration which is due, not to 
     <lb/>the arguments of the Government, feeble as 
     <lb/>they may be in view of the great interests 
     <lb/>involved, but to the fact that the country 
     <lb/>desires and cries for, at the hands of the 
     <lb/>House, some measure whereby its internal 
     <lb/>prosperity, peace and happiness may be de<lb break="no"/>veloped and maintained. (Loud cheers.) 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName> continued the debate as 
     <lb/>
     follows :—Honorable gentlemen will remember 
     <lb/>
     that I yesterday moved the adjournment with 
     <lb/>
     the intention of replying to the remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member from Niagara Division (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     MR. CURRIE), who engaged the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House during most of its sitting. From 
     <lb/>
     its commencement to its conclusion, the speech 
     <lb/>
     of that honorable gentleman was of a most 
     <lb/>
     remarkable character. At its very outset he 
     <lb/>
    took the opportunity of quoting some parts of 
     <lb/>the first speech he made in this chamber, two 
     <lb/>years ago, in which he strongly approved of 
     <lb/>the principle of a Confederation between 
     <lb/>Canada and the Lower Provinces, and in some 
     <lb/>portions of his yesterday's speech he reiterated 
     <lb/>in a very decided manner his approval of such 
     <lb/>a scheme. But other parts of his speech were 
     <lb/>of such a character that if any of the pro<lb break="no"/>moters of Confederation had been at first in<lb break="no"/>clined to number him among the friends of 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="72" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0072.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">72</fw> 

       Intercolonial Union, they might
afterwards <lb/>
have said "save us from our friends." (Hear.) <lb/>
He took the very singular course of first <lb/>
decrying the credit of the Lower Provinces, <lb/>
and then decrying that of Canada itself, en<lb break="no"/>deavoring to show first that we were making <lb/>
a very bad bargain in uniting our destiny <lb/>
with such poor provinces as they were, <lb/>
and afterwards that such was our state <lb/>
of bankruptcy that they would be very <lb/>
foolish indeed in joining their fate with <lb/>
ours. (Laughter.) It would, indeed, be almost <lb/>
a sufficient answer to the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber to take his speech in separate paragraphs <lb/>
and to place certain of them opposite to others <lb/>
as the reply, for a more illogical and inconse<lb break="no"/>quential address I hardly ever heard. Nor <lb/>
was he content with dealing in what he thought <lb/>
was irony or sarcasm, but ventured to attack <lb/>
important statements of fact made by the pub<lb break="no"/>lic men of this and the other provinces. Now, <lb/>
if we are to have a Confederation at all, I think <lb/>
we should be careful what language we use with<lb/>
respect to such men, and what statements
we <lb/>
place before the public. If language such as <lb/>
the hon. member permitted himself to use he <lb/>
encouraged, it will be impossible
to secure the <lb/>
good feeling and harmony which are indispen<lb break="no"/>sably necessary to the well-working of the <lb/>
contemplated union. I am, however, satisfied <lb/>
that the sober sense of the House will condemn <lb/>
such language, not only when it comes from <lb/>
the hon. member for Niagara, but when falling <lb/>
from any other hon. member. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
The hon. member commenced his attacks upon <lb/>
the public men of the provinces by quoting <lb/>
from a speech of Mr. LYNCH, recently deliv<lb break="no"/>ered at Halifax, and did his best to turn it <lb/>
into ridicule, as well as to excite contemptuous <lb/>
laughter at the expense of that gentleman. <lb/>
Now the statements Mr. LYNCH made are <lb/>
facts, not foolish inventions, as
the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber pretended. That gentleman spoke by <lb/>
the book, and relied for his information upon <lb/>
the official report of one of our public depart<lb break="no"/>ments, and if the hon. member will turn to <lb/>
the census of 1852, he will find, at
page 32, a <lb/>
table comparing the produce of Canada and <lb/>
the United States, from which it appears that, <lb/>
while that of the latter increased 48 per cent., <lb/>
that of Canada increased 400 per cent. during <lb/>
the previous decade. This is what Mr. LYNCH <lb/>
stated, and what the hon. member for Niagara <lb/>
asserted to be untrue. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—That was between <lb/>
the years 1841 and 1851, while the remarks <lb/>
of Mr. LYNCH had reference to the subsequent <lb/>
decade.<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—It is not so; Mr. LYNCH <lb/>
spoke of an increase of ten years; he read <lb/>
from our official records in proof, and read <lb/>
correctly. The hon. member probably derived <lb/>
his information from some newspaper, and the <lb/>
error he has committed should teach him to be <lb/>
more cautious how he assails public men on <lb/>
such evidence. (Hear, hear.) He then turned <lb/>
from Mr. LYNCH to the Premier of New <lb/>
Brunswick, a gentleman of the highest char<lb break="no"/>acter and ability, who is so strong in the <lb/>
esteem and confidence of the people of that <lb/>
province that it seems impossible to displace him. <lb/>
Now I maintain that, to say the least it is in <lb/>
extremely bad taste to attack high-placed <lb/>
public men, especially those of other countries,
<lb/>
and more especially those of the sister colonies, <lb/>
as the hon. member has done. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I did not attack <lb/>
them. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—The hon. member has <lb/>
attacked their veracity; he has denied the cor<lb break="no"/>rectness of the statements they made openly <lb/>
as public men. The Hon. Mr. TILLEY
quoted <lb/>
the figures of our own Minister of Finance, <lb/>
and the hon. member represented
him as not <lb/>
speaking the truth, but as, in effect, attempting <lb/>
to deceive those whom he addressed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I beg to know when <lb/>
the Finance Minister of Canada stated that <lb/>
the average duties collected in Canada were <lb/>
11 per cent. The figures-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—The honorable member <lb/>
will find it in the Finance Minister's speech, <lb/>
and while I do not think it proper in him <lb/>
to interrupt me for the purpose of going into <lb/>
calculations just at this moment, I maintain <lb/>
that by taking all the imports, including those <lb/>
free of duty, the honorable member will find <lb/>
that the rate stated is exactly correct. The <lb/>
imports in 1863 amounted to $45,964,493,
<lb/>
and the duty collected was $5,169,173,
which <lb/>
is just 11 per cent. of the whole. I repeat, <lb/>
honorable gentlemen, that, instead of making <lb/>
such attacks on great public men, I conceive <lb/>
it to be more properly our duty to defend <lb/>
them. (Hear.) Having thus disposed of the <lb/>
remarks the honorable member made on the <lb/>
veracity of Mr. LYNCH and Hon. Mr. TILLEY, <lb/>
I will now advert to that portion of his remarks <lb/>
in which he endeavored to show that Hon. Mr. <lb/>
GALT'S statements were incorrect. He referred <lb/>
to the figures respecting the tonnage of the pro<lb break="no"/>posed Confederation, as quoted by Hon. Mr.<lb/>
GALT, and pooh=poohed his remarks in a way
<lb/>
which was no doubt intended to be very amusing. <lb/>
The Minister of Finance declared that when <lb/>
the Union was effected, we should be, he be<lb break="no"/><pb n="73" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0073.jpg"/><fw type="num">73</fw>lieved, the third largest country in the
world, <lb/>
as regards the tonnage of our commercial <lb/>
marine, though possibly France might be about <lb/>
on an equality with us. England, he said, <lb/>
was the first, the United States the second,
<lb/>
and either France or the contemplated Con<lb break="no"/>federation would be the third ; and this is true. <lb/>
I will read the statement of that honorable <lb/>
gentleman :-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The sea-going tonnage of Canada,
including <lb/>
that of the inland lakes, amounts to about nine <lb/>
million tons, a great portion of which, however, <lb/>
represents the tonnage of vessels performing
the <lb/>
coasting service, may of which frequently clear <lb/>
and arrive in the course of one day. It is grati<lb break="no"/>fying to know that the trade between Canada and<lb/>
the States on the other side of the lakes is of a <lb/>
nature to give employment to a large portion of <lb/>
this lake tonnage—amounting to 6,907,000 tons. <lb/>
I cannot class that in the same category as the <lb/>
tonnage arriving at Quebec and Montreal which, <lb/>
in most cases, can only make two or three trips <lb/>
per annum. The sea-going tonnage of Canada <lb/>
amounts to 2,133,000 tons ; of New Brunswick, <lb/>
1,386,000 tons ; of Nova Scotia,
1,432,000 tons. <lb/>
Consequently the amount of
sea-going tonnage, <lb/>
subject only to a small deduction, is actually <lb/>
about five million tons. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> The way the honorable Minister of Finance
<lb/>
made up his statement was exactly similar to <lb/>
that in which the same kind of statistical <lb/>
statements were made up in England, the <lb/>
United States, and other great maritime <lb/>
countries, the object being to show the actual <lb/>
amount of tonnage employed during each year <lb/>
in the carrying trade. It does not matter <lb/>
whether a vessel is engaged in long or short <lb/>
voyages ; if it be employed merely as a ferry, <lb/>
the fact of its being so employed
in carrying <lb/>
goods inwards or outwards is a proof that its <lb/>
tonnage capacity is required by the trade of <lb/>
the countries to and from which it plies. <lb/>
(Hear.) But the honorable member
made it <lb/>
appear untruly that the statement
of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable the Minister of Finance with respect to <lb/>
the tonnage employed on the Canadian lakes <lb/>
was put forth for the purpose of misleading <lb/>
the public and inducing them erroneously to <lb/>
believe that the Confederation will have a pro<lb break="no"/>minent place among the great maritime nations <lb/>
by reason of the tonnage employed in its <lb/>
trade. Mr. GALT's statement was that the <lb/>
sea-going tonnage of the proposed Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion would be the third largest
employed in <lb/>
the trade of the world, and the statistics re<lb break="no"/>garding the tonnage of the inland waters of<lb/>
Canada were superadded to those of the sea<lb break="no"/>going tonnage of the Union. The two state<lb break="no"/>ments were made perfectly distinct in every <lb/>
         
            <cb/>  
       
table and every speech emanating from the
<lb/>
Minister of Finance or his department. It <lb/>
is thus the honorable member has availed <lb/>
himself of his position for the purpose of <lb/>
trying to throw dirt upon our leading states<lb break="no"/>men—of endeavoring to asperse the charac<lb break="no"/>ters of our most distinguished public men, <lb/>
and I repeat, for I cannot too strongly urge <lb/>
it upon the House, that we ought to dis<lb break="no"/>countenance such attempts, for we should con<lb break="no"/>sider the character of our public men as <lb/>
public property, not to be lightly attacked <lb/>
and damaged. If we are to enter into this <lb/>
scheme, we should at least do so unassailed by <lb/>
our own people, and with as good a public <lb/>
reputation as we deserve. (Hear, hear.) The <lb/>
honorable member next proceeded to read ex<lb break="no"/>tracts from old <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globes</hi> and other newspapers, <lb/>
in which, with the characteristic features and <lb/>
bitter feelings of the times in which they <lb/>
were written, certain things were stated not <lb/>
specially commendatory of some of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian ministers now concerned in the prepara<lb break="no"/>tion of the Confederation scheme. I am not <lb/>
here to defend these gentlemen—the Hon. <lb/>
Messrs. BROWN and MCDOUGALL, his own <lb/>
party leaders, whom he attacked—nor do I <lb/>
intend to make remarks upon past events, but <lb/>
this I will say, that the parties alluded to <lb/>
have entered upon their present work with the <lb/>
sincere intention, I believe, of putting an end <lb/>
to the grave difficulties which have so long <lb/>
distracted the country. This they have done <lb/>
with the full concurrence and approbation of <lb/>
their political friends, whose advice they <lb/>
sought before entering the Administration ; <lb/>
and I think that, under the circumstances, <lb/>
instead of being reproached and held up to pub<lb break="no"/>lic censure, they ought to be treated with con<lb break="no"/>fidence and generosity. I have hitherto <lb/>
always listened to the honorable member with <lb/>
pleasure, even when I could not agree with <lb/>
him, and even in certain parts of the speech <lb/>
to which I am now referring, the honorable <lb/>
member exhibited considerable ability ; but <lb/>
I do think, considering it as a whole, that <lb/>
a more illogical, self-contradictory, and gen<lb break="no"/>erally objectionable address has seldom been <lb/>
made in the Canadian Legislature. Upon <lb/>
reviewing the general effect of this re<lb break="no"/>markable effort, can only compare it with <lb/>
the performances of the Parrott
guns dis<lb break="no"/>charged against Fort Fisher, six of which, we <lb/>
have been told, slightly wounded two of the <lb/>
enemy, but killed and disabled about fifty of <lb/>
the men who served them. I take it that <lb/>
Hon. Messrs. TILLEY and LYNCH have got <lb/>
off with very slight wounds indeed, and that <lb/>
    
            <pb n="74" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0074.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">74</fw>
 
 any damage done is to the honorable
member's <lb/>
own friends. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)
I <lb/>
will now come more closely to the subject <lb/>
under debate, the proposed Confederation of <lb/>
Canada and the other British North American <lb/>
colonies, and in doing so I feel I am dealing <lb/>
with a matter in which is bound up the hap<lb break="no"/>piness and prosperity of the country, not for <lb/>
the present only, but for a long course of years <lb/>
to come. I only wish the honorable member <lb/>
for the Niagara Division had read the debates <lb/>
which preceded the establishment of the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican Constitution after the United States had <lb/>
gained their independence. I especially advert <lb/>
to the debates in the Councils of Virginia, <lb/>
which at that time, by reason of its wealth and <lb/>
population, bore a similar relation to the other <lb/>
colonies to that which Canada now bears to the <lb/>
Lower Provinces. If he had read the speeches <lb/>
of the MADISONS, the MARSHALLS, the
RAN<lb break="no"/>DOLPHs, the HENRYS, the LEES and others, he <lb/>
would have found no passage in keeping with <lb/>
the sentiments he uttered yesterday. Those <lb/>
great patriots evidently met under a deep sense <lb/>
of the responsibilities of their work, and instead <lb/>
of bringing into the debates the small village <lb/>
feelings and animosities tending to embarrass <lb/>
and to destroy harmony, they
acted like great <lb/>
men, true and noble men as they were, and <lb/>
applied themselves to their task with the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of bringing it to a successful issue. he <lb/>
confederation which they first established, in <lb/>
the year 1781, did not work well. It <lb/>
remained poor, without respect abroad, or<lb/>
prosperity at home, and so in 1789 they aban<lb break="no"/>doned that condition of existence and adopted <lb/>
the Constitution which lasted until the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the present unfortunate war, <lb/>
and now governs the North. In speaking of <lb/>
the Constitution prepared by our delegates,
<lb/>
the honorable member for Niagara said it was <lb/>
neither one thing nor another, it was neither <lb/>
legislative nor federative, but
a mongre1 non<lb break="no"/>descript scheme between the two; a Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion or which there was no precedent in all <lb/>
the world's history. Such, at least, was the <lb/>
effect of the words he used. It happens, <lb/>
however, to be a fact, that in opposition to the <lb/>
profound and enlightened opinion of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member, the work of the delegates has <lb/>
received the approbation of some of the most <lb/>
eminent statesmen of England, as well as that <lb/>
of the most distinguished and able writers for <lb/>
the press of that country, which is at any rate <lb/>
some small consolation. I will say that if the <lb/>
delegates who met at Quebec and prepared <lb/>
that instrument were incompetent for the task, <lb/>
I do not know where others can be found to <lb/>
    

            <cb/>

do it better; and, after all, I think
that, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the remarks of the honorable <lb/>
member, the disinterested testimonies to the <lb/>
value of the work done, coming from the <lb/>
quarters I have indicated, will be
considered in <lb/>
Canada as having some weight. (Hear,
hear.) <lb/>
But since the honorable member regards this <lb/>
as a mongrel constitution, unworthy of ac<lb break="no"/>ceptance, ought he not to have been ready to <lb/>
suggest something better? Should he not as <lb/>
a patriot have given the country the benefit of <lb/>
his superior wisdom? It is of no use to look <lb/>
for a better form to the constitution of the <lb/>
ancient republics which have passed away,<lb/>
their having ceased to exist being of itself <lb/>
proof enough of their not being adapted to<lb/>
our wants. The honorable member might <lb/>
perhaps have cited the Swiss and Dutch re<lb break="no"/>publics, or the constitutions of
the United <lb/>
tates of 1781 and 1789, and if he had, the <lb/>
House would perhaps have been able to com<lb break="no"/>pare them with that now
proposed, and arrive <lb/>
at some definite conclusion which might after <lb/>
all have been that ours, as now proposed, is <lb/>
that which promises best to secure freedom to <lb/>
those who are to live under it, and stability <lb/>
for the political condition of our country. <lb/>
With respect to the Swiss Confederation, <lb/>
however well it ma be considered to have <lb/>
worked, it is a fact that within our own time <lb/>
a civil war has existed among the cantons, <lb/>
and that republic has been upon the brink of <lb/>
destruction. As regards the Dutch repub<lb break="no"/>lic, it is a matter of history how it fell. <lb/>
During the whole of its struggle against <lb/>
PHILIP II., the provinces comprising it never <lb/>
had that centralized power which is necessary <lb/>
to the stability of a government, especially one <lb/>
assailed by enemies from without, for two <lb/>
provinces, Guelderland and Overyssel, con<lb break="no"/>tributed nothing all that contest through<lb break="no"/>each standing upon its state rights—while <lb/>
among the remaining five, by far the largest <lb/>
proportion was contributed by the one Prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Holland. The natural result was that <lb/>
the republic fell, and became a monarchy. <lb/>
The same evil lay at the root of the American <lb/>
Constitution of 1781, and after it had been <lb/>
adopted, so ill concerted and disunited were the <lb/>
efforts of the thirteen states,
that the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment would not work at all, so that General <lb/>
WASHINGTON was obliged to ask for
and actu<lb break="no"/>ally obtained dictatorial powers, to enable him <lb/>
to carry on the contest against Great Britain. <lb/>
The difficulties between the North and the <lb/>
South which now prevail, arose wholly upon <lb/>
the question of state rights, and had provisions <lb/>
existed in the Constitution of the American <lb/>
         
            <pb n="75" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0075.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">75</fw>
        
Union, similar to those which it is
proposed to <lb/>
introduce into ours, the probability is the <lb/>
States would have remained united. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) But the hon. member said further <lb/>
that the scheme has taken the country by sur<lb break="no"/>prise. Now, I really beg to ask whether
there <lb/>
is any foundation for such a statement? I <lb/>
most deliberately say that there is not. It <lb/>
must be well known to hon. members that the <lb/>
late Chief Justice SEWELL, who
enjoyed the <lb/>
friendship of the Duke of KENT, the father of <lb/>
Her Majesty the Queen, so far back as 1814, <lb/>
addressed a letter to the noble Duke, recom<lb break="no"/>mending an union, for this fact is adverted to <lb/>
in Lord DURHAM'S report on the affairs
of <lb/>
the British North American Provinces.
Some <lb/>
ten or twelve years before even that, the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. UNIACKE, of Nova Scotia, had made a <lb/>
similar suggestion, and from time to time, <lb/>
since then, the importance and desirability of <lb/>
the project has been openly advocated by lead<lb break="no"/>ing public men in all the colonies. Amongst <lb/>
others, I may mention Archdeacon
STRACHAN, <lb/>
the present venerable and Right Reverend <lb/>
Bishop of Toronto, whose enlightened opin<lb break="no"/>ions upon great public questions, have always <lb/>
commanded the utmost respect, and who, <lb/>
writing to Mr. CHARLES BULWER, the able <lb/>
Secretary of Lord DURHAM, in 1838 ex<lb break="no"/>pressed himself as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">I have
only to add that it will be a pleasure to <lb/>
me to contribute everything in my power to the <lb/>
prosperous issue of Lord DURHAM'S Administra<lb break="no"/>tion ; and if Mr. PITT considered
the Constitution <lb/>
which he conferred upon the Canadas one of the <lb/>
glories of his life, what glory must redound to <lb/>
the statesmen who give a free
Constitution to the <lb/>
British North American colonies, and by consoli<lb break="no"/>dating them into one territory or kingdom, exalts <lb/>
them to a nation acting in unity, and under the <lb/>
protection of the British
Government; and thus <lb/>
not only ensuring their
happiness, but preventing <lb/>
for ever the sad consequences that might arise <lb/>
from a rival power getting possession of their <lb/>
shores. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> Then
it was formally presented and recom<lb break="no"/>mended in Lord DURHAM'S remarkable report <lb/>
on Canada and British North America
gener<lb break="no"/>ally, so often quoted as a high authority, and <lb/>
only yesterday
by the honorable member him<lb break="no"/>self. Well, what did that distinguished noble<lb break="no"/>man say on the subject. He said :-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>How inseparably
connected I found the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of Your Majesty's Provinces

which it will be my duty to discuss
very fully be<lb break="no"/>fore closing this report. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Again—On
my first arrival in Canada, I was <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
       strongly inclined to the project of a
Federal union, <lb/>
and it was with such a plan in view that I dis<lb break="no"/>cussed a general measure for the government of <lb/>
the colonies with the deputations from the Lower <lb/>
Provinces, and with various leading individuals <lb/>
and public bodies in both the Canadas. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> But I had still more strongly impressed
on me <lb/>
the great advantage of an united government, and <lb/>
I was gratified by finding the leading minds of the <lb/>
various colonies strongly and generally inclined to <lb/>
a scheme that would elevate their countries into <lb/>
something like a national existence. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Lord DURHAM, after expressing his 'opinion <lb/>
in the report as on the whole in favor of the <lb/>
Legislative Union, and referring to the influ<lb break="no"/>ence of the United States as surrounding us <lb/>
on every side, goes on to say :-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>If we wish to prevent the extension of
this in<lb break="no"/>fluence, it can only be done by raising up for the <lb/>
North American Colonist some
nationality of his <lb/>

communities into a society having some objects
<lb/>
of a national importance, and by thus giving their <lb/>
inhabitants a country which they will be unwilling
<lb/>
to see absorbed even into one more powerful. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> An union for common defence against
foreign <lb/>
enemies is the natural bond of connection that <lb/>
holds together the great communities of the <lb/>

obvious than between the whole of these colonies. <lb/>

            <p> The whole of this branch of this
remarkable <lb/>
report on the subject of an union
of the <lb/>
British American Provinces should be read <lb/>
by every man in the several provinces, the <lb/>
arguments in its favor are so able and so <lb/>
unanswerable. (Hear, hear.) I will honestly <lb/>
say, as many others have said before me, that <lb/>
if it could have been attained, I would have <lb/>
preferred a Legislative Union, but it is well <lb/>
understood that Lower Canada would never <lb/>
have agreed to it. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—Nor the Lower <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—Nor, as my honorable <lb/>
and gallant friend the Premier states, would <lb/>
the Lower Provinces have consented to it. <lb/>
He may well be supposed to know, for he was <lb/>
in the Conference, presiding over its delibera<lb break="no"/>tions, and had the very best opportunity of <lb/>
ascertaining the opinions of the
delegates. <lb/>
(Hear.) But coming down to later times<lb break="no"/>the times so well described by
the hon. <lb/>
Premier in his excellent speech—when diffi<lb break="no"/>culties between Upper and Lower Canada <lb/>
began to thicken, the Hon. Mr. GALT brought <lb/>
up the scheme of Colonial Federation as the <lb/>
best mode of overcoming those difficulties,
<lb/>
and made a most able speech on the subject in <lb/>
his place in Parliament. Subsequently, in <lb/>
     
            <pb n="76" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0076.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">76</fw>
       
1858, that honorable minister entered the
<lb/>
Government with the express understanding <lb/>
that the question would be dealt with. It <lb/>
is well known that he carried his point so far, <lb/>
that the subject was alluded to at the close of <lb/>
the session of 1858, in the Speech of Sir <lb/>
E. HEAD, the Governor General, and com<lb break="no"/>munication with the Imperial Government for <lb/>
permission to negotiate with the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces on the subject was then undertaken. <lb/>
Shortly after this, three members of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, viz., Hon. Messrs. CARTIER,
GALT, <lb/>
and myself, went to England, and on the 25th <lb/>
of October, 1858, we laid our request before <lb/>
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir <lb/>
E. B. LYTTON, but difficulties,
not of our <lb/>
creation, intervened and caused delay—Lord <lb/>
DERBY's Government was defeated, and <lb/>
the matter continued in abeyance. To say, <lb/>
in the face of the facts I have stated, that <lb/>
the project is unknown and has taken the <lb/>
country by surprise, is to say what is <lb/>
not the case. Even last year it was dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly referred to in is Excellency's <lb/>
Speech at the close of the Session, and Hon. <lb/>
Messrs. BROWN, MCDOUGALL and MOWAT <lb/>
entered the Government with the express <lb/>
understanding that negociations were to ensue <lb/>
to bring about the proposed Federation. <lb/>
Hon. Messrs. BROWN and MOWAT went <lb/>
back to their constituents and were re-elected <lb/>
by acclamation, and although Hon. Mr. <lb/>
MCDOUGALL was defeated, he too was sub<lb break="no"/>sequently elected for another constituency by <lb/>
acclamation. These gentlemen, instead of be<lb break="no"/>ing decried and assailed for the part they <lb/>
have acted, should be honored for their <lb/>
patriotism. There has been no such thing <lb/>
as surprise. The resolutions were sent to all <lb/>
the members of the Legislature shortly after <lb/>
they were fully settled upon, and even before <lb/>
that the plan was published in all the news<lb break="no"/>papers of the province, and I am
at a loss to <lb/>
know how it could have been made more pub<lb break="no"/>lic. It is true the Opposition have not held <lb/>
public meetings to consider or object to the <lb/>
scheme, but the reason of this is, that the <lb/>
majority in its favor is so enormously large <lb/>
that they did not venture to do so. (Hear.)
<lb/>
The next piece of disingenuousness on the <lb/>
part of the honorable member was in stating <lb/>
the military power of the Lower Provinces at <lb/>
65,000 fighting men, or in limiting to that <lb/>
number the men competent for military ser<lb break="no"/>vice— </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. Mn. CURRIE</persName>—No; I said 128,000, <lb/>
of whom 65,000 only were available, the rest <lb/>
being engaged on the water. <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/> 

            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MB. ROSS</persName>—Why did not the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member candidly state their census <lb/>
population, which at this time cannot be much <lb/>
short of a million souls? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—With the per<lb break="no"/>mission of the honorable member I will state <lb/>
the result of my experience in this matter. I <lb/>
have been for some time attached to the <lb/>
Adjutant General's office, where I had the <lb/>
opportunity of examining the particularly cor<lb break="no"/>rect returns of the Militia for Lower Canada, <lb/>
and it always appears that out of a given <lb/>
population of both sexes the one-fifth part <lb/>
shows the exact number of men, between the <lb/>
ages of 18 and 60, fit for military duty. This <lb/>
is the case all the world over. The law is as <lb/>
uniform as that which determines the relative <lb/>
numbers of the two sexes; in all Christian <lb/>
countries the males being 21 and a fraction to <lb/>
20 females, while in countries where polygamy <lb/>
exists the case is exactly reversed, the females <lb/>
being 21 and a fraction, and the males 20. I <lb/>
have verified the fact that one-fifth of our <lb/>
population shows the correct number of militia<lb break="no"/>men, and if the honorable member (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
CURRIE) will apply to the Adjutant General <lb/>
he will find it was so. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MB. CURRIE</persName>—I have taken the <lb/>
figures as furnished by a colleague of the <lb/>
honorable member. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—Then my col<lb break="no"/>league must be in contradiction with myself. <lb/>
The number of militia-men in Upper Canada, <lb/>
by the last census, was 280,000, which, multi<lb break="no"/>plied by 5, gives the population, with a few to <lb/>
spare. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—I think it is now unne<lb break="no"/>cessary for me to say anything else on this <lb/>
subject, as the honorable member has been <lb/>
fully answered by my honorable friend the <lb/>
Premier. All that I need add is that accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the rule now stated, the million of <lb/>
souls in the Lower Provinces would produce <lb/>
200,000 instead of 65,000 men, all capable of <lb/>
bearing arms, those employed on the water <lb/>
being as liable to serve as those employed on <lb/>
the land. I trust we shall never require to <lb/>
muster our fighting men from any part of the <lb/>
proposed Confederation; but the best preven<lb break="no"/>tative of danger is preparedness to meet it. <lb/>
(Hear.) The honorable member next came <lb/>
to the question of the Intercolonial Railway, <lb/>
which after all seems to be his great peculiar <lb/>
horror—the great pillar which overshadows <lb/>
and oppresses him. Well, I will turn again <lb/>
to Lord DURHAM'S report, in which the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing passage, remarkably apposite to the <lb/>

            <p> This passage greatly impressed the public
<lb/>
men of the day—the LAFONTAINE-BALD<lb break="no"/>WIN Administration—in which Mr. HINCKS <lb/>
and the honorable Premier each had a <lb/>
place. It was under them that the railway <lb/>
legislation of the province received its first <lb/>
impulse, and last session I
remember to have <lb/>
had occasion to quote the preamble of an act <lb/>
passed in 1851, which recites:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>That, whereas it is of the highest
importance <lb/>
to the progress and welfare of this province, that <lb/>
a Main Trunk line of railway should be made <lb/>
throughout the length thereof, and from the <lb/>
eastern frontier thereof through the provinces of <lb/>
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to the city and <lb/>
port of Halifax; and it is therefore expedient <lb/>
that every effort should be made to ensure the <lb/>
construction of such railway. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> The second clause of the act </p>
            <p>Authorizes the Government, for the time <lb/>
being, to negotiate with the Imperial Government <lb/>
and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, for the <lb/>
construction of the line, and to bargain therefor; <lb/>
the funds to be obtained under Imperial guarantee. </p></quote>

            <p>This act, honorable gentlemen, is still in
<lb/>
force, and from the time of its passing there has <lb/>
always been an anxiety among the public men <lb/>
of Canada to accomplish the construction of a <lb/>
railway to Halifax. All our governments, <lb/>
without exception, have felt in the same way, <lb/>
and the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Administration <lb/>
took steps towards such an end. But the <lb/>
difficulties which followed stopped further pro<lb break="no"/>gress, and, in fact, had almost stopped legisla<lb break="no"/>tion altogether. Now, however, the Hon. Mr. <lb/>
BROWN himself has made the construction of <lb/>
this railway a part of the proposed Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, and has said, at a great meeting in To<lb break="no"/>ronto, that if the project contained half-a-dozen <lb/>
intercolonial railways he would go for them all. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I feel morally certain that if <lb/>
the subject were fairly discussed in every town <lb/>
in Upper Canada, nine-tenths of the people<lb/>
would go heartily for it. Indeed, the
railway<lb/>
is absolutely necessary and we cannot do<lb/>
without it. Upper Canada alone, not to
speak <lb/>
           
            <cb/>

 of Lower Canada at all, requires it, and so <lb/>
well is this understood in the Lower Provinces <lb/>
that an opponent of the Hon. Mr. TILLEY<lb break="no"/>-<persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>—has lately said it was quite <lb/>
unnecessary for New Brunswick to spend any <lb/>
money on the work, as Upper Canada must <lb/>
build it for its own sake. As to the cost of <lb/>
this road, which has been so greatly exaggera<lb break="no"/>ted, Mr. BRYDGES, who must be supposed to <lb/>
know something about the matter, has offered,
<lb/>
on behalf of an English company, to under<lb break="no"/>take the construction of the line for £3,500,000 <lb/>
sterling. Everybody knows how much that <lb/>
is, and when reciprocity is gone, Upper <lb/>
Canada will do well to build the road on its <lb/>
own account, if all the other provinces refuse. <lb/>
They will however not refuse, for the line is <lb/>equally necessary for Lower Canada and the <lb/>
other provinces, and it is a great
advantage to <lb/>
all parties that it should be so. New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick requires it to open up its
rich interior <lb/>
country which contains, as I have learned from <lb/>
advance reports of subordinate surveying en<lb break="no"/>gineers, some of the finest lands in the world. <lb/>
Halifax wants it, in order to bring freight to <lb/>
her great seaport when those of Quebec and <lb/>
Montreal are closed. It should have been <lb/>
commenced three years ago, and if it had it <lb/>
would now be built, and we should have heard <lb/>
nothing about the abolition of the Reciprocity <lb/>
Treaty. (Hear, hear.) The honorable member <lb/>
then asked why, since there was to be a disso<lb break="no"/>lution and an appeal to the people of New <lb/>
Brunswick on the subject, there should not be <lb/>
one in Canada? The answer to that has al<lb break="no"/>ready been given. The term of Parliament <lb/>
would have expired in that province on the <lb/>
1st of June, and as the members would then <lb/>
have had to go to their constituents to give an <lb/>
account of their conduct during the previous <lb/>
four years, it was thought better to anticipate <lb/>
the time of its dissolution by three or four <lb/>
months. In Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, <lb/>
however, where the elections were more <lb/>
recent, there are to be no elections. I will <lb/>
add that this mode of appealing to the people <lb/>
is not British but American, as under the <lb/>
British system the representatives of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in Parliament are presumed to be compe<lb break="no"/>tent to decide all the public questions submit<lb break="no"/>ted to them. When the unions between Eng<lb break="no"/>land and Scotland, and between England and <lb/>
Ireland were effected, there were no appeals to <lb/>
the people, it being assumed that the people's <lb/>
chosen representatives were quite competent to <lb/>
judge of the measures. (Hear,
hear.) Yet <lb/>
the members who have recently gone to the <lb/>
country have found public opinion to be de<lb break="no"/><pb n="78" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0078.jpg"/><fw type="num">78</fw>cidedly in favor of the project. One
honorable <lb/>
member (Hon. Mr. MACPHERSON) who
repre<lb break="no"/>sents 130,000 souls, has told the House that <lb/>
he has held meetings all over the vast Division <lb/>
for which he sits, and that in every case he <lb/>
has explained the subject to them without <lb/>
finding a single person to oppose it. (Hear.)
<lb/>
The honorable member for Niagara also said, <lb/>
that the project has been unfairly brought down. <lb/>
Now, I contend that it was brought down in <lb/>
the only way in which it could be submitted <lb/>
to us or to the people. Such a censure as this <lb/>
is beyond my comprehension, and it has cer<lb break="no"/>tainly not been shown to my satisfaction, nor <lb/>
I should imagine, to that if any body else, in <lb/>
what the unfairness consists. (Hear.) Next <lb/>
the honorable member attacked the financial <lb/>
terms of the scheme, and rolled up a mass of <lb/>
figures which I strongly suspected the honor<lb break="no"/>able member himself did not understand. <lb/>
Hear, and laughter.) The Minister of <lb/>
Finance fully and lucidly stated the case last <lb/>
evening, and I will read part of his speech <lb/>
to show how satisfactory the matter was <lb/>
explained. <persName ref="pers:GALT1">Hon. Mr. GALT</persName> said: <lb/>

            <p> Reasoning from these figures, Mr. GALT <lb/>
stated that the debt of Canada amounts at the <lb/>
present time to about $27 per
head, and <lb/>
that to enter into an equitable arrangement <lb/>
with the other provinces where the debts
<lb/>
were about $25 par head either ours had <lb/>
to be reduced or theirs increased ; that <lb/>
is, when made chargeable to the Confed <lb/>
eration—and as the former is the preferable
<lb/>
course, the surplus or excess of ours over $25 <lb/>
per head has to be locally assumed by Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. He also explained that the debts of
<lb/>
Prince Edward Island and of Newfoundland <lb/>
being less than $25 per head, an allowance <lb/>
had to be made to them to place them on <lb/>
an equal footing with the rest of the colonies. <lb/>
I will add, for the information of the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Niagara, the following official <lb/>
figures, which are instructive as showing that <lb/>
the people of the Maritime Provinces are a <lb/>
people who contribute, under their present tar<lb break="no"/>iffs, a considerable sum to their respective <lb/>
treasuries: <lb/>

            <p> Looking
at all these facts together, the
con<lb break="no"/>clusion appears to me irresistible
that the <lb/>
arrangement proposed is in every respect
an <lb/>
equitable one, and that it has been made with <lb/>
a view to give to each province as nearly as <lb/>
possible what is right and fair, as far as what <lb/>
is right could be discovered. No honorable <lb/>
member could wish that Canada should have <lb/>
undue advantages over the other parties
to the <lb/>
compact. The spirit in which the deliberations <lb/>
of the Conference were conducted was the <lb/>
correct one, and had its members tried to over<lb break="no"/>reach each other—had they not been impressed <lb/>
with the necessity of mutual concessions for <lb/>
the common good—no result could ever have <lb/>
been arrived at. (Hear, hear.) The next <lb/>
point the honorable member touched was the <lb/>
    
            <pb n="79" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0079.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">79</fw>
       
assets of the Lower Provinces, and he
asked <lb/>
very emphatically what they had to bring into <lb/>
the partnership. He said we had our valuable <lb/>
canals, but what had they? Well, they have <lb/>
their own railways, built with provincial money. <lb/>
New Brunswick has 200 miles, equal in value <lb/>
to eight millions of dollars; and Nova Scotia <lb/>
150 miles or thereabouts, equal to about six <lb/>
millions of dollars—though I am not sure of <lb/>
the exact extent. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—What do they pay? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS8">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—What do our canals <lb/>
pay? That, however, is not the question; our <lb/>
canals are assets and valuable assets too, even <lb/>
though they do not pay much directly, for they <lb/>
cheapen transport to an extraordinary extent. <lb/>
I remember the time when the freight of a <lb/>
barrel of flour from Toronto to Montreal cost <lb/>
one dollar, and now it is 10d; and one cwt. of <lb/>
merchandize brought back also cost one dollar <lb/>
then, but now only 1s. It is in this way that <lb/>
great public works are valuable to a country. <lb/>
As to the earnings of the Lower Province <lb/>
railways, the net profits—not the gross receipts <lb/>
—are stated, I believe, at $140,000
; $70,000 <lb/>
in New Brunswick, and $70,000 in Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, which, at any rate, is something. The <lb/>
Welland Canal, of which the
honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman spoke so much, did not pay even the <lb/>
interest on its cost; and if the canal on the <lb/>
American side of the Niagara is constructed, <lb/>
as we learn from the American press it is to <lb/>
be, the chief source of its revenue will be cut <lb/>
off, and so far from being the
best of the canals <lb/>
in a paying point of view, it will be the worst <lb/>
of all those connected with the
St. Lawrence <lb/>
navigation. Let me not be understood, how<lb break="no"/>ever, as depreciating the value of the Welland <lb/>
Canal. None is more ready than I am to <lb/>
admit that its construction was
wise, and that <lb/>
it has proved and will continue to prove bene<lb break="no"/>ficial in the highest degree. (Hear.)
The <lb/>
honorable member, living as he does on the <lb/>
very banks of the Welland Canal,
very natur<lb break="no"/>all asked how the canals are to
be enlarged? <lb/>
Well, they will be the property of the General <lb/>
Government, and when the trade requires it, <lb/>
that Government will, no doubt, appropriate <lb/>
money for the work. (Hear.) As to local <lb/>
taxation, all the provinces will put upon the <lb/>
same footing, and nothing can be fairer. If <lb/>
Upper Canada, which it is asserted is so <lb/>
much wealthier than the other portions of <lb/>
the Confederation, requires more than the
<lb/>
eighty cents per head allowed to all the <lb/>
provinces, its greater wealth will cause it <lb/>
feel the taxation so much the
less. (Hear.) <lb/>
The honorable member next attacked the pro<lb break="no"/><cb/>posed constitution of the Legislative
Council, <lb/>
and insisted not only that it should have re<lb break="no"/>mained elective, but that the principle of <lb/>
representation according to population should <lb/>
also have prevailed. But who ever heard that <lb/>
in a Federal Constitution the Upper House <lb/>
should be arranged on that principle? If <lb/>
that view be the sound one, the better way <lb/>
would be to have but one House, for the only <lb/>
effect of having two Houses, both elected on the <lb/>
basis of population, would be that one would <lb/>
constantly be combating the other, and the <lb/>
wheels of government would unavoidably be <lb/>
brought to a stand-still. In such a case the <lb/>
more powerful members of the Confederacy <lb/>
would be wholly unrestrained, and would com<lb break="no"/>pletely overwhelm the weaker. This was <lb/>fully considered on the adoption of a Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion for the United States, according to which <lb/>
it is well known that the smaller states are <lb/>
represented in the Senate by the same number <lb/>
of senators as the larger ones—there being two <lb/>
members for each. The same principle has <lb/>
been adopted in arranging the terms of this <lb/>
proposed union, and for the same reason; viz., <lb/>
to protect the weaker parties to the compact. <lb/>
(Hear.) The next point referred to by the <lb/>
honorable member related to the Common <lb/>
Schools and the fund proposed to be created <lb/>
by the Act of 1849, but as the honorable <lb/>
member has been informed, one of its pro<lb break="no"/>visions, that relating to this fund. has never <lb/>
been carried out; with respect to the other, <lb/>
my honorable friend the Commissioner of <lb/>
Crown Lands has already explained that <lb/>
the million of acres have been set apart and <lb/>
a fund year by year created, while Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment has annually set apart about $100,000 <lb/>
for the support of the schools. Upper Canada <lb/>
then has suffered no injustice in this. (Hear.) <lb/>
The honorable member at last concluded his <lb/>
remarks by drawing a sorry picture of the <lb/>
condition of Canada. According
to him, it <lb/>
was about bankrupt when a number of self- <lb break="yes"/>
appointed delegates met and devised this <lb/>
scheme for its further embarrassment. So <lb/>
far from this being the case, it is a matter <lb/>
of history that the Government was formed <lb/>
expressly for the purpose of considering and <lb/>
framing this very scheme, and getting rid of <lb/>
the dead-locks which have so injuriously affected <lb/>
the legislation of the country. It appeared <lb/>
that by the time the honorable member came <lb/>
to this part of his speech he became so excited <lb/>
that he hardly knew what he was saying. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I will conclude by reading
an <lb/>
extract from a remarkable speech delivered by <lb/>
His Honor the Speaker (the Honorable U.J.<lb/>

TESSIER) at a public meeting held in
Quebec <lb/>
in 1858, when the three delegates were in <lb/>
England pressing for Confederation. It is <lb/>
as follows :-<lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">In 1849 and 1852 there were passed acts
of <lb/>

Legislature, I pledge my best support to help <lb/>
this enterprise, and as to the Canadian nationality, <lb/>
distinct from the English or French nationality, <lb/>
composed of the best qualities of both, to which <lb/>
allusion has been made, I share in this sentiment, <lb/>
and I hope to see growing a Canadian Empire in <lb/>

this Intercolonial Railway, that may hold a posi<lb break="no"/>tion able to counterbalance the grasping power <lb/>

            <p> I refer to this able speech to show the
en<lb break="no"/>lightened views which that honorable member <lb/>
held on the subject, in common with many <lb/>
other distinguished public men. I have now <lb/>
done with the speech of the honorable member <lb/>
for Niagara, and will only say further that I hope <lb/>
the important subject before the House will <lb/>
be fully and completely discussed, so that the <lb/>
fine merits of the scheme may be thoroughly <lb/>
understood. I know it will be discussed <lb/>
calmly, with mutual forbearance and kindness, <lb/>
and with the excellent dispositions which hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen usually bring to the consi<lb break="no"/>deration of the matters submitted for their <lb/>
judgment. (Hear, hear, and applause.) I <lb/>

work by assenting to the resolutions submitted <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ALEX1">HON. MR. ALEXANDER</persName> said—I am sure <lb/>
that the members of the Government desire <lb/>
that this great question should be freely and <lb/>

state wherein they conceived any of its details <lb/>
to be defective—I am sure that the suggestions <lb/>
by the honorable gentlemen who represent the <lb/>
divisions of Victoria and Wellington will be <lb/>
duly weighed by the present Administration, <lb/>
as any other suggestions made in the spirit to <lb/>
accomplish good. But some members in both <lb/>
branches of the Legislature appear to be op<lb break="no"/>posed to the Confederation scheme
<hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi>.-<lb/>They hold that the constitutional changes pro<lb break="no"/>posed are unwise, and are fraught with great <lb/>
evil. The honorable member or Niagara Di<lb break="no"/>vision (Hon. Mr. CURRIE) appears to be of <lb/>
that number, from the very strong appeal <lb/>
which he has made to this House against the <lb/>
whole measure, and I desire to reply to some <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          
of the arguments which he pressed, no
doubt <lb/>
with very great force and ability, upon our <lb/>
attention. He objects to the whole manner in <lb/>
which the Convention was formed; he has no <lb/>
faith whatever in the result of their delibera<lb break="no"/>tions. He maintains, in the boldest manner, <lb/>
that the proposed union will be found disad<lb break="no"/>vantageous and burdensome to all the provinces
<lb/>
uniting. He produced figures, prepared be<lb break="no"/>forehand, to show that our burdens will be <lb/>
increased to the extent of at least $3,000,000
<lb/>
per annum—an increase which will be found <lb/>
oppressive to the industry of the province of <lb/>Canada. I cannot understand from what <lb/>
source he has obtained his figures to arrive at <lb/>
such a conclusion. There is no difficulty in <lb/>
our being able to form a reliable idea as to <lb/>
the future financial position of the proposed <lb/>
federal and local governments. If we make <lb/>
an estimate of the whole revenue of those <lb/>
provinces from their financial returns, taking <lb/>
the basis of 1863, we find that there will be a <lb/>
net revenue, available for the purposes of the <lb/>
General Government, after paying the subsidy <lb/>
of eighty cents per head to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, amounting to the sum of $9,643,108, <lb/>
while we are justified in assuming that the <lb/>
ordinary expenditure of the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will not exceed $9,000,000. But, of <lb/>
course, there are always certain grants which <lb/>
are not classed under ordinary expenditure, <lb/>
and we shall have to provide for the Intercol<lb break="no"/>onial Railway, and the widening and deepen<lb break="no"/>ing of the St. Lawrence canals; and suppose <lb/>
that we allow the very liberal item of $25,000,<lb break="no"/>000 for those great objects, it will be admit<lb break="no"/>ted on all sides that we shall be enabled to <lb/>
obtain this amount under the Imperial Guar<lb break="no"/>antee at four per cent., thus throwmg upon the <lb/>
federal treasury the additional annual burden <lb/>
or charge of $1,000,000, which we may, with <lb/>
perfect right, say will be met in the following <lb/>
manner. It can be clearly shewn that it rests <lb/>
entirely with ourselves, whether we cannot <lb/>
meet all the claims of ordinary expenditure <lb/>
and interest on the federal debt with the <lb/>
amount, already named, of $9,643,108; while <lb/>
I am sure that most commercial men will allow <lb/>
that, with the power which we shall have of <lb/>
imposing uniform tariff and excise duties <lb/>
throughout the whole united territory of these <lb/>
united provinces, we shall raise sufficient ad<lb break="no"/>ditional revenue to meet this large item. But <lb/>
as I have, on a former occasion, said, we must <lb/>
inaugurate the dawn of our infant
national ca<lb break="no"/>reer with the utmost care and prudence. All <lb/>
jobbery and lavish expenditure must be care<lb break="no"/>fully avoided; and if we do so, I venture to <lb/>

 prophesy
that the anticipations of my honorable <lb/>
friend from Niagara will never be realized. I <lb/>
venture to say, in the face of all his evil fore<lb break="no"/>bodings of increased burdens and debt, that we <lb/>
shall find our position greatly improved. He <lb/>
appeared in the delivery of his able and power<lb break="no"/>ful speech, very desirous to make out the <lb/>
strongest possible case, raking up even the <lb/>
public condemnation of the Provincial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary at the famous Harrington meeting. I was <lb/>
one of those who voted against Mr. SCOTT'S <lb/>
Separate School Bill, valuing, in common with <lb/>
the earnest electors at Harrington, our noble <lb/>
school system of Upper Canada, which carries <lb/>
the blessings of education throughout the <lb/>
width and breadth of the land; but the peo<lb break="no"/>ple generally are not prepared to reject the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>proposed Confederation, because of the po<lb break="no"/>sition of that question, although there are in<lb break="no"/>dividual electors who have strong convictions <lb/>
on the subject. My honorable friend also <lb/>
dwells upon the amount which will require to be <lb/>
appropriated for the militia. He appears to <lb/>
think that soldiers can be formed by magical <lb/>
influence in a day, and to effect a small saving <lb/>
he would elect to leave this magnificent ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, with its valuable homesteads, exposed <lb/>
to be swept at any moment by a ruthless
ag<lb break="no"/>gressor; or should not mind that our Canadian <lb/>
people should run the risk of being subjected <lb/>
to share the liability of three thousand mil<lb break="no"/>lions of debt, inaddition to their own burdens. <lb/>
The great body of the people of Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada have great faith in the expansion and <lb/>
growth of a young country such as this. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) They do not forget the remarkable <lb/>
fact, that after experiencing a large deficiency <lb/>
in the revenue of the country for several years, <lb/>
with also, in addition, two very indifferent <lb/>
harvests, we are in a position to
announce a <lb/>
considerable surplus of revenue
at this mo<lb break="no"/>ment; and we look forward to this consolida<lb break="no"/>tion of other great interests, full of hope, that <lb/>
it will give us a higher standing in the world <lb/>
—that it will give a great impetus to the <lb/>
growth of our population, our commerce and <lb/>
our revenue; and if the expenditure to be <lb/>
made on those great public improvements <lb/>
should swell the debt, we shall find ourselves <lb/>
in a condition of such prosperity that it will <lb/>
fall lightly upon us. There are so many con<lb break="no"/>spiring circumstances to make us
regard this <lb/>
great scheme with favor, the offspring,
as it <lb/>
is presented to us, of the large experience and <lb/>
matured judgment of the political
leaders of <lb/>
all these provinces. (Hear, hear.) We may <lb/>
venture to accept it and give it a fair trial as <lb/>
the best solution of the difficulties we have ex<lb break="no"/><cb/>perienced in working out our present
Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Union. It is very true that we have all <lb/>
opposed until now the construction of the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway, because we have had grave <lb/>
doubts as to the commercial value of that <lb/>
work, and the prospect of its being self-sus<lb break="no"/>taining; but it certainly cannot be denied <lb/>
that the unfriendly attitude assumed towards <lb/>
us by the neighboring republic in respect to <lb/>
the trade relations between the two countries, <lb/>
makes it more prudential for us thus to <lb/>
secure a winter road to the great highway <lb/>
of the world's commerce—(hear, hear)—and <lb/>
it will certainly place us in a stronger po<lb break="no"/>sition to negotiate fair and just terms in <lb/>
a renewal or modification of the Reciprocity <lb/>
Treaty. Whilst that public work is accepted <lb/>
as an indispensable part of the scheme, we are <lb/>
glad to be assured by the members of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, that the deepening and widening of <lb/>
the St. Lawrence canals will be carried out <lb/>
simultaneously. Good cannot fail to flow from <lb/>
the union if justice is thus done to all its com<lb break="no"/>ponent parts. As regards the question of <lb/>
finance, the proposition to
assume the debts <lb/>
upon a certain basis on the one hand, and to im<lb break="no"/>pose a uniform tariff on the other, with certain <lb/>
reasonable stipulations, is perhaps the nearest <lb/>
approximation to dealing out common justice <lb/>
to all, which could he arrived at, with so many <lb/>
varied interests there represented. We know <lb/>
that our own delegates contended, as we now <lb/>
contend, that it would on] have been fair and <lb/>
just that the future subsidy to be paid to each <lb/>
province of eighty cents per head should
be <lb/>
ased upon the census returns to be made <lb/>
every ten years. But this is not the moment <lb/>
to enlarge upon this point, or upon these de<lb break="no"/>tails, to which, as I have before stated, the <lb/>
great bed of my constituents take exception, <lb/>
and I will reserve myself, therefore, until we <lb/>
discuss the details <hi rendition="simple:italic">seriatim</hi>. I would only, in <lb/>
conclusion, observe, that our most enlightened <lb/>
citizens see nothing but weakness and insecur<lb break="no"/>ity in our present fragmentary
position, while <lb/>
they regard the proposed union as calculated <lb/>
in every way to give us importance, standing <lb/>
and strength—improve our credit—inspire a <lb/>
feeling of confidence in our future, and bring <lb/>
emigration to our shores. If we can look back <lb/>
with just pride to our giant growth during the <lb/>
last quarter of a century, so may we enter <lb/>
upon the extended relations now proposed <lb/>
full of hope, that with an accession of terri<lb break="no"/>tory, populaltion and
power—commencing our <lb/>
career with a volume of trade exceeding <lb/>
$137,000,000, with such boundless
resources <lb/>
to develop, and a country capable of sus<lb break="no"/><pb n="82" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0082.jpg"/><fw type="num">82</fw>taining any extent of population, there
is no <lb/>
barrier to our extension and material progress. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) We must feel that
such a field <lb/>
for human enterprise and such a position is <lb/>
calculated to give our people higher aspira<lb break="no"/>tions, and to make them cherish what may at <lb/>
the present moment be pronounced at this <lb/>
stage of our infancy but a dream; that just <lb/>
as the Russian Empire extends its powerful <lb/>
sway from the Black Sea to the polar regions, <lb/>
so may the people of British North America <lb/>
aspire to raise up a great Northern Power <lb/>
upon this continent, which shall be distin<lb break="no"/>guished for the wisdom and stability of its <lb/>
institutions, which shall emulate the parent <lb/>
countries from which its races have sprung, in <lb/>
developing their manly virtues, and in diffusing <lb/>
the blessings of a higher civilization wherever <lb/>
its population may flow. (Cheers) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:VIDA1">HON. MR. VIDAL</persName> said he cordially agreed <lb/>
with the honorable gentleman who had spoken <lb/>
in desiring a union of the provinces, and with <lb/>
the Honorable Premier in believing that if such <lb/>
union could be arranged to the satisfaction of all <lb/>
the parties concerned, it ought to be effected. <lb/>
Without exactly committing himself to the <lb/>
opinion of the Honorable Premier that this <lb/>
country was upon an inclined plane which, if <lb/>
the proposed scheme of Confederation were <lb/>
rejected, would land us in the United States, <lb/>
he nevertheless thought that the arguments <lb/>
which he had advanced to demonstrate the <lb/>
necessity of some change which would secure <lb/>
our future exemption from the difficulties
<lb/>
by which we were now beset were unanswered <lb/>
and unaswerable. Yet he was obliged to <lb/>
express his disapproval of the manner in which <lb/>
the scheme had been submitted to Parliament, <lb/>
as the course adopted entirely precluded the <lb/>
Legislature from suggesting any improvement <lb/>
or modification of its details. He felt, in <lb/>
common with all other honorable members, <lb/>
that the subject was one of vast importance; <lb/>
that we were not legislating for the mere pur<lb break="no"/>pose of escaping from unpleasant party political <lb/>
difficulties, but for the safety
and prosperity <lb/>
of our country and the welfare of our children <lb/>
and descendants, and therefore could not agree <lb/>
with the honorable member for Brock (Hon. <lb/>
Mr. BLAIR), that immediate action was neces<lb break="no"/>sary and that any delay was dangerous. Not<lb break="no"/>withstanding all that had been said of this <lb/>
country being acquainted with the scheme and <lb/>
prepared to adopt it, he did not
and could not <lb/>
believe that such was the case; in arranging <lb/>
its details no advice or assistance had been <lb/>
sought from the representatives of the people, <lb/>
and the people themselves were to have no <lb/>
  
            <cb/>
         
 voice in the matter. The scheme was as <lb/>
sumed to be perfect, and being perfect, must <lb/>
be adopted by the House without change or <lb/>
modification of any kind. It was said that <lb/>
nine-tenths of the people were in its favor ; <lb/>
he believed that a very large majority ap<lb break="no"/>proved of the general principle of union, but <lb/>
there were details of the plan which did not <lb/>
pass unchallenged. It was much to be re<lb break="no"/>gretted that the resolutions had not been in<lb break="no"/>troduced in such a way as would have per<lb break="no"/>mitted the House to place upon record its <lb/>
views in respect to any part of them which <lb/>
might be unacceptable, and to suggest to
the <lb/>
Imperial authorities who might frame the <lb/>
bill, such amendments as it
considered desir<lb break="no"/>able. He thought the honorable member for <lb/>
Wellington (Hon. Mr. SANBORN) was in <lb/>
error in proposing the amendments of which <lb/>
he had given notice,—the resolutions before <lb/>
them were not, properly speaking, resolutions <lb/>
of the House, they must be
regarded as a <lb/>
mere statement of certain agreements entered <lb/>
into by other parties and communicated to us <lb/>
for our information, and consequently could <lb/>
not in any way be altered or amended. Hon<lb break="no"/>orable members were thus placed in an ano<lb break="no"/>malous position—invited to
discuss the whole <lb/>
subject freely and their assistance requested, <lb/>
and at the same time informed that no change <lb/>
would be effected—that in fact the only <lb/>
assistance wanted was the voting for the adop<lb break="no"/>tion of the scheme as a whole. Whatever <lb/>
doubts may exist as to the change the proposed <lb/>
union might effect either for good or for ill, he <lb/>
thought there was no doubt that there would <lb/>
necessarily be a vast increase of expense in <lb/>
carrying on the Government: without men<lb break="no"/>tioning specific sums, it must be obvious that <lb/>
Canada would have to maintain two local <lb/>
legislatures with all their appurtenances, in <lb/>
addition to her share of the expense of the <lb/>
Federal Legislature, which latter could scarcely <lb/>
be expected to be less than at present. With <lb/>
to the proposed change in the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Legislative Council, he was far from <lb/>
considering it a wise step; like the honorable <lb/>
member for Niagara (Hon. Mr.
CURRIE), he <lb/>
had great regard for the right of the franchise <lb/>
as now enjoyed by the people, and felt that it <lb/>
would be improper to vote away that privilege <lb/>
of his constituents without their authority or <lb/>
assent. He had been sent here by them to assist <lb/>
in legislating under the Constitution we now <lb/>
have, and not to change it. It was admitted by <lb/>
all that the elective system had operated advan<lb break="no"/>tageously, and why then should it be aban<lb break="no"/>doned?—why initiate a retrograde move<lb break="no"/><pb n="83" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-08_Page_0083.jpg"/><fw type="num">83</fw>ment unsought for by the country ? Much <lb/>
had been said about the risk of collision <lb/>
between two elective Houses, that legislation <lb/>
might come to a dead-lock; now it was a <lb/>
remarkable fact that under the present system <lb/>
there had been no such difficulties, while both <lb/>
in England and in Canada, previous to the <lb/>
introduction of the elective
system, they had <lb/>
occurred, and on several occasions the power <lb/>
of the Crown had been called in to overcome <lb/>
them by appointing additional members. <lb/>
What would be the position of
the House <lb/>
under the new scheme ? It would be the <lb/>
most irresponsible body in the world; and if a <lb/>
dead-lock should occur there would be no way <lb/>
of overcoming it, for the casualties of death, <lb/>
resignation or acceptance of office, which had <lb/>
been so strongly insisted upon as sufficiently <lb/>
numerous to enable the Government of the <lb/>
day to modify the character of the House, <lb/>
would not in his opinion be adequate to meet <lb/>
such an exigency. Such was apparently the <lb/>
view of the Colonial Secretary; and it would <lb/>
in all probability be found necessary to leave <lb/>
the Crown unfettered in the exercise of its <lb/>
preogative of apppointment. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman concluded by saying that he <lb/>
would not now comment upon any other <lb/>
details of the scheme, as he understood the <lb/>
resolutions were to be discussed <hi rendition="simple:italic">seriatim</hi>, but <lb/>
he did not very clearly see the advantage of <lb/>
such a discussion when it was so distinctly <lb/>
stated that the only question for the House to <lb/>
determine was whether the scheme as now <lb/>
submitted, unchanged and unchangeable, <lb/>
should be rejected or adopted.
(Hear, hear.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName> said the scheme, <lb/>
it was true, must be taken as a whole, or re<lb break="no"/>jected, since it was not the property of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada alone, but of
all the other <lb/>
provinces as well. But it did not therefore <lb/>
follow that honorable members who might dis<lb break="no"/>sent from some parts of it might not inscribe <lb/>
that dissent on the journals. If the amend<lb break="no"/>ments proposed were passed, the motion for an <lb/>
Address would not be pressed; but, if they did <lb/>
not carry, then the votes of the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>bers who had supported them would be on record. <lb/>
In former days, before the yeas and nays were <lb/>
taken, it was the practice for members who <lb/>
objected to any particular measure, in confor<lb break="no"/>mity with the practice of the House of Lords, <lb/>
to enter a protest on the journals exhibiting <lb/>
their reasons for dissent, and
he knew of no <lb/>
rule which would prevent such a course from <lb/>
being pursued on the present occasion. It <lb/>
was quite in the power of honorable members, <lb/>
if they chose, to propose amendments, and so <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
      
 secure the advantage of placing their
views <lb/>
before the country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Cries of " adjourn! adjourn!" <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MOOR1">HON. MR. MOORE</persName>
said, as there was an <lb/>
evident desire for an adjournment, he would <lb/>
not occupy the time of the House for more <lb/>
than a few minutes, his intention being merely <lb/>
to refer to a portion of the remarks made <lb/>
by the honorable gentleman (Hon. Mr. VIDAL) <lb/>
who had just sat down. Though be generally <lb/>
agreed in what had been said by that honor<lb break="no"/>able member, there was one particular in which <lb/>
he (Hon. Mr. MOORE) thought he was in error. <lb/>
He (Hon. Mr. VIDAL) seemed to have become <lb/>
impressed with the idea that it was not compe<lb break="no"/>tent for the House to amend the resolutions, but <lb/>
that they should either be adopted or rejected <lb/>
as a whole. It was true the Government had <lb/>
so laid it down, but he (Hon. Mr. MOORE) held <lb/>
that the question could be dealt with in the <lb/>
same manner as any other that might come <lb/>
before the House. His honorable friend was <lb/>
also of opinion that, if no suggestions or amend<lb break="no"/>ments were to be adopted, it was wasting time <lb/>
to discuss the scheme. In this respect he <lb/>
(Hon. Mr. MOORE) begged to differ with the <lb/>
honorable gentleman, holding that it was not <lb/>
only useful, but essentially necessary that the <lb/>
details of a measure fraught with such grave and <lb/>
momentous importance to the country should <lb/>
be thoroughly discussed. A calm and con<lb break="no"/>siderate discussion—and every latitude for <lb/>
discussion—were necessary, and he hoped the <lb/>
Government would not press the measure with <lb/>
any unseemly haste, for they not only owed it <lb/>
to the Legislature, but to the
country, that <lb/>
ample opportunity for consideration of the <lb/>
project should be afforded to
the people's <lb/>
representatives. He also considered it import<lb break="no"/>ant that members should have an opportunity <lb/>
to confer with their constituents on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, in order to vote advisedly
when the time <lb/>
came; and he trusted the Government would <lb/>
not press the matter, nor hinder the expression <lb/>
of views, even if those views extended to <lb/>
amendment in certain particulars. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman then sat down, repeating <lb/>
that he thought the House might deal with <lb/>
the question as with any other that might <lb/>
come before it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The debate was then adjourned until the <lb/>
morrow. <lb/>
