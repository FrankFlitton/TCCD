<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> tion in this chamber, not fewer than fifty
have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been called</span> on since our scheme
was announced <br />
to pronounce at the polls their verdict upon it, <br />
and at the whole of them but four candidates <br />
on both sides of politics ventured to give it <br />
opposition. (Cheers.) Was I not right then <br />
in asserting that the electors of Canada had, <br />
in the most marked manner, pronounced in <br />
favor of the scheme ? (Hear, hear.) And <br />
will honorable gentlemen deny that the people <br />
and press of Great Britain have received it <br />
with acclamations of approval?—that the Gov- <br />
ernment of England have cordially endorsed <br />
and accepted it?—aye, that even the press<br />
and the public men of the United States have <br />
spoken of it with a degree of respect they never <br />
before accorded to any colonial movement? <br />
Sir, I venture to assert that no scheme of <br />
equal magnitude, ever placed before the world, <br />
was received with higher eulogiums, with <br />
more universal approbation, than the mea- <br />
sure we have new the honor of submit- <br />
ting for the acceptance of the Canadian <br />
Parliament. And no higher eulogy could, I <br />
think, be pronounced than that I heard a few <br />
weeks ago from the lips of one of the fore- <br />
most of British statesmen, that the system of <br />
government we proposed seemed to him a <br />
happy compound of the best features of the <br />
British and American Constitutions. And <br />
well, Mr. SPEAKER, might our present atti- <br />
tude in Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrest</span> the
earnest attention of <br />
other countries. Here is a people composed <br />
of two distinct races, speaking different lan- <br />
guages, with religious and social and municip- <br />
al and education institutions totally different; <br />
with sectional hostilities of such a character as <br />
to render government for many years well-nigh <br />
impossible; with a Constitution so unjust in <br />
the view of one section as to justify any resort <br />
to enforce a remedy. And yet, sir, here we <br />
sit, patiently and temperately discussing how <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> great evils and hostilities
may justly <br />
and amicably be swept away forever. (Hear, <br />
hear.) We are endeavoring to adjust har- <br />
moniously greater difficulties than have plunged <br />
other countries into all the horrors of civil <br />
war. We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">striving</span> to do
peacefully and <br />
satisfactorily what Holland and Belgium, after <br />
years of strife, were unable to accomplish. We <br />
are seeking by calm discussion to settle ques- <br />
tions that Austria and Hungary, that Den— <br />
mark and Germany, that Russia and Poland, <br />
could only crush by the iron heel of armed <br />
force. We are see ' to do without foreign <br />
intervention that which deluged in blood the <br />
sunny plains of Italy. We are striving to <br />
settle forever issues hardly less momentous <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> than those that have rent the neighboring re-
<br />
public and are now exposing it to all the hor- <br />
rors of civil war. (Hear, hear.) Have we <br />
not then, Mr. SPEAKER, great cause of thank- <br />
fulness that we have found a better way for <br />
the solution of our troubles than that which <br />
has entailed on other countries such de- <br />
plorable results? And should not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span>
<br />
one of us endeavor to rise to the magnitude <br />
of the occasion, and earnestly seek to deal <br />
with this question to the end in the same <br />
candid and conciliatory spirit in which, so <br />
far, it has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussed?</span>
(Loud cries of <br />
hear, hear.) The scene presented by this <br />
chamber at this moment, I venture to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affirm,</span>
<br />
has few parallels in history. One hundred <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> have passed away since
these provinces <br />became by conquest part of the British <br />
Empire. I speak in no boastful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spirit—I</span>
<br />
desire not for a moment to excite a painful <br />
thought—what was then the fortune of war <br />
of the brave French nation, might have been <br />
ours on that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well-fought</span> field. I
recall those <br />
olden times merely to mark the fact that here <br />
sit to-day the descendants of the victors and <br />
the vanquished in the fight of 1759, with all <br />
the differences of language, religion, civil law, <br />
and social habit, nearly as distinctly marked <br />
as they were a century ago. (Hear, hear.) <br />
Here we sit to-day seeking amicably to find a <br />
remedy for constitutional evils and injustice <br />
complained of—by the vanquished? No, sir <br />
—but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complained</span> of by the
conquerors! <br />
(Cheers by the French Canadians.) Here <br />
sit the representatives of the British popula- <br />
tion claiming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justice—only</span>
justice ; and here <br />
sit the representatives of the French popula- <br />
tion, discussing in the French tongue whether <br />
we shall have it. One hundred years have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed</span> away since the conquest of
Quebec, <br />but here sit the children of the victor and the <br />
van uished, all avowing hearty attachment to <br />
the British Crown—all earnestly deliberating <br />
how we shall best extend the blessings of <br />
British institutions—how a great people may <br />
be established on this continent in close and <br />
hearty connection with Great Britain. (Cheers.) <br />
Where, sir, in the page of history, shall we <br />
find a parallel to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this?</span> Will it
not stand as <br />
an imperishable monument to the generosity <br />
of British rule? And it is not in Canada <br />
alone that this scene is being witnessed. Four <br />
other colonies are at this moment occupied as <br />
we are—declaring their hearty love for the <br />
parent State, and deliberating with us how <br />
they may best discharge the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span>
duty en- <br />
trusted to their hands, and give their aid in <br />
developing the teeming resources of these vast <br />
