<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of its canals. The Atlantic Provinces
desire <br />
the Intercolonial Railway ; but they hold in <br />
dread the expenditure which would be en- <br />
tailed by the opening up of the North-West <br />
territory and the enlargement of the canals. <br />
Upper Canada already fears lest the Atlantic <br />
Provinces should unite with Lower Canada <br />
against her ; the French-Canadians fear for <br />
their nationality, threatened by the English <br />
majority from the other provinces, and yet <br />
Confederation so far only exists as a scheme. <br />
If our relations with the other provinces are <br />
not at present very intimate, at least there <br />
is nothing hostile in them. We regard them <br />
with interest and friendship as members of <br />
one and the same family with ourselves. <br />
We all grow together under the shelter of <br />
the English ﬂag, and in case of war with the <br />
United States, we are all ready to unite in <br />
our <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>in good faith, for our
common de- <br />
fence. But when the different provinces <br />
shall meet together in the Federal Parliament <br />
as on a ﬁeld of battle, when they have there <br />
contracted the habit of contending with each <br />
other to cause their own interests, so various <br />
and so incompatible with each other, to <br />
prevail, and when, from repetition of this <br />
undying strife, jealousy and inevitable hatred <br />
shall have resulted, our sentiments towards <br />
the other provinces will be no longer the <br />
same ; and should any great danger, in <br />
which our safety would <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">depend</span> upon our <br />
united condition, arise, it would then per- <br />
haps be found that our Federal union had <br />
been the signal for our disunion. In such <br />
a position the greatest danger would result <br />
from the neighborhood of the United States, <br />
a nation which for a long time has looked on <br />
our provinces with a covetous eye, and <br />
which has an immense army which the end <br />
of the war, probably not far distant, will <br />
leave without occupation. They will follow <br />
up our political struggles closely, will en-<br />
courage the discontented, and will soon ﬁnd<br />
an opportunity for interfering in our internal <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>being called in by the
weaker party ; <br />
history is full of similar occurrences. The <br />
Attorney General for Lower Canada pretends <br />
that the opponents of Confederation desire <br />
annexation to the United States. I ﬁnd it <br />
difﬁcult to believe in his sincerity when he <br />
expresses that opinion ; it is usually by such <br />
arguments as this that he replies to his <br />
opponents when he has no other answer to <br />
make them. One of the most justly respect- <br />
ed men in Lower Canada, a man who enjoys <br />
universal esteem, Mr. CHERBIER, who had <br />

determined, <br />
despite his repugnance to entering the lists, <br />
to raise his voice in order to warn his fellow- <br />
countrymen against the dangers of the Con- <br />
federation project. The purity of his motives <br />
could not be questioned ; being connected <br />
with no political party, he was perfectly <br />
disinterested in the course he took. It <br />
appears to me that the opinion of such a <br />
man deserved at least a respectful hearing. <br />
Instead of answering his argument, the <br />
honorable the Attorney General attempted <br />
to make him the laughing stock of this <br />
House. The Government stiﬂes the voice <br />
of those who wish to enlighten the people ; <br />
but it takes upon itself the task of enlight- <br />
ening them. Here is a work “in favor of <br />
Confederation,” published in 1865, entitled: <br />

Rêdacteur-en-chef du Journal de Québec ; </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
and also author of a work published in 1858, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
“against Confederation.” If the Govern- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ment were generous, they would distribute </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the work of 1858 at the same time with that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of 1865, in order to </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span><span style="background-color: white;"> to every one the </span><br style="background-color: white;" />

the honorable author cannot be right in both. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
In bringing these two works into contrast, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
I do not wish to make a personal attack on </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the honorable member ; the fact that he ﬁrst </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
wrote against Confederation and then in favor </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of it, is perfectly foreign to the debate. I </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
should not have mentioned the matter, were</span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;">it not that the Government make use of
the</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
work of 1865 (the second) in order to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
propagate in every direction their doctrines </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
on Confederation ; they are distributing </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
thousands of copies of the work throughout </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Lower Canada, and in order to inﬂuence the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
English-speaking population, they are having </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
it translated into English. It is, therefore, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
right to warn the people that they must </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
distrust the </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguments</span><span style="background-color: white;"> contained in that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
book ; they are diametrically opposed to the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
opinions enunciated by the author in his </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
work of 1858, in which he says, in express </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
terms, that the consequences of Confederation </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
would be the ruin of Lower Canada. Of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
course the author, in his work of 1865, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
attempts to explain his change of opinion ; </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
it is none the less true that he was wrong </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
either in 1858 or else in 1865—which ? It </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
may be said in behalf of the book of 1865 </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
