hesitation in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
giving it all the support in my power. (Hear, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
hear.) In its main features it is the very </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
scheme which was proposed by the Toronto </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Convention—only carried to a greater extent </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
than the convention thought advisable or </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
possible at the time. The speeches which </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
were delivered at that </span>convention, as well <br />
as the resolutions which were passed, shewed <br />
clearly that it was the opinion of the dele- <br />
gates there present, that a Confederation of <br />
the whole provinces would be desirable, if <br />
it were possible to attain it as speedily, as <br />
they expected they could obtain a Feder- <br />
ation of the two Provinces of Canada. <br />
That, I believe, was the sole reason <br />
why resolutions were not moved and adopt- <br />
ed in favor of the larger instead of the <br />
smaller scheme. But we have been told by <br />
the two hon gentlemen beside me—the hon. <br />
member for Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON) <br />
and the honorable member for Hochelaga <br />
(Hon. Mr. DORION)—that the scheme of the <br />
Toronto Convention took no hold upon the <br />
public mind. As to th<span style="background-color: white;">is I have to say that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
having had as fair an </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">opportunity</span><span style="background-color: white;">
perhaps as </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
most men to ascertain the feel</span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">ings</span><span style="background-color: white;">
of </span>the <br />
people in Western Canada, I can assert, <br />
without any fear of contradiction by hon. <br />
gentlemen from that part of the country, <br />
that no scheme ever took a greater or more <br />
complete hold upon the public mind in <br />
Upper Canada than the scheme of the <br />
Toronto Convention. (Hear, hear.) And <br />
for the very reason that the present scheme <br />
is merely an expansion of that one, it has <br />
received almost universal approval in Canada <br />
West. (Hear, hear.) It is true that after <br />
the Toronto Convention was held, there was <br />
not any very strong agitation in its favor. <br />
But I have observed this, that at all the elec- <br />
tions which have been held subsequent to the <br />
convention, gentlemen who have taken the <br />
