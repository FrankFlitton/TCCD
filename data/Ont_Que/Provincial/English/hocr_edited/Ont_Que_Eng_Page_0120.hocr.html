<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ping more than British America. (Hear, <br />
hear.) In 1860, the aggregate commercial <br />
navy of France was but 996,124 tons. I <br />
say then, that even as ship-owners, the British <br />
American Confederacy will occupy from the <br />
ﬁrst, a proud place among the Maritime <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> of the world—and that when
all her <br />
ships hoist a distinctive ﬂag alongside the <br />
Cross of Red, there will be few seas in which it <br />
will not be unfurled. And let me here mention <br />
a fact which came under my notice while re- <br />
cently in the Lower Provinces—a fact of great <br />
importance, and from which, I think, we, who <br />
are more inland, may well proﬁt. I learned <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that, as in the</span> British Isles, a
system of joint- <br />
stock ship-building has been spreading over <br />
many parts of the Maritime Provinces. Ships <br />
are built and owned in small shares—say in <br />
sixteenth, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thirty-second, or</span>
sixty-fourth parts, <br />
and all classes of the people are taking small <br />
ventures in the trade. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Most</span> of
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ships</span> so <br />
built are sold, but a portion, and an increasing <br />
portion, every year, are sailed, and sailed with <br />
proﬁt, by the original <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">joint-stock</span>
builders. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I was delighted to be told <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> some of those clipper
vessels which we <br />
often hear of as making wonderful trips from <br />
China and India and Australia to British <br />
ports<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> are vessels built and
owned in New <br />
Brunswick, under this joint-stock system. <br />
(Hear, hear.) So much for the building and <br />
ownership of ships. Now let me show you <br />
what will be the strength of the united pro- <br />
vinces in seafaring men. By the census of <br />
1861, it appears that the numbers of sailors <br />
and ﬁshermen were then— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Whether <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regarded</span>
merely as a lucrative <br />

British America will have a combined force <br />
of seventy thousand seamen, appears to me an <br />
immense argument in favor of the union. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) And let us look at
the pro- <br />
ducts of the labor of a portion of these men <br />
—the ﬁshermen. From the latest returns I <br />
have been able to meet with, I ﬁnd the joint <br />
products of our sea-coasts and inland lakes <br />
were, in the years named, estimated at the <br />
following values:— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> (Hear, hear.) I was unable to ﬁnd an <br />
estimate as regards Prince Edward Island, <br />
but fancy the amount there must be about <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000.</span> But, be this as it may,
so valuable <br />
a ﬁshing trade as this of the united provinces <br />
does not exist in any part of the world. And <br />
no doubt these estimates are far under the <br />
fact, as a large portion of the delicious food <br />
drawn by our people from the sea and inland <br />
waters could not possibly be included in the <br />
returns of the ﬁshery inspectors. (Hear, <br />
hear.) And let us observe, for a moment, the <br />
important part played by this ﬁshing industry <br />
in the foreign commerce of the provinces. <br />
The exports of products of the sea in the year <br />
1863 were as follows:— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Add to this, nine millions of dollars
received <br />
in the same year for new ships, and we have <br />
$16,696,021 as one year‘s foreign exports of <br />
our ship-building and ﬁshing interests. (Hear, <br />
hear.) With such facts before us as the re- <br />
sult of only a partially-developed traffic, may <br />
we not fearlessly look forward to the future in <br />
the conﬁdent hope of still more gratifying re- <br />
sults, when, by combined and energetic action, <br />
a new impetus has been given to these valua- <br />
ble branches of industry? But there remains <br />
a still more singular comparison to be made. <br />
The Minister of Finance referred to it last <br />
night—but he scarcely did justice to our <br />
position, because he excluded altogether the <br />
inland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shipping.</span> I refer to
the statement of <br />
ships annually entering and leaving our ports. <br />
Of course every one comprehends that a large <br />
amount of the tonnage entering and leaving <br />
ports on the uppper lakes is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repeated</span>
in the re- <br />
turns over an over again. This is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case,</span>
<br />
for instance, with the ferry boats between the <br />
American and Canadian shores, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carry</span>
<br />
passengers and a small quantity of goods. It <br />
would be unfair to put down the tonnage of <br />
such boats every time they enter or leave a <br />
port, as foreign commerce. Still there is a <br />
