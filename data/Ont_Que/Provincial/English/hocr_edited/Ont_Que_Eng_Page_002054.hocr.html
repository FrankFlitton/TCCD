<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Canada, in the same way that
the English <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> House of Commons
represents the Commons <br />
of England, with the same privileges, the <br />
same parliamentary usage, and the same <br />
parliamentary authority.   In settling the <br />
constitution of the Lower House, that which <br />
peculiarly represents the people, it was <br />
agreed that the principle of representation <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> based on population
should be adopted, and <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the mode of applying
that principle is fully <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> developed in these
resolutions.   When <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speak</span> of
representation by population, the <br />
House will of course understand, that univer- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> sal suffrage is not
in any way sanctioned, or <br />
admitted by these resolutions, as the basis <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> on which the
constitution of the popular <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> branch should rest.
  In order to protect <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> local interests, and
to prevent sectional <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> jealousies, it was
found requisite that the <br />
three great divisions into which British <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> North America is
separated, should be <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> represented in the
Upper House on the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> principle of
equality.   There are three great <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> sections, having
different interests, in this <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> proposed
Confederation.   We have Western <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Canada, an
agricultural country far away <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> from the sea, and
having the largest popu- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> lation who have
agricultural interests prin- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> cipally to guard.
  We have Lower Canada, <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> with other and
separate interests, and espe- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> cially with
institutions and laws which she <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> jealously guards
against absorption by any <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> larger, more
numerous, or stronger power. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> And we have the
Maritime Provinces, hav- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ing also different
sectional interests of their <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> own, having , from
their position, classes and <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> interests which we do
not know in Western <br />
Canada.   Accordingly, in the Upper House, <br />
—the controlling and regulating, but not the <br />
initiating, branch (for we know that here as <br />
in England, to the Lower House will practic- <br />
ally belong the initiation of matters of great <br />
public interest), in the House which has the <br />
sober second-thought in legislation—it is <br />provided that each of
those great sections <br />
shall be represented equally by 24 members. <br />
The only exception to that condition of <br />
equality is in the case of Newfoundland, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> has an
interest of its own, lying, as it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">does, at</span> the
mouth of the great river St. Law- <br />
rence, and more connected, perhaps, with <br />
Canada than with the Lower Provinces.   It <br />
has, comparatively speaking, no common in- <br />
terest with the other Maritime Provinces, <br />
but has sectional interests and sectional <br />
claims of its own to be protected.   It, there- <br />
fore has been dealt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> is to have a separate
representation in the <br />
Upper House, thus varying from the equality <br />
established between the other sections.— <br />
As may be well conceived, great difference <br />
of opinion at ﬁrst existed as to the constitu- <br />
tion of the Legislative Council.   In Canada <br />
the elective principle prevailed ; in the <br />
Lower Provinces, with the exception of <br />
Prince Edward Island, the nominative prin-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ciple was the rule.
  We found a general <br />
disinclination on the part of the Lower <br />
Provinces to adopt the elective principle ; <br />
indeed, I do not think there was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissent-</span>
<br />
ing voice in the Conference against the adop- <br />
tion of the nominative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principle,</span>
except from <br />
Prince Edward Island. The delegates from <br />
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfound- <br />
land, as one man, were in favor of nom- <br />
ination by the Crown.   And nomination by <br />
the Crown is of course the system which is <br />
most in accordance with the British Con- <br />
stitution.   We resolved then, that the con- <br />
stitution of the Upper House should be in <br />
accordance with the British system as nearly <br />
as circumstances would allow.   An hereditary <br />
Upper House is impracticable in this young <br />
country. Here we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>
none of the elements <br />
for the formation of a landlord aristocracy— <br />
no men of large territorial positions—no <br />
class separated from the mass of the people. <br />
An hereditary body is altogether unsuited to <br />
our state of society, and would soon dwindle <br />
into nothing. The only mode of adapting <br />
the English system to the Upper House, is <br />
by conferring the power of appointment on <br />
the Crown (as the English peers are appoint- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ed),</span> but that
the appointments should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span>
for <br />
life.   The arguments for an elective Council <br />
are numerous and strong; and I ought to say <br />
so, as one of the Administration responsible <br />
for introducing the elective principle into <br />
Canada. (Hear, hear.) I hold that this prin- <br />
ciple has not been a failure in Canada ; but <br />
there were causes—which we did not take <br />
into consideration at the time—why it did <br />
not so fully succeed in Canada as we had <br />
expected. One great cause was the enormous <br />
extent of the constituencies and the immense <br />
labor which consequently devolved on those <br />
who sought the suffrages of the people for <br />
election to the Council. For the same reason <br />
the expense—(laughter)—the legitimate <br />
expense was so enormous that men of stand- <br />
ing in the country, eminently ﬁtted for such <br />
a position, were prevented from coming <br />
forward.   At ﬁrst, I admit, men of the <br />
ﬁrst standing did come forward, but we <br />
