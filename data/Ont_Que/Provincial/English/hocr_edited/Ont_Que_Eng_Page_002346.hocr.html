</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear, hear.) When they have <br />
all things in readiness, he says to himself: <br />
“You may have power to marry me, but you <br />
cannot make me live happily." Now, had he <br />
been consulted, he would probably have made <br />
the same choice and have been fully satisfied <br />
with the alliance. As human nature is always <br />
the same, I have thought these were sufficiently <br />
strong reasons for wishing to have some delay, <br />
in order that the people, after the matter was <br />
fully before them, might cordially enter into <br />
the proposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union. I am favorably
impressed <br />
with a great many of the resolutions compos- <br />
ing this measure. I cannot, however, agree<br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> with my hon. friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ross),</span> that Upper Canada would
build the <br />
Intercolonial Railway herself rather than be <br />
without it. Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> does
not produce <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">anything that can be proﬁtably taken over <br />
the road. There is no alternative, however, <br />
but to build it, if Confederation is to be <br />
carried out. In 1862, we had a good bargain <br />
thrown open to us, but as we refused to accept <br />
it at the time, we cannot now get it without <br />
paying a higher price. Along with the ma- <br />
trimonial alliance into which we are about to <br />
enter, there will be fresh responsibilities, and <br />
I really do not think the country is quite <br />
prepared for them. (Hear, hear, and laugh- <br />
ter.) It seems we are pretty certain to form <br />
the alliance, and it is equally certain that <br />
those little responsibilities will immediately <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">spring up. (Laughter.) I think, however, <br />
th<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at we must call them great
responsibilities, <br />
and I repeat, much greater than we are pre- <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">pared for. I would make a great sacrifice
for <br />
the defence of the country, but if England <br />
tells us we must do more than the country is <br />
able to do, I do not think we will be willing <br />
to submit to it. We are prepared to do all <br />
we can, but I am not prepared to go to such <br />
an enormous expense as to involve our country <br />
in such debt as will render it an undesirable <br />
place to live in. With Confederation we will <br />
have to go to great expense, not only for our <br />
defences and our militia, but also for a navy; <br />
because I believe that, as soon as the Ameri- <br />
cans put an increased number of gun-boats <br />
on the lakes, we will have to put on an equal <br />
number, and it is very doubtful to me if we <br />
can afford it. (Hear, hear.) Where is the <br />
money to come from ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. Mr. CURRIE—Yes—where is the <br />
money to come from? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. Mr. READ—We are now very <br />
heavily taxed, and have a heavy bill to pay <br />
for interest on our large debt. I would like <br />
to see the Government adopt some method by <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> which this interest should not go out of
the <br />
country. I do not like to see so much bor- <br />
rowed from abroad. Interest is a thing that <br />
accumulates very rapidly, and it has to be <br />
paid regularly. If some system could be de- <br />
vised by which this borrowing from abroad <br />
could be stopped, the Federation scheme would <br />
suit me much better, especially when we con- <br />
sider that the taxes of the people of this <br />
country, per head, have been running up at <br />
an alarming rate—from one dollar to three— <br />
since the union, in 1841. It seems that the <br />
Confederation is to increase our taxes; that <br />
fact is generally admitted, independent of the <br />
ex use of building the Intercolonial Railway. <br />
I do not see where all the money is to come <br />
from, but I dare say the Finance Minister <br />
will ﬁnd out some means of raising it by in- <br />
creased taxation. When the ﬁnal vote comes <br />
on, I shall be prepared to support the motion <br />
rather than have it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rejected</span>
altogether, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> press my opposition no
further. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> <br />

motion: “ Provided always, that His Excel- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. Mr. DICKSON—I am desirous of <br />
calling to the notice of the House the fact <br />
that this amendment appears on the face <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
it <br />
to embody the same principle as the amend- <br />
ment proposed by the honorable member op- <br />
posite (Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CURRIE),</span> and
seconded by <br />
myself, and which, after a long and somewhat <br />
tedious discussion, was decided in the negative. <br />
I would like to know, therefore, whether the <br />
amendment is in order. I do not oppose it, <br />
but if it is not in order, time will be saved by <br />
disposing of it at once, and I rise to obtain <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speaker's</span> decision upon the
point. <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. Mr. ROSS—The objection of the <br />
honorable member is, I think, conclusive with <br />
regard to the amendment. It appears to be <br />
the same in principle as that moved by the <br />
honorable member for Niagara, and seems to <br />
me to be out of order. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. Mr. BUREAU—I think the motion <br />
is in order. It declares that before the scheme <br />
is ﬁnally adopted, it shall be referred to the <br />
people, for them to vote yes or nay upon it. <br />
