<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> cidedly in favor of the project. One
honorable <br />
member (Hon. Mr. MACPHERSON<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)</span> who
repre- <br />
sents 130,000 souls, has told the House that <br />
he has held meetings all over the vast Division <br />
for which he sits, and that in every case he <br />
has explained the subject to them without <br />
ﬁnding a single person to oppose it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear.)</span>
<br />
The honorable member for Niagara also said, <br />
that the project has been unfairly brought down. <br />
Now, I contend that it was brought down in <br />
the only way in which it could be submitted <br />
to us or to the people. Such a censure as this <br />
is beyond my comprehension, and it has cer- <br />
tainly not been shown to my satisfaction, nor <br />
I should imagine, to that if any body else, in <br />
what the unfairness consists. (Hear.) Next <br />
the honorable member attacked the ﬁnancial <br />
terms of the scheme, and rolled up a mass of <br />
figures which I strongly suspected the honor- <br />
able member himself did not understand. <br />
Hear, and laughter.) The Minister of <br />
Finance fully and lucidly stated the case last <br />
evening, and I will read part of his speech <br />
to show how satisfactory the matter was <br />
explained. Hon. Mr. GALT said: <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> With reference to the trade of this
country, he <br />
had taken the returns of 1863. The returns of <br />
the trade of Canada, in that year, taking exports <br />
and imports conjointly, showed an aggregate of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$87,795,000.</span> Taking the census of
1861, this <br />
trade represented thirty-ﬁve dollars per head of <br />
the population. The value of the import and ex- <br />
port trade of New Brunswick, for the same year, <br />
reached <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$16,729,680,</span> amounting
to sixty-six dol- <br />
lars per head of its population. The aggregate <br />
trade of Nova Scotia, for the same period, amount- <br />
ed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$18,622,359,</span> or ﬁfty-six
dollars per head of <br />
its people. And in the case of Prince Edward <br />
Island, the import and export trade amounted to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,055,568,</span> representing
thirty-seven dollars per <br />
head of the population of that colony. The value <br />
of the total trade of Newfoundland was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1
<span class="unclear" title="Number is missing a digit.">?</span>,245,-</span> <br />
032, or eighty-six dollars per head. The whole <br />
of these ﬁgures represents an aggregate trade of <br />
all the provinces, amounting to $137,447,567. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Reasoning from these ﬁgures, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">GALT</span> <br />
stated that the debt of Canada amounts at the <br />
present time to about $27 p<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">er</span>
head, and <br />
that to enter into an equitable arrangement <br />
with the other provinces where the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debts</span>
<br />
were about $25 par head either ours had <br />
to be reduced or theirs increased ; that <br />
is, when made chargeable to the Confed <br />
eration—and as the former is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preferable</span>
<br />
course, the surplus or excess of ours over $25 <br />
per head has to be locally assumed by Ca- <br />
nada. He also explained that the debts of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
Prince Edward Island and of Newfoundland <br />
being less than $25 per head, an allowance <br />
had to be made to them to place them on <br />
an equal footing with the rest of the colonies. <br />
I will add, for the information of the honor- <br />
able member for Niagara, the following official <br />
ﬁgures, which are instructive as showing that <br />
the people of the Maritime Provinces are a <br />
people who contribute, under their present tar- <br />
iffs, a considerable sum to their respective <br />
treasuries: <br />

the common good—no result could ever have <br />
