every succeeding election <br />
in both Canadas there has been an in- <br />
creasing disinclination, on the part of <br />
men of standing and political experience <br />
and weight in the country, to become can- <br />
didates ; while, on the other hand, all the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">young men, the active
politicians, those who <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> resolved
to embrace the life of a <br />
statesman, have sought entrance to the <br />
House of Assembly.   The nominative system <br />
in this country, was to a great extent success- <br />
ful, before the introduction of responsible <br />
government. Then the Canadas were to a <br />
great extent Crown colonies, and the upper <br />
branch of the legislature consisted of gentle- <br />
men chosen from among the chief judicial <br />
and ecclesiastical dignitaries, the heads of <br />
departments, and other men of the ﬁrst <br />
position in the country.   Those bodies com- <br />
manded great respect from the character, <br />
standing, and weight of the individuals <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com-</span> <br />
posing them, but they had little sympathy <br />
with the people or their representatives, and <br />
coillisions with the Lower House frequently <br />
occurred,especially in Lower Canada. When <br />
responsible government was introduced, it <br />
became necessary for the Governor of the <br />
day to have a body of advisers who had the <br />
conﬁdence of the House of Assembly <br />
which could make or unmake ministers <br />
as it chose.   The Lower House in effect<br />
pointed out who should be nominated to the <br />
Upper House ; for the ministry, being de- <br />
pendent altogether on the lower branch of <br />
the legislature for support, selected members <br />
for the Upper House from among their poli- <br />
tical friends at the dictation of the House of <br />
Assembly.   The Council was becoming less <br />
and less a substantial check on the legislation <br />
of the Assembly ; but under the system now <br />
proposed, such will not be the case.   No <br />
ministry can in future do what they have <br />
done in Canada before,—they cannot, with <br />
the view of carrying any measure, or of <br />
strengthening the party, attempt to overrule <br />
the independent opinion of the Upper House, <br />
by ﬁlling it with a number of its partisans <br />
and political supporters. The provision in <br />
the Constitution, that the Legislative Council <br />
shall consist of a limited number of members <br />
—that each of the great sections shall appoint <br />
twenty-four members and no more, will <br />
prevent the Upper House from being <br />
swamped from time to time by the ministry <br />
of the day, for the purpose of carrying out <br />
their own schemes or pleasing their parti- <br />
sans. The fact of the government being <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> prevented from
exceeding a limited number <br />
will preserve the independence of the <br />
Upper House, and make it, in reality, <br />
a separate and distinct chamber, having a <br />
legitimate and controlling inﬂuence in the <br />
legislation of the country. The objection has <br />
been taken that in consequence of the Crown <br />
being deprived of the right of unlimited <br />
appointment, there is a chance of a dead <br />
lock arising between the two branches of <br />
the legislature ; a chance that the Upper <br />
House being altogether independent of the <br />
Sovereign, of the Lower House, and of the <br />
advisers of the Crown, may act indepen- <br />
dently, and so independently as to produce <br />
a dead lock.   I do not anticipate any such <br />
result.   In the ﬁrst place we know that in <br />
England it does not arise.   There would <br />
be no use of an Upper House, if it did <br />
not exercise, when it thought proper, the <br />
right of opposing or amending or postponing <br />
the legislation of the Lower House.   It <br />
would be of no value whatever were it a mere <br />
chamber for registering the decrees of the <br />
Lower House.   It must be an independent <br />
House, having a free action of its own, for it <br />
is only valuable as being a regulating body, <br />
calmly considering the legislation initiated <br />
by the popular branch, and preventing any <br />
hasty or ill considered legislation which may <br />
come from that body, but it will never set <br />
itself in opposition against the deliberate <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understood</span>
wishes of the people.   Even <br />
the House of Lords, which as an hereditary <br />
body, is far more independent than one <br />
appointed for life can be, whenever it <br />
ascertains what is the calm, deliberate <br />
will of the people of England, it <br />
yields, and never in modern times has <br />
there been, in fact or act, any attempt to <br />
overrule the decisions of that House by the <br />
appointment ot new peers, excepting, per- <br />
haps, once in the reign of Queen Anne.   It <br />
is true that in 1832 such an increase was <br />
threatened in consequence of the reiterated <br />
refusal of the House of Peers to pass the <br />
Reform Bill.   I have no donbt the threat <br />
would have been carried into effect, if neces- <br />
sary ; but every one, even the Ministry who <br />
advised that step, admitted that it would be <br />
a revolutionary act, a breach of the Consti- <br />
tution to do so, and it was because of the <br />
necessity of preventing the bloody revolution <br />
which hung over the land, if the Reform Bill <br />
had been longer refused to the people of Eng- <br />
land, that they consented to the bloodless <br />
revolution of overriding the independent <br />
