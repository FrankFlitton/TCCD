free from Canada. There is a large manu- <br />
facture of such articles, and with them, as <br />
with some other articles we make, we might <br />
supply the Lower Province markets. (Hear, <br />
hear.) If there is one feature in our con- <br />
nection with the Lower Provinces which we <br />
must not lose sight of, it is their possessing <br />
coal in large quantities; this is sure eventu- <br />
ally to create manufacturing communities <br />
amongst them, to increase their population, <br />
and cause a larger home demand than at <br />
present, for the agricultural productions of <br />
Western Canada. (Hear, hear.) I may <br />
now recur to the Intercolonial Railway ques- <br />
tion, and express a hope that it will be gone <br />
about by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> in the
most econo- <br />
mical manner possible. This much may be <br />
said. that whatever money is spent on it will <br />
be spent in the country, that is, in our new <br />
country, will be spent among ourselves, and <br />
will attract a great army of laborers; and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I </span>do hope and trust the
Administration <br />
will so arrange the prosecution of the <br />
work, that these laborers shall be induced <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> settle on the lands traversed
by the <br />
hue, which, I am told, are very favorable <br />
to settlement, so that another market for our <br />
manufactures and productions may be formed ; <br />
and that if the Reciprocity Treaty should be <br />
lost to us (an event which I deprecate as <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> much as anyone), we may have something to
<br />
fall back upon—which we shall have, hon. gen- <br />
tlemen, if we look at our position boldly and <br />
energetically, and take advantage of circum- <br />
stances as they arise (Hear, hear.) With <br />
respect to the statement that the road will <br />
not be valuable for purposes of defence, not <br />
being a military man, that is, nothing more. <br />
than a militia oﬁcer, I do not pretend to <br />
offer a very valuable opinion: but it appears <br />
to me that, removed a certain distance from <br />
the frontier as it will be, an attack on the <br />
railway must be next to impossible in the <br />
winter time; besides, it will be our duty to <br />
guard our frontier in such a way that incur- <br />
sions cannot be made upon us with effect, <br />
and I hope we shall be able to do so. <br />
(Hear, hear.) It has been remarked that the <br />
English Government would not think of send- <br />
ing a military force from Halifax to Canada <br />
by railway, but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confess</span> I
differ from this <br />
view. In the war which is now going on in <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the United States, if it has been proved
that <br />
railways can be easily broken up, it has also <br />
been proved that they can easily be relaid, <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and the value set upon them by military
men <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> is clearly exemplified by the struggles
they <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> make to gain or to retain possession of
them. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If a railway is partially broken up, they
have <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> appliances at hand quickly to repair it.
It <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> is a part of modern warfare to lay
railways <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and lines of telegraph, and armies have
corps <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> attached to them whose special duty this
is. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> (Hear, hear.) There is another thing, <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> important in a military point of view,
which <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> has been lost sight of—which is, that
although <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> soldiers might walk over the snow,
military <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> munitions and the heavy articles used in
war, <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> such as cannon and mortars, can not be
put on <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> snow-shoes. (Hear, hear, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laughter.)</span> I <br />
think the railway would be of incalculable <br />
value for transporting such things as these <br />
if there were occasion for it, which I hope <br />
there never will be. It is, however, meet to <br />
be prepared for such an eventuality as war, <br />
for that is the best way to avoid it. (Hear, <br />
hear.) I may here refer to what some <br />
honorable gentlemen have remarked in this <br />
debate, that the circumstance of certain <br />
portions of the population of the Lower <br />
Provinces being occupied in maritime pur- <br />
suits, diminishes to that extent their power <br />
of aiding Canada in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case</span> of war.
In this <br />
opinion am unable to concur; for if there <br />
be one arm more than another in which <br />
they can assist us, it is by the aid of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span>
<br />
hardy seafaring population, who will swarm <br />
the seaports of the Confederacy and the <br />
