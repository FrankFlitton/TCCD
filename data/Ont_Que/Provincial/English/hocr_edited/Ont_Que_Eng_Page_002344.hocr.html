<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and the rights of the electors who sent
us here, <br />
that I desire to make a very few remarks to <br />
explain why I, representing a Lower Canadian <br />
division, a majority of whom will be amongst <br />
the minority of the Lower Canada of the <br />
future, have decided that it is my duty to vote <br />
for the resolutions of the Quebec Conference <br />
as they have been laid before us by the <br />
Government, and consequently against all the <br />
amendments. I am free to confess, honorable <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen,</span> that there are among
the resolu- <br />
tions some that I would have gladly seen, as I <br />
conceive, amended; but considering, from the <br />
nature of the thing itself, and therefore fully <br />
concurring in what many of as heard from an <br />
eminent and distinguished statesman in another <br />
place, that the whole scheme of Confederation <br />
partook of the nature of a treaty, into which, <br />
as a matter of course, the spirit of compromise <br />
must largely enter; and the Government hav- <br />
ing, as I also consider they were bound to do, <br />
informed us we must accept the scheme as a <br />
whole, or reject it as a whole, I conceived it <br />
was my duty not to be a bar in the way, <br />
however humble, of the passage of the resolu- <br />
tions, and I came to this conclusion the more <br />
willingly because I have been for a long time <br />
an advocate for a union of the provinces, and <br />
I have been so because it is indisputable that <br />
a much greater <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">share</span> of our
self-defence must <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rest</span> upon ourselves than
heretofore; and <br />
though at the best our means of defence may <br />
not be as great as we could wish, yet it must <br />
be manifest they must be greater by being <br />
consolidated under one head. Some hon. gen- <br />
tlemen, especially my neighbor from St. Clair, <br />
have ridiculed the idea of Confederation in- <br />
creasing our powers of defence, inasmuch as <br />
under the best of circumstances it must take a <br />
long time to perfect our arrangements; but I <br />
would ask hon. gentlemen to consider what <br />
will be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> in England,
as to our defences, <br />
if we reject or even postpone this scheme of <br />
Confederation, coming as it would on the <br />
heels of a rejected Militia Bill. During the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion,</span> we have had, if the
term is par- <br />
liamentary and may be used, many fancy ﬁnance <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statements.</span> Now, without
disputing the cor- <br />
rectness of any of them, I would ask the <br />
honorable gentlemen who have made them, <br />
have they made any calculation as to the costs <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">we would be at after we had been gobbled
up <br />
by our neighbors south of 45°, or, to use the <br />
words of the honorable and gallant Knight the <br />
Premier, after we had slid down the inclined <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plane,</span> and become merged in the
neighboring <br />
republic? I for one would say that such a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> was altogether too
oontemptible to <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> occupy. With reference to the change
doing <br />
away with our elective Legislative Council, of <br />
which we have heard so much, I for one can <br />
say that I consider the delegates came to <br />
the only correct conclusion, and this is no new <br />
conclusion, and involves no change of opinion <br />
on my part, for I can appeal to an honorable <br />
member of this House as to whether, within <br />
half an hour of taking my seat in it, I did <br />
not express the opinion that though it was not <br />
right to speak ill of the bridge over which one <br />
had crossed safely, yet that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I was</span>
opposed to <br />
the elective system as applied to this House. <br />
I also dissent from the sentiments I have heard <br />
expressed by many honorable members of this <br />
House as to our position here, for I never <br />
understood that I came here as the mere <br />
delegate of the men of Inkerman, to vote just <br />
as the most active village politicians happened <br />
to pull the wires for me. No, gentlemen, I <br />
came here, as I thought, as the representative <br />
of my division, to do my best according to <br />
my humble ability in legislating for the <br />
beneﬁt of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whole</span> country, and
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> no <br />
other circumstances would I have accepted <br />
the position. I shall not occupy your time, <br />
honorable gentlemen, in saying that which has <br />
been better said by others; but thanking you <br />
for the few moments’ hearing you have so <br />
kindly given me, conclude by reducing my <br />
explanations as follows: I vote for Confeder- <br />
ation because I consider it essential to the <br />
maintenance of British connection, and to <br />
preserve that, I for one am prepared to make <br />
man sacrifices. (Hear, hear.) <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. BLAKE—I feel it to be my <br />
duty, honorable gentlemen, to make a few <br />
remarks upon the general question of Federa- <br />
tion before the vote is taken. A great deal <br />
has been said about the manner in which the <br />
scheme has originated. It has been said that <br />
the honorable gentlemen composing the Con- <br />
ference were self-elected. Now I hold that <br />
it is most unfair to charge honorable gentle- <br />
men who have, as members of a government, <br />
entered into this matter at the request of His <br />
Excellency the Governor-General, with a sin- <br />
cere desire to do the best that could be done <br />
for the interests of Canada, with being too <br />
precipitate, especially when the subject was <br />
surrounded with so much difficulty. Although <br />
I have been an advocate of a union of the <br />
provinces for very many years, yet I am fully <br />
prepared to admit that there are some matters <br />
of detail in these resolutions that are very <br />
distasteful to me. I refer particularly to the <br />
abandonment of the elective principle in the <br />
constitution of this branch of the Legislature. <br />
