<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> (Hear, hear.) Here, sir, was a Government
<br />
formed seven years ago for the express purpose <br />
of doing that which we are now engaged in— <br />
a Government distinctly telling the Governor <br />
General that the ace and prosperity of the <br />
country were an angered because constitu- <br />
tional remedies were deferred; and yet my <br />
honorable friends opposite, who with me were <br />
responsible for that document, tell us that we <br />
are not now in a ﬁt position to legislate upon <br />
this question. (Hear, hear.) But I come <br />
next to the famous despatch to the Colonial <br />
Minister, signed in 1858 by my honorable <br />
friend the Minister of Finance, the Attorney <br />
General East, and the Hon. JOHN ROSS. It <br />
stated that “very grave difficulties now pre- <br />
sented themselves in conducting the Govern- <br />
ment of Canada”—that “the progress of pop- <br />
ulation has been more rapid in the western <br />
section, and claims are now made on behalf of <br />
its inhabitants for giving them representation <br />
in the Legislature in proportion to their num- <br />
bers”—that “ the result is shown by an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agita-</span><br />
tion fraught with great danger to the peaceful <br />
and harmonious working of our constitutional <br />
system, and, consequently, detrimental to the <br />
progress of the province"—that “this state of <br />
things is yearly becoming worse”—and that <br />
“the Canadian Government were impressed <br />
with the necessity of seeking for such a mode <br />
of dealing with these difficulties as may for <br />
ever remove them.” What must have been <br />
the state of public feeling when the Conserva- <br />
tive Government of 1858 ventured to use such <br />
language as this ?—and how can any one pre- <br />
tend that the people do not comprehend this <br />
question, when seven years of agitation have <br />
passed since that document was penned? <br />
(Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, I come to <br />
a still more important document—one that <br />
goes into the details and the merits of just <br />
such a scheme as that before the House. I <br />
refer to the manifesto issued, in 1859, by the <br />
Lower Canada members of the liberal party <br />
in this House. (Hear, hear.) It is very long, <br />
and I will only read from it a few extracts:— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The proposition to federalize the
Canadian <br />
union is not new. On the contrary, it has been <br />
frequently mooted in Parliament and in the press <br />
during the last few years. It was, no doubt, sug- <br />
gested by the example of the neighboring states,<br />
where the admirable adaptation of the Federal<br />
system to the Government of an extensive terri- <br />
tory, inhabited by people of diverse origins, creeds, <br />
laws and customs, has been amply demonstrated ; <br />
but shape and consistency were ﬁrst imparted to <br />
it in 1856, when it was formally submitted to <br />
Parliament by the Lower Canada Opposition, as <br />
offering, in their judgement, the true corrective of <br />
the abuses <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generated under</span> the

additional checks on expenditure involved in the <br />
new system, and the more direct responsibility of <br />
public servants in the province to the people im- <br />
mediately affected by such expenditure, be entire- <br />

dress?—on whose special responsibility was <br />
this manifesto sent forth to the world? Why, <br />
it was signed by my honorable friend opposite, <br />
Hon. A. A. DORION—(cheers and laughter) <br />
—Hon. T. D. MCGEE, Hon. L. T. DRUMMOND, <br />
and HON. L. A. DESSAULLES<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> four
of the <br />
most able and most popular leaders of the <br />
Lower Canada liberal party—the party now <br />
virulently opposing the resolutions before the <br />
Chair. (Hear, hear.) So my honorable <br />
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. DORION) not only <br />
agitated the country for constitutional changes, <br />
but insisted that it should take the shape of <br />
a Federal union, because of the cheapness of <br />
that system and the facility it afforded for <br />
bringing within the federation the other <br />
British American Provinces—(cheers and <br />
laughter)-—and yet, six years after the promul- <br />
gation of this document, my honorable friend <br />
gets up and repudiates a Federal union <br />
