appears to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them to require </span>further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span> whether,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> if <br />

ence of opinion shall arise between them. <br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now the point of this (Mr. CARDWELL'S) <br />
objection clearly is to the number being ﬁxed, <br />
not to the principle of nomination, nor to <br />
members being appointed for life. (Hear, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> Like many honorable
gentlemen in <br />
this House, there are certain of the clauses <br />
in these resolutions which, I think, might <br />
have been improved. I, for instance, might <br />
have preferred the Confederate seat of gov- <br />
ernment being established elsewhere than at <br />
Ottawa; and, with reference to this subject, <br />
I have been much struck with a remark, <br />
which I will cite, from a recent writer, who <br />
says that—“Any country compelled to fore- <br />
go the use of its natural chief city, and make <br />
some inferior and ill-placed town the seat of <br />
its government, labors under incalculable <br />
disadvantages.” Everybody, however, has <br />
his own little bantling, and thinks it <br />
the handsomest in the world; and I <br />
doubt very much if, after all, we should <br />
have made the plan of Confederation much <br />
better, had every one of us been consult- <br />
ed and taken into the Conference, at Charlotte- <br />
town or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec,</span> to urge our own
special views. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I rather infer, from the dif- <br />
ferences of opinion I have heard around me <br />
in these debates, that the compromise system <br />
would not have been so easily adopted by us <br />
as by the gentlemen who composed these <br />
conferences. I hope, however, that we shall <br />
adopt that system now, and get through the <br />
debate in the faith that they have done what <br />
is best for the interests at the country, and <br />
that the measure is so important, as a whole, <br />
as to render it unwise to place minor impedi- <br />
ments in its way to interrupt its course. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I have marked several sec- <br />
tions of the resolutions which I think are <br />
open to objection or susceptible of improve- <br />
ment, and I hope the honorable and gallant <br />
Knight at the head of the Government will <br />
give some explanations respecting the views <br />
which animated the Conference in reference <br />
to them. One of them is a matter in which <br />
Lower Canada is somewhat peculiarly inter- <br />
ested—the system of marriage and divorce, <br />
which, I see, is to be left in the hands of the <br />
Federal Government. I hope nothing will <br />
be done by the General Government, in rela- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> tion to this action, which will outrage
the <br />
feelings of Lower Canada, or lead to the <br />
laxity, in dealing with the marriage tie, <br />
which prevails south of the line 45°. (Hear, <br />
hear.) Again, emigration is a subject which <br />
is left to the Local as well as the General <br />
Government to deal with. I think it should <br />
be under the care of the General Govern- <br />
ment entirely. Then, as to the question of <br />
education, I hope that the Government will secure <br />
to Roman Catholics in Upper Canada the <br />
same rights which will be extended to Pro- <br />
testants in Lower Canada. To have the same <br />
privileges is only equal justice, which I trust <br />
and believe will be granted. Having been <br />
in communication with several of the Roman <br />
Catholic clergy, I can say that they desire to <br />
have every justice done to their Protestant <br />
fellow-subjects, but expect to have the same&nbsp;<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privileges </span>granted to Roman
Catholics in <br />
Upper Canada (who are the minority there,)
<br />
as will be given to the Protestant minority <br />
in Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) I must <br />
also refer to the clause which gives to local <br />
governments the right of dividing the sec- <br />
tions of the Confederation into constituencies <br />
and electoral divisions. This power may <br />
become very dangerous and lead to great <br />
practical injustice, and should, I think, be <br />
placed in the hands et the General Govern- <br />
ment. I come now to the question of rail- <br />
way extension, and this is a matter which <br />
seems to have been a serious stumbling-block <br />
to a great number of those who are really <br />
favorable to the measure of Confederation. <br />
Now, I do not think the Intercolonial Railway <br />
will be a proﬁtable concern, all at once; but <br />
I think I can remove a few of the objections <br />
which have been raised to this part of the <br />
scheme. In the ﬁrst place, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span>
a mistake <br />
prevails as to what will be the cost of carrying <br />
freight on this railway. I have here the annual <br />
Trade and Navigation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Returns</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> <br />
Brunswick for 1863, in which I ﬁnd the <br />
following statement:— <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_14" title="bbox 1655 4292 3117 5117">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If New Brunswick was connected with Mon- <br />
treal and Quebec by direct railway communication <br />
through British territory, our importations from <br />
the States would decrease immediately, and much <br />
of our ﬂour and other supplies would come direct <br />
from Canada; and in the event of the Reciprocity <br />
Treaty and the bonding system of the Unit<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />ed <br />
States, which allows British goods to pass through <br />
their territory free of duty under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bond</span>
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> <br />
being abolished, Saint John would probably <br />
become the Atlantic shipping port of Canada for <br />
the winter months. <br />
