<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> view. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span>
have the advantage of getting <br />
the money in the winter, it is true, but how <br />
do we get it? By losing a large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount.</span>
<br />
For my part, I do not believe in getting <br />
only 33. 9d. for a dollar’s worth of produce. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) And I am satisfied
that <br />
when our farmers get to understand the <br />
question, they never will consent to be taxed <br />
for the construction of any such road. <br />
Taking the cost of transportation at two <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents</span> per ton per mile, and the
distance from <br />
Halifax to Belleville at 831 miles, we ﬁnd it <br />
would cost $16.62 to transport a ton of goods <br />
between the two places. And at such ﬁgures, <br />
does any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honorable</span> gentleman who
has the <br />
slightest knowledge of commercial transac- <br />
tions believe for a moment that merchandise <br />
could be sent over the road at any such rates? <br />
Supposing you reduce the rate one cent, <br />
it would still cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$8.31,</span> which
would pre- <br />
clude the possibility of carrying freight over <br />
the road; so that, in a commercial point of <br />
view, the road would be perfectly useless. <br />
It is true that under our present system of <br />
banking, our bankers endeavor to enforce on <br />
the purchasers of produce the necessity of <br />
immediate shipments and immediate sales, <br />
and with that view cause them to draw for <br />
their accommodation at short dates; but it <br />
is also true that by such a practice the far- <br />
mer is in every instance the loser. The <br />
reason of this custom is that the banks want <br />
quicker returns. But I contend that the <br />
banks should be prepared to advance money <br />
at such dates as will enable the producer to <br />
so sell his produce as to get from it a remu- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nerative</span> return for his labor.
But this it <br />
not done. It seems that the tendency of <br />
everything is to force freight down the rail- <br />
ways during the winter season, and to this <br />
end money is advanced at short dates, the <br />
farmer being the chief loser by the transac- <br />
tion. Then the Intercolonial Railway is <br />
advocated as a military necessity. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span>
<br />
that it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">essential</span> for the
defence of the <br />
country, to enable the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">transportation</span>
of troops <br />
and military stores. I think, hon. gentlemen, <br />
we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> to look across the
lines and see <br />
what has taken place during the war in the <br />
State of Virginia and in other states, to <br />
convince us at once that for the purpose of <br />
moving troops and heavy supplies, such as <br />
artillery and ammunition, these roads are of <br />
very little use. You will ﬁnd that they <br />
have been cut in almost every direction, <br />
and the facilities they were supposed to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posse</span>ss for transportation have
been proved <br />
to be well nigh worthless for any practical <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> purpose,—and that, too, in a country
where <br />
they are able in a short time to rebuild <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span>
<br />
portions of the roads which may be destroyed. <br />
But how would it he on the Intercolonial <br />
Railway? That road is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intended</span>
to run <br />
through a country near the boundary of the <br />
State of Maine, over which troops could be <br />
distributed at given points so as, in case of <br />
necessity, to break up the Intercolonial Rail- <br />
way in every direction and to prevent the <br />
transportation of troops and munitions of <br />
war during the winter. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> AN HON. MEMBER—They would be <br />
unable to reach it so as to cut it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">FLINT—That</span>
is a very curious <br />
idea: “ They cannot reach it.” I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">look</span>
upon <br />
the Americans as a class of persons who can <br />
cut their way wherever they wish to go. <br />
Nothing would be easier than for them to <br />
cut the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Intercolonial</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> But if it <br />
were really the case that the country to be <br />
traversed by the Intercolonial Railway is of <br />
such a nature that no one could get through <br />
to it, the sooner we cease saying anything <br />
further about it the better. (Hear.) For <br />
if the country is in such a state that it is <br />
impossible for men to travel through it, I see <br />
no benefit in having such a railway. (Hear. <br />
hear.) These are my views in reference to <br />
the railway. In the ﬁrst place I do not feel <br />
inclined to pay the large sum of money it is <br />
going to cost, without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knowing</span>
how much <br />
will be required. There is no knowing how <br />
much it will cost Upper Canada for her pro- <br />
portion—whether it is to be $12,000,000, <br />
$15,000,000, or $20,000,000. But taking <br />
into consideration the amount of debt we <br />
will have to assume, together with our appor- <br />
tionment of the $62,500,000 assigned to <br />
Upper and Lower Canada. as also that por- <br />
tion yet unprovided for by the resolutions; <br />
I think that by the time the Intercolo- <br />
nial Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> built, Upper
Canada will be <br />
saddled with at least $50,000,000 as her <br />
share of debt. I do not see how it is pos- <br />
sible for the people to bear up under such a <br />
weight; nor do I believe that, if the under- <br />
stood this matter as they ought to understand <br />
it, they would give their consent to us to <br />
vote for it. It may be thought, perhaps, that <br />
I am not in favor of Confederation. But such <br />
is not the case. I would much desire the <br />
Federation of all the provinces; but while <br />
I would desire the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federation</span> of
all the pro- <br />
vinces, I do desire that that Federation <br />
should be based on true and proper princi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ples--that</span> every portion of these
provinces <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Her Majesty’s dominion should
share and <br />
