<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> does not ﬁnd its best solution in a large
inﬂux <br />
of immigration. The larger our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population,</span>
<br />
the greater will be our productions, the more <br />
valuable our exports, and the greater our <br />
ability to develop the resources of our country. <br />
The greater the number of tax-payers, and the <br />
more densely they are settled, the more lightly <br />
will the burden of taxation fall upon us all. <br />
And in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> of
immigration is found <br />
the only true solution of the problem of defence. <br />
Fill up our vacant lands, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">double</span>
our popula-<br />
tion, and we will at once he in a position to <br />
meet promptly and effectually any invader <br />
who may put his foot with hostile intent upon <br />
our soil. (Hear, hear.) And this question <br />
of immigration naturally brings me to the <br />
great subject of the North-West territories. <br />
(Hear, hear.) The resolutions before us <br />
recognize the immediate necessity of those <br />
great territories being brought within the <br />
Confederation and opened up for settlement. <br />
But I am told that, while the Intercolonial <br />
Railroad has been made an absolute condition <br />
of the compact, the opening up of the Great <br />
West and the enlargement of our canals have <br />
been left in doubt. Now, sir, nothing can be <br />
more unjust than this. Let me read the reso- <br />
lotions:— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span>
General Government shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secure,</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">without</span> delay, the completion of
the Intercolonial <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> from Rivière du Loup,
through New <br />
Brunswick, to Truro in Nova Scotia. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">communications</span>
with the North-West- <br />
ern Territory, and the improvements required <br />
for the development of the trade of the Great <br />
West with the seaboard are regarded by this <br />
Conference as subjects of the highest importance <br />
to the Federated Provinces, an shall be prose- <br />
cuted at the earliest possible period that the state <br />
of the ﬁnances will permit. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Confederation is, therefore, clearly
com- <br />
mitted to the carrying out of both these en- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terprises.</span> I doubt if there was a
member of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Conference who did not
consider that the <br />
Opening up of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-West</span> and
the improve- <br />
ment of our canal system, were not as clearly <br />
for the advantage of the Lower Provinces as <br />
for the interests of Upper Canada. Indeed, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> gentleman held that the Lower
Pro- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vinces</span> were more interested—they
wished to <br />
get their products into the west—they wanted <br />
a back<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> country as much as we did—they <br />
wanted to be the carriers for that great <br />
country<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—and</span> they were, therefore,
to say the <br />
least, as much interested in these questions as <br />
we were. But honorable gentlemen lay stress <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> the point, that, while the
one enter- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prise</span> is to be undertaken at
once, the other <br />
is not to be commenced until the state of the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> finances will permit. No doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this is corrects,</span> <br />
and the reason for it is simply this—the <br />
money has already been found for the Inter- <br />
colonial Railway. They must be well aware that <br />
the late Government (the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MACDONALD-SICOTTE</span>
<br />
Administration) agreed to build the Intercolo- <br />
nial Railway, and obtained from the Imperial <br />
Government a guarantee of the debentures for <br />
building it—so that that money is ready at a <br />
very low rate of interest, whenever required. <br />
We know where to ﬁnd the money for one enter— <br />
prise at a rate we are able to bear, and can thus <br />
at once go on with a work which must be gone <br />
on with if this union is to be consummated. <br />
But we don’t know this of the other great <br />
work—and we all felt that it would be exceed- <br />
ingly indiscreet—I, myself, as the special ad- <br />
vocate of opening up the Great West and of <br />
the enlargement of our canals<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,—felt</span>
that I <br />
could not put my name to a document which <br />
declared that at all hazards, while our ﬁve <br />
per cent. debentures were quoted at 75 or <br />
80 per cent. in the money <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">market—we</span>
would <br />
commence at once, without an hour’s delay, <br />
any great public work whatever. (Hear, <br />
hear.) Honorable gentlemen opposite must not <br />
imagine that they have to do with a set of <br />
tricksters in the thirty-three gentlemen who <br />
composed that Conference. What we have <br />
said in our resolutions was deliberately adopted, <br />
in the honest sense of the words employed, and <br />
not for purposes of deception. Both works <br />
are to go on at the earliest possible moment <br />
our ﬁnances will permit, and honorable gen- <br />
tlemen will ﬁnd the members of the Cabinet <br />
from Lower, as well as from Upper Canada, <br />
actuated by the hearty desire to have this <br />
whole scheme carried out in its fair meaning. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CARTIER—Hear, hear ! <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. GALT—Hear, hear !<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—When recently in <br />
England, I was charged to negotiate with the <br />
Imperial Government for the Opening up of <br />
the North-West territories. In a few days <br />
the papers will be laid before the House, <br />
and it will then be seen whether or not <br />
this Government is in earnest in that matter. <br />
Sir, the gentlemen who formed the Conference <br />
at Quebec did not enter upon their work with <br />
the miserable idea of getting the advantage of <br />
each other, but with a due sense of the great- <br />
ness of the work they had on hand, with an <br />
earnest desire to do justice to all, and keeping <br />
always in mind that what would benefit one <br />
section in such a union must necessarily benefit <br />
the whole. (Cheers) It has always appeared <br />
to me that the opening up of the North-West <br />
ought to be one of the most cherished <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">projects</span>
