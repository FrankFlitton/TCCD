<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> destruction. The resolution before the <br />
House is not, as I said before, aimed at <br />
the destruction of the scheme ; and I hope, <br />
before the debate closes, the Government <br />
will see the propriety and the advisability of <br />
granting the reasonable delay therein asked <br />
for. Suppose the Government concedes even <br />
the short delay of one month, it can do no <br />
possible harm to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure.</span> If
the mea- <br />
sure be good—if it be so desirable as the <br />
governments of the respective provinces tell <br />
us it is—the simple permitting it to stand <br />
over for a month will certainly not destroy <br />
it. If, on the other hand, it be bad—if it <br />
contain within itself the elements of decay— <br />
it is better to know it now than hereafter, <br />
when the resolutions will have been embodied <br />
in a Statute over which we have no control. <br />
To shew my own feeling in the matter, all <br />
I have to say is this : give a reasonable <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delay</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allow</span> the section of the country I <br />
have the honor to represent to speak on the <br />
subject, and if it be found to be the will of <br />
my constituents that the measure in its <br />
present shape be adopted, honorable gentle- <br />
men may be assured that I shall give them <br />
no further opposition ; and that instead of <br />
doing everything in my power to impede the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">progress</span> of these resolutions, I
will do nothing <br />
to impede their progress through the House. <br />
“ But," say hon. gentlemen, “ delay means <br />
defeat.” If it be a good measure—if it <br />
commend itself to the approval of the people, <br />
supported as it is by the most able and <br />
brilliant men in Parliament—the scheme is <br />
in no danger. And, hon. gentlemen, sup- <br />
posing a month’s delay is granted, we will <br />
even then be further advanced with the <br />
measure than the people of the eastern pro- <br />
vinces. The writs for the elections in New <br />
Brunswick are returnable, if I mistake not, <br />
on the 25th March. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—On the 9th <br />
March. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—Then it will be at <br />
least the 21st or 22nd of March before the <br />
Legislature of that colony can be called <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together.</span> <br />

MR. CAMPBELL — I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misunder-</span> <br />
stood the statement made by my hon. friend. <br />
What I meant to say was that the Legislature <br />
of New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick,</span> is expected to
assemble <br />
on the 8th or 9th of March. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRlE—Then they are going <br />
to hurry up matters there, I am sorry to <br />
hear, nearly as fast as in Canada, the people <br />
of which have not had the same opportunity, <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> at all events, of considering the question
as <br />
the people of New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick.</span> The
people <br />
of New Brunswick seem to be fully alive to <br />
the importance of this momentous question, <br />
and I hope that when their verdict is given <br />
it will be a well-considered verdict ; but this <br />
we do know, that it will not be given until <br />
after a free and fair opportunity has been <br />
afforded them of discussing the question on <br />
its merits in all its bearings. My hon. friend <br />
from the Western Division (Hon. Mr. <br />
MCCREA) really surprised me the other day <br />
when he declared that an elective Legislative <br />
Council was neither asked for nor desired by <br />
the people. My recollection is that the <br />
Council under the nominative system was a <br />
standing grievance in Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span>
as well <br />
as in Upper Canada. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. MCCREA—That was before <br />
the union. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—The demand arose <br />
that the Council should be elective. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. MCCREA— Not after the <br />
union. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
MR. CURRIE—My hon. friend is, <br />
I can assure him, mistaken in stating that <br />
there were no petitions in favor of an elective <br />
Legislative Council at the time of the change. <br />
If my hon. friend will consult the Journals <br />
of Parliament, he will ﬁnd there petitions for <br />
the change ; he will ﬁnd also that from the <br />
town of Cobourg a petition was received in <br />
favor of representation by population in <br />
this as well as in the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">branch</span>
of the <br />
Legislature. But my hon. friend, in his igno- <br />
rance of the facts of the case—although he <br />
certainly handled the subject with a good<br />
deal of ability, though not with the ability <br />
he usually puts forth when he has a good<br />
cause to plead—(a laugh)—made a state-<br />
ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> he could scarcely
have considered <br />
before bringing it under the notice of the <br />
House. He said that a House appointed by <br />
the Crown would be more responsible to the <br />
people than the present House.&nbsp; That, hon. <br />
gentlemen, is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certainly</span> a new
doctrine to <br />
me. If such would be the case, why, I ask, <br />
do you not apply the same system to the <br />
other branch of the Legislature?&nbsp; In such <br />
an event I feel assured that the Government <br />
of the day would have a much more comfort- <br />
able and pleasant life of it than even the <br />
present Government, strong and talented as <br />
they undoubtedly are. (Laughter.) But, <br />
says my hon. friend. once more, the people <br />
of Canada are in favor of the scheme, in <br />
regard to which they have had ample time <br />
