provinces, <br />
not to feel a sympathy towards them, as there <br />
still exist a large number of the old Acadians <br />
who will feel proud to renew old acquaint- <br />
ance, and to live with them as brothers, <br />
happy under the protection of the English <br />
Government. Let me call to their memory <br />
some of the places which were the theatre of <br />
the exploits of the brave ofﬁcers I have al- <br />
read mentioned, such as Port Royal, or <br />
Louisbourg, now Annapolis; Chebucto, now <br />
Halifax; Port Lajoie, now Charlottetown; <br />
L'Isle Royale, now Cape Breton; Isle St. <br />
Jean, now Prince Edward Island, &amp;c., &amp;c<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> I <br />
hope, also, that the construction of a good <br />
route to Rivière Rouge, the Rocky Moun- <br />
tains and British Columbia, will bring those <br />
places to an easy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">access</span> for
commerce, trading<br />
and agriculture, to our growing population, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <br />
will prevent them emigrating to the United <br />
States, as they will ﬁnd glorious <span style="font-style: italic;">souvenirs</span>
<br />
in the former places, where their Canadian <br />
brothers have already formed ﬂourishing agri- <br />
cultural settlements, and opened up valuable <br />
mines. I trust that my French Canadian <br />
countrymen in this House will see the advan- <br />
tage of adopting the resolutions now laid be- <br />
fore them, trusting as they should do to the <br />
good disposition of the Home Government, as <br />
this new Constitution is well calculated to <br />
develope the resources of this ﬁne and immense <br />
country. And the best proof that we are <br />
taking the right steps to secure our happiness, <br />
is found amongst other articles hostile to Brit- <br />
ish interests, in an article of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Courrier

of Confedera- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Notwithstanding</span>
all that may be said, written <br />
or spouted about English tyranny and rapacity, <br />
we must acknowledge that Great Britain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>
al- <br />

the age, and to deal out privileges to her colon- <br />
ies by judicious instalments. <br />

to a large and important Confederation, and <br />
our credit will rise in consequence. The <br />
Lower Canadians will recollect that in 1840, <br />
after the temporary suspension of the Act of <br />
1791, England granted us a new Constitution. <br />
They will recollect also the anguish, the pangs <br />
felt by them at that period; but notwithstand- <br />

in <br />
1763, have not been abrogated, and I am of <br />
opinion that by adopting those resolutions, <br />
our future rights are as safe as they were for- <br />

answer the remarks made by the honorable <br />
member for Lanaudière division, in a speech a <br />
few days ago, respecting the Monroe doctrine, <br />
alleging that we ought not to legislate upon <br />
this delicate subject, or words to that effect. <br />
I will quote two letters lately discovered and <br />
published by Monsieur PIERRE MERGOZ, <br />
Guardian of Archives of the Ministry of the <br />
Foreign Affairs in France, and his remarks on <br />
these two great honored navigators who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span>-
<br />
covered the Mississippi and other parts of <br />
America, and which remarks are as follow:— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> We cannot shut our eyes to the affinity of
the <br />
interests of the present times and those of former <br />
days, and which recommend the memory of LA- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SALLE</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">D’IBERVILLE.</span> In 1699 D"IBERVILLE <br />
wrote on the subject of Louisiana: “If France <br />
does not take possession of this part of America, <br />
which is the ﬁnest, to have a colony strong <br />
enough to resist those that England possesses in <br />
the east from Pescadoue to the Caroline, these <br />
colonies, which are becoming very extensive, will <br />
increase to such an extent that in less than a cen- <br />
tury they will be strong enough to seize upon <br />
the whole continent of America, and to expel all <br />
other nations ” D'IBERVILLE wrote again in <br />
November, 1702: “What may be said against <br />
the establishment that the king has made at Mo- <br />
bile?  It is the only one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
could sustain Ame- <br />
rica against the undertakings of the English on <br />
this continent. In a few years they will be able <br />
to forward in ﬁfteen days, by means of their large <br />
navy, more than 20,000 or 30,000 men upon <br />
such of the French islands as they would be in- <br />
clined to attack, the distance not being, at the <br />
utmost, more than 500 to 600 leagues, the wind <br />
being generally favorable to carry them on those <br />
shores, and by land they may reach <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mexico.”</span>
<br />
“These views (says Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MERGOZ),</span>
together with <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">D'IBERVILLE's</span> remarks, will
account for the na- <br />
tural uneasiness felt by the European powers at <br />
what is now taking place in South America.” <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> What I have just quoted is, I believe,
suffi- <br />

the Lanaudière Division that the European <br />
Powers were not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposed,</span> even
at those <br />
remote times, to favor the doctrine now called <br />
the Monroe; the British colonists of these <br />
times being now replaced by our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">republican</span>
