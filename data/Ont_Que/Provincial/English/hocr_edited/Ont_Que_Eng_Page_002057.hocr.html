<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Houses, the
government of the day being <br />
obliged to have the conﬁdence of the <br />
majority in the popular branch—would, <br />
for the purpose of bringing the former into <br />
accord and sympathy with the latter, ﬁll up <br />
any vacancies that might occur, with men of <br />
the same political feelings and sympathies <br />
with the Government, and consequently with <br />
those of the majority in the popular branch ; <br />
and all the appointments of the Administra- <br />
tion would be made with the object of <br />
maintaining the sympathy and harmony be- <br />
tween the two houses.   (Hear, hear.)   There <br />
is this additional advantage to be expected <br />
from the limitation. To the Upper House is <br />
to be conﬁded the protection of sectional <br />
interests ; therefore is it that the three great <br />
divisions are there equally represented, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> <br />
the purpose of defending such interests <br />
against the combinations of majorities in the <br />
Assembly.   It will, therefore, become the <br />
interest of each section to be represented <br />
by its very best men, and the members of <br />
the Administration who belong to each sec- <br />
tion will see that such men are chosen, in <br />
case of a vacancy in their section.   For the <br />
same reason each state of the American <br />
Union sends its two best men to represent <br />
its interests in the Senate.   (Hear, hear.) <br />
It is provided in the Constitution that in the <br />
ﬁrst selections for the Council,   regard <br />
shall be had to those who now hold similar <br />
positions in the different colonies.   This, it <br />
appears to me, is a wise provision.   In all the <br />
provinces, except Prince Edward,   there are <br />
gentlemen who hold commissions for the <br />
Upper House for life.   In Canada, there are <br />
a number who hold under that commission ; <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>but the
majority of them hold by a com- <br />
mission, not, perhaps, from a monarchical <br />
point of view so honorable, because the <br />
Queen is the fountain of honor,—but still, <br />
as holding their appointment from the <br />
people, they may be considered as standing <br />
on a par with those who have Her Majesty’s <br />
commission.   There can be no reason suggest- <br />
ed why those who have had experience in <br />
legislation, whether they hold their positions <br />
by the election of the people or have received <br />
preferment from the Crown—there is no <br />
valid reason why those men should be passed <br />
over, and new men sought for to form the <br />
Legislative Council of the Confederation. <br />
It is, therefore, provided that the selection <br />
shall be made from those gentlemen who are <br />
now members of the upper branch of the <br />
Legislature in each of the colonies, for seats <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> in the Legislative
Council of the General <br />
Legislature.   The arrangement in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-</span> <br />
spect is somewhat similar to that by which <br />
Representative Peers are chosen from the <br />
Peers of Scotland and Ireland, to sit in the <br />
Parliament of the United Kingdom.   In <br />
like manner, the members of the Legislative <br />
Council of the proposed Confederation will <br />
be ﬁrst selected from the existing Legislative <br />
Councils of the various provinces.   In the <br />
formation of the House of Commons, the <br />
principle of representation by population <br />
has been provided for in a manner equally <br />
ingenious and simple.   The introduction of <br />
this principle presented at ﬁrst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> apparent <br />
difﬁculty of a constantly increasing body <br />
until, with the increasing population, it <br />
would become inconveniently and expen- <br />
sively large.   But by adopting the represen- <br />
tation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span>
Canada as a ﬁxed standard <br />
—as the pivot on which the whole would <br />
turn—that province being the best suited for <br />
the purpose, on account of the compara-<br />
tively permanent character of its population, <br />
and from its having neither the largest nor <br />
least number of inhabitants—we have been <br />
enabled to overcome the difﬁculty I have <br />
mentioned.   We have introduced the system <br />
of representation by population without the <br />
danger of an inconvenient increase in the <br />
number of representatives on the recurrence <br />
of each decennial period.   The whole thing <br />
is worked by a simple rule of three.   For <br />
instance, we have in Upper Canada 1,400,000 <br />
of a population ; in Lower Canada 1,100,000. <br />
Now, the proposition is simply this—if Lower <br />
Canada, with its population of 1,100,000, has <br />
a right to 65 members, how many members <br />
should Upper Canada have, with its larger <br />
population of 1,400,000? The same rule <br />
applies to the other provinces—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propor-</span> <br />
tion is always observed and the principle of <br />
representation by population carried out, <br />
while, at the same time, there will not be <br />
decennially an inconvenient increase in the <br />
numbers of the Lower House.   At the same <br />
time, there is a constitutional provision that <br />
hereafter, if deemed advisable, the total <br />
number of representatives may be increased <br />
from 194, the number ﬁxed in the ﬁrst <br />
instance.   In that case, if an increase is <br />
made, Lower Canada is still to remain the <br />
pivot on which the whole calculation will <br />
turn.   If Lower Canada, instead of sixty- <br />
ﬁve, shall have seventy members, then the <br />
calculation will be, if Lower Canada has <br />
seventy members, with such a population, <br />
