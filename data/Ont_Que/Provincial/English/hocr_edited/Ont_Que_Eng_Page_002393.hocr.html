<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and that that province will approve of
our <br />
having inserted the clause in question in <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolutions.</span> The vote which
took place <br />
last night in another place, shows that I am <br />
not mistaken in what I assert on this subject. <br />
One of the greatest objections which the <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga raises to the <br />
appointment of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span>
councillors by <br />
the Crown, is that their number will be ﬁxed, <br />
and that, by consequence, it will prove an <br />
obstacle to the decisions and legislation of the <br />
Commons House of the Federal Parliament. <br />
In a word, the honorable member declares that<br />
the Legislative Council, so constituted, will <br />
be, to use an English expression, a nuisance. <br />
The honorable member should glance back at <br />
the past to consider how many councillors ap- <br />
pointed for life there were in the Legislative <br />
Council at the time of the concession of the <br />
elective principle, and how many of those said <br />
councillors remain at the present day. He <br />
would have ascertained that in eight years the <br />
number had diminished by one-half. Of the <br />
forty-two or forty-three members which there <br />
were then, there now remain but twenty-one <br />
or twenty-two. (Hear, hear.) The honor- <br />
able member for Hochelaga should also have <br />
admitted that in those eight years there had <br />
been such considerable changes among the <br />
elected councillors, that there was no danger <br />
of the Legislative Council not being at least <br />
accessible to the people. This diminution <br />
gives an average of three members a-year, <br />
and if we take the proportion between this <br />
diminution and that which would necessarily <br />
prevail among a larger number of councillors, <br />
we shall ﬁnd that there will be at least ﬁve <br />
vacancies in each year. The honorable mem- <br />
ber must then perceive that, if it should hap- <br />
pen that the Legislative Council should be so <br />
opposed to the views of the Lower House as <br />
systematically to reject the measures of the <br />
popular branch of the Legislature, at the end <br />
of a year or perhaps less, such changes would <br />
be effected by death or otherwise, that we <br />
should immediately have such an infusion of <br />
new blood, that any attempt of this kind <br />
could not be repeated for a long time. <br />
Besides, the Legislative Council will not con- <br />
stitute a separate class like the House of <br />
Lords in England. The councillors will come <br />
from among the people, with whom they will <br />
have interests in common, and it is absurd to <br />
suppose that they will be induced to oppose <br />
systematically and constantly the measures <br />
which the Lower House may enact in favor <br />
of the people and at their instance. The hon. <br />
member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hochelaga,</span> when on
this subject, <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> reproached the Attorney General for Upper<br />
Canada with having stated in his opening <br />
speech, that if he had to preside over the <br />
selection of the legislative councillors, he <br />
would see that the best qualiﬁed men were ap- <br />
pointed. Now, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> I see
nothing <br />
in that declaration which is not in the most <br />
perfect accordance with the interests of the <br />
country, and it is important that the best men <br />
from each section of the Confederacy should <br />
be called to sit in this important branch of <br />
our General Legislature. The honorable <br />
member has taken occasion to ﬁnd fault with <br />
the clause of the resolutions which provides <br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lieutenant-governors</span>
shall be appoint- <br />
ed by the Central Government, and sees in it <br />
great danger, especially to Lower Canada. <br />
Mr. SPEAKER, I should very much like to <br />
know what protection the population of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
different provinces derive from the fact that <br />
the governors of the British North American <br />
Provinces are sent out to us from England. <br />
Under the existing system, our governor is <br />
responsible neither to the people nor to the <br />
House ; he depends entirely upon the Eng- <br />
lish Government, to which he is responsible. <br />
Under the system proposed the lieutenant- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governors</span> will be appointed by
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Central</span> <br />Government, to which they will necessarily be <br />
responsible for their actions. And in that <br />
Government we shall have more than one vote ; <br />
we shall be represented in it by our ministers, <br />
who will be there to cause every encroachment <br />
or arbitrary act which the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lieutenant-governor</span>
<br />
may allow himself to commit, to be condemn- <br />
ed. If the Central Government should refuse <br />
to do us this justice, and should persist in not <br />
recalling any lieutenant-governor who should <br />
have so failed in his duty to the population <br />
which he governed, we should have our sixty- <br />
ﬁve representatives to protest and to vote at <br />
need against a government which should dare <br />
to act in such away. In that respect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span>
<br />
should have much better guarantees than at <br />
present ; and in very truth this is a new privi- <br />
lege that we have obtained, as the people will <br />
have a voice in these appointments, from the <br />
fact that we shall have our responsible minis- <br />
ters in the Central Government, who will be <br />
sustained and supported by the members from <br />
our section. In allusion to the appointment <br />
of the lieutenant-governors, the honorable <br />
member for Hochelaga thought proper to <br />
make a violent attack upon the Conservative <br />
party. He asserted that that party continu- <br />
ally sought to diminish the liberties and the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privileges</span> of the people, whilst
the Liberal <br />
party labored to extend and ensure those same <br />
