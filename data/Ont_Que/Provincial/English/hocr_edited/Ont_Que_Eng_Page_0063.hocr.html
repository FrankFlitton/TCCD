<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> it will never be the
deliberately expressed <br />
determination of the Government of Great <br />
Britain. &nbsp; (Hear, hear.) &nbsp; The colonies are <br />
now in a transition state. &nbsp; Gradually a dif- <br />
ferent colonial system is being developed— <br />
and it will become, year by year, less a case <br />
of dependence on our part, and of overruling <br />
protection on the part of the Mother Coun- <br />
try, and more a case of a healthy and cordial <br />
alliance. &nbsp; Instead of looking upon us as a <br />
merely dependent colony, England will have <br />
in us a friendly nation—a subordinate but <br />
still a powerful people—to stand by her in <br />
North America in peace or in war. (Cheers.) <br />
The people of Australia will be such another <br />
subordinate nation. &nbsp; And England will have <br />
this advantage, if her colonies pragress <br />
under the new colonial system, as I believe <br />
they will, that, though at war with all the <br />
rest of the world, she will be able to look to <br />
the subordinate nations in alliance with her, <br />
and owning allegiance to the same Sovreign, <br />
who will assist in enabling her again to <br />
meet the whole world in arms, as she has <br />
done before. (Cheers.) And if, in the great <br />
Napoleonic war, with every port in Eurcpe <br />
closed against her commerce, she was yet <br />
able to hold her own, how much more will <br />
that be the case when she has a colonial em- <br />
pire rapidly increasing in power, in wealth, <br />
in inﬂuence, and in position. (Hear, hear.) <br />
It is true that we stand in danger, as we <br />
have stood in danger again and again in <br />
Canada, of being plunged into war and suf- <br />
fering all its dreadful consequences, as the <br />
result of causes over which we have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> <br />
trol, by reason of their connection. &nbsp; This, <br />
however, did not intimidate us. &nbsp; At the <br />
very mention of the prospect of a war some <br />
time ago, how were the feelings of the people <br />
aroused from one extremity of British Ame- <br />
rica to the other, and preparations made for <br />
meeting its worst consequences. &nbsp; Although <br />
the people of this country are fully aware <br />
of the horrors of war—should a war arise, <br />
unfortunately, between the United States <br />
and England, and we all pray it never may <br />
—they are still ready to encounter all perils <br />
of that kind, for the sake of the connection <br />
with England. &nbsp; There is not one adverse <br />
voice, not one adverse opinion on that point. <br />
We all feel the advantages we derive from <br />
our connection with England. &nbsp; So long as <br />
that alliance is maintained, we enjoy, under <br />
her protection, the privileges of constitu- <br />
tional liberty according to the British sys <br />

will enjoy here that which is the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> great test of
constitutional freedom—we will <br />
have the rights of the minority respected <br />
(Hear, hear.) &nbsp; In all countries the rights <br />
of the majority take care of themselves, but <br />
it is only in countries like England, enjoy- <br />
ing constitutional liberty, and safe from the <br />
tyrany of a single despot or of an unbridled <br />
democracy, that the rights of minorities are <br />
regarded. &nbsp; So long, too, as we form a portion <br />
of the British Empire, we shall have the ex- <br />
ample of her free institutions, of the high <br />
standard of the character of her statesmen <br />
and public men, of the purity of her legis- <br />
lation, and the upright administration of <br />
her laws. &nbsp; In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>
younger country one <br />
great advantage of our connection with <br />
Great Britain will be, that, under her <br />
auspices, inspired by her example, a portion <br />
of her empire, our public men will be actu- <br />
ated by principles similar to those which <br />
actuate the statesmen at home. &nbsp; These al- <br />
though not material, physical beneﬁts, of <br />
which you can make an arithmetical calcu- <br />
lation, are of such overwhelming advantage <br />
to our future interests and standing as a <br />
nation, that to obtain them is well worthy <br />
of any sacriﬁces we may be called upon to <br />
make, and the people of this country are <br />
ready to make them.&nbsp; (Cheers.)&nbsp; We should <br />
feel, also, sincerely grateful to beniﬁcent <br />
Providence that we have had the opportun- <br />
ity vouchsafed us of calmly considering this <br />
great constitutional change, this peaceful <br />
revolution—that we have not been hurried <br />
into it, like the United States, by the ex- <br />
igencies of war—that we have not had a <br />
violent revolutionary period forced on us, as <br />
in other nations, by hostile action from with- <br />
out, or by domestic dissensions within. Here <br />
we are in peace and prosperity, under the <br />
fostering government of Great Britain— <br />
a dependent people, with a government <br />
having only a limited and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegated</span>
au- <br />
thority, and yet allowed, without restric- <br />
tion, and without jealousy on the part of <br />
the Mother Country , to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislate</span>
for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our-</span> <br />
selves, and peacefully and deliberately to <br />
consider and determine the future of Cana- <br />
da and of British North America. &nbsp; It is <br />
our happiness to know the expression of the <br />
will of our Gracious Sovereign, through Her <br />
Ministers, that we have her full sanction for <br />
our deliberations, that Her only solicitude is <br />
that we shall adopt a system which shall be <br />
really for our advantage, and that She prom- <br />
ises to sanction whatever conclusion after full <br />
deliberation we may arrive at as to the best <br />
