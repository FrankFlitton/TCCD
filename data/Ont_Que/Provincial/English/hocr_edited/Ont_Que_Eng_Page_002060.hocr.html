<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> law too—the
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">determination</span>
of what is a <br />
crime and what is not and how crime shall <br />
be punished—is left to the General Govern- <br />
ment.   This is a matter almost of necessity. <br />
It is of great importance that we should have <br />
the same criminal law throughout these pro- <br />
vinces—that what is a crime in one part of <br />
British America, should be a crime in every <br />
part—that there should be the same pro- <br />
tection of life and property as in another. <br />
It is one of the defects in the United States <br />
system, that each separate state has or may <br />
have a criminal code of its own,—that what <br />
may be a capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offence</span>
in one state, may <br />
be a venial offence, punishable slightly, in <br />
another.   But under our Constitution we <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>shall have one
body of criminal law, based on <br />
the criminal law of England, and operating <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">equally throughout
British America, so that <br />
a British American, belonging to what <br />
province he may, or going to any other <br />
part of the Confederation, knows what his <br />
rights are in that respect, and what his <br />
punishment will be if an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offender</span>
against the <br />
criminal laws of the land.   I think this is one <br />
of the most marked instances in which <br />
we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span>
advantage of the experience derived <br />
from our observations of the defects in the <br />
Constitution of the neighboring Republic. <br />
(Hear, hear.)   The 33rd provision is of very <br />
great importance to the future well-being of <br />
these colonies.   It commits to the General <br />
Parliament the “ rendering uniform all or <br />
any of the laws relative to property and civil <br />
rights in Upper Canada, Nova Scotia, New <br />
Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince Ed- <br />
ward Island, and rendering uniform the pro- <br />
cedure of all or any of the courts in these <br />
provinces.”   The great principles which <br />
govern the laws of all the provinces, with <br />
the single exception of Lower Canada, are <br />
the same, although there may be a divergence <br />
in details; and it is gratifying to ﬁnd, on the <br />
part of the Lower Provinces, a general de- <br />
sire to join together with Upper Canada in <br />
this matter, and to procure, as soon as possi- <br />
ble, an assimilation of the statutory laws and <br />
the procedure in the courts, of all these pro- <br />
vinces.   At present there is a good deal of <br />
diversity.   In one of the colonies, for in- <br />
stance, they have no municipal system at all. <br />
In another, the municipal system is merely <br />
permissive, and has not been adopted to any <br />
extent.   Although, therefore, a legislative <br />
union was found to be almost impracticable, <br />
it was understood, so far as we could inﬂuence <br />
the future, that the ﬁrst act of the Confeder- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ate Government should
be to procure an as- <br />
similation of the statutory law of all those <br />
provinces, which has, as its root and founda- <br />
tion, the common law of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England.</span>
  But to <br />
prevent local interests from being over-ridden, <br />
the same section makes provision, that, while <br />
power is given to the General Legislature to <br />
deal with this subject, no change in this <br />
respect should have the force and authority <br />
of law in any province until sanctioned by <br />
the Legislature of that province.   (Hear, <br />
hear.)   The General Legislature is to have <br />
power to establish a general Court of Appeal <br />
for the Federated Provinces.   <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Although</span> the <br />
Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span>
has always had the <br />
power to establish a Court of Appeal, to <br />
which appeals may be made from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
courts <br />
of Upper and Lower Canada, we have never <br />
availed ourselves of the power.   Upper Can- <br />
ada has its own Court of Appeal, so has <br />
Lower Canada.   And this system will con- <br />
tinue until a General Court of Appeal shall <br />
be established by the General Legislature. <br />
The Constitution does not provide that such <br />
a court shall be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established.</span>
There are many <br />
arguments for and against the establishment <br />
of such a court.   But it was thought wise <br />
and expedient to put into the Constitution a <br />
power to the General Legislature, that, if <br />
after full consideration they think it advisa- <br />
ble to establish a General Court of Appeal <br />
from all the Superior Courts of all the pro- <br />
vinces, they may do so. (Hear, hear.)   I <br />
shall not go over the other powers that are <br />
conferred on the General Parliament.  Most <br />
of them refer to matters of ﬁnancial and <br />
commercial interest, and I leave those sub- <br />
jects in other and better hands.   Besides <br />
all the powers that are speciﬁcally given in <br />
the 37th and last item of this portion of the <br />
Constitution, confers on the General Legis- <br />
lature the general mass of sovereign legisla- <br />
tion, the power to legislate on “ all matters <br />
of a general character, not specially and ex- <br />
clusively reserved for the local governments <br />
and legislatures.”   This is precisely the <br />
provision which is wanting in the Constitu- <br />
tion of the United States. It is here that we <br />
ﬁnd the weakness of the American system—<br />
the point where the American Constitution <br />
breaks down. (Hear, hear.)   It is in itself a <br />
wise and necessary provision.   We thereby <br />
strengthen the Central Parliament, and make <br />
the Confederation one people and one govern- <br />
ment, instead of ﬁve peoples and ﬁve govern- <br />
ments, with merely a point of authority con- <br />
necting us to a limited and insufficient extent. <br />
