<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> judicial system : but an exception is
made in <br />
favor of Lower Canada and our laws. There <br />
are also as many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different tariffs as
there are <br />
different provinces, as many commercial and <br />
customs regulations as provinces. It is true <br />
that there are now many free goods, but it <br />
is also correct to say that there as many cus-<br />
toms systems as there are provinces. And <br />
with respect to great colonial works, is it not <br />
true that it is impossible at the present day <br />
to undertake them, because the interests in-<br />
volved are too considerable, and because it is <br />
necessary to consult three or four legisla- <br />
tures ? By this it will be understood that it is <br />
almost impossible to reconcile so many differ-<br />
ent interests, except by uniting in one and the <br />
same legislature the representatives of those <br />
interests and of the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affected</span>
by them, <br />
and this object we cannot attain by remaining<br />
by ourselves. Currency and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
interest of <br />
money are also regulated by different systems <br />
in the several provinces. There is one cur-<br />
rency here, another in Newfoundland, an- <br />
other in Prince Edward Island, and so on. <br />
The shilling and pound of this province are <br />
different from the shilling and pound of <br />
Newfoundland and those of the other Mari- <br />
time Provinces. But, with Confederation, <br />
all these matters would be placed under the <br />
control of one central legislature ; the cur-<br />
rency would become uniform throughout, <br />
and capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be everywhere
invested <br />
without obstacle. So also it will be with <br />
respect to the rights of authors, patents for <br />
mechanical inventions, &amp;c. When speaking <br />
of the Intercolonial Railway, I made no men-<br />
tion of the Paciﬁc Railway, because I con-<br />
sider that we ought to devote our attention to <br />
accomplishing the works of which we at <br />
present stand in need. At a later period, <br />
when our resources and our population shall <br />
have suﬂiciently increased, we may direct our <br />
attention to the Paciﬁc Railway. And should <br />
it become necessary, we can, with Confed- <br />
eration, hope to build it in less than ten <br />
years, whereas by remaining by ourselves as <br />
we are, we could not hope to have it for per <br />
haps one hundred years. I think that I have <br />
now held up in a salient point of view the <br />
disadvantages of the <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo.</span>
The neces- <br />
sary consequence of what I have just demon- <br />
strated is that we cannot remain in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">po-</span><br />
sition in which we now are, whether we will <br />
or not. The question of representation <br />
based on population must be met ; that <br />
question must be settled. To say that we <br />
will grant it is to wish to place us in a posi-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inferiority,</span> and I, for my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part,</span> will <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> never consent to place my section of the
<br />
province in that position. Then there is <br />
another alternative that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed—annex-</span>
<br />
ation to the United States. I do not believe <br />
there is a single member in the House or out<br />
of the House who would consent to the<br />
annexation of Canada to the United States. <br />
But it is a question which must be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">examined</span>
<br />
when discussing that of Confederation, be- <br />
cause it is one of' the alternatives offered to <br />
us, and out of which we have to make a <br />
selection. What then would be our position <br />
in case we were annexed to the United <br />
States? It is true that we should become <br />
an independent State in the American Con- <br />
federation, but with the advantages accruing <br />
from such a state of affairs,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> we
should like-<br />
wise have the disadvantages. We should <br />
have to contribute towards the liquidation <br />
of the enormous debt which the United <br />
States have contracted in consequence of the <br />
war which is desolating one of the ﬁnest <br />
portions of the land ; we should have to pay <br />
the interest, and subsequently the principal <br />
itself, for I do not suppose that the Ameri-<br />
cans have the slightest intention of repudiat- <br />
ing their debt. The debt would have to be <br />
paid, and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> that, heavy
imposts would <br />
have to be paid for a great number of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span><br />
to provide the interest and sinking fund. <br />
Those who talk of the debt which is going <br />
to result from the Confederation should <br />
remember that it will be but a mere triﬂe <br />
compared with that for which we should <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">become</span> responsible under
annexation. For <br />
one dollar that we shall have to pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span>
<br />
Confederation, we should have to pay six. <br />
under annexation. It is said that the debt <br />
will be enormous, but it will only be as one <br />
dollar to four dollars in England, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">six</span>
<br />
dollars in the United States. That is the <br />
ﬁnancial aspeet of annexation. But what <br />
would be the fate of the French-Canadians <br />
in the case of annexation to the United <br />
States ? Let us proﬁt by the example of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
French race in the United States, and enquire <br />
what has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> the fate of the
French in <br />
Louisiana ? What has become of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them ?</span>
<br />
What has become of their language, their <br />
customs, their manners and their institutions ? <br />
After the war, hardly a trace will remain to <br />
show that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French</span> race has
passed that <br />
way. So far as religion is concerned, we <br />
might not ﬁnd ourselves so badly off ;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
but <br />
we live in peace at the present day and are <br />
perfectly comfortable ; Catholics and Protest-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
ants have the same rights and religious <br />
liberty, and they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">live</span> as peacefully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together</span> <br />
