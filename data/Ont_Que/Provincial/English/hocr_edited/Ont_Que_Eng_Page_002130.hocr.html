great commotion in their day and generation <br />
—the British American League. I hold in <br />
my hand the proceedings of the League of 3rd <br />
November, 1849, and among other names <br />
mentioned I ﬁnd those of the Hon. GEORGE <br />

whom, however, I ﬁnd it recorded that he <br />
spoke in a very jocose manner. Here is the <br />
resolution of the League :— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That whether protection or reciprocity
shall be <br />
conceded or withheld, it is essential to the wel- <br />

unison with the wishes of the people, and suited <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I pass on to 1856 when we had the motion <br />
and speech of my honorable friend the Minis- <br />
ter of Finance (Hon. Mr. GALT) in favor of <br />
a union of all the British American Provinces, <br />
but, as the whole House is familiar with it, I <br />
shall not read the document. But in the Votes <br />
and Proceedings of this House, of 25th April, <br />
1856, I ﬁnd a very remarkable document. It <br />
is a notice of motion to be made in this House <br />
—and its contents are as follow :— <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CARTIER—Whose</span> notice was <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> that?<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN.—This notice of mo- <br />
tion was given by my honorable friend the <br />
member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION.) <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION.—It was in amend- <br />
ment of that of the honorable member for <br />
Sherbrooke, which I did not exactly like. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—and which that <br />
honorable gentleman did not venture to move, <br />
so that the House did not pronounce upon it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—But my honorable <br />
friend (Hon. Mr. DORION) made a speech, <br />
which I perfectly remember. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">held this</span>
<br />
motion in his hand while he spoke. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION—I made a speech on <br />
the motion of the honorable member for Hal- <br />
dimand, Mr. MACKENZIE, not on my own. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—That does not sig- <br />
nify. I seek not to fasten down my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honorable</span>
<br />
friend to the views he then held. Much light <br />
has been thrown on the whole subject since <br />
1856, and I trust we will all act on our con- <br />
scientious convictions of what is best for the <br />
country now—without regard to any opinions <br />
we may at other times have held. (Hear, <br />
hear.) But when my honorable friend and <br />
others allege that there never has been in <br />
Canada an agitation in favor of a Federal <br />
system, and that the people have never con- <br />
sidered such a proposition, I think it directly <br />
in point to prove the contrary by my honor- <br />
able friend’s own proceedings. (Hear, hear.) <br />
The next step in the constitutional agitation <br />
of the country was the formation of the BROWN- <br />
DORION Administration. That was in 1858— <br />
and to show how serious my honorable friend <br />
opposite (Hon. Mr. DORION) and myself and <br />
our ten colleagues viewed the position of the <br />
country from the denial of constitutional <br />
reform, I will read the ofﬁcial statement of <br />
the basis on which the Government was <br />
formed. I read, sir, from the Journals of the <br />
Legislative Council for 1858 :— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> For some years past, sectional feelings
have <br />
risen in this country which, especially during <br />
the present session, have seriously impeded the <br />
carrying on of the administrative and legislative <br />
functions of the Government. The late Adminis- <br />
tration made no attempt to meet these difficulties <br />
or to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sugggest</span> a remedy for
them, and thereby the <br />
evil has it greatly aggravated. His Excel- <br />
lency’s present Advisers have entered the Govern- <br />
ment with the ﬁxed determination to propose <br />
constitutional measures for the establishment of <br />
that harmony between Upper and Lower Canada <br />
