<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> already remarked upon that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> point, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <br />
if it were changed, would it not be to retain <br />
the elective principle? If the Imperial Par- <br />
liament may do so, may we not ask them to <br />
do it? May we not record our views? And <br />
would they, upon a measure of such vast <br />
moment and pregnant with such results, pro- <br />
ceed to adopt a principle unless they knew its <br />
operation to be beneficial? Turning to his <br />
proposed amendment, the honorable member <br />
said that if it were adopted, the principle of <br />
federal representation in the resolutions would <br />
be retained; the same members would be <br />
retained (in Canada at least); and to render <br />
the proportion of the Lower Provinces rela- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tively equal, he would allow them to
name ten <br />
life members. Were we to be told that such <br />
a form would be incongruous, and be deterred <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> considering the proposition?
Then we <br />
should be reﬂecting upon ourselves. He and <br />
other honorable members sat under a mandate <br />
from the people, while other honorable mem- <br />
bers set under a patent from the Crown. It <br />
would be a reﬂection both on our past and <br />
present condition. There were the same <br />
reasons now for adopting such a form as there <br />
were when the elective principle was adopted. <br />
It was a domestic matter, and should be left <br />
to domestic arrangement. Each province had <br />
its own peculiar interests, and should be left <br />
to the exercise of its judgment in the manage- <br />
ment of them. If subsequently a change were <br />
desired, it could be granted. He maintained <br />
that his views were correct and logical, and <br />
he was at a loss to see the incongruity with <br />
which they were charged. He could not dis- <br />
cover any sufficient cause for the proposed <br />
change, and as the people had not asked <br />
for it, and as Canada formed a large ma- <br />
jority of the whole, it ought not to have been <br />
granted without reference to their opinions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Representation</span> according to population
was <br />
now looked upon as a cardinal principle, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span>
<br />
it certainly was not observed in dealing with <br />
this important question. We were told the <br />
vote was taken by provinces, not by numbers, <br />
still the Lower Provinces had the majority of <br />
representatives, though they represented but a <br />
minority of the people. Then it was said our <br />
delegates were leading men and men of talent, <br />
which he was quite prepared to allow, yet <br />
they did not compose all the talent or states- <br />
manship of Canada. In this way the one- <br />
third of the populations interested had given <br />
the law to the other two-thirds. We were <br />
told again that the Constitution emanating- <br />
from the Conference was desirable because it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was,</span> modelled on the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution.</span><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution</span> was unmatched in <br />
the world, and was not susceptible of imita- <br />
tion. It had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grown</span> by the
secretions of ages, <br />
by the independence of the people, and by <br />
their undying love of justice and fair play. <br />
(Hear, hour.) It had been produced by the <br />
strictest inductive method, and stood unri- <br />
valled as a monument of the greatest human <br />
wisdom. Except in remote future times, it <br />
could not be imitated—(hear)—and he did <br />
not urge this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> as a
demerit, for it <br />
was in the nature of things that it should <br />
exist. It had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reform</span> to
different kinds of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people—to</span> people of different
nine, and to <br />
people of new countries and altered circum- <br />
stances; but though an able theoretical com- <br />
position, it might fail to produce the antici- <br />
pated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">malts.</span> It was not a copy
of that hor- <br />
ror of our Constitution-makers—the Constitu- <br />
tion of the United States—but he would <br />
show that the delegates had borrowed more <br />
largely from that Constitution than from any <br />
other, though to be sure, in some aspects, it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differed</span> very much from it, as
in the provision <br />
which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gives</span> to members of the
Upper House <br />
their seats for life. The resolutions provided <br />
that an equal representation should given <br />
to the three sections of the Confederation as <br />
having separate interests, while in the Lower <br />
House the representation was to be according <br />
to population. Both these provisions were <br />
copied from the American
Constitution. The <br />
life membership was supposed to be in con- <br />
formity with the British Constitution, but <br />
the limitation of the number of members was <br />
a violation of it. The limitation of the pow- <br />
er of the federal, and the power of the coal <br />
governments, was the old story of federal and <br />
state <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights—in</span> fact, the bone of
contention <br />
which had led to the present unhappy war; <br />
an apple of discord which our posterity might <br />
gather in fruits of the most bitter character. <br />
There was another branch of the subject he <br />would fail in his duty if he did not touch <br />
upon, and that was the situation in which the <br />
English of Lower Canada would be placed. <br />
The Honorable Premier had remarked at <br />
some length upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dispos</span>ition to
toleration <br />
and the indulgent spirit evinced by his people <br />
in past times, and he (Hon.Mr. SANBORN) was <br />
not prepared to detract from this. He would <br />
freely and fully concede the point. He had <br />
always lived in the midst of a mixed popu- <br />
lation, and his division was more French than <br />
English, and it would ill become him to cast <br />
reﬂections on their liberality and desire for <br />
fair play or justice to others. But this was <br />
the time, when treating of important arrange- <br />
