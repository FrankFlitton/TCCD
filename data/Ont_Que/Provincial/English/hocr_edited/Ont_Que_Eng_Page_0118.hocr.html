this union is to have on our position over <br />
the world, it is a fact like this, that our secu- <br />
rities went up 17 per cent. in consequence of <br />
the publication of the details of our scheme. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) The honorable
member for <br />
Chateauguay asks, “What put them down <br />
again?” I will tell him. They remained at <br />
91 or 92 until the news came that a raid had <br />
been made from Canada into the United <br />
States, that the raiders had been arrested and <br />
brought before a Canadian Court, and that <br />
upon technical legal grounds, not only had <br />
they been set free, but the money of which <br />
they had robbed the banks had been handed <br />
over to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">robbers.</span> The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of this news, <br />
coupled with General DIX’s order, was to <br />
drive down our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">securities</span> 11 per
cent. almost <br />
in one day. (Hear, hear.) But, as my hon- <br />
orable friend the Finance Minister suggests, <br />
this is but an additional roof of the accuracy <br />
of the argument I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span>
sustaining—for <br />
this would not have happened, at all events to <br />
the same extent, if all the provinces had been <br />
united and prepared, as we are now proposing, <br />
not only for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purposes</span> of
commerce but for pur- <br />
poses of defence. (Hear, hear.) But secondly, <br />
Mr. SPEAKER, I go heartily for the union, <br />
because it will throw down the barriers of <br />
trade and give us the control of a market of <br />
four millions of people. (Hear, hear.) What <br />
one thing has contributed so much to the won- <br />
drous material progress of the United States <br />
as the free passage of their products from one <br />
State to another? What has tended so much <br />
to the rapid advance of all branches of their <br />
industry, as the vast extent of their home <br />
market, creating an unlimited demand for all <br />
the commodities of daily use, and stimulating <br />
the energy and ingenuity of producers? Sir, <br />
I confess to you that in my mind this one <br />
view of the union—the addition of nearly a <br />
million of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> to our home
consumers— <br />
sweeps aside all the petty objections that are <br />
averred against the scheme. What, in com- <br />
parison with this great gain to our farmers and <br />
manufacturers, are even the fallacious money <br />
objections which the imaginations of honorable <br />
gentlemen opposite have summoned up? All <br />
over the world we ﬁnd nations eagerly longing <br />
to extend their domains, spending large sums <br />
and waging protracted wars to them- <br />
selves of more territory, untilled and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uninhabit</span>-
<br />
ed. (Hear, hear.) Other countries <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span>
<br />
large inducements to foreigners to emigrate to <br />
their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shores—free</span> passages, free
lands, and free <br />
food and implements to start them in the <br />
world. We, ourselves, support costly estab- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lishments to attract immigrants</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> our coun- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> try, and are satisfied when our annual
outlay <br />
brings us ﬁfteen or twenty thousand souls. <br />
But here, sir, is a proposal which is to add, in <br />
one day, near a million of souls to our popula- <br />
tion—to add valuable territories to our domain, <br />
and secure to us all the advantages of a large <br />
and proﬁtable commerce, now existing. And <br />
because some of us would have liked certain of <br />
the little details otherwise arranged, we are to <br />
hesitate in accepting this alliance! (Hear, hear.) <br />
Have honorable gentlemen forgotten that the <br />
United States gladly paid twenty millions in <br />
hard cash to have Louisiana incorporated in <br />
the Republic? But what was Louisiana then <br />
to the Americans, in comparison with what <br />
the Maritime Provinces are at this moment to <br />
Canada? I put it to honorable gentlemen <br />
opposite—if the United States were now to <br />
offer us the State of Maine, what possible <br />
sum could be named within the compass of <br />
our ability that we would not be prepared to <br />
pay for that addition to our country? (Hear, <br />
hear.) If we were offered Michigan, Iowa or <br />
Minnesota, I would like to know what sum <br />
within the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compass</span> of Canada, we
would <br />
not be prepared to pay? These are portions <br />
of a foreign country, but here is a people <br />
owning the same allegiance as ourselves, loving <br />
the same old sod, enjoying the same laws
and <br />
institutions, actuated by the same
impulses <br />
and social customs,—and yet when it is pro- <br />
posed that they shall unite with us for pur- <br />
poses of commerce, for the defence of our <br />
common country, and to develope the vast <br />
natural resources of our united domains, we <br />
hesitate to adopt it! If a Canadian goes <br />
now to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, or <br />
if a citizen of these provinces comes here, <br />
it is like going to a foreign country. The <br />
customs officer meets you at the frontier, <br />
arrests your progress, and levies his im- <br />
posts on your effects. But the proposal <br />
now before us is to throw down all barriers <br />
between the provinces—to make a citizen of <br />
one, citizen of the whole; the proposal is, <br />
that our farmers and manufacturers and <br />
mechanics shall carry their wares unquestioned <br />
into every village of the Maritime Provinces; <br />
and that they shall with equal freedom bring <br />
their ﬁsh, and their coal, and their West India <br />
produce to our three millions of inhabitants. <br />
The proposal is, that the law courts, and <br />
the schools, and the professional and in- <br />
dustrial walks of life, throughout all the <br />
provinces, shall be thrown equally open to us <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear, hear).</span> But, thirdly, Mr. SPEAKER, <br />
I am in favor of a union of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because—and</span> I call the attention
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honorable</span> <br />
