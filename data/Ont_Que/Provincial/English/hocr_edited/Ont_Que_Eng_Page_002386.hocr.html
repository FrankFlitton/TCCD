<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR.</span>
DUFRESN! (Iberville)—We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> <br />
well off, just us remain so.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. SOL. GEN. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LANGEVIN—Yes, but <br />
we cannot remain in the position in which <br />
we are. The hon. member for Hochelaga <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span><br />
said so for ten years past, and undertook to <br />
change it. He said the position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
no <br />
longer tenable in 1854, and if it was not <br />
tenable then, it is still less so in 1865. I <br />
now come to the other alternative proposed <br />
to us—that of independence  Men may be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found,</span> both in the House and out
of the <br />
House, who would be disposed to say that <br />
we had better have independence than Con-<br />
federation.  For my part, I believe that the <br />
independence of the British North American <br />
Provinces would be the greatest misfortune <br />
which could happen to them ; it would be to<br />
leave us at the mercy of our neighbors, and<br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throw</span> us into their arms.
Independence <br />
would make us masters of our position, but <br />
at the same time we should be deprived of <br />
the protection of England and without that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it is</span> by no means difficult to
foresee what <br />
would become of us. The hon. member for <br />
Hochelaga may think it to our advantage to <br />
be weak, but in that opinion I do not coin- <br />
side ; I consider that it is better to be in a<br />
position to meet the enemy in case of his<br />
attacking us. Let it be well understood<br />
that without the protection of England we<br />
can do nothing. And besides the outlay <br />
which would be entailed by our providing <br />
for our defence, there would also be enor- <br />
mous expenditure in order to keep up in a <br />
suitable manner our relations with foreign <br />
powers. With independence, and without <br />
the support and assistance of’ England, we <br />
should have to maintain an army and a very <br />
expensive government, we should have to <br />
keep up diplomatic relations with other <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">countries,</span> and provide means to
defray a host <br />
of other expenses which we should not have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to do</span> under Confederation.
Independence <br />
is, therefore, out of the question for the pre- <br />
sent. Lastly, we have the fourth alter-<br />
native—the Confederation of the two Ca-<br />
nadas, proposed by the honorable member <br />
for Hochelaga. In his manifesto of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1864</span>
he <br />
told us in what position we should then be. <br />
The following passage is from the manifesto<br />
is question :— <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It would have been easy at any time to
satisfy <br />
Upper Canada by giving her four or ﬁve members <br />
more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> Lower Canada,
preserving at the same <br />
time equality in the Legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council.
To <br />
avoid the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">danger</span> which this
increase of members <br />
</span></p>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 1682 635 3145 1276">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> might entail, it is proposed to give Upper
Canada <br />
seventeen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> more than Lower Canada, <br />
and there are added besides forty-seven members <br />
more for the Maritime Provinces ; in all sixty-four<br />
members are added to the British element besides<br />
the twenty-eight additional members which are <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> to the Legislative Council ;
and this is the <br />
way in which it is pretended that the rights of <br />
Lower Canada are to be protected. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_11" title="bbox 1659 1318 3135 5251">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. member for Hochelaga according
to <br />
his own plan would have preferred— 
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DURlON—It is not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plan,</span> it <br />
is an argument. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SOL.</span> GEN. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LANGEVIN—Then</span> it <br />
is a very bad argument—an argument by no <br />
means advantageous to Lower Canada. The <br />
hon. member says in that manifesto that it <br />
would be quite an easy matter to secure the <br />
silence of Upper Canada, by granting it four<br />
or ﬁve more members than Lower Canada. <br />
But the hon. member very well knows that <br />
if we were to grant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span>
based on <br />
population, it would not be four or ﬁve <br />
members we should have to give to Upper <br />
Canada, but the seventeen members which<br />
it is now proposed to give Upper Canada by <br />
the plan of Confederation. The increase<br />
would not be based on an imaginary number. <br />
But even with four or ﬁve members more in <br />
the present union, Upper Canada could <br />
impose its decision on all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questions</span>
which <br />
might come before the House. The hon. <br />
member for Hochelaga has told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span>
that under <br />
the proposed system. Upper Canada will have<br />
seventeen members more than<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
Lower Canada, <br />
and that the English element will be in- <br />
creased by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">addition</span> of all
the members <br />
from the Lower Provinces, and that they <br />
will enter into a league against us Lower <br />
Canadians. I must say, I do not think the <br />
hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pays</span> a very high
compliment <br />
to his ex-colleague the Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HOLTON,</span>
<br />
when he says that because the members will <br />
be English, they will be against us French- <br />
Canadians. So great was his conﬁdence in <br />
the hon. member for Chateauguay, that he <br />
took him into his Government, and would <br />
take him again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day</span> if he had
the oppor- <br />
tunity ; and yet the hon. member for Hoche- <br />
laga speaks of the English as though they <br />
were our natural enemies. For my part, I <br />
do not think they are ; moreover, the <br />
question before us is not the formation of a <br />
Local Government only. We are considering <br />
the establishment of a Confederacy—with <br />
a Central Parliament and local parlia- <br />
ments. The Central or Federal Parliament <br />
will have the control of all measures <br />
