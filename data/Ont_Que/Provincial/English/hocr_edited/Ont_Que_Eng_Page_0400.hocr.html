<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> advantage to unite themselves with the
pro- <br />
vinces for all general business, reserving to <br />
themselves the management of their local af- <br />
fairs. I quote as follows from one of the <br />
journals in question :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Whatever may be the result of the present
at- <br />
tempts to form a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span>
of the North <br />
American Colonies, we may be certain of one <br />
thing, and that is, that but few years will pass <br />
away before the accomplishment of a plan of this <br />
nature. Half a dozen provinces lying adjacent <br />
to each other, and subject to one and the same <br />
power, having different tariffs, exhibit a state of <br />
affairs which, from its very nature, cannot con- <br />
tinue long. However, setting aside this ano- <br />
maly, we find North American Colonies for which <br />
a more vast political career must be provided. <br />
The people have too long labored under the <br />
weight of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> disabilities which, by
wounding their<br />
pride, have placed them in a humiliating position<br />
before the eyes of the whole world. With all the <br />
advantages of responsible government granted <br />
to him by the Imperial authorities, after years <br />
of strife and trials, the colonist hardly po<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ssesses<br />
one half the national privileges enjoyed by an <br />
Englishman. He is deprived of his share of<br />
patronage even in cases in which he is entitled to <br />
it and is eminently worthy of it. The position of <br />
Colonial Governor is seldom or never granted to <br />
him, and in many parts of Her Majesty ’s <br />
dominions he is forbidden to practise his profes-<br />
sion in the courts of justice. We therefore hail <br />
this initiative taken by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span>
Government <br />
as the commencement of the regeneration of the <br />
colonists, who have hitherto remained in pupilage. <br />
With a confederation of colonies extending from <br />
one ocean to the other, what limits shall we <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assign</span> to our greatness, our
material progress <br />
and our political aspirations ? Instead of seeing <br />
the talent of our statesmen fettered, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">harassed</span>
and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restrained</span> within the narrow
limits of local poli- <br />
tics, we shall ﬁnd its scope extended to a whole <br />
continent, while a more vast and natural ﬁeld <br />
will be thrown open to the active and enterprising <br />
spirit of the North American Provinces. Want <br />
of space prevents our entering upon this question <br />
at greater lenth to-day ; but we hope that the <br />
movement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> succeed and will
allow us at no <br />
distant day to emerge from the isolated and feeble<br />
position in which we now are, to become a part<br />
of the great British North American Confeder- <br />
ation. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That is the language of one of the news- <br />
papers of those colonies. What has the <br />
hon. member to say to it ? I hope I shall <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forgiven</span> for reading some
more extracts <br />
from these journals, which we do not read <br />
here as much as we ought to do, although <br />
they are of a nature to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> us
information <br />

six millions of souls, occupying a territory as <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I shall not occupy any further time in <br />

demonstrate that the plan of Confederation

their extremity, as was said by the hon. <br />

they perceive that it will be advantageous to <br />
them. As to the facilities for communication, <br />
I shall quote an excellent authority—Pro- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Canadian emigrant party assembled at
Fort <br />
Garry, in June, 1862, travelling thither by Detroit, <br />
La Crosse, St. Paul, and Fort Abercrombie, by <br />
rail, stage and steamer. At Fort Garry they <br />
separated into two parties ; the ﬁrst division con- <br />
tained about one hundred emigrants, the second <br />
division, sixty-ﬁve persons. The ﬁrst party took <br />
the northern route, by Carlton to Edmonton ; the <br />
second, the southern trail. At Edmonton they all <br />
changed their carts for horses and oxen, and <br />
went thence in a straight line to the Leather Pass <br />
(lat. 54° ), through which they took 130 oxen, <br />
and about 70 horses. They suddenly found them- <br />
selves on the head waters of the Fraser river, and <br />
so gentle was the ascent that the only means they<br />
had of knowing that they had passed the dividing <br />
ridge of the Rocky Mountains<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> was by
unex- <br />
pectedly observing the waters of the rivers ﬂow- <br />
ing to the westward. When in the mountains they <br />
killed a few oxen for provisions ; others were sold <br />
to the Indians at Tête Jaune Cache, on the Fraser <br />
river, and others were rafted down the Fraser to <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forks</span> of the Quesnelle.
At Tête Jaune Cache <br />
a portion of the party separated from the rest, <br />
and, with fourteen horses, went across the country <br />
by an old well-worn trail, to Thompson’s river, <br />
and thus succeeded in taking their horses from <br />
Fort Garry through the Rocky Mountains— <br />
through a supposed impassable part of British <br />
Columbia—to the wintering station on Thomp- <br />
