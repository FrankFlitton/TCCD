<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> With respect to the
local governments, it is <br />
provided that each shall be governed by a <br />
chief executive officer, who shall be nomin- <br />
ated by the General Government. &nbsp; As this is <br />
to be one united province, with the local <br />
governments and legislatures subordinate to <br />
the General Government and Legislature, it is <br />
obvious that the chief executive officer in <br />
each of the provinces must be subordinate <br />
as well. &nbsp; The General Government assumes <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>towards the
local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments</span>
precisely the <br />
same position as the Imperial Government <br />
holds with respect to each of the colonies <br />
now ; so that as the Lieutenant Governor of <br />
each of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
provinces is now ap- <br />
pointed directly by the Queen, and is direct- <br />
ly responsible, and reports directly to Her, <br />
so will the executives of the local govern- <br />
ments hereafter be subordinate to the Rep- <br />
resentative of the Queen, and be responsible <br />
and report to him. &nbsp; Objection has been tak- <br />
en that there is an infringement of the <br />
Royal prerogative in giving the pardoning <br />
power to the local governors, who are not <br />
appointed directly by the Crown, but only <br />
indirectly by the Chief Executive of the <br />
Confederation, who is appointed by the <br />
Crown. &nbsp; This provision was inserted in the <br />
Constitution on account of the practical dif- <br />
ﬁculty which must arise if the power is <br />
conﬁned to the Governor General. &nbsp; For ex- <br />
ample, if a question arose about the dis- <br />
charge of a prisoner convicted of a minor <br />
offence, say in Newfoundland, who might be <br />
in imminent danger of losing his life if he <br />
remained in conﬁnement, the exercise of the <br />
pardoning power might come too late if it <br />
were necessary to wait for the action of the <br />
Governor General. &nbsp; It must be remembered <br />
that the pardoning power not only extends <br />
to capital cases, but to every case of convic- <br />
tion and sentence, no matter how triﬂing—<br />
even to the case of a ﬁne in the nature of a <br />
sentence on a criminal conviction. It extends <br />
to innumerable cases, where, if the responsi- <br />
bility for its exercise were thrown on the <br />
General Executive, it could not be so satis- <br />
factorily discharged, &nbsp; Of course there must <br />
be, in each province, a legal adviser of the <br />
Executive, occupying the position of our <br />
Attorney General, as there is in every state of <br />
the American Union. &nbsp; This officer will be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>an
ofﬁcer of the Local Government ; but, if <br />
the pardoning power is reserved for the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chief</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive,</span> there must,
in every case <br />
where the exercise of the pardoning power is <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>sought, be a
direct communication and report <br />
from the local law ofﬁcer to the Governor <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> General. The
practical inconvenience of <br />
this was felt to be so great, that it was <br />
thought well to propose the arrangement we <br />
did, without any desire to infringe upon the <br />
prerogatives of the Crown, for our whole ac- <br />
tion shews that the Conference, in every step <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> they took, were
actuated by a desire to guard <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> jealously these
prerogatives. &nbsp; (Hear, hear.) <br />
It is a subject, however, of Imperial interest, <br />
and if the Imperial Government and Imperial <br />
Parliament are not convinced by the argu- <br />
ments we will be able to press upon them for <br />
the continuation of that clause, then, of <br />
course, as the over-ruling power, they may <br />
set it aside. &nbsp; (Hear, hear.) &nbsp; There are nu- <br />
merous subjects which belong, of right, both <br />
to the Local and the General Parliaments. <br />
In all these cases it is provided, in order <br />
to prevent a conﬂict of authority, that <br />
where there is concurrent jurisdiction in the <br />
General and Local Parliaments, the same rule <br />
should apply as now applies in cases where <br />
there is concurrent jurisdiction in the Im- <br />
perial and in the Provincial Parliaments, and <br />
that when the legislation of the one is adverse <br />
to or contradictory of the legislation of the. <br />
other, in all such cases the action of the <br />
General Parliament must overrule, ex-neces- <br />
sitate, the action of the Local Legislature. <br />
(Hear, hear.) &nbsp; We have introduced also all <br />
those provisions which are necessary in order <br />
to the full working out of the British Consti- <br />
tution in these provinces. &nbsp; We provide that <br />
there shall be no money votes, unless those <br />
votes are introduced in the popular branch <br />
of the Legislature on the authority of the <br />
responsible advisers of the Crown—those <br />
with whom the responsibility rests of equal- <br />
izing revenue and expenditure—thnt ere <br />
can be no expenditure or authorization of <br />
expenditure by Address or in any other way <br />
unless initiated by the Crown on the advice <br />
of its responsible advisers. &nbsp; (Hear, hear.) <br />
As regards the ﬁnancial features of the <br />
scheme, the arrangements made as to the <br />
present liabilities of the several provinces, <br />
and the future liabilities of the Confedera- <br />
tion, on these and kindred matters, I have <br />
no doubt that my honorable friends, the <br />
Finance Minister and the President of the <br />
Council, will speak at full length, and that <br />
they will be able to show you that this branch <br />
of the subject has received the fullest con- <br />
sideration. &nbsp; I feel I would be intruding <br />
myself unnecessarily on the House if, with <br />
my inferior knowledge of those subjects I <br />
were to detain you by venturing to speak of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span>them, when I
know that they will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span>
so ably <br />
