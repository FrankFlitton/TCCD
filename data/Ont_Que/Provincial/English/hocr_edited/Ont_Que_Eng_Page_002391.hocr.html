in saying what I said ; but after the <br />
explanations which the hon. gentleman has <br />
just <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given, I cannot accuse him of
having <br />
done it otherwise than inadvertently. The <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga stated that <br />
the memorial submitted by the Government <br />
at the time of its formation spoke of a Con- <br />
federation other than the one which it now <br />
proposes. It will be well to refer to the docu- <br />
ment in question in order to ascertain its <br />
contents. The memorial consists of two <br />
parts, of which the following is the ﬁrst :— <br />
</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 285 1652 1841 5167">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Government are prepared to state that
<br />
immediately after the prorogation, they will <br />
address themselves, in the most earnest manner, <br />
to the negotiation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> a
Confederation of all the <br />
British North American Provinces. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That failing a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">successful</span> issue to such negoti- <br />
ations, they are prepared to pledge themselves to <br />
legislation,during the next session of Parliament, <br />
for the purpose of remedying existing difficulties <br />
by introducing the Federal principle for Canada <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alone,</span> coupled with such
provisions as will permit <br />
the Maritime Provinces and the North-Western<br />
territory to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hereafter</span>
incorporated into the <br />
Canadian system. <br />
In other words, the Government promises, <br />
in the ﬁrst part of the memorial in question, <br />
to direct its attention to a Confederation of <br />
all the British North American Provinces ; <br />
and, in the event of its not succeeding in <br />
carrying out that object, to turn its attention <br />
to a Confederation of the two Canadas. And <br />
now here are the contents of the second <br />
part :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Government are prepared to pledge
them- <br />
selves to bring in a measure, next session, for the <br />
purpose of removing existing difficulties, by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intro-</span><br />
ducing the Federal principle into Canada, coupled<br />
with such provision as will permit the Maritime <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> and the North-West
territory to be in-<br />
corporated into the same system of government.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">And the Government will seek, by sending <br />
representatives to the Lower Provinces and to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span> to secure the assent of
those interests <br />
which are beyond the control of our own legis- <br />
lation, to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> such a measure as may
enable all <br />
British North America to be united under a <br />
General Legislature based upon the Federal <br />
principle. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Well,</span>
where is the contradiction between <br />
these promises and the present action of the <br />
Government ? We begin with a plan of <br />
Confederation for the two Canadas, and sub- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sequently,</span> ﬁnding that the
Maritime Pro- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vinces</span> are ready to enter upon
the considera- <br />
tion of a more extensive union, we have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> arrangements to bring them
at once <br />
into the Confederation. There is no contra- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diction
in that, but it is the same measure <br />
and the same plan ; the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span>
is,<br />
that, instead of admitting them into the <br />
union some six or nine months hence, we<br />
have admitted them at once. When <br />
we approached the question, we found <br />
the Maritime Provinces in process of de-<br />
liberating upon a union amongst them-<br />
selves ; but the Charlottetown delegates<br />
perceived that the Confederation which we<br />
proposed to them would be much more <br />
advantageous to all the provinces than that <br />
upon which they were engaged, and they at <br />
once consented to accept our proposition.<br />
Accordingly they came to Quebec, and the <br />
result of their visit was the plan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span>
has <br />
been submitted to this House. The hon. <br />
member for Hochelaga has, therefore, no<br />
right to reproach us with having altered the <br />
plan promised to the House, since it is word<br />
for word that which we promised. This<br />
measure, as I observed a short time ago, <br />
cannot last, unless it protects the interests<br />
of all. Now, we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
interests in <br />
Lower Canada, in which reside two popula- <br />
tions differing in origin, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differing</span> in religion, <br />
and speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
languages. On the <br />
other hand, Upper Canada has a homogeneous<br />
population, but one professing different <br />
religions, and so it is with respect to the<br />
several Maritime Provinces. In these latter <br />
provinces, also, we have more than one hun-<br />
dred thousand fellow countrymen of French <br />
origin. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, we have taken <br />
care to protect these different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests,</span>
and <br />
to preserve the rights of this population, by <br />
uniting them in the Confederation to a peo-<br />
ple numbering a million souls of the same <br />
origin as themselves. But we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">told:</span>
<br />
“ You wish to form a new nationality.” Let <br />
us come to an understanding on this word, <br />
Mr. SPEAKER. What we desire and wish, <br />
is to defend the general interests of a great <br />
country and of a powerful nation, by means <br />
of a central power. On the other hand,we <br />
do not wish to do away with our different <br />
customs, manners and laws ; on the contrary, <br />
those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are precisely</span> what we are
desirous of <br />
protecting in the most complete manner <br />
by means of Confederation. Under the <br />
new system there will be no more reason <br />
than at present to lose our character as <br />
French or English, under the pretext <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
<br />
we should all have the same general in- <br />
terests ; and our interests in relation to race,</span><br />
religion and nationality will remain as
they <br />
