nication between Halifax and Quebec would, in <br />
fact, produce relations between these Provinces <br />
that would render a general union absolutely <br />
necessary. Several surveys proved that a railway <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> This passage greatly impressed the public
<br />
men of the day—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LAFONTAINE</span>-BALD-
<br />
WIN Administration—in which Mr. HINCKS <br />
and the honorable Premier each had a <br />
place. It was under them that the railway <br />
legislation of the province received its ﬁrst <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impulse,</span> and last session I
remember to have <br />
had occasion to quote the preamble of an act <br />
passed in 1851, which recites:— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That, whereas it is of the highest
importance <br />
to the progress and welfare of this province, that <br />
a Main Trunk line of railway should be made <br />
throughout the length thereof, and from the <br />
eastern frontier thereof through the provinces of <br />
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to the city and <br />
port of Halifax; and it is therefore expedient <br />
that every effort should be made to ensure the <br />
construction of such railway. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 150 3042 1645 5008">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The second clause of the act </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Authorizes the Government, for the time <br />
being, to negotiate with the Imperial Government <br />
and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, for the <br />
construction of the line, and to bargain therefor; <br />
the funds to be obtained under Imperial guarantee. </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">This act, honorable gentlemen, is still in
<br />
force, and from the time of its passing there has <br />
always been an anxiety among the public men <br />
of Canada to accomplish the construction of a <br />
railway to Halifax. All our governments, <br />
without exception, have felt in the same way, <br />
and the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Administration <br />
took steps towards such an end. But the <br />
difficulties which followed stopped further pro- <br />
gress, and, in fact, had almost stopped legisla- <br />
tion altogether. Now, however, the Hon. Mr. <br />
BROWN himself has made the construction of <br />
this railway a part of the proposed Constitu- <br />
tion, and has said, at a great meeting in To- <br />
ronto, that if the project contained half-a-dozen <br />
intercolonial railways he would go for them all. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I feel morally certain that if <br />
the subject were fairly discussed in every town <br />
in Upper Canada, nine-tenths of the people<br />
would go heartily for it. Indeed, the
railway<br />
is absolutely necessary and we cannot do<br />
without it. Upper Canada alone, not to
speak <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of Lower Canada at all, requires it, and so <br />
well is this understood in the Lower Provinces <br />
that an opponent of the Hon. Mr. TILLEY— <br />
Hon. Mr. SMITH—has lately said it was quite <br />
unnecessary for New Brunswick to spend any <br />
money on the work, as Upper Canada must <br />
build it for its own sake. As to the cost of <br />
this road, which has been so greatly exaggera- <br />
ted, Mr. BRYDGES, who must be supposed to <br />
know something about the matter, has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered,</span>
<br />
on behalf of an English company, to under- <br />
take the construction of the line for £3,500,000 <br />
sterling. Everybody knows how much that <br />
is, and when reciprocity is gone, Upper <br />
Canada will do well to build the road on its <br />
own account, if all the other provinces refuse. <br />
They will however not refuse, for the line is <br />equally necessary for Lower Canada and the <br />
other provinces, and it is a great
advantage to <br />
all parties that it should be so. New Bruns- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wick</span> requires it to open up its
rich interior <br />
country which contains, as I have learned from <br />
advance reports of subordinate surveying en- <br />
gineers, some of the ﬁnest lands in the world. <br />
Halifax wants it, in order to bring freight to <br />
her great seaport when those of Quebec and <br />
Montreal are closed. It should have been <br />
commenced three years ago, and if it had it <br />
would now be built, and we should have heard <br />
nothing about the abolition of the Reciprocity <br />
Treaty. (Hear, hear.) The honorable member <br />
then asked why, since there was to be a disso- <br />
lution and an appeal to the people of New <br />
Brunswick on the subject, there should not be <br />
one in Canada? The answer to that has al- <br />
ready been given. The term of Parliament <br />
would have expired in that province on the <br />
1st of June, and as the members would then <br />
have had to go to their constituents to give an <br />
account of their conduct during the previous <br />
four years, it was thought better to anticipate <br />
the time of its dissolution by three or four <br />
months. In Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, <br />
however, where the elections were more <br />
recent, there are to be no elections. I will <br />
add that this mode of appealing to the people <br />
is not British but American, as under the <br />
British system the representatives of the peo- <br />
ple in Parliament are presumed to be compe- <br />
tent to decide all the public questions submit- <br />
ted to them. When the unions between Eng- <br />
land and Scotland, and between England and <br />
Ireland were effected, there were no appeals to <br />
the people, it being assumed that the people's <br />
chosen representatives were quite competent to <br />
judge of the measures. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span>
hear.) Yet <br />
the members who have recently gone to the <br />
country have found public opinion to be de- <br />
