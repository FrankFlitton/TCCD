contains <br />
provisions which are unjust to Lower Canada. <br />
The full scope of that clause is not generally <br />
understood ; that proportion of ﬁve per cent. <br />
appears to be a very small affair, and yet, <br />
under certain circu<span style="background-color: white;">mstances, it might produce </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
considerable results,</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;"> which are not
taken into </span><br style="background-color: white;" />

that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

Mr. CAUCHON, which the Government has </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
caused to be distributed (pages 72 to 87). </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
It is difﬁcult to foretell what the exact numer- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ical increase of the several provinces will be </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
from the present time to the next census in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
1871. The Honorable Mr. CAUCHON assumes, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
as the basis of his calculations, a rate of thirty </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">that i</span><span style="background-color: white;">n all the provinces (with the

by thirty per cent between 1861 and 1871, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
and that that of Lower Canada increases by </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
thirty-four per cent. It may, perhaps, be </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of such importance as that which is now
under <br />
our consideration, we should provide for all <br />
possible contingencies ; but this one is far <br />
from being impossible if the predictions of the <br />
Minister of Finance and the Attorney General, <br />
who promise to Lower Canada so brilliant a <br />
future under the Federal system, are fulﬁlled. <br />
If Lower Canada becomes the heart of the <br />
commercial life of the Confederation ; if the <br />
mines of copper, lead, silver, and gold which <br />
we have lately discovered should produce the <br />
same results that they produce everywhere <br />
else, that of attracting a great inﬂux of popu- <br />
lation, I cannot be accused of any very great <br />
exaggeration in supposing that the population <br />
of Lower Canada may, between the years 1861 <br />
and 1871, increase by four per cent more <br />
than the population of the other provinccs. <br />
In the case which I have supposed the in- <br />
crease would be as follows :— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> According to this calculation, Lower
Canada <br />
would have, in 1871, a population of 1,488,- <br />
289 souls, which would have to be divided by <br />
65, that being the invariable number of repre- <br />
sentatives assigned to Lower Canada, in order <br />
to ascertain what will be the number of con- <br />
stituents for each representative in the Fed- <br />
eral Parliament ; the result will be found to <br />
be 22,896. Upper Canada would have a <br />

divided <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">by 22,896, would give her seventy-nine
repre- <br />
sentatives instead of eighty-two. Nova Scotia <br />
would have a population of 430,114 souls, <br />
which would give her nineteen <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
as at present (eighteen and a fraction over the <br />
half). New Brunswick would have a popu- <br />
lation of 327,661 souls, which would give her <br />
fourteen representatives instead of ﬁfteen. <br />
Newfoundland would have a population of<br />
169,000 souls, which would give her seven <br />
representatives instead of eight. Prince Ed- <br />
ward Island would have a population of <br />
104,984 souls, which would give her ﬁve <br />
members as at present (four and a fraction <br />
over the half). It will be seen that if the <br />
ﬁve other provinces were represented on the <br />
same scale as Lower Canada, they would, in <br />
1871, lose among them ﬁve members ; but as <br />
the total population of each will not have <br />
decreased by ﬁve per cent, relatively to the <br />
total population of the Confederated <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
