<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Upper House has already sanctioned the <br />
scheme, and I would take the opportunity of <br />
remarking that I do not think that the mem- <br />
bers of that House can be ri<span style="background-color: white;">ghtly</span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">
charged <br />
with not having given it that <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">deliberate</span><span style="background-color: white;">
con- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
sideration which its importance demands. I </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
think that they have shown a very proper ex- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ample in their discussion of the </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span><span style="background-color: white;">
and </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
one that we may well follow. They </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">debated</span><span style="background-color: white;">
</span><br />
with leisure, deliberation, and a thorough ap- <br />
preciation of its gravity, day by day, during <br />
four weeks, and I therefore think that the <br />
members of the Upper House ought not to <br />
have been charged with “ indecent haste.” <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span style="background-color: white;"> HON. J. S. MACDONALD—Who said so ? </span><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. MORRIS—The honorable member <br />
from Cornwall was one of those who said so. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. J. S. MACDONALD—I said it was <br />
unsuitable haste. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MORRIS—I have somewhat of a re- <br />
cording memory, and I think the words he <br />
unfortunately used were “ indecent haste.” <br />
However, I have no intention of disputing <br />
with my honorable friend as to the particular <br />
words he used. I have only to express my <br />
opinion that the time which has been already <br />
spent on this<span style="background-color: white;"> </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span><span style="background-color: white;"> here and
elsewhere has </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
not been lost. I think it is our duty to con- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
sider this subject in all its aspects, and be- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
lieving as I do that the scheme will be adopt- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ed by this House, I feel the importance of a </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
full and free discussion, in order that its mer- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
its may be put before the country. (Hear, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I desire now to state </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
that I support the proposal at present under </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
our consideration, because in my honest and </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
deliberate judgment I believe that this union, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
if accomplished, is calculated in its practical </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">effects</span><span style="background-color: white;"> to bind u</span>s more closely
to Britain than <br />
We could be bound by any other system. <br />
(Hear, hear.) <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> A VOICE—It would put an end to the <br />
connection. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. MORRIS—An honorable member <br />
says “it would put an end to the connection.” <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Well, I would say to that honorable
gentle- <br />
man and this House, that in my opinion there <br />
are but two destinies before us. We have <br />
either to rise into strength and wealth and <br />
power by means of this union, under the shel- <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">tering</span><span style="background-color: white;"> protection of Britain, or
we must be </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
absorbed by the great power beside us. (Hear, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
hear.) I believe that that is the only con- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
clusion we can arrive at. </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
</p>
<p style="background-color: white;" class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> A VOICE—But the people are against it. <br />

<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span><span style="background-color: white;"> the people are not in favor

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span style="background-color: white;"> the people are in favor of the change.
When </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the public mind is excited against any mea- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
sure, is there not a means open to the </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span><span style="background-color: white;">
</span><br />
to make known their opposition, and how is it <br />
that the table of this House is not covered <br />
with petitions against the scheme, if it is so <br />
unpopular as honorable gentlemen would have <br />
us believe ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> AN HON. MEMBER—There are no peti- <br />
tions for it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. MORRIS—An honorable gentleman <br />
says “ there are no petitions for it.” And why <br />
is it that there are not? Is it not because the <br />
Government was constituted on the basis of <br />
union ? (Hear, hear.) The people, through <br />
a vast majority of their representatives in this <br /><span style="background-color: white;">
House, are in favor of it. If they are op- </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">posed</span><span style="background-color: white;"> to </span>it they have the remedy
in their own <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">hands, they have the means of opposing,
but <br />
they do not oppose it because they feel that a <br />
change of some kind is absolutely essential, <br />
and they have conﬁdence in the wisdom of <br />
those entrusted with the destiny of the country <br />
in this crisis of its history. But I say that <br />
the great reason why this scheme has taken <br />
the hold that it has done upon the public men <br />
of the province, is that they see in it an <br />
earnest desire to perpetuate British connec- <br />
tion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—It will turn out a <br />
delusion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. MORRIS—I am not a prophet, nor <br />
the son of a prophet, but I am willing to <br />
place my prediction against that of the honor- <br />
able gentleman who says it will be a delusion. <br />
(Hear, hear.) A fear has been expressed <br />
that the Confederation will lead to the sever- <br />
ance of those links which bind us to the <br />
Mother Country. But I believe it will be <br />
our own fault if the ties between us are <br />
broken. With entire freedom and the right <br />
of self-government in the fullest sense of the <br />
word, together with the great advantage of an <br />
improved position, and the strength and <br />
power of Great Britian to foster and protect <br />
us, why should we seek to change our con- <br />
nection, what object could we have to induce <br />
us to form other ties? (Hear, hear.) What <br />
have we to envy in the position of the neigh- <br />
boring country, burdened as it is with the <br />
heavy load of taxation arising from the cruel <br />
war raging there, that we should covet that <br />
ﬂag? Why then should our coming together <br />
for the purpose of union weaken our position <br />
or diminish the tie that links us to Britain ? <br />
It will be for honorable gentlemen who do not <br />
believe that the union of these scattered colo- <br />
nies will give them strength, to prove that, <br />
