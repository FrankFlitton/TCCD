<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> there will be no reduction in the number
of <br />
their representatives, in accordance with the <br />
provisions of this 21st clause. It is the <br />
interest of Lower Canada, more than of any <br />
other province, to watch with a jealous eye <br />
over the mechanism adopted for the organiza- <br />
tion of the Federal Legislature. In case of a <br />
vital question arising, we should have to coun- <br />
teract the votes of these ﬁve members (who <br />
ought, in justice, to be deducted from the <br />
representation of the other provinces) by those <br />
of ﬁve of our members, whose votes would <br />
thus be lost to us, as would also be the weight <br />
which their ﬁve united counties, with a total <br />
population of 114,480 (or 22,896 for each <br />
county), would throw into the scale. Other <br />
combinations of circumstances might arise <br />
which might prove even more disadvantageous <br />
to us. This subject naturally leads me to <br />
address myself to my French Canadian col- <br />
leagues ; I fear that my remarks may not be <br />
well received by all, but I hope that honorable <br />
members will be good enough to excuse my <br />
frankness in consideration of the great import- <br />
ance of the question. I have no right to <br />
maintain that all those who are favorably dis- <br />
posed towards Confederation are not acting in <br />
good faith ; it is not my wish to reproach <br />
them for acting according to their convictions, <br />
but in so acting they should not forget the <br />
duties which their charge imposes on them. <br />
It a well known fact that when the scheme <br />
of Confederation was laid before the pub- <br />
lic, all the newspapers, and most of the <br />
members who support the Administration, <br />
declared themselves in favor of the scheme, <br />
but, in nearly every instance, with an ex- <br />
press reservation of the right to introduce <br />
certain amendments which they considered <br />
indispensable. But the Honorable Attor- <br />
ney General for Upper Canada declared, <br />
some days ago, that the Government would <br />
accept no amendment, and that the resolu- <br />
tions must be adopted exactly in the shape in <br />
which they were brought down. Are honor- <br />
able members going to submit to this decree ? <br />
Is it not their intention at least to make an <br />
effort to have those amendments, which they <br />
looked upon as indispensable, adopted ? Their <br />
position in relation to the Government confers <br />
upon them an inﬂuence which they can never <br />
exert more usefully than at present ; it is <br />
their duty to exert that inﬂuence ; they are <br />
responsible for the results of this measure, <br />
which cannot be adopted without th<span style="background-color: white;">eir con- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
currence. Their principal argument in sup- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
port of Confederation is that we have now an </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
excellent opportunity of obtaining favorable</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />

proba- <br />
bly never occur again, and one of which it is <br />
their duty to avail themselves. But have the <br />
honorable members made those conditions ? <br />
Have they taken as great precautions to pre- <br />
serve intact the interests of nearly a million <br />
French Canadians entruste<span style="background-color: white;">d to their care, as </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

ditions at all ? If they have made no condi- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

nature of the form of Government which will </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
be imposed on Lower Canada? Can they </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
say whether we shall have Responsible Gov- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ernment ? No ! for the Ministry refuses to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
speak ; it will only speak when the measure </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of Confederation shall have been adopted, and </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
when it is too late to raise any objections. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Responsible government would not be a very </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
efﬁcacious remedy for the evils which I fore- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
see, but it would, at all events, be a means of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
defence for us, and we ought not to reject it. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
It is true that, accordig to the 4lst article </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of the resolutions, " The </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;">local
governments </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

structed in such manner as the existing legis- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

But the English element is at </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span><span style="background-color: white;"> in the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

naturally favorable </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;">to responsible
govern- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ment. That is true when it relates to them- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
selves ; for how many years did Canada re- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
main without responsible government ? The </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
painful events of 1837 and 1838 were the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
result of that anomaly in the parliamentary </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
system. Upper </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span><span style="background-color: white;"> will not need, as we </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
shall, a local responsible government ; it will </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
not have, as we shall have, to defend a nation- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ality which will be in a minority in the Fed- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

enjoy in Lower Canada those powers which </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
parliamentary authority everywhere accords </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to the majority. Upper Canada only desires </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to make of her local legislature a municipal </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

Canada, who will gain nothing by having a</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;">
