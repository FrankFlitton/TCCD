<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> in every word we utter ; it is that the
consti- <br />
tutional system of Canada cannot remain as it <br />
is now. (Loud cries of hear, hear.) Something <br />
must be done. We cannot stand still. We <br />
cannot go back to chronic, sectional hostility <br />
and discord—to a state of perpetual Ministerial <br />
crises. The events of the last eight months <br />
cannot be obliterated ; the solemn admissions <br />
of men of all parties can never be erased. The <br />
claims of Upper Canada for justice must be <br />
met, and met now. I say, then, that every one <br />
who raises his voice in hostility to this measure <br />
is bound to keep before him, when he speaks, <br />
all the perilous consequences of its rejection,— <br />
I say that no man who has a true regard for <br />
the well-being of Canada, can give a vote <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> this scheme, unless he is
prepared to <br />
offer, in amendment, some better remedy for <br />
the evils and injustice that have so long threat- <br />
ened the peace of our country. (Hear, hear.) <br />
And not only must the scheme proposed in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment</span> be a better scheme—it
must be <br />
something that can be carried. (Hear, hear.) <br />
I see an honorable friend now before me, for <br />
whose opinions I have the very highest respect, <br />
who says to me : “ Mr. BROWN, you should <br />
not have settled this part of the plan as you <br />
have done ; here is the way you should have <br />
framed it." “ Well, my dear sir," is my reply, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“I perfectly agree with you, but
it could not <br />
be done. Whether we ask for parliamentary <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reform</span> for Canada alone or in
union with <br />
the Maritime Provinces, the French Canadians <br />
must have their views consulted as well as us. <br />
This scheme can be carried, and no scheme <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can be</span> that has not the support
of both sec- <br />
tions of the province." <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon. Mr.</span>
CARTIER—Hear, hear ! there <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> is the question ! </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span>
Mr. BROWN—Yes, that is the ques- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion</span> and the whole question. No
constitution <br />
ever framed was without defect; no act of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">human</span> wisdom was ever free from
imperfec- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion;</span> no amount of talent and
wisdom and <br />
integrity combined in preparing such a scheme <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span> have placed it beyond the
reach of criti- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cism.</span> And the framers of this
scheme had <br />
immense special difficulties to overcome. We <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> the prejudices of race and
language and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religion</span> to deal with; and we had
to encounter <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all </span>the rivalries of trade and
commerce, and <br />
all the jealousies of diversified local interests. <br />
To assert<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> then, that our scheme
is without <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fault,</span> would be folly. It was
necessarily the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work </span>of concession ; not one of
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thirty-three</span> <br />
framers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but had, on some points, to
yield his <br />
opinions; and, for myself, I freely admit that <br />
I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">struggled</span> earnestly, for days
together, to <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> have portions of the scheme amended. But,
<br />
Mr. SPEAKER<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> admitting all
this—admitting <br />
all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties</span> that beset
us—admitting <br />
frankly that defects in the measure exist—I <br />
say that, taking the scheme as a whole, it has <br />
my cordial, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enthusiastic</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">support,</span> without hesi- <br />
tation or reservation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(H</span>ear,
hear.) I be- <br />
lieve it will accomplish all, and more than all, <br />
that we, who have so long fought the battle of <br />
parliamentary reform, ever hoped to see ac- <br />
complished. I believe that, while granting se- <br />
curity for local interests, it will give free scope <br />
for carrying out the will of the whole people <br />
in general matters—that it will draw closer <br />
the bonds that unite us to Great Britain—and <br />
that it will lay the foundations deep and <br />
strong of a powerful and prosperous people. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span> And if the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will allow me</span> <br />
to trespass to a somewhat unusual degree on <br />
its indulgence, I am satisfied that I can clear- <br />
ly establish that such are the results fairly to <br />
be anticipated from the measure. Mr. SPEAK- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ER,</span> there are two views in which
this scheme <br />
may be regarded, namely, the existing evils it <br />
will remedy, and the new advantages it will <br />
secure for us as a people. Let us begin by <br />
examining its remedial provisions. First, then, <br />
it applies a complete and satisfactory remedy <br />
to the injustice of the existing system of par-<br />
liamentary representation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(H</span>ear,
hear.) The <br />
people of Upper Canada have bitterly com- <br />
plained that though they numbered four hun- <br />
dred thousand souls more than the population <br />
of Lower Canada, and though they have con- <br />
tributed three or four pounds to the general <br />
revenue for every pound contributed by the <br />
sister province, yet the Lower Canadians send <br />
to Parliament as many representatives as they <br />
do. Now, sir, the measure in your hands <br />
brings this injustice to an end ;-—it sweeps <br />
away the line of demarcation between the two <br />
sections on all matters common to the whole <br />
province ; it gives representation according to <br />
numbers wherever found in the House of As- <br />
sembly ; and it provides a simple and conve- <br />
nient system for re-adjusting the representa- <br />
tion after each decennial census. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span>
<br />
To this proposed constitution of the Lower <br />
Chamber, I have heard only two objections. <br />
It has been alleged that until after the census <br />
of 1871, the number of members is to re- <br />
main as at present; but this is a mistake. <br />
Upper Canada is to receive from the start <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eighty-two</span> representatives, and
Lower Canada <br />
sixty-five; and whatever increase the census <br />
of 1871 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may establish</span> will be
then adjusted. <br />
It has also been objected that though the reso- <br />
lutions provide that the existing Parliament <br />
