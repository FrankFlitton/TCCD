<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> tines—resolutions which, as they stand, <br />
are incapable of justiﬁcation — resolutions <br />
which shew concession after concession to <br />
have been made to the eastern provinces, <br />
but not one of which (I challenge them to <br />
the proof) was made by the Lower Pro- <br />
vinces to the people of Canada ? Then look <br />
at the representation at the Conference. <br />
Both parties, I believe, from all the provinces <br />
were represented, except as regards one sec- <br />
tion of Canada.  There was no one repre- <br />
senting in the Conference the Liberal party <br />
in Lower Canada.  (Hear, hear.) While <br />
in the eastern provinces the Government <br />
of the day were magnanimous enough to ask <br />
the cooperation and consideration of the <br />
leaders of the Opposition in those provinces, <br />
the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> in Canada
ignored <br />
entirely the existence of the Liberal party <br />
in Lower Canada.  (Hear, hear.) My hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> from the Erie Division
tells us that <br />
he is strongly opposed to the details of the <br />
scheme. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CHRISTIE—I did not say <br />
so. I stated in reference to the elective <br />
principle that I was opposed to its abro- <br />
gation. <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
MR. CURRIE—If the hon. gentle- <br />
man feels towards the elective principle as <br />
strongly as I do, he will oppose its abro- <br />
gation to the last. I have reason to feel <br />
strongly in regard to that principle, being, like <br />
himself, indebted for it to a seat in the Le- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gislature ;</span> and I will resist the
measure very <br />
long before I vote against a principle giving <br />
the people power to send me here as their <br />
representative. The hon. gentleman also
told <br />
us that the whole country is in favor of <br />
Federation. I have no doubt the whole coun- <br />
try is in favor of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federation</span> in
itself, but there <br />
are many people throughout Canada who are <br />
opposed to the present scheme on account of <br />
its details. Then the hon. gentleman declared <br />
that the country understood the scheme. <br />
Now, what better illustration can we have of <br />
the falsity of this position than what was <br />
witnessed on the ﬂoor of this House last <br />
night ? We then heard one of the most intel- <br />
ligent and one of the most able members of the <br />
mercantile community in Upper Canada, my <br />
hon. friend from Ottawa Division (Hon. Mr. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SKEAD)</span> tell us it was only within
the last <br />
twenty-four hours that he had understood the <br />
scheme as now submitted to the House. And <br />
yet we are gravely told that the whole country <br />
understands it ! Do the people of the pro- <br />
vince generally know anything in reference <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> to the cost of working the scheme ? Hon. <br />
gentlemen, it has been stated in various parts <br />
of the country, by leading public men of. the <br />
country, that the local subsidies proposed <br />
in the scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> be more than
sufficient <br />
to carry on the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments</span>
of the <br />
several provinces. But, hon. gentlemen, we <br />
must judge of the future by the experience <br />
afforded by the past. If you will look at the <br />
Public Accounts of Upper and Lower Canada <br />
—take for instance Upper Canada<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
in 1838,— <br />
you will ﬁnd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the
expenditure on 450,000 <br />
of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> was $885,000 for
one year. <br />
But hon. gentlemen may assert that at that <br />
time Upper Canada had to bear the <br />
burdens of the militia and pay the cost of <br />
collecting the customs, and some other small <br />
charges which it is now proposed to throw <br />
on the Federal Government. But what were <br />
the charges of the militia for that year ? The <br />
insigniﬁcant sum of £649. 19s.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> 11 1/2d.  Then <br />
there was received from fees and commissions <br />
£317 15s., thus making the total cost of the <br />
militia to Upper Canada no more than <br />
£332. 4s. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />11 1/2d. Then as
to customs. Why, <br />
honorable gentlemen, the whole cost of <br />
collecting the customs revenue in Upper <br />
Canada, during the year 1838, amounted <br />
to £2,792. 14s. 2d.—just about one half <br />
the cost, hardly one half the cost — of <br />
collecting the present duties at the port <br />
of Toronto. Then if you come down to <br />
Lower Canada you will find that at the time <br />
of the union you had a population of 650,000 <br />
souls, and that the expense of governing the <br />
people was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$573,348.</span> And I venture
to <br />
say that no people in the world were ever <br />
more cheaply governed than were the people <br />
of Lower Canada before the union. (Hear, <br />
hear.) But if you can govern them after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
union just as cheaply per head as before, what <br />
do you ﬁnd ? You will require $980,000 to <br />
carry on the government of the country, <br />
independent of paying the interest upon the <br />
large portion of debt saddled upon you. In <br />
Upper Canada, we have been told that we <br />
really shall not know what to do with the <br />
large amount of money about to be lavished <br />
on the Local Legislature. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span>
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. MCCREA—Who said that—— <br />
that we would have more money than we <br />
know what to do with ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—You must have <br />
read it in the speeches made in the other <br />
House, and particularly in the speeches of <br />
the Hon. Mr. Brown. Well, if we can <br />
govern the people of Upper Canada as cheap- <br />
