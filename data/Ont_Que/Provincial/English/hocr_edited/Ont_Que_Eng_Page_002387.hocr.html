<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of a general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character,</span> as provided by <br />
the Quebec Conference ; but all matters <br />
of local interest, all that relates to the <br />
affairs and rights of the different sections of <br />
the Confederacy, will be reserved for the <br />
control of the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliaments.</span>
The posi- <br />
tion in which Confederation will place us is <br />
very different from that which we should <br />
have occupied under the system proposed by <br />
the honorable member, inasmuch as the <br />
seventeen members, which Upper Canada <br />
will have more than Lower Canada, will <br />
have nothing to do with our local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span>
<br />
our religious questions or particular institu- <br />
tions, and the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hochelaga,</span>
<br />
by his scheme, would have entrusted all <br />
that to the good-will of the Upper Canadian <br />
majority ; but for my part, I would rather <br />
entrust the management of these matters to <br />
my own people than to them. As regards <br />
the seventeen additional members which <br />
Upper Canada will have in the Federal Par- <br />
liament, I am not alarmed at their presence <br />
any more than at that of the members from <br />
the Lower Provinces, because in Parliament <br />
there will be no questions of race, nation- <br />
ality, religion or locality, as this Legislature <br />
will only be charged with the settlement of <br />
the great general questions which will <br />
interest alike the whole Confederacy and <br />
not one locality only. Our position <br />
then is excellent, and all those who <br />
frankly give expression to their opinions <br />
must admit that the representatives of Lower <br />
Canada at the Quebec Conference have care- <br />
fully guarded her interests. I may say that <br />
the basis of action adopted by the delegates, <br />
in preparing the resolutions, was to do jus- <br />
tice to all—justice to all races, to all reli- <br />
gions, to all nationalities, and to all interests. <br />
For this reason the Confederation will be <br />
accepted by all, in the Lower Provinces as <br />
well as here. Under Confederation there <br />
will no longer be domination of one race over <br />
another, and if one section should be desirous <br />
of committing an act of injustice against <br />
another section, all the others would unite <br />
together to prevent it. But, supposing that <br />
an unjust measure was passed in the House <br />
of Commons of the Federal Legislature, it <br />
would be stopped in the Legislative Council ; <br />
for there we shall be represented equally <br />
with the other sections, and that is a guar- <br />
antee that our interests will be amply pro- <br />
tected. In the Legislative Council we shall <br />
have 24 members like Upper Canada and <br />
the Lower Provinces. I assert, then, that <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 1961 600 3414 2197">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> there is a vast difference between the
argu- <br />
ments of the hon. member for Hochelaga <br />
and the measure of the Government ; our <br />
interests will be protected by the Legisla- <br />
tive Council, and the measures of general <br />
interest will come under the jurisdiction of <br />
the Federal Parliament. When the matter <br />
under consideration is a great public enter- <br />
prise, such as a railway, a canal or a tele- <br />
graph line, our religious and national in- <br />
terests will not be endangered. It will be the <br />
duty of the Central Government to see that <br />
the country prospers, but it will not be its <br />
duty to attack our religion, our institutions or <br />
our nationality, which, moreover, as I have <br />
just proved, will be amply protected. While <br />
on this point, I will draw the attention of the <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga to the fact, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> in 1859 he expressed himself
as fol- <br />
ows :— <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 1981 2251 3419 3876">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Whatever may be the number of provinces
or <br />
of subdivisions which it may hereafter be deemed <br />
necessary to adopt, the separating line between <br />
Upper and Lower Canada must be maintained. <br />
In deﬁning the powers of the local and federal <br />
governments, those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> must be
delegated to <br />
the latter which would be absolutely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span>
<br />
for the purposes of Confederation, and, as a neces- <br />
sary consequence, reserve to the subdivisions <br />
powers as ample and as varied as possible. The <br />
customs, the mail service, the laws respecting the <br />
currency, patents and copy-rights, the public <br />
lands, and such of the public works <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as possess</span>
<br />
an interest common to all parts of the country, <br />
ought to be the principal, if not the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objects</span> <br />
which would be placed under the control of the <br />
Federal Government, whilst all that would relate <br />
to improvements purely local—to education, the <br />
administration of justice, the militia, the laws of <br />
preperty, and of internal police—would be under <br />
the control of the local governments, whose <br />
powers, in a word, would extend to all matters not <br />
specially delegated to the General Government. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Thus we see that the honorable member <br />
was willing to give up the control of the <br />
public lands to the Federal Government. <br />
He considered that it would be better to <br />
leave the control of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonization</span>
and the <br />
public lands to the Federal Government, in <br />
which, nevertheless, he was prepared to give <br />
a preponderance to Upper Canada. By the <br />
plan of Confederation brought down by the <br />
present Government, the control of these <br />
matters is given up to the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures,</span>
<br />
and I earnestly hope that the honorable <br />
member will not endeavor to take them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">away</span>
<br />
and transfer them to the control of the Fed- <br />
eral Government. If his plan or his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argu-</span>
