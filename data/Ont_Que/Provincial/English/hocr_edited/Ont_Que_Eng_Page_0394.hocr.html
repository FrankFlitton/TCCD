<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> liberties. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I believe
the <br />
people know their interests as well as the hon- <br />
orable member for Hochelaga, and that they <br />
will not heap reproaches upon us for having <br />
given them a Constitution, the object of which <br />
is to protect their local and general rights in a <br />
much more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effectual</span> manner than
they are <br />
protected under the present system. While <br />
thus attacking the Conservative party, the <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga did not <br />
neglect also to make a slight insinuation against <br />
the delegates to the Conference. In fact, he <br />
says :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Speaker of the Legislative Council
will <br />
also be appointed by the Crown. This is another <br />
retrograde step, and a bit of patronage more for <br />
the Government. We have all heard talk of a<br />
speech delivered lately in the Island of Prince <br />
Edward or in New Brunswick—I forget which—in <br />
which the speaker enumerated the advantages <br />
which had been ﬂashed in the eyes of the delegates, <br />
while they were here, in the shape of appointments <br />
which were to be looked for, as those of judges <br />
in the Court of Appeals, of Speaker of the Legis- <br />
lative Council, of local governorships, as one of <br />
the causes of the unanimity which prevailed <br />
among the members of the Conference. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_4" title="bbox 124 2748 1602 5290">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The honorable member must have a very
mean <br />
opinion of human nature, to suppose that pub- <br />
lic men, having such great interests entrusted <br />
to them, and their own and their country’s <br />
honor to guard and to keep pure and unsullied <br />
in the eyes of the world, would agree to betray <br />
and deliver up their country for the love of a <br />
poor appointment, even if it were the post of <br />
lieutenant-governor or of chief justice. I am <br />
willing to believe that that insinuation was a <br />
slip of the tongue, and that he is already sorry <br />
that it ever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">escaped</span> from his
lips. Another <br />
point on which the honorable member for <br />
Hochelaga enlarged, is the militia question and <br />
the defence of the country. On this head, <br />
the honorable member declares that he cannot <br />
understand how the union of the provinces is <br />
to increase our strength. The experience of <br />
the honorable member for Hochelaga and the <br />
teachings of history ought, however, to have <br />
taught him that a disunited people, scattered <br />
over a vast extent of territory, must be an <br />
easier conquest than one which is united under <br />
a single strong and respected government. <br />
This brings me to speak of another observation <br />
made by the honorable member, who declared <br />
that our best policy, in order to avoid all diffi- <br />
culty with our neighbors, and escape the evils <br />
of a war, would be to remain quiet and sit <br />
with our arms across. The House will permit <br />
me to quote the very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressions</span>
of the honor- <br />
able member<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> on this subject :—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></span></p>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 2534 578 2669 598"> </div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 1664 665 3135 5292">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It would be a piece of folly for us to
raise a <br />
standing army, by way of keeping off an invasion <br />
of our frontier. Our best plan is to remain quiet, <br />
and to give no pretext to our neighbors for <br />
making war on us. Let a healthy state of public <br />
opinion be our shield ; let not the press violently <br />
assail the northern authorities ; then if war comes <br />
without any fault of ours, it will be our duty to do <br />
our best to assist the Mother<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
Country in the <br />
struggle which would ensue. <br />
</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I think, as the honorable member does,
that <br />
we ought not to give any just cause of dissatis- <br />
faction to our neighbors, and still less attack <br />
their frontier ; and the present Government <br />
have given proof, on all occasions, that they <br />
are disposed to respect the rights and opinions <br />
of the American people. But, on the other <br />
hand, the honorable member is the ﬁrst to <br />
inform us that the best means of defending <br />
ourselves is, not to be ready and accustomed <br />
to the use of arms, but to remain unarmed, <br />
with our arms across like men of peace—in <br />
plain terms, to give ourselves up, bound hand <br />
and foot. Now, I will ask him a plain ques- <br />
tion. If he were apprehensive of an attack <br />
from a neighbor of his, would he go to him <br />
and say, “ Here I am, do what you please with <br />
me,” or would he not rather be prepared to <br />
meet an attack ? I rather think that the <br />
honorable member would not be long in making<br />
up his mind as to which course he would<br />
take. Now, that which is wise and politic
in <br />
an individual is equally wise and politic in <br />
the case of a nation. We are not desirous of <br />
assuming a threatening attitude towards our <br />
neighbors. On the contrary, our wish is to <br />
live with them in peace and quietness. We <br />
are anxious not to do the least act which can <br />
be construed into a threat ; but we should be <br />
lamentably blind if, with the enormous mili- <br />
tary armament of our neighbors before our <br />
eyes, we looked at this formidable military <br />
display with our arms across, and a careless <br />
disregard of its greatness in our hearts. Such <br />
an attitude would neither be patriotic nor <br />
worthy of a nation of free men. The most <br />
certain way to avoid an attack and subjugation <br />
by our neighbors, to have our independence <br />
and our privileges respected, is to shew them <br />
that we are prepared to defend them at any <br />
cost. The honorable member for Hochelaga <br />
has declared that he is prepared to make some <br />
sacriﬁces to defend the country, but he has <br />
not told us how much he is ready to do in <br />
that behalf. Perhaps he will let us know at <br />
a future time, if we are called upon to spend <br />
money for the purpose. However that may <br />
be, I must animadvert on the remarks which <br />
he has made with regard to the volunteers. <br />
