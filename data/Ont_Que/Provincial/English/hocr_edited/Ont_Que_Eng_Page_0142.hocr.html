<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ments for the future, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lay aside all unneces-</span><br />
sary delicacy, and by our action to lay down <br />
the guarantees for the perpetuation of these <br />
kind feelings and this spirit of toleration so <br />
long existing, and which he devoutly hoped <br />
would never cease. No greater calamity could <br />
befall the English, or, in fact, both races, than <br />
the introduction of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religious</span>
discord among <br />
the people of Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) <br />
It would, however, be a grievous mistake to <br />
overlook the safeguards and rules <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span>
<br />
to perpetuate kindly feelings, and to prevent <br />
the disposition to aggressions which existed <br />
more or less in all minds. That principle—<br />
the love of power—was found in every human <br />
heart, none were exempt from it, and the <br />
history of the world showed that no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span>
<br />
had ever risen superior to it. The Honorable <br />
Premier had recognized this truth in the re- <br />
marks he had made in regard of the difficul- <br />
ties between Upper and Lower Canada. The <br />
French Canadians had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persistantly</span>
refused <br />
the demands of Upper Canada for represen- <br />
tation by population, because of the terror they <br />
felt that, if granted, their institutions would be <br />
in danger; and he had told the French mem- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bers in the house that under the new
Consti-</span><br />
tution their rights were so effectually guarded<br />
that their autonomy was fully secured<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—the</span>
<br />
safeguards thereof being put in their own <br />
hands. But, at the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time,</span>
the English, <br />
who were a fourth of the population, and who, <br />
by habit and tradition, had their own views of<br />
public policy, were left entirely without guar-<br />
antee other than the good feelings and tolerant<br />
spirit of the French. Was this safe? The <br />
only safeguard they were to have was in regard <br />
of education, but in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> of
the rights <br />
of property they were to be left to the <br />
Legislature. And this brought him to the <br />
consideration of that part of the proposed Con- <br />
stitution which had reference to civil rights <br />
and rights of roperty. It was said that the <br />
civil laws of war Canada were now consoli- <br />
dated into a code, and this would enhance our <br />
credit; and if based upon sound principles and <br />
rendered permanent, it would undoubtedly do <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so, </span>for what is so conducive to
the prosperity <br />
a country as well-protected rights of pro- <br />
perty and vested interests? This feature was <br />
engrained in the British mind, and in <br />
that of the United States also, insomuch that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the American</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution provides</span> that no law <br />
could be passed which would affect the rights of property. This was
exemplified in the cele- <br />
brated Dartmouth College case, in which WEB- <br />
STER so distinguished himself, when the endow- <br />
ment was maintained and perpetuated. But <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> to what power were the rights of com- <br />
mitted in these resolutions? When the Min- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ister</span> of Finance appealed to moneyed men <br />
abroad for a loan, could he say the Constitu- <br />
tion had provided guarantees against injurious <br />
changes, when it was known that the laws re- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lating</span> to property were left to
the caprice of <br />
the coal governments? Where was the <br />
security of the great religious societies of <br />
Montreal, if a sentiment hostile to monopolies <br />
were carried to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extremes</span> in the Local Parlia-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
HON. SIR. E. P. TACHÉ—The General <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> had power to disallow
such acts. <br />HON. MR. CURRIE—This would be an <br />
interference with local rights. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span> MR. ROSS—It would preserve
local <br />
rights. <br />
HON. MR. SANBORN—It was a wise <br />power and commended itself to all; it was, <br />however, not an ordinary power to be com-  <br />
manly resorted to, but an extreme power, and <br />
one almost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revolutionary.</span> It was
a power <br />
somewhat similar to that which existed in the <br />
second branch of the Legislature to stop the
<br />
supplies, but in its very nature not one often <br />
to be exercised; and it could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not be frequently</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exercised</span> without destroying the
very founda- <br />
tions of society, and occasioning evils of the <br />
greatest magnitude. On the whole he con- <br />
ceived that entrusting such power to the local <br />
governments was illogical and dangerous, and <br />
informing the world at the rights of property <br />
were not made sure. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It was urged</span> by some<br />
that, to make the measure now before the <br />
House answer the ends proposed, it must be <br />
immediately adopted, but he did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">partici-</span>
<br />pate in this opinion. He knew no reason for <br />
this haste, and could not believe that a few <br />
months would make any material difference. <br />
This union, when formed, was to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strengthen</span>
<br />
us so marvellously that we would be able to <br />
intimidate all the rest of the world, and guar- <br />
antee us a lasting peace with all mankind. It <br />
might increase facilities for communication, <br />
but could not increase our real strength. How <br />
the people of New Brunswick could be expect- <br />
ed to come up to Canada to defend us, and <br />
leave their own frontier unprotected, he could <br />
not comprehend. If he had misinterpreted <br />
the statements or explanations on this point, <br />
let the ministers show ow this greater <br />
was to be acquired. There would be three or <br />
four provinces more united together, but the <br />
frontier to be defended would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be increased</span>
in <br />
greater proportion than the additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">number</span>
<br />
of men acquired. It was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said by the</span>
advo- <br />
cates of the schemes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the naval power of</span><br />
