<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> force us to ratify their bargain. There
is <br />
only one man in Canada who could have done <br />
what the Attorney General for Lower Canada <br />
has done, and that man is himself. Thanks <br />
to his energy, to his intimate acquaintance <br />
with the stron<span style="background-color: white;">g and the weak points of his </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
fellow-countrymen, the Attorney General for </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Lower Canada has succeeded in attaining an </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
elevation which no one can dispute with him </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
—that of chief of the French Canadian na- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tionality. To attain this eminence, he has </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
crushed the weak, cajoled the strong, deceived </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the credulous, bought up the venal, and exalt- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ed the ambitious ; by turns he has called in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the accents of religion and stimulated the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
clamour of interest—he has gained his end. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
When Lower Canada heard of his alliance </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
with the President of the Council, there arose </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
from all quarters one universal cry of indig- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
nation. He </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">managed to convert the cry
of <br />
anger into a shout of admiration. When his <br />
scheme of Confederation became public, a <br />
feeling of uneasiness pervaded all minds ; <br />
that instinct forewarned them of the danger <br />
which impended. He has hushed that feel- <br />
ing to a sleep of profound security. I shall <br />
compare him to a man who has gained the <br />
unbounded conﬁdence of the public, who takes <br />
advantage of it to set up a Savings Bank, in <br />
which the rich man deposits his wealth, and <br />
the day laborer the small amount which he <br />
has squeezed out of his wages, against a day <br />
of need—both without a voucher. When that <br />
man has gathered all into his strong box, he <br />
ﬁnds an opportunity to purchase, at the cost <br />
of all he holds in trust, the article on which <br />
he has long set his ambitious eye ; and he buys <br />
it, unhesitatingly, without a thought of the <br />
wretches who are doomed to ruin by his con- <br />
duct. The deposit committed to the keeping <br />
of the Attorney General is the fortune of the <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">French-Canadians—their</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>nationality. That <br />
fortune had not been made in a day ; it was <br />
the accumulation of the toil and the savings <br />
of a whole people in a whole century. To <br />
prolong the ephemeral existence of his admin- <br />
istration for a few months, the Attorney Gen- <br />
eral has sacriﬁced, without a scruple, this <br />
precious trust, which the unbounded con- <br />
ﬁdence of his fellow-countrymen had conﬁded <br />
to his keeping. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> is why the honorable member is desirous
of <br />
extending the circle of his operations. But <br />
he will not long enjoy the fruits of his trea- <br />
son ; by crushing the power of the French- <br />
Canadians he has crushed his own, for upon <br />
them his existence depends. Does he believe <br />
in the sincerity of the friendship of the Liber- <br />
als of Upper Canada ? They fought with him <br />
for too long a time to allow of the existence <br />
of any sympathy between them and him, and <br />
now he has lost even their respect. They <br />
consented to ally themselves with him in <br />
order to obtain their object—representation <br />
by population ; but when they no longer <br />
stand in need of him, they will throw him <br />
aside like a worn-out tool. I look upon this <br />
threat of civil war as resembling a farce <br />
played by two comrades ; they shout out to <br />
us, "Take care, we are going to ﬁght; we <br />
shall do some mischief if you don’t hold us." <br />
Do not put yourselves out of the way to stop <br />
them ; you need not be alarmed, they will not <br />
ﬁght. It is also said to us, “See how many <br />
changes of Ministry there have been since <br />
1862 ; can such a state of affairs continue <br />
any longer ?” I am free to admit that all those <br />
changes must have been very unpleasant for <br />
the different ministers who have succumbed <br />
under them, but has the country suffered <br />
much by them ? The condition of the ﬁnances <br />
of a nation is the touchstone of its prosperity. <br />
In 1862, the Minister of Finance, before re- <br />
signing, declared a deﬁcit of ﬁve millions one <br />
hundred and ﬁfty-two thousand dollars (page <br />
20 of his speech) ; for the year ending the 30th <br />
June last, there was a surplus of seven hun- <br />
dred and ﬁfty thousand dollars. If all these <br />
changes of ministries had not taken place, it <br />
is impossible to say how large the deﬁcit <br />
would have become by this time, as for sever- <br />
al years previous to 1862 it had gone on <br />
steadily increasing. These two reasons ad- <br />
vanced by ministers are merely intended as <br />
a veil to conceal the true motive for this com- <br />
plete revolution in our Constitution ; <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
true motive is simply a desire on their parts <br />
to remain in power. Without wishing to <br />
enter into all the details of the measure pro-<br />
posed to the House, which have been so
ably <br />
handled by the honorable member for Hoche- <br />
laga, more especially those relating to the <br />
Legislative Council, there are some which I <br />
cannot pass over in silence. The following <br />
are the paragraphs of the resolutions of the <br />
Quebec <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>which regulate the organi- <br />
zation of the Lower House of the Federal <br />
Legislature, principally in respect of the num- <br />
ber of representatives :— <br />
