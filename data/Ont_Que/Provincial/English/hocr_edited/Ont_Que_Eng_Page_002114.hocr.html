in <br />
to the common schools. (Hear, hear.) <br />
The clause complained of is as follows:— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 6. Education; saving the rights and
privileges <br />
which the Protestant or Catholic minority in <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, I need hardly remind the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span><br />
I have always opposed and continue to oppose <br />
the system of sectarian education, so far as the <br />
public chest is concerned. I have never had <br />
any hesitation on that point. I have never <br />
been able to see why all the people of the <br />
province, to whatever sect they may belong, <br />
should not send their children to the same <br />
common schools to receive the ordinary <br />
branches of instruction. I regard the parent <br />
and the pastor as the best religious instruc- <br />
tors—and so long as the religious faith of the <br />
children is uninterfered with, and ample op- <br />
tunity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afforded</span> to the clergy to
give religious <br />
instruction to the children of their flocks, I <br />
cannot conceive any sound objection to mixed <br />
schools. But while in the Conference and <br />
elsewhere I have always maintained this view, <br />
and always given my vote against sectarian <br />
public schools, I am bound to admit, as I have <br />
always admitted, that the sectarian system, <br />
earned to the limited extent it has yet been in <br />
Upper Canada, and confined as it chiefly is to <br />
cities and towns, has not been a very great <br />
practical injury. The real cause of alarm was <br />
that the admission of the sectarian principle <br />
was there, and that at any moment it might <br />
be extended to such a degree as to split up <br />
our school system altogether. There are but <br />
a hundred separate schools in Upper Canada, <br />
out of some four thousand, and all Roman <br />
Catholic. But if the Roman Catholics are <br />
entitled to separate schools and to go on <br />
extending their operations, so are the members <br />
of the Church of England, the Presbyterians, <br />
the Methodists, and all other sects. No can- <br />
did Roman Catholic will deny this for a <br />
moment; and there lay the great danger to <br />
our educational fabric, that the separate <br />
system might gradually extend itself until the <br />
whole country was studded with nurseries <br />
of sectarianism, most hurtful to the best <br />
interests of the province, and entailing an <br />
enormous expense to sustain the hosts of <br />
teachers that so prodigal a system of public <br />
instruction must inevitably entail. Now <br />
it is known to every honorable member of <br />
this House that an Act was passed in 1863, <br />
as a final settlement of this sectarian contro- <br />
versy. I was not in Quebec at the time, but <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> if I had been here I would have voted
against <br />
that bill, because it extended the facilities for <br />
establishing separate schools. It had, how- <br />
ever, this good feature, that it was accepted <br />
by the Roman Catholic authorities, and car- <br />
ried through Parliament as a final compromise <br />
of the question in Upper Canada. When, <br />
therefore, it was proposed that a provision <br />
should be inserted in the Confederation scheme <br />
to bind that compact of 1863 and declare it a <br />
final settlement, so that we should not be com- <br />
pelled, as we have been since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1849,</span>
to stand <br />
constantly to our arms, awaiting fresh attacks <br />
upon our common school system, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propo-</span>
<br />
sition seemed to me one that was not rashly <br />
to be rejected. (Hear, hear.) I admit that, <br />
from my point of view, this is a blot on the <br />
scheme before the House, it is, confessedly, one <br />
of the concessions from our side that had to be <br />
made to secure this great measure of reform. <br />
But assuredly, I, for one, have not the slightest <br />
hesitation in accepting it as a necessary condi- <br />
tion of the scheme of union, and doubly accept- <br />
able must it be in the eyes of honorable gentle- <br />
men opposite, who were the authors of the bill <br />
of 1863. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span> But it was
urged that <br />
though this arrangement might perhaps be fair <br />
as regards Upper Canada, it was not so as re- <br />
gards Lower Canada, for there were matters of <br />
which the British population have long com- <br />plained, and some amendments to the existing <br />School Act were required to secure them equal <br />
justice. Well, when this point was raised, <br />
gentlemen of all parties in Lower Canada at <br />
once expressed themselves prepared to treat it <br />
in a frank and conciliatory manner, with a <br />
view to removing any injustice that might be <br />
shown to exist; and on this understanding the <br />
educational clause was adopted by the Con- <br />
ference. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. T. C. WALLBRIDGE—That de- <br />
stroys the power of the local legislatures to <br />
legislate upon the subject. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
BROWN—I would like to know <br />
how much “power” the honorable gentleman has <br />
now to legislate upon it? Let him introduce <br />
a bill to-day to annul the compact of 1863 and <br />
repeal all the œctarian school acts of Upper <br />
Canada, and how many votes would he st for <br />
it? Would twenty members vote for it out <br />
of the one hundred and thirty who com <br />
this House? If the honorable gentleman had <br />
been struggling for fifteen years, as I have <br />
been, to save the school system of Upper Can- <br />
ada from further extension of the sectarian <br />
element, he would have found precious little <br />
diminution of power over it in this very mod- <br />
erate compromise. And what says the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon-</span>
