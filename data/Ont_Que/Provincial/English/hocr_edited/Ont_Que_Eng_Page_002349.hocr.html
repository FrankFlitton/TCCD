<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> cede to the Lower Provinces. (Hear,
hear.) <br />
Another of the delegates to the Quebec Con- <br />
ference, Hon. Mr. WHELAN, of Prince Edward <br />
Island, enumerates all the advantages that <br />
will be secured to that province by Confeder- <br />
ation, and winds up by saying, that that little <br />
island will have $40,000 a year more than <br />
necessary to carry on its local affairs. (Hear.) <br />
Taking all these circumstances into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider-</span>
<br />
ation, I do think the Government ought to have <br />
given more time to deliberate upon and perfect <br />
this measure; and, at any rate, to leave it <br />
over till another session of Parliament before <br />
demanding a ﬁnal decision upon the question. <br />
Failing to do that, and failing to consent <br />
to any alteration in any one of the reso- <br />
lutions, however objectionable, I think it <br />
it is our duty to refer it to the people <br />
for their decision upon it. I know I will <br />
be met with the objection that this is con- <br />
trary to British practice—that a reference <br />
to the people in the manner I propose is <br />
unknown to the British Constitution. We <br />
may say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> same thing in regard
to every <br />
branch of legislation and public business in <br />
this country, that it differs in some respects <br />
from the mode of conducting it which pre- <br />
vails in England; but we must remember <br />
that we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differently</span> situated
in this coun- <br />
try from the people of England, and that our <br />
feelings and habits of thought upon public <br />
affairs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are altogether different. And
since we <br />
have adopted the principle in the conduct of <br />
our municipal affairs, to refer all matters in- <br />
volving the expenditure of money for special <br />
purposes to the people, it will do no possible <br />
harm to apply it to this measure; and if the <br />
peeple adopt it, and it should afterwards prove <br />
that they had entered into a bad bargain, <br />
they would have no one to blame but them- <br />
selves, and I have no doubt would, under <br />
such circumstances, bear it more patiently. <br />
But if we take the opposite course, if we <br />
close this arrangement on terms disadvan- <br />
tageous to us, it will be many years before a <br />
change can be effected. Would Prince Ed- <br />
ward Island, at the demand of Canada, give <br />
up the lien, the constitutional right she will <br />
have obtained under this scheme, to the <br />
money she receives over and above what is <br />
necessary to meet her local requirements? <br />
Not at all. Would Newfoundland give up <br />
her bonus of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$160,000</span> a year for
all time, <br />
should the looked for coal not be found to <br />
pay? Not a bit of it. Would Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia</span>
<br />
give up her right to impose an export duty <br />
on coals and other minerals, because Canada <br />
found that this right gave her undue advan-<br />

wick surrender her right to levy an export <br />
duty on timber, or, at the call of Canada, <br />
give any extra assistance towards the construc- <br />
tion of the Intereolonial Railway, which will <br />
beneﬁt her far more largely than any of the <br />
other provinces, inasmuch as it will open up <br />
a large tract of country within her borders, <br />
and render the land and timber it contains <br />
far more valuable? Undoubtedly she would <br />
not; we would have to abide by our agree— <br />
ment, no matter how invidious might be the <br />
advantages it conferred, no matter how  un- <br />
favorably it might affect western interests. <br />
(Hear, hear.) The complaint that has been <br />
made against the working of the present union <br />
is that in Lower Canada the people do not <br />
pay as much in taxes to the general rev- <br />
enue, man for man, as the people of Upper <br />
Canada. It was contended, I believe, by <br />
the present Attorney General East, at a <br />
speech delivered some years since to his con- <br />
stituents at Verchères, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure</span>
<br />
for the redemption of seigniorial rights did not <br />
affect Lower Canada very much, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span>
<br />
Upper Canada paid two-thirds of the revenue <br />
of the country; and all the advocates of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">western</span> section, who have urged
its rights <br />
before the people, have taken the ground that <br />
it contributed in that proportion to the public <br />
exchequer. Now, if there be any truth in <br />
this statement, it must follow that under this <br />
arrangement Canada, at all events, will have <br />
to pay more, man for man, than the eastern <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> to the general revenue,
because it <br />
cannot be contended, I apprehend, that Prince <br />
Edward Island, Newfoundland, or either of <br />
the other Maritime Provinces, however pros- <br />
perous their condition may be, have a popula— <br />
tion as wealthy as that of Upper Canada. or <br />
one that will contribute as much in taxes to <br />
the General Government. If then, during the <br />
past, Lower Canada has paid less than Upper <br />
Canada to the revenue, while enjoying the <br />
benefit of as large or perhaps a. larger expen-<br />
diture than that section, what is proposed to <br />
be done now? Why, to remove that diffi- <br />
culty which led almost to a dead-lock in our <br />
legislation, to get rid of the embarrassments <br />
that have beset the Government of this coun- <br />
try for many years past, we are asked to adopt <br />
a scheme that will perpetuate them on a larger <br />
scale than before, and involve, in the con-<br />
struction of the Intercolonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ra</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ilway</span> alone, <br />
the expenditure of a million or a million and <br />
a half annually for ever. (Hear, hear.)
How<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
absurd then to urge on this scheme without at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
