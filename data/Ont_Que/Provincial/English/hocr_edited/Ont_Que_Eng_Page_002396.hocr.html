<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> regard to their own. On the other hand, <br />
Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> the disallowance of
a measure <br />
sanctioned by the local governments is limited <br />
as to time, and must be declared within twelve <br />
months, whereas, under the present system, <br />
it can be done within two years. This is a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restriction</span> which has been
granted in favor of <br />
Lower Canada and of all the other provinces <br />
of the Confederation ; it is a restriction fa- <br />
vorable to the people, but the honorable mem- <br />
ber will refuse, no doubt, to acknowledge that <br />
this concession to the people is our work. <br />
Moreover, why should we be afraid of this <br />
veto? In our Local Legislature we assuredly <br />
have no intention to be unjust towards a por- <br />
tion of the population, but propose to act <br />
towards them, as in times past, as towards <br />
equals ; we intend, in short, to be as just to <br />
that part of the population as we were when <br />
they were a feeble element in it. This has <br />
not prevented the honorable member for Ho- <br />
chelaga from telling the English members <br />
from Lower Canada that they must be on <br />
their guard and take care of themselves. <br />
Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I shall not offer such an <br />
insult to the race to which I belong. The <br />
French-Canadians have always acted honor- <br />
ably towards the other races who live among <br />
them, and they will certainly not take advan- <br />
tage now, any more than they have done in <br />
times past, of the majority they may have in <br />
the Local Legislature to molest or persecute the <br />
minority. This is the reason why we have <br />
no fear nor misgiving relative to the right of <br />
veto. Moreover, we are not to suppose that <br />
the intention of the two clauses which I have <br />
already quoted, is that every bill passed in the <br />
local legislatures will be reserved for the sanc- <br />
tion of the Central Government. That re- <br />
servation will take place only in respect of <br />
such measures as are now reserved for Her <br />
Majesty’s sanction. So that the honorable <br />
member for Hochelaga is widely mistaken <br />
when he reproaches the present Government for <br />
having agreed to those two clauses. Another <br />
question on which the hon. member has also <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">called us to</span> account, relates to
the export <br />
duties on timber and coals. In clause 29, <br />
which relates to the powers of the Federal <br />
Parliament, the third section reads as follows : <br />
</p>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_4" title="bbox 134 4657 1603 4995">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The imposition or regulation of duties of
cus- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">toms</span> on imports or exports,
except on exports <br />
of timber, logs, masts, spars, deals, and sawn <br />
lumber from New Brunswick, and of coal and <br />
other minerals from Nova Scotia. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 139 5034 1603 5115">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The fact that this power has been
conferred<br />
on the Government does not imply that it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> be exercised.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> The power was granted<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> simply because it might be
necessary in certain <br />
cases mentioned. Now this is the reason for <br />
the second part of the clause which I have <br />just read to the House, and which I cannot <br />better explain than by citing some expressions <br />
of a speech by the Hon. the Minister of <br />
Finance on the subject. Nevertheless, as there <br />
are several honorable members in the House <br />
who do not understand English, I think it <br />
will perhaps be better to explain them in <br />
French. Here then was the thought of the <br />
Convention : as in New Brunswick the Gov- <br />
ernment had found that it was a great disad- <br />
vantage to collect the duties on timber ac- <br />
cording to the system formerly adopted, and <br />
they had substituted an export duty which <br />
superseded all other dues on that product, <br />
it was no more than right that this source of <br />
revenue should remain in New Brunswick, to <br />
which province it was an object of absolute <br />
necessity to defray its local expenses. In <br />
Canada we retain, under the new Constitution, <br />
our own method of collecting similar duties. <br />
As to New Brunswick, the duty on the article <br />
in question is their principal revenue, as coal <br />
is almost the sole revenue of Nova Scotia ; <br />
and if they had been deprived of them, they <br />
would have peremptorily refused to join the <br />
Confederation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.)
Their demand <br />
was perfectly just, and could not therefore be <br />
refused. Moreover, we have no right to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com-</span>
<br />
plain, for they leave us all our mines and our <br />
lands, and we shall now, as heretofore, collect <br />
the proceeds for our own use and proﬁt. The <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga says that it <br />
will be impossible to administer the affairs of <br />
the local legislatures without having recourse <br />
to direct taxation ; but a man of his expe- <br />
rience ought not to have made that assertion. <br />
Instead of attempting to trade on popular <br />
prejudice, he ought to have admitted at once <br />
that the right granted by the new Constitution <br />
of levying direct taxes, is the same that <br />
already exists in the present Constitution ; <br />
it is the same right that all our municipalities <br />possess. It does not follow that the right will<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span>
exercised. But the honorable member <br />
knows well that the people are not in favor <br />
of direct taxation, and that they would be <br />
unwilling to adopt it as a system, in place of <br />
indirect taxes ; hence his attempt to use it as <br />
a bug-bear in order to alarm the people of <br />
Lower Canada. We must bear in mind that <br />
the proceeds of the local revenue of Lower <br />
Canada will be employed in
defrayiug local <br />
expenses. The Hon. Minister of Finance has <br />
stated that in Lower Canada the local revenue <br />
will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$557,000,</span> besides the 80
cents per <br />
