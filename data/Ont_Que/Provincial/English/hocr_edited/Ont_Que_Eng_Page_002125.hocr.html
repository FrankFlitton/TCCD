<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> brought us our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goods</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span>
our European <br />
goods—and taken our produce not only to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Europe</span> but even to the Lower
Provinces; and <br />
I say one of the best features of this union <br />
is, that if in our commercial relations with <br />
the United States we are compelled by them <br />
to meet ﬁre with ﬁre—it will enable us to stop <br />
this improvidence and turn the current of our <br />
own trade into our own waters. Far be it from <br />
me to say I am an advocate of a coercive com- <br />
mercial policy—on the contrary, entire freedom <br />
of trade, in my opinion, is what we in this <br />
country should strive for. Without hesitation, <br />
I would, to-morrow, throw open the whole of <br />
our trade and the whole of our waters to the <br />
United States, if they did the same to us. <br />
But, if they tell us, in the face of all the ad- <br />
vantages they get by Reciprocity, that they are <br />
determined to put a stop to it, and if this is <br />
done through a hostile feeling to us—deeply <br />
as I should regret that this should be the ﬁrst <br />
use made by the Northern States of their new- <br />
found liberty—then, I say, we have a policy, <br />
and a good policy of our own, to fall back <br />
upon. And let me say a word as to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span>
<br />
of the repeal of Reciprocity on the Ameri- <br />
can ﬁshing interest. The Americans, in 1851, <br />
had engaged in the cod and mackerel ﬁshing, <br />
in our waters, shipping to the extent of 129,- <br />
014 tons—but under the inﬂuence of the <br />
Reciprocity Treaty it rose, in 1861, to 192,- <br />
662—an increase, in ten years, of upwards of <br />
63,000 tons, or ﬁfty per cent. (Hear, hear.) <br />
The repeal of Reciprocity will give us back <br />
all this increase, and more, for it will be a <br />
very different thing in the future from what it <br />
was formerly, to poach on our ﬁshing grounds, <br />
when these provinces are united and determined <br />
to protect the ﬁsheries of the Gulf. This <br />
ﬁshing interest is one which may be cul- <br />
tivated to an extent difficult, perhaps, for many <br />
of us to conceive. But we have only to <br />
look at the amount of ﬁsh taken from our <br />
waters by the Americans and other nations, <br />
and the advantages we possess, to perceive <br />
that, if we apply ourselves, as a united people, <br />
to foster that trade, we can vastly increase the <br />
great traffic we now enjoy. (Hear, hear.) On <br />
the whole, then, sir, I come ﬁrmly to the con- <br />
clusion that, in view of the possible stoppage <br />
of the American Reciprocity Treaty, and our <br />
being compelled to ﬁnd new channels for our <br />
trade, this union presents to us advan- <br />
tages, in comparison with which any objection <br />
that has been offered, or can be offered to it, is <br />
utterly insignificant. (Hear, hear.) But, <br />
sixthly, Mr. SPEAKER, I am in favor of the <br />
union of the provinces, because, in the event <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of war, it will enable all the colonies
to defend <br />
themselves better, and give more efficient aid <br />
to the Empire, than they could do separately. <br />
I am not one of those who ever had the war- <br />
fever; I have not believed in getting up large <br />
armaments in this country; I have never <br />
doubted that a military spirit, to a certain ex- <br />
tent, did necessarily form part of the character <br />
of a great people ; but I felt that Canada had <br />
not yet reached that stage in her progress <br />
when she could safely assume the duty of de- <br />
fence; and that, so long as peace continued <br />
and the Mother Country threw her shield <br />
around us, it was well for us to cultivate our <br />
ﬁelds and grow in numbers and material <br />
strength, until we could look our enemies <br />
fearlessly in the face. But it must be admit- <br />
ted—and there is no use of closing our eyes <br />
to the fact—that this question of defence has <br />
been placed, within the last two years, in a <br />
totally different position from what it ever oc- <br />
cupied before. The time has come—it matters <br />
not what political party may be in power in <br />
England—when Britain will insist on a re- <br />
consideration of the military relations which a <br />
great colony, such as Canada, ought to hold <br />
to the Empire. And I am free to admit that <br />
it is a fair and just demand. We may doubt <br />
whether some of the demands that have been <br />
made upon us, without regard to our peculiar <br />
position at the moment, and without any at- <br />
tempt to discuss the question with us in all its <br />
breadth, were either just or well-considered. <br />
But of this I think there can be no doubt, that <br />
when the time comes in the history of any <br />
colony that it has overcome the burdens and <br />
embarrassments of early settlement, and has <br />
entered on a career of permanent progress and <br />
prosperity, it is only fair and right that it <br />
should contribute its quota to the defence of <br />
the Empire. What that quota ought to be, I <br />
think, is a matter for grave deliberation and <br />
discussion, as well as the measure of assistance <br />
the colony may look for, in time of war, from <br />
the parent state—and, assuredly, it is in this <br />
spirit that the present Imperial Government <br />
is desirous of approaching the question. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I am persuaded that nothing <br />
more than that which is fairly due at our <br />
hands will be demanded from us, and and<br />
less than this, I am sure, the people is of
Canada <br />
do not desire. (Hear, hear.) In the con- <br />
versations I had, while in England, with pub— <br />
lic men of different litics—while I found <br />
many who considered that the connection <br />
between Canada and England involved the <br />
Mother Country in some danger of war with <br />
the powerful state upon our borders, and that <br />
