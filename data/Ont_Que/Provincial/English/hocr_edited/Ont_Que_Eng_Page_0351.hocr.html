<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and yet, on the eve of accomplishment,
those<br />
who have advocated it have not effected <br />
a change of the nature that was desired, <br />
but have jumped into a new and totally <br />
different scheme, that really seems to me <br />
to have been brought about for the sole <br />
purpose of advancing their own personal aims, <br />
rather than satisfying any demand on the <br />
part of the people. (Hear, hear.) The hon- <br />
orable and gallant Knight at the head of the <br />
Government stated that we were on an in- <br />
clined plane, and in danger of sliding into the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">republicanism</span> of the United
States. This <br />
phrase has been referred to so often by honor- <br />
able members who have spoken, and so many <br />
deductions have been drawn from it, that I <br />
may perhaps be permitted to say a few words <br />
upon it. I think all must see that the ten- <br />
dency of the scheme now before the House <br />
will be in a few years to impose direct taxation <br />
upon the people for the support of the local <br />
governments. Let us then have direct taxa- <br />
tion, and what will be the result? If there is <br />
a large expenditure on the part of the Gen- <br />
eral Government, in addition to this taxation, <br />
political agitators will arise, who will cry out <br />
that the public burdens are unequally borne <br />
—(hear)—that two-thirds of the revenue is <br />
borne by the people living west of Quebec— <br />
that is, the population west of this city <br />
will, man for man, pay twice as much to <br />
the public exchequer as the population east <br />
of it. There will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undoubtedly</span> be
the same <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tendency,</span> under such a state of
things, as has <br />
been charged to exist on the part of the Lower <br />
Canadian representatives since the union was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed—namely,</span> a tendency on the
part of <br />
those who pay the smaller portion of the re- <br />
venue to spend the public money freely and <br />
extravagantly. They will naturally say when <br />
any appropriation is proposed for their own <br />
section—“ We will go for this expenditure, <br />
for it will benefit us; and we will support a <br />
corresponding expenditure in the other sec- <br />
tion, because we have not so much to pay of <br />
it as the people of that section--we will have <br />
only ﬁfty cents to pay of it, while they will <br />
have to pay a dollar.” This argument will <br />
be used in support of all extravagant and <br />
wasteful expenditures, and you may depend <br />
upon it that they will soon be incurred. Then <br />
you will have political agitators who will con- <br />
stantly keep these things <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span>
the people, <br />
who will demand a dissolution of the union of <br />
the provinces as a remedy for the evil. Then <br />
a further difficulty will be found in the fact <br />
that breadstuffs, the American market for <br />

cannot be <br />
transported <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />to the Lower from the
Upper <br />
Provinces without being protected by a
heavy <br />
import duty. Will the representatives from <br />
the Lower Provinces allow that import duty <br />
to be imposed? No, undoubtedly they will not. <br />
Attempt to carry it in the interest of Upper <br />
Canada and you will at once transform the <br />
whole of them into advocates for the repeal <br />
of the union. Thus you create cause <br />
for agitation in all the sections, and it <br />
will not long continue until you will again <br />
see another dead-lock. You <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span>
again have <br />
three administrations formed and three gen- <br />
eral elections occurring within two years, and <br />
again you will have suﬂicient excuse for <br />
another change in the Constitution. And you <br />
may rely upon it, that before such an agita- <br />
tion goes on ﬁve years it will be made an ex- <br />
cuse for sliding further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down</span>
the inclined <br />
plane than would have been afforded if we had <br />
remained as we were. (Hear, hear. I can- <br />
not help coming to the conclusion, honorable <br />
gentlemen, that these resolutions contain the <br />
seeds of our destruction as colonies. There <br />
can be no political advantage in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span>
<br />
union, unless we assume the rights and respon- <br />
sibilities of an independent country. We are <br />
not yet prepared for that step. Our popula- <br />
tion is not numerous enough; we are too young <br />
and too weak to assume these rights and res- <br />
ponsibilities. We have no commercial advan- <br />
tages to gain by the union. Why then force <br />
it upon us? Let it remain for more mature <br />
consideration, and the evils you have will be <br />
borne the more quietly; but if you force it <br />
upon the people prematurely, and the evils I <br />
fear spring from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> it, depend upon
it that the <br />
public men who press it forward will be as <br />
seriously condemned as they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now</span>
highly <br />
lauded. The fact is, the people of the country <br />
do not understand this scheme. How can it be <br />
expected that they should understand it in all its <br />
bearings? Why, the honorable member from <br />
the Rideau Division said he heard the expla- <br />
nations of it and was here a couple of weeks <br />
before he understood it, and that he had sent <br />
2000 circulars to his constituents that they <br />
might have a knowledge of it. How can he <br />
expect them to understand it from these print- <br />
ed documents, when he himself, with the ad- <br />
vantage of hearing all the explanations upon <br />
it, was two weeks in gaining an understand- <br />
ing of it? Honorable gentlemen, I am in the <br />
abstract in favor of the union of these colon- <br />
ice—(hear, hear)—but I do not wish to force <br />
on this scheme in a way that is unfair and un- <br />
