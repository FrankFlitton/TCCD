that the anticipations of my honorable <br />
friend from Niagara will never be realized. I <br />
venture to say, in the face of all his evil fore- <br />
bodings of increased burdens and debt, that we <br />
shall find our position greatly improved. He <br />
appeared in the delivery of his able and power- <br />
ful speech, very desirous to make out the <br />
strongest possible case, raking up even the <br />
public condemnation of the Provincial Secre- <br />
tary at the famous Harrington meeting. I was <br />
one of those who voted against Mr. SCOTT’S <br />
Separate School Bill, valuing, in common with <br />
the earnest electors at Harrington, our noble <br />
school system of Upper Canada, which carries <br />
the blessings of education throughout the <br />
width and breadth of the land; but the peo- <br />
ple generally are not prepared to reject the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">proposed Confederation, because of the po-<br />
sition of that question, although there are in- <br />
dividual electors who have strong convictions <br />
on the subject. My honorable friend also <br />
dwells upon the amount which will require to be <br />
appropriated for the militia. He appears to <br />
think that soldiers can be formed by magical <br />
inﬂuence in a day, and to effect a small saving <br />
he would elect to leave this magnificent ter- <br />
ritory, with its valuable homesteads, exposed <br />
to be swept at any moment by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ruthless</span>
ag- <br />
gressor; or should not mind that our Canadian <br />
people should run the risk of being subjected <br />
to share the liability of three thousand mil- <br />
lions of debt, inaddition to their own burdens. <br />
The great body of the people of Upper Can- <br />
ada have great faith in the expansion and <br />
growth of a young country such as this. (Hear, <br />
hear.) They do not forget the remarkable <br />
fact, that after experiencing a large deficiency <br />
in the revenue of the country for several years, <br />
with also, in addition, two very indifferent <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">harvests,</span> we are in a position to
announce a <br />
considerable surplus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of revenue</span>
at this mo- <br />
ment; and we look forward to this consolida- <br />
tion of other great interests, full of hope, that <br />
it will give us a higher standing in the world <br />
—that it will give a great impetus to the <br />
growth of our population, our commerce and <br />
our revenue; and if the expenditure to be <br />
made on those great public improvements <br />
should swell the debt, we shall find ourselves <br />
in a condition of such prosperity that it will <br />
fall lightly upon us. There are so many con-<br />
spiring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances</span> to make us
regard this <br />
great scheme with favor, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offspring,</span>
as it <br />
is presented to us, of the large experience and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matured</span> judgment of the political
leaders of <br />
all these provinces. (Hear, hear.) We may <br />
venture to accept it and give it a fair trial as <br />
the best solution of the difficulties we have ex-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> perienced in working out our present
Legisla- <br />
tive Union. It is very true that we have all <br />
opposed until now the construction of the In- <br />
tercolonial Railway, because we have had grave <br />
doubts as to the commercial value of that <br />
work, and the prospect of its being self-sus- <br />
taining; but it certainly cannot be denied <br />
that the unfriendly attitude assumed towards <br />
us by the neighboring republic in respect to <br />
the trade relations between the two countries, <br />
makes it more prudential for us thus to <br />
secure a winter road to the great highway <br />
of the world’s commerce—(hear, hear)—and <br />
it will certainly place us in a stronger po- <br />
sition to negotiate fair and just terms in <br />
a renewal or modification of the Reciprocity <br />
Treaty. Whilst that public work is accepted <br />
as an indispensable part of the scheme, we are <br />
glad to be assured by the members of the Gov- <br />
ernment, that the deepening and widening of <br />
the St. Lawrence canals will be carried out <br />
simultaneously. Good cannot fail to ﬂow from <br />
the union if justice is thus done to all its com- <br />
ponent parts. As regards the question of <br />
finance, the proposition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
assume the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debts</span> <br />
upon a certain basis on the one hand, and to im- <br />
pose a uniform tariff on the other, with certain <br />
reasonable stipulations, is perhaps the nearest <br />
approximation to dealing out common justice <br />
to all, which could he arrived at, with so many <br />
varied interests there represented. We know <br />
that our own delegates contended, as we now<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
contend, that it would on] have been fair and <br />
just that the future subsidy to be paid to each </span><br />
province of eighty cents per head should
be <br />
ased upon the census returns to be made <br />
every ten years. But this is not the moment <br />
to enlarge upon this point, or upon these de- <br />
tails, to which, as I have before stated, the <br />
great bed of my constituents take exception, <br />
and I will reserve myself, therefore, until we <br />
discuss the details seriatim. I would only, in <br />
conclusion, observe, that our most enlightened <br />
citizens see nothing but weakness and insecur- <br />
ity in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> fragmentary
position, while <br />
they regard the proposed union as calculated <br />
in every way to give us importance, standing <br />
and strength—improve our credit—inspire a <br />
feeling of confidence in our future, and bring <br />
emigration to our shores. If we can look back <br />
with just pride to our giant growth during the <br />
last quarter of a century, so may we enter <br />
upon the extended relations now proposed <br />
full of hope, that with an accession of terri- <br />
tory, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">populaltion</span> and
power—commencing our <br />
career with a volume of trade exceeding <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$137,000,000,</span> with such boundless
resources <br />
to develop, and a country capable of sus- <br />
