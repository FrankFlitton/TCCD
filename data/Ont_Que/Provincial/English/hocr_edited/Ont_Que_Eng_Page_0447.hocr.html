<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the honorable member for Lotbinière, but <br />
that honorable gentleman gave as a reason for <br />
its apparent success, that Switzerland was <br />
surrounded by a number of powerful nations. <br />
I think, on the other hand, that the reason <br />
assigned would be the very cause of a failure <br />
of the system in Switzerland. The govern- <br />
ment of that country would have broken down <br />
long ago if there was any inherent weakness <br />
in the form of the constitution, in consequence <br />
of the hostile systems which surrounded it. <br />
The fact of the Swiss maintaining their inde- <br />
pendence s<span style="background-color: white;">o long and conducting the adminis- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tration of their </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span><span style="background-color: white;"> s</span>o well
and cheaply, is <br />
an evidence to my mind that the Federal sys- <br />
tem of government is not weak where the <br />
people are trained and educated to under- <br />
stand and appreciate the beneﬁts of self-gov- <br />
ernment. (Hear, hear.) Then, sir, we are <br />
assured that all sorts of calamities will over- <br />
take us if we change our Constitution, and <br />
many of the honorable gentlemen who pro- <br />
phecy these evil results will no doubt, like <br />
many other prophets, do all they can to bring <br />
their predictions to pass. (Hear, hear.) This <br />
is not the ﬁrst time in the history of the <br />
world that prophecies of this kind have been <br />
indulged in. I was a good deal amused the <br />
other night in reading the discussions which <br />
took place in the Scottish Parliament on the <br />
occasion of the proposed union with England <br />
in 1707 ; and in perusing one of the speeches <br />
in particular, I could not help remarking the <br />
coincidence betwen the tone therein assumed <br />
and that adopted by Her Majesty's loyal Can- <br />
adian Opposition. The speaker, Lord BEL- <br />
HAVEN, used this language in depicting the <br /><span style="background-color: white;">

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> And here, Mr. SPEAKER, comes the climax, <br />
and if I were asked to point to one of <br />
the dramatis personæ in our Canadian House <br />
of Assembly ﬁtted to take part in a similar <br />
scene as is here depicted, I should unhesitat- <br />
ingly turn to the honorable member for Cha- <br />
teauguay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON), who could <br />
more suitably than any one else I know per- <br />
sonate Lord BELHAVEN when he exclaims : <br />
“But above all, my Lord, I think I see our <br />
ancient mother Caledonia, lik<span style="background-color: white;">e </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">CAESAR,</span><span style="background-color: white;">

ruefully </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
looking round about her, covering h</span>erself <br />
with her royal garment, attending to the fatal <br />
blow and breathing out her last with et tu <br />
quoque mi ﬁli.” (Laughter.) It must have <br />
seemed very strange for the statesmen of <br />
Scotland, who saw in the union of the two <br />
kingdoms all the evidences of coming power <br />
and grandeur, to have heard expressed such <br />
desponding sentiments as these. (Hear, <br />
hear.) No doubt the majority saw in the <br />
union which they were then about to consum- <br />
mate, the strength which subsequently grew <br />
out of that union, and the inﬂuence and <br />
greatness by which it would be attended. <br />
At the time of the union Scotland had only a <br />
revenue of £150,000 per annum, and last <br />
year she contributed to the British cxchequer <br />
nearly £7,000,000. (Hear, hear.) This, <br />
however, is but one instance of the benefit of <br />
the union, which has worked to the fullest <br />
extent as well as could possibly be desired. <br />
If necessary I could bring forward many ar- <br />
guments to prove that, in the same manner, <br />
union between different peoples who are geo- <br />
graphically situated so as to favor it, adds to <br />
their strength, and makes them greater and <br />
more powerful than they could possibly hope <br />
to become in their several states <span style="background-color: white;">of </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">separation</span><span style="background-color: white;">
