            </p>

    

    
   
            <p>
     I do not fear, sir, but that the treaty will be 
     <lb/>
     renewed; enlightened counsels will prevail, 
     <lb/>
     and, with the better feeling existing between 
     <lb/>
     the two countries, the subject will be taken 
     <lb/>
     up in a proper spirit, and legislated upon 
     <lb/>
     accordingly. (Hear.) The construction of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway is said to be a 
     <lb/>
     necessity of the proposed union, and without 
     <lb/>
     it there can be no union except in name. 
     <lb/>
     Calculations have been made which show 
     <lb/>
      that this road cannot be used for carrying 
     <lb/>
      heavy merchandise at remunerative rates, 
     <lb/>
     more especially flour, which it has been 
     <lb/>
     shown would cost $2.25 per barrel from 
     <lb/>
     Toronto to Halifax, at two cents per ton per 
     <lb/>
     mile. The Grand Trunk Railway now car<lb break="no"/>ries flour from Toronto to Montreal for 25 
     <lb/>
     cents per barrel during winter, and at the 
     <lb/>
     same rate a barrel of flour would cost $1.22. 
     <lb/>
     If this could be done, the difference in cost 
     <lb/>
     between winter rates and shipping via the St. 
     <lb/>
      Lawrence in summer, at 85 cents per barrel, 
     <lb/>
     would be made up in a saving of storage, 
     <lb/>
     interest, and insurance. Then there is the 
     <lb/>
     military aspect of the subject, which has 
     <lb/>
     already been thoroughly discussed. I con<lb break="no"/>tend, sir, that union with the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces not only allies us more closely to 
     <lb/>
     them and to each other, but also to that 
     <lb/>
     power which alone could render us aid 
     <lb/>
    whenever subjected to attack ; and, regarded  
     <lb/>from this point of view, this railroad is said 
     <lb/>to be a necessity. Lord DURHAM in his 
     <lb/>report said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     An union for common defence against foreign 
     <lb/>
     enemies is the national bond of connection that 
     <lb/>
     holds together the great communities of the 
     <lb/>
     world, and between no parts of any kingdom or 
     <lb/>
     state did the necessity exist of such a union 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     more obviously than between the whole of these 
     <lb/>
     colonies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     (Hear,hear.) In conclusion; sir, if we reject 
     <lb/>
     the proposed union, what is offered as a 
     <lb/>
     substitute? In the absence of anything 
     <lb/>
     better which will settle our existing diffi<lb break="no"/>culties, shall we reject the opportunity now 
     <lb/>
     presented and that may never recur? Rather 
     <lb/>
     let us, as members of the same family, unite 
     <lb/>
     for weal or for woe. By it we secure enlarged 
     <lb/>
     commercial intercourse, greater security in 
     <lb/>
     case of attack, a remedy for the existing dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties between Upper and Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and also render more lasting the connection 
     <lb/>
     now existing with the Mother Country. 
     <lb/>
    (Hear.) While in favor of this measure, 
     <lb/>but believing that it should be submitted for 
     <lb/>the approval of those who are to be affected 
     <lb/>by the contemplated change, I shall feel it 
     <lb/>to be my duty in the first instance to vote 
     <lb/>against the "previous question," in order 
     <lb/>that such an amendment may be put, reserv<lb break="no"/>ing the right to vote for the amendment of 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Peel, when that shall 
     <lb/>come up for discussion, its object being to 
     <lb/>submit the question for popular sanction. 
     <lb/>(Cheers.) If this, however, shall fail, I 
     <lb/>shall vote, Mr. SPEAKER, for the resolution 
     <lb/>now in your hands.

            <p><persName ref="pers:JONE2">MR. D. FORD JONES</persName> resumed the

     <lb/>SPEAKER, to address the House on the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions which you hold in your hand in 
     <lb/>favor of a Confederation of all the Provinces 
     <lb/>of British North America. I feel that the 
     <lb/>question is one involving such very great 
     <lb/>interests, involving a change in the whole 
     <lb/>Constitution of the country, and involving 
     <lb/>consequences which may plunge us into 
     <lb/>great difficulties, or which may have the 
     <lb/>very opposite effect— that I feel great 
     <lb/>diffidence and embarrassment in approaching 
     <lb/>it. But I feel it is a duty I owe to myself 
     <lb/>and to those who sent me here, that I should 
     <lb/>express my opinions on this proposed union, 
     <lb/>before I record my vote on the resolutions 
     <lb/>now before the House. I desire to do this, 
     <lb/>because I cannot give my approval to the 
     <lb/>whole scheme, some of its details being such 
     <lb/>that I cannot support them.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JONE2">MR.  JONES</persName>—The way in which I look at 
     <lb/>
     this question does not at all depend on 
     <lb/>
     whether this hon. gentleman or that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman may be at the head of affairs in this 
     <lb/>
     country; or whether we may have a 
     <lb/>
     Coalition Government or a purely party 
     <lb/>
     Government ; but I consider we should look 
     <lb/>
     at the sheme on its own merits, and deal 
     <lb/>
     with it as a whole, giving a fair and square 
     <lb/>
     vote on the resolutions as a whole. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I think, therefore, that the course 
     <lb/>
     which has been taken by the Government to 
     <lb/>
     obtain such a vote is the wise and honest 
     <lb/>
     course. (Hear, hear.) I think they deserve 
     <lb/>
     credit for the step they have taken with a 
     <lb/>
     view to bringing this debate to a close. We 
     <lb/>
     have been debating this question day after 
     <lb/>
     day for a number of weeks, and I must say 
     <lb/>
     that the opposition given by hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side has been of a very 
     <lb/>
     factious character; time after time they 
     <lb/>
     have risen to make motions on this, that, 
     <lb/>
     and the other thing, keeping the House 
     <lb/>
     from addressing itself to the matter really 
     <lb/>
     under debate, and protracting unnecessarily 
     <lb/>
     the decision of the question. Only the night 
     <lb/>
     before last, when an hon. gentleman had 
     <lb/>
     risen for the purpose of addressing the 
     <lb/>
     House, they cried out that it was too late, 
     <lb/>
     and called for an adjourment of the debate; 
     <lb/>
     and yet, when that was agreed to, they 
     <lb/>
     wasted two or three hours in moving addi<lb break="no"/>tions to that motion for adjournment. This 
     <lb/>
     was done, too, by hon. gentlemen who were 
     <lb/>
     well conversant with the rules of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and who must have known that these motions 
     <lb/>
     were not in order. At midnight they were 
     <lb/>
     too tired to allow the debate to go on, and 
     <lb/>
     yet they kept the House sitting after that 
     <lb/>
     till three in the morning, discussing 
     <lb/>
     mere points of order. (Hear, hear.) That 
     <lb/>
     has been the course pursued by hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite. And what, on the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     has been the course pursued, by the Admin<lb break="no"/>istration? Did they not put a motion on the 
     <lb/>
     notice paper—a motion which the factiousness 
     <lb/>
     of hon. gentlemen opposite prevented from 
     <lb/>
     being put to the vote—to give further time 
     <lb/>
     for the discussion of this question, by resolv<lb break="no"/>ing that instead of its being taken up at 
     <lb/>
     half-past seven, it should be taken up at 
     <lb/>
     three, the whole time of the House being 
     <lb/>
     devoted to it? We have been debating the 
     <lb/>
     question for weeks, and though hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite have been in their places, they 
     <lb/>
     have not proposed a single amendment. And 
     <lb/>
     yet, after this had gone on for such a length 
     <lb/>

<cb/>
     of time, so soon as the " previous question " 
     <lb/>
     is moved, those hon. gentlemen get up and 
     <lb/>
     cry out that they are gagged. Even after 
     <lb/>
     the House began to discuss the question at 
     <lb/>
     three o'clock, these hon. gentlemen day after 
     <lb/>
     day wasted the time by getting in one side- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     wind after another, in order to create delay, 
     <lb/>
     to see if something might not turn up against 
     <lb/>
     the scheme. Now, at last, they have got 
     <lb/>
     something. Something has turned up in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, and I suppose they will now 
     <lb/>
     permit us to come to a vote. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     In discussing this question, I do not see any 
     <lb/>
     necessity for going back eight or ten years 
     <lb/>
     to the speeches of hon. members. I do not 
     <lb/>
     see why lengthy extracts should be read to 
     <lb/>
     shew that the hon. member for Montmorency 
     <lb/>
     opposed the union of the provinces in 1858, 
     <lb/>
    or that the hon. member for Hochelaga, at 
     <lb/>that time, was in favor of it. I do not see 
     <lb/>what that has to do with the question before 
     <lb/>us. It is now submitted in a practical form 
     <lb/>for our decision, and what we have to do 
     <lb/>is to give a square vote, yea or nay, that we 
     <lb/>are in favor of this Confederation, or that we 
     <lb/>are against it. Our circumstances have 
     <lb/>changed within the last few years; but it is 
     <lb/>not on that account merely that I now support 
     <lb/>this union. I have always, upon every occa<lb break="no"/>sion, on the hustings, at public meetings 
     <lb/>and elsewhere, advocated a union of the 
     <lb/>British North American Provinces; and 
     <lb/>were our relations with the United States in 
     <lb/>the same favorable form that existed some 
     <lb/>five or six years since, I would still give my 
     <lb/>support to a union. It is, therefore, sir, not 
     <lb/>because I think there is a great present 
     <lb/>necessity for the scheme being brought to a 
     <lb/>speedy conclusion that I now support it. 
     <lb/>That present necessity, however, now exists, 
     <lb/>and I do not see why other hon. gentlemen, 
     <lb/>after a lapse of five or six years, when times 
     <lb/>have changed, and a greater urgency has 
     <lb/>arisen for such a union, should not be allowed 
     <lb/>to change their minds. "Wise men change 
     <lb/>their minds; fools have no minds to change." 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Shortly before the meeting 
     <lb/>of this House, I advertised that I would 
     <lb/>hold a series of meetings in the riding of 
     <lb/>South Leeds, for the purpose of placing my 
     <lb/>views upon this question before my consti<lb break="no"/>tuents, and to see whether their views 
     <lb/>accorded with my own; men of all shades 
     <lb/>of politics were requested to attend these 
     <lb/>meetings, and they were very numerously 
     <lb/>and respectably attended, not only by these 
     <lb/>who supported me, but also by those who 
     <lb/>were my most bitter opponents at the last 
     <lb/>
            

            <pb n="816" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0816.jpg"/>

     election. And at all of those meetings, 
     <lb/>
     some six or seven, not a single voice was 
     <lb/>
     raised against the union of these provinces 
     <lb/>
     with the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island. All appeared to think such 
     <lb/>
     a union advisable and necessary, not only 
     <lb/>
     for commercial purposes, but because it 
     <lb/>
     would tend to strengthen the ties that bound 
     <lb/>
     us to the Mother Country. It has been said 
     <lb/>
     that this union has never been before the 
     <lb/>
     people, that it has never been a test question 
     <lb/>
     at the polls. Now, sir, so long ago as the 
     <lb/>
     year 1826, this union was advocated by Sir 
     <lb/>
     JOHN BEVERLEY ROBINSON, one of the most 
     <lb/>
     able men this country has ever produced; 
     <lb/>
     subsequently, on different occasions, it was 
     <lb/>
     adverted to by Lord DURHAM in his celebrated 
     <lb/>
     report—also by the British American League, 
     <lb/>
     presided over by the late lamented Hon. 
     <lb/>
     GEO. MOFFATT of Montreal, and latterly 
     <lb/>
     in that despatch to the home Government 
     <lb/>
     in October, 1858, over the signatures of the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Messrs. CARTIER, GALT and ROSS. 
     <lb/>
     Why action was not taken upon that despatch, 
     <lb/>
     I cannot say; I leave this matter in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of those who at that time administered 
     <lb/>
     the affairs of this country, and who are 
     <lb/>
     responsible for the course they pursued in 
     <lb/>
     allowing it to be dropped. Sir, the union 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces would, in my humble 
     <lb/>
     opinion, be of the very greatest advantage 
     <lb/>
     to us in many points. It would strengthen, 
     <lb/>
     and not weaken, as has been said by its 
     <lb/>
     opponents, the ties that bind us to the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country. It would give us a standing 
     <lb/>
     in the eyes of the world. Instead of being 
     <lb/>
     several small, disjointed and fragmentary pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, as was so ably expressed in the Speech 
     <lb/>
     from the Throne, we would form one great 
     <lb/>
     nationality, with a population to begin with 
     <lb/>
     of nearly 4,000,000 people, which would 
     <lb/>
     place us among the list of the first countries 
     <lb/>
     of the world. (Hear, hear.) It would tend 
     <lb/>
     to strengthen our securities both here and 
     <lb/>
     in the Mother Country. Instead of our stocks 
     <lb/>
     and our bonds being quoted as if by accident 
     <lb/>
     on the Stock Exchange in London, they 
     <lb/>
     would be looked for daily, and sought after. 
     <lb/>
     It would give us an increased market for 
     <lb/>
     our produce and our manufactures, and it 
     <lb/>
     would tend more than anything else to 
     <lb/>
     cause a tide of emigration to flow to our 
     <lb/>
     shores. (Hear, hear.) Now the emigrant 
     <lb/>
     in coming to America is preplexed to know 
     <lb/>
     to which of the different provinces he shall 
     <lb/>
     go, and when he speaks of going to America, 
     <lb/>
     the only place he thinks of is New York. 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     It would create a daily line of steamship 
     <lb/>
     from the different points of Europe to Halifax, 
     <lb/>
     the nearest point and shortest sea voyage 
     <lb/>
    to this country—and with the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway to bring the emigrant directly 
     <lb/>through to Canada, who will say that we 
     <lb/>shall not have a tide of emigration to our 
     <lb/>shores such as we can scarcely imagine? 
     <lb/>The only emigration we now have is that 
     <lb/>induced to come by friends who have made 
     <lb/>this country a home and have prospered. 
     <lb/>These, sir, are the reasons, from a political 
     <lb/>point of view, why I support the resolutions 
     <lb/>now in your hand. And, sir, in speaking 
     <lb/>in a commercial sense, and as a commercial 
     <lb/>man, they shall also have my full and 
     <lb/>hearty support. (Hear, hear.) Does any 
     <lb/>one pretend to say that by the addition of 
     <lb/>nearly a million of inhabitants to these 
     <lb/>provinces, a thrifty and intelligent people, 
     <lb/>that this country will not be made more 
     <lb/>prosperous? Does any one pretend to 
     <lb/>say, that by taking away the barriers that 
     <lb/>exist to trade, with a million of people 
     <lb/>living close alongside of us, that this country 
     <lb/>will not be advanced? Will we not have 
     <lb/>largely-increased markets for our manufac<lb break="no"/>tures when those hostile. tariffs that now 
     <lb/>meet us st every port in the Maritime 
     <lb/>Provinces, restricting our trade with them, 
     <lb/>are removed? Will we not have an in<lb break="no"/>creased market for our produce when we 
     <lb/>are linked together by the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railroad, and when a free interchange 
     <lb/>of all our commodities exists? Can we 
     <lb/>remain, as at present, without any highway 
     <lb/>of our own to the Atlantic, for ingress or 
     <lb/>egress, for five months of the year? (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) When we see the hostility existing 
     <lb/>towards us, and forcibly shown towards us, 
     <lb/>by the press, the people, and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the United States, by the enforce<lb break="no"/>ment of the obnoxious passport system, by 
     <lb/>the notice of the abrogation of the Recipro<lb break="no"/>city treaty, by the annulling of the bonding 
     <lb/>system, by. the notice given to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Great Britain that the treaty 
     <lb/>regarding armed vessels on our lakes is w 
     <lb/>be done away with—when our farmers can<lb break="no"/>not send their produce for five months of 
     <lb/>the year to a market; when our merchants, 
     <lb/>for the same period, cannot get their stocks 
     <lb/>of merchandise for the supply of the wants 
     <lb/>of the country; when we are dependent 
     <lb/>on the generosity of a foreign country 
     <lb/>even for the passage of our mails to Old 
     <lb/>England—when that is our position, shall it 
     <lb/>be said that this union with the Lower 
     <lb/>

     Provinces is not desirable, and that we shall 
     <lb/>
     not, as soon as possible, have a railroad 
     <lb/>
     across our territory to the Atlantic seaboard, 
     <lb/>
     to Halifax, one of the best harbors in the 
     <lb/>
     world? Shall we be indebted, be subservient 
     <lb/>
     to, be at the mercy of a foreign country for 
     <lb/>
     our very existence? (Hear, hear.) Sir, shall 
     <lb/>
     we remain dependent upon that country for 
     <lb/>
     all these things, or shall we not rather put 
     <lb/>
     our own shoulders to the wheel, throwing 
     <lb/>
     off our supineness and inertia, and by 
     <lb/>
     building the Intercolonial Railway, provide 
     <lb/>
     an outlet for ourselves? (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>
     simultaneously with the construction of that 
     <lb/>
     great work, I hold that for the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     the commercial interests of the country we 
     <lb/>
     ought to enlarge and deepen our canals. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I desire now to read a 
     <lb/>
     Minute of the Executive Council, issued by 
     <lb/>
     the SANDFIELD MACDONALD-DORION Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, under date 19th February, 1864. 
     <lb/>
     It is as follows :—

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Although no formal action, indicative of the 
     <lb/>
     strength of the party hostile to the continuance 
     <lb/>
     of the Reciprocity treaty, has yet taken place, 
     <lb/>
     information of an authentic character, as to the 
     <lb/>
     opinions and purposes of influential public men 
     <lb/>
     in the United States, has forced upon the com<lb break="no"/>mittee the conviction that there is imminent dan<lb break="no"/>ger of its speedy abrogation, unless prompt and 
     <lb/>
     vigorous steps be taken by Her Majesty's Im 
     <lb/>
     perial advisers to avert what would be generally 
     <lb/>
     regarded by the people of Canada as a great 
     <lb/>
    calamity. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

    
   
            <p>
     And in another place it is stated :—

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Under the beneficent operation of the system

     of self-government, which the later policy of the

     Mother Country has accorded to Canada, in com<lb break="no"/>mon with the other colonies possessing represent<lb break="no"/>ative institutions, combined with the advantages 
     <lb/>
     secured by the Reciprocity treaty of an unre<lb break="no"/>stricted commerce with our nearest neighbors in 
     <lb/>
     the natural productions of the two countries, all 
     <lb/>
     agitation for organic changes has ceased, all 
     <lb/>
     dissatisfaction with the existing political relations 
     <lb/>

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     From this Minute it appears to have been 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of the SANDFELD MACDON<lb break="no"/>ALD—DORION Government that the abroga<lb break="no"/>tion of the Reciprocity treaty would pro<lb break="no"/>bably bc a great calamity to this coun<lb break="no"/>try. But I am not of that opinion, and 
     <lb/>
     I believe that the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     will never be so reduced as to go on 
     <lb/>
     their knees to pray the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     United States to continue the treaty. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Indeed, for the past year or 
     <lb/>
     two, in consequence of the difference in the 
     <lb/>
     
         

            <cb/>
       

     currency between the two countries, we have 
     <lb/>
     felt almost as though that treaty had been 
     <lb/>
     put an end to already. In consequence of 
     <lb/>
     the state of the currency, many of the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of this country have been injured, 
     <lb/>
     the mining interest of the province has been 
     <lb/>
     put a stop to, and the lumbering interest, one 
     <lb/>
     of the most important of our many important 
     <lb/>
     interests, crippled and paralysed. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     What much greater injury can befall us, 
     <lb/>
     by the abrogation of the Reciprocity treaty, 
     <lb/>
     than that we now suffer through the de<lb break="no"/>rangement of the currency? Instead of 
     <lb/>
     the repeal of the Reciprocity treaty being 
     <lb/>
     a great calamity, it will lead to an agitation 
     <lb/>
     for organic changes which cannot fail to be 
     <lb/>
     of the greatest advantages to the future 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of the country. For my part I do 
     <lb/>
     not at all like the idea of a document of that 
     <lb/>
     kind, emanating from our Canadian Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, falling into the hands of the American 
     <lb/>
     people, and leading them to believe that 
     <lb/>
     in our estimation the repeal by them of the 
     <lb/>
     Reciprocity treaty would be calamitous to 
     <lb/>
     this country. (Hear, hear.) I repeat that 
     <lb/>
     I do not believe that the abrogation of that 
     <lb/>
     treaty will eventually be detrimental to our 
     <lb/>
     interests. It is true that we may suffer for 
     <lb/>
     four or five years, and suffer greatly, but we 
     <lb/>
     will be thrown upon our own resources, and 
     <lb/>
     ultimately become strong and self-reliant. 
     <lb/>
     Our merchants will no longer be denied an 
     <lb/>
     outlet to the ocean during five or six months 
     <lb/>
     in the year, except by the favor or forbearance 
     <lb/>
     of our Yankee neighbors. Let us put our 
     <lb/>
     hands into our pockets to build this Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway, and we will be opening a 
     <lb/>
     way to the ocean to our merchants and our 
     <lb/>
     farmers for shipping their products over 
     <lb/>
     their own territory. And when we are in 
     <lb/>
     that position, we shall be able to say to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the United States—" You shall no 
     <lb/>
     onger be allowed to participate in the bene<lb break="no"/>fits of our fisheries—we will close the naviga<lb break="no"/>tion of our canals against you—and we will 
     <lb/>
     cease to permit, wit out the payment of a 
     <lb/>
     heavy duty, the importation into this country 
     <lb/>
     of your coarse grains for the supply of our 
     <lb/>
     distillers and brewers." And, sir, when it is 
     <lb/>
     stated that the importations of these grains 
     <lb/>
     have amounted to nearly two millions of 
     <lb/>
     bushels annually, it will be seen that after 
     <lb/>
     all the reciprocity is not altogether on one 
     <lb/>
     side. (Hear, hear.) I think that they will 
     <lb/>
     then acknowledge it will be better for them 
     <lb/>
     to be on more friendly terms with this pro<lb break="no"/>vince, seeing that we control the navigation 
     <lb/>
     of the Welland and St. Lawrence canals, the 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="818" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0818.jpg"/>

     natural outlet for the products of the 
     <lb/>
     Western States, which in 1863 amounted to 
     <lb/>
     the enormous quantity of five hundred and 
     <lb/>
     twenty million bushels of grain—they will 
     <lb/>
     be dependent upon us, instead of our relying 
     <lb/>
     upon them. Compared with the St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     navigation the Erie canal is but a ditch, and 
     <lb/>
     it is closed by the trust tarlier in the season 
     <lb/>
     than our lake and river navigation. When 
     <lb/>
     all these advantages which we enjoy are 
     <lb/>
     considered, the people of the United States 
     <lb/>
     will see how much better it is to live on terms 
     <lb/>
     of friendship and amity with us, instead of, 
     <lb/>
     to use a vulgar but forcible phrase, " cutting 
     <lb/>
     off their nose to spite their face." (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) With regard to the proposed resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, I stated at the outset that there were 
     <lb/>
     portions of the scheme to which I objected, 
     <lb/>
     and I may now, sir, be allowed briefly to 
     <lb/>
     advert to them. I would prefer that the 
     <lb/>
     whole power was concentrated under one head 
     <lb/>
     by a Legislative union, rather than a Federal 
     <lb/>
     union. I fear that the machinery will be com<lb break="no"/>plex, and that we will find, under the proposed 
     <lb/>
     system, that the expenses of the Government 
     <lb/>
     will be much greater than if we had one 
     <lb/>
     General Government without these additions 
     <lb/>
     of local legislatures for each of the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But lam happy to say that 
     <lb/>
     the proposed Federal system is not a reflex 
     <lb/>
     of the old Federal union of the United States. 
     <lb/>
     Notwithstanding some honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have praised the Federal system in the 
     <lb/>
     States as worthy of imitation, still I think 
     <lb/>
     our proposed system much to be preferred. 
     <lb/>
     It differs in this—the United States Federal 
     <lb/>
     system was formed from a number of sov<lb break="no"/>ereign states, with sovereign powers, dele<lb break="no"/>gating to a central power just as much or as 
     <lb/>
     little of their power as they chose; thereby 
     <lb/>
     the doctrine ot state rights obtained, and, 
     <lb/>
     as we have seen within the last four years, 
     <lb/>
     has been the cause of bloodshed and civil 
     <lb/>
     war, it may be to the probable destruction of 
     <lb/>
     that Federal union. Our case is exactly the 
     <lb/>
     reverse. Instead of the Central Government 
     <lb/>
     receiving its power from the different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, it gives to those provinces just as 
     <lb/>
     much or as little as it chooses. Hear what 
     <lb/>
     the 45th resolution says—" ln regard to all 
     <lb/>
     subjects in which jurisdiction belongs to 
     <lb/>
    both the general and local legislatures, the 
     <lb/>laws of the General Parliament shall control 
     <lb/>and supersede those made by the local le<lb break="no"/>gislatures, and the latter shall be void so 
     <lb/>far as inconsistent with the former." This 
     <lb/>places the whole control in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     General Government, making the union as 
     <lb/>
     nearly legislative as the circumstances of 
     <lb/>
     the various provinces would admit. So much 
     <lb/>
     is this the case that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Hochelaga fears that it would eventually 
     <lb/>
     result in a legislative union—a result to 
     <lb/>
     my mind most devoutly to be desired. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) There are two or three more of the 
     <lb/>
     points of the resolutions to which I have 
     <lb/>
     objection. The public lands are placed at 
     <lb/>
     the disposal of the local legislatures; immi<lb break="no"/>gration also is in the hands of the local le<lb break="no"/>gislatures, and the seacoast fisheries are in 
     <lb/>
     the hands of the local legislatures. These 
     <lb/>
     are matters common to the whole, and should, 
     <lb/>
     for many reasons, be under the control of the 
     <lb/>
     General Government. These various interests, 
     <lb/>
     however, are all covered by the 45th resolu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Conference which I have just 
     <lb/>
     read, and which declares that when con<lb break="no"/>sistent with the welfare of the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, their control will be taken from 
     <lb/>
     the local legislatures. (Hear, hear.) I have, 
     <lb/>
     as briefly as possible, shewn thatin my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     in our political and our commercial relations 
     <lb/>
     we would be benefited by the union of Canada 
     <lb/>
     with the Maritime Provinces. I have also 
     <lb/>
     adverted briefly to the objections which I 
     <lb/>
     hold to the proposed mode of carrying out 
     <lb/>
     the union. I shall now endeavor to show 
     <lb/>
     that as a means of defence it is highly desir<lb break="no"/>able. If there is one thing more desirable 
     <lb/>
     than another, it is to have the whole forces 
     <lb/>
     of the country under one governing power. 
     <lb/>
     How might it fare with us, in case of war or 
     <lb/>
     invasion, with the provinces disunited? 
     <lb/>
     Objections could now be made against the 
     <lb/>
     withdrawal of a portion of the militia from 
     <lb/>
     one province to the others, without the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the government of that province, 
     <lb/>
     and before they could be brought into the 
     <lb/>
     field, valuable time would be lost, red-tapeism 
     <lb/>
     would stand in the way, and the delay might 
     <lb/>
     be dangerous. (Hear, hear.) By being united 
     <lb/>
     and controlled under one head, troops could 
     <lb/>
     be thrown upon any point attacked, at a 
     <lb/>
     moment's notice. Objections have been made 
     <lb/>
     by hon. gentlemen to any expenditure for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of building fortications, at pro 
     <lb/>
     per points, for the defence of the country; 
     <lb/>
     but I am satisfied there is no reasonable sum 
     <lb/>
     that may be required that will be grudged 
     <lb/>
     by the people of Canada; for if there is any 
     <lb/>
     purpose for which they will contribute cheer<lb break="no"/>fully, it is for the defence of their country, 
     <lb/>
     and to continue the connection and cement 
     <lb/>
     the tie that binds us to the Mother Country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="819" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0819.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">819</fw>
            <p>
     (Hear, hear.) It has been also stated that 
     <lb/>
     we could not defend ourselves against an 
     <lb/>
     overwhelming power such as the United 
     <lb/>
     States. Time was when we did defend our<lb break="no"/>selves, and that successfully ; and if the time 
     <lb/>
     should ever come again, the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and of the Maritime Provinces will not he 
     <lb/>
     found backward to defend everything they 
     <lb/>
     held sacred and most dear. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     has also been said that we should keep a 
     <lb/>
     strict neutrality; in fact that our neutrality 
     <lb/>
     should be guaranteed by England, France 
     <lb/>
     and the United Siates, in case war should 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately take place between them. But 
     <lb/>
     such an idea is too absurd to be considered 
     <lb/>
     for a moment. Would the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country submit to such an arrangement even 
     <lb/>
     if attempted to be carried out ? Would we 
     <lb/>
     allow England, if forced to go to war with 
     <lb/>
     the United States, want the assistance of her 
     <lb/>
     Canadian subjects? Could we restrain the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada from doing their duty, when 
     <lb/>
     they saw the Mother Country battling with 
     <lb/>
     her foes? If I thought such would be the 
     <lb/>
     case, I should deny my country, for we should 
     <lb/>
     be held up to the scorn and derision of the 
     <lb/>
     world. (Hear, hear.) On the question of our 
     <lb/>
     defences, I desire to read an extract from the 
     <lb/>
     report of Col. JERVOIS, the able engineer 
     <lb/>
     sent out to report upon the practicability of 
     <lb/>
     defending Canada against attack :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The question appears to be whether the British 
     <lb/>
     force now in Canada shall be withdrawn in order 
     <lb/>
     to avoid the risk of its defeat, or whether the 
     <lb/>
     necessary measure shall be taken to enable that 
     <lb/>
     force to be of use for the defence of the country. 
     <lb/>
     The sum required for the construction of the 
     <lb/>
    proposed works and armaments at Montreal and 
     <lb/>Quebec would only be about one year's expense 
     <lb/>of the regular force we now maintain in Canada. 
     <lb/>It is a delusion to suppose that force can be of 
     <lb/>any use for the defence of the country, without 
     <lb/>fortifications to compensate for the comparative 
     <lb/>smallness of its numbers. Even when aided by 
     <lb/>the whole of the local militia that could at pre<lb break="no"/>sent be made available, it would, in the event 
     <lb/>of war, be obliged to retreat before the superior 
     <lb/>numbers by which it would be attacked, and it 
     <lb/>would be fortunate if it succeeded in embarking at 
     <lb/>Quebec, and putting to sea without serious defeat. 
     <lb/>On the other hand , if the works now recom— 
     <lb/>mended be constructed, the vital points of the 
     <lb/>country could be defended, and the regular army 
     <lb/>would become a nucleus and support, round 
     <lb/>which the people of Canada would rally to resist 
     <lb/>aggression, and to preserve that connection with 
     <lb/>the Mother Country which their loyalty, their 
     <lb/>interests, and their love of true freedom alike 
     <lb/>make them desirous to maintain.

     itself from a source of military expenditure. He 
     <lb/>
     might felicitate the House that Birmingham was 
     <lb/>
     sending admirably finished Armstrong and Whit<lb break="no"/>worth guns to arm the new naval forces of America 
     <lb/>
     on the Canadian lakes. He might congratulate the 
     <lb/>
     House that Birmingham was sending out a plenti<lb break="no"/>ful supply of fetters and handcuffs to be used in 
     <lb/>
     coercing the refractory Americans. The right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman might, at the same time, be able 
     <lb/>
     to congratulate the House upon a vast amount 
     <lb/>
     of commercial prosperity, and announce that he 
     <lb/>
     was able to reduce the income tax a penny or two 
     <lb/>
     pence on the pound. But if ever that day should 
     <lb/>
     come, and if ever that speech were made, 
     <lb/>
     the whole world would observe that the old 
     <lb/>
     English oak was not only withered in its limbs, 
     <lb/>
     but was rotten at its heart. There was, in fact, 
     <lb/>
     no escape from the obligation which bound Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, by every tie of national honor and inter<lb break="no"/>est, to maintain and defend Canada. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not one merely between England and 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but was one between England and the 
     <lb/>
     United States. It appeared to him that the notice 
     <lb/>
     given by the American Government was an act 
     <lb/>
    of such unmistakable hostility, that it almost, 
     <lb/>

     amounted to a declaration of war, and at a much 
     <lb/>
     earlier period of our history, it would have been 
     <lb/>
     so regarded.

            <p>When such views are held in England, when 
     <lb/>so strong a desire is manifested in Canada to 
     <lb/>maintain our connection with England, and 
     <lb/>to remain under the sheltering folds of that 
     <lb/>flag we love so well, shall it be said that we

     <lb/>I know, sir, that the people of Canada will

     <lb/>I feel that there is some of the spirit of 1812

     <lb/>and who gave up all in order to live under the

     <lb/>courses through our veins. (Hear.) Sir, I trust

     <lb/>that British power on this continent may be 
     <lb/>consolidated, our connection with the Mother

     <lb/>under this union this country may be made 
     <lb/>a happy home for hundreds of thousands of 
     <lb/>emigrants from the Mother Country—a happy 
     <lb/>and contented home for all now living here,

     <persName ref="pers:CART3">MR. CARTWRIGHT</persName>, said—Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, the turn which this debate has assumed 
     <lb/>
     of late is somewhat remarkable. Up to a 
     <lb/>
     very recent period, hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     have dwelt chiefly on the extreme—I think 
     <lb/>
     they even said the indecent—haste with 
     <lb/>
     which this project has been pushed forward. 
     <lb/>
     They have asserted that this scheme was the 
     <lb/>
     sole, the only bond of union between the 
     <lb/>
     members of the present Ministry, and fur<lb break="no"/>ther, that so rash, so inconsiderate was their 
     <lb/>
     eagerness to effect their end at any cost, 
     <lb/>
     that they have seriously compromised our 
     <lb/>
     interests by undue concessions to the remain<lb break="no"/>ing provinces, and notably to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and New Brunswick. Latterly, however, 
     <lb/>
     the question has assumed a new and different 
     <lb/>
     phase. It has been discovered that so far 
     <lb/>
     from being a bond of union, the project of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is a mere pretext, a blind to 
     <lb/>
     cover their predetermination to maintain 
     <lb/>
     their position at all hazards. Now, sir, pass<lb break="no"/>ing over the obvious inconsistency of these 
     <lb/>
     contradictory accusations, passing over the 
     <lb/>
     absurdity of calling the Confederation the 
     <lb/>
     sole bond of union, and yet a sham to cover 
     <lb/>
     that union, I shall have a few words to say 
     <lb/>
     as to the reasons which induced me, in com<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
          
mon with a great majority of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe with a great majority of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country, to support honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the Treasury benches, not only 
     <lb/>
     as regards the project we are now discus<lb break="no"/>ing, but as to their general policy in 
     <lb/>
     effecting the extraordinary fusion of parties 
     <lb/>
     which took place last summer. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     it is idle to talk of that step as if those 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen were alone responsible 
     <lb/>
     for their conduct on that occasion. What 
     <lb/>
     they did was done with the full know<lb break="no"/>ledge and consent of their supporters, and 
     <lb/>
     reflects on our honor, if wrong, quite as 
     <lb/>
     much as on theirs. But, sir, I am very far 
     <lb/>
     indeed from admitting that we were wrong. 
     <lb/>
     I think the reasons which influenced us 
     <lb/>
     then were strong enough to justify us fully; 
     <lb/>
     those reasons are tenfold stronger now. To 
     <lb/>
     understand them, Mr. SPEAKER, we need 
     <lb/>
     only glance at the parliamentary history of 
     <lb/>
     the last few years, and then ask ourselves 
     <lb/>
     whether any language is too strong, any 
     <lb/>
     sacrifice too great, to put an end to the state 
     <lb/>
     of things which prevailed throughout that 
     <lb/>
     period. But first, sir, let me pause to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the charge of undue haste. Doubtless 
     <lb/>
     the rapidity with which these negotiations 
     <lb/>
     have advanced was as remarkable as it was 
     <lb/>
     unexpected. I believe there is hardly an 
     <lb/>
     instance in which a political project of such 
     <lb/>
     magnitude and delicacy has made such 
     <lb/>
     astonishing progress in so short a time; and 
     <lb/>
     so far from holding it an objection, so far 
     <lb/>
     from allowing that this is any evidence that the 
     <lb/>
     country has been taken by surprise in meeting 
     <lb/>
     to this scheme, I hold that it is, on the con<lb break="no"/>trary, the best possible omen of its ultimate 
     <lb/>
     success, no matter what temporary checks it 
     <lb/>
     may encounter, because it shows conclusively 
     <lb/>
     not only how zealously and honestly Minis<lb break="no"/>ters have devoted themselves to the task of 
     <lb/>
     carrying it into efi'ect, but, which I think of 
     <lb/>
     even more importance, because it proves 
     <lb/>
     how powerfully the events of the last few 
     <lb/>
     years have contributed to mature men's 
     <lb/>
     views on this subject, and shows that, so far 
     <lb/>
     as this province is concerned, my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friends are but aiding to carry out a foregone 
     <lb/>
     conclusion—a conclusion long since arrived 
     <lb/>
     at by every man among us who desires to 
     <lb/>
     maintain our independence or our connection 
     <lb/>
     with the British Crown; that in this, or 
     <lb/>
     some such scheme as this, lies our best, if 
     <lb/>
     not our only hope of escaping absorption 
     <lb/>
     into the great republic which adjoins us. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, this is an argument which perhaps has 
     <lb/>
     more weight with me than with some hon. 
     <lb/>

     gentlemen before me. It may be that there 
     <lb/>
     are some even here who are secretly dazzled 
     <lb/>
     by the magnificent vision, so dear to Ameri<lb break="no"/>can statesmen, of an empire which shall 
     <lb/>
     spread from sea to sea, and unite every 
     <lb/>
     scattered state and province from the Gulf 
     <lb/>
     of Mexico to Hudson's Bay under one law 
     <lb/>
     and one rule. Sir, I can understand the 
     <lb/>
     fascination which such an idea can exercise; 
     <lb/>
     I can even sympathise with it to some 
     <lb/>
     extent; and it is just because I do under<lb break="no"/>stand it that I am prepared to oppose 
     <lb/>
     it to the utmost, believing that in the 
     <lb/>
     long run the establishment of a power 
     <lb/>
     so gigantic could not fail to be fraught 
     <lb/>
     with the greatest misfortunes to those 
     <lb/>
     who might live under it, if not to the whole 
     <lb/>
     human race. And now, sir, to return to 
     <lb/>
     my subject, I would like to take a rapid 
     <lb/>
     glance at the perils from which we have but 
     <lb/>
     lately escaped; and in so doing, I shall 
     <lb/>
     speak only of those of which I have myself 
     <lb/>
     been cognizant in my own parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     career, brief though it is; and I appeal 
     <lb/>
     again to the consciousness of every honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman, whether there is anything 
     <lb/>
     in the events of the past two sessions of 
     <lb/>
     which we have much reason to feel proud, 
     <lb/>
     save, perhaps, their closing scene? What 
     <lb/>
     was our position, Mr. SPEAKER ; what was 
     <lb/>
     that position which some honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men have the hardihood to affect to regret? 
     <lb/>
     Two dissolutions granted (though in the 
     <lb/>
     latter case the Royal prerogative was not 
     <lb/>
     exercised); three changes of Ministry within 
     <lb/>
     the space of a single twelvemonth; the fate 
     <lb/>
     of cabinets dependant on the vote of a single 
     <lb/>
     capricious or unprincipled individual, in a 
     <lb/>
     House of 130 members; a deficient revenue 
     <lb/>
     and a sinking credit; all useful legislation at 
     <lb/>
     a stand-still -- these, 'sir, were circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which might well have filled us with appre<lb break="no"/>hension, had they occurred in a time of 
     <lb/>
     profound peace; but which, sir, coming, 
     <lb/>
     as they did, at a period when we are 
     <lb/>
     menaced with the gravest danger which 
     <lb/>
     can befall a free people, would have argued 
     <lb/>
     us deaf and blind to every lesson which the 
     <lb/>
     misfortunes of our neighbors ought to teach 
     <lb/>
     us, had we not embraced the very earliest 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to extricate ourselves from such 
     <lb/>
     a position; and the wonder to me is not that 
     <lb/>
     our statesmen should have shown themselves 
     <lb/>
     willing to bury their private grudges and 
     <lb/>
     paltry personal animosities, but rather that 
     <lb/>
     we could have been infatuated enough to 
     <lb/>
     permit such a state of things to continue 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
      

     at such a crisis for two whole years. It is 
     <lb/>
     not for me to say who has been most .to 
     <lb/>
     blame in the past. I judge no one, still less 
     <lb/>
     do I undertake to defend them; but I speak 
     <lb/>
     of acts patent and known to all, when I say 
     <lb/>
     that the position of parties in this province, 
     <lb/>
     the bitterness and virulence of party 
     <lb/>
     feeling, and the narrowness and acrimony 
     <lb/>
     to which those feelings gave rise, were de<lb break="no"/>grading and demoralizing us all to a degree 
     <lb/>
     which it is not pleasant to look back upon 
     <lb/>
     even now. And so far from regarding the 
     <lb/>
     union of parties which has taken place as a 
     <lb/>
     political misfortune in itself, or as tending to 
     <lb/>
     deprive the people of any safeguard, I say 
     <lb/>
     that it was of the greatest importance to our 
     <lb/>
     people that they should be relieved, if only 
     <lb/>
     for a brief period, from the desperate party 
     <lb/>
     struggles in which they have been engaged 
     <lb/>
     —that a lull of some kind should be afforded, 
     <lb/>
     that they should have some opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     considering the grave dangers which encom<lb break="no"/>pass them, some chance of escaping from the 
     <lb/>
     state of practical anarchy into which they 
     <lb/>
     had been drifting. It is to their credit, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, and to the credit of those who 
     <lb/>
     control the press of this country, that ever 
     <lb/>
     since this project has been fairly before us 
     <lb/>
     a very marked improvement has taken place 
     <lb/>
     in the whole tone and temper of public 
     <lb/>
     discussion. Of the press, in particular, I 
     <lb/>
     must say that the moment they were relieved 
     <lb/>
     from the necessity of supporting party 
     <lb/>
     manoeuvres—the moment a subject of suffi<lb break="no"/>cient importance was submitted for considera<lb break="no"/>tion, they seem to have risen at once to the 
     <lb/>
     level of the subject, and to have abandoned 
     <lb/>
     all those unhappy and rancourous personali<lb break="no"/>ties which, in times past, were too apt to 
     <lb/>
     disfigure their pages. Sir, I believe the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada have learned a lesson 
     <lb/>
     which they will not easily forget. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that henceforward it will not be found so 
     <lb/>
     easy to array citizen against citizen, race 
     <lb/>
     against race, as it has been heretofore. I 
     <lb/>
     believe our people have discovered that men 
     <lb/>
     who rise to be the heads of great parties are 
     <lb/>
     not of necessity villains and scoundrels—that 
     <lb/>
     both sides may have great political principles 
     <lb/>
     to maintain—that the words Reformer and 
     <lb/>
     Revolutionist, Conservative and Corrup<lb break="no"/>tionist, are not absolutely convertible 
     <lb/>
     terms, and that men who have given up the 
     <lb/>
     best part of their lives, and sacrificed too 
     <lb/>
     often, the best part of their fortnnes in the 
     <lb/>
     service of their country, have had some bet<lb break="no"/>ter and higher reasons than more love of 
     <lb/>

     jobbery and intrigue for doing so. To me, 
     <lb/>
     sir, this appears a matter of great moment. 
     <lb/>
     It is only too notorious how much of the 
     <lb/>
     misery and misfortune which has befallen 
     <lb/>
     the United States, is to be traced to the sys<lb break="no"/>tematic degradation of their public men. It 
     <lb/>
     is well for us that the matter is still in our 
     <lb/>
     own power. It is well for us that we have 
     <lb/>
     still the choice whether we will have states<lb break="no"/>men or stump orators to rule over us— 
     <lb/>
     whether this House shall maintain its hon<lb break="no"/>orable position as the representatives of a 
     <lb/>
     free people, or whether. it shall sink into a 
     <lb/>
     mere mob of delegates, the nominees of cau<lb break="no"/>cuses and of wire-pullers. It is still in our 
     <lb/>
     power to decide whether we shall secure a 
     <lb/>
     fair share of the best talent we possess to 
     <lb/>
     carry on the affairs of the country, or whether 
     <lb/>
     we will ostracise from our councils every 
     <lb/>
     man of superior ability, education or intelli<lb break="no"/>gence—with what practical results we need 
     <lb/>
     not look far abroad to see ; and I think, 
     <lb/>
     sir, it is fast becoming apparent that 
     <lb/>
     in this, as in other matters, the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada are well disposed to adhere 
     <lb/>
     to the traditions of their British ancestry. 
     <lb/>
     There is one objection, Mr. SPEAKER, which 
     <lb/>
     has been advanced perpetually throughout 
     <lb/>
     this debate by some hon. gentlemen who, 
     <lb/>
     while unable or unwilling to show an valid 
     <lb/>
     reason against Confederation in itself, pro<lb break="no"/>fess themselves bitterly scandalised at the 
     <lb/>
     political combination by which it is likely to 
     <lb/>
    e brought about. Now, sir, I admit at 
     <lb/>once that there is a prejudice, a just and 
     <lb/>wholesome prejudice, against all coalitions in 
     <lb/>the abstract. I admit that that prejudice is 
     <lb/>especially strong in the minds of English<lb break="no"/>men, and that, in point of fact, a coalition is 
     <lb/>always an extreme measure, only to be had 
     <lb/>resort to in cases of extreme emergency. A 
     <lb/>coalition, Mr. SPEAKER, may be a very base 
     <lb/>act, but it may also be a very noble one. It 
     <lb/>may be a mere conspiracy, for purposes of 
     <lb/>revenge or plunder, on the part of men hating 
     <lb/>and detesting each other to the uttermost— 
     <lb/>or it may be an honorable sacrifice of private 
     <lb/>personal enmity before the pressure of over<lb break="no"/>whelming public necessities, to escape from 
     <lb/>great danger or to carry a great object. Sir, 
     <lb/>I shall not insult the intelligence of the 
     <lb/>House by enquiring whether this present 
     <lb/>existing Coalition has proposed to itself an 
     <lb/>object of sufficient importance to warrant its 
     <lb/>formation Even those who censure the de<lb break="no"/>tails of this scheme most strongly are fain to do 
     <lb/>homage to the grandeur of the project, and 
     <lb/>
       
            <cb/>
        

     are compelled to admit that a union which 
     <lb/>
     should raise this country from the position 
     <lb/>
     of a mere province to that of a distinct nation, 
     <lb/>
     is a project well worthy of the utmost efforts 
     <lb/>
     of our statesmen. To determine the remain<lb break="no"/>ing question whether the position of our 
     <lb/>
     affairs were so critical as to require the 
     <lb/>
     utmost energy of all our leaders, and to 
     <lb/>
     justify any union which gave a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     hope of extricating ourselves from our diffi<lb break="no"/>culties, I must again revert to the condition 
     <lb/>
     in which we found ourselves during the last 
     <lb/>
     few years, and I ask every hon. member to 
     <lb/>
     answer for himself whether it was one which 
     <lb/>
     it gives him any pleasure to look back upon? 
     <lb/>
     Was it pleasant for us, Mr. SPEAKER, a 
     <lb/>
     young country without one penny of debt 
     <lb/>
     which has not been incurred for purposes of 
     <lb/>
     public utility—was it pleasant for us,I ask, to 
     <lb/>
     find our revenue yearly outrunning our ex<lb break="no"/>penditure in the ratio of 20, 30 or even 40 
     <lb/>
     per cent. per annum? Was it pleasant for 
     <lb/>
     us to know that some of our once busiest 
     <lb/>
     and most prosperous cities were being depo<lb break="no"/>pulated under the pressure of exorbitant 
     <lb/>
     taxation ? Was it pleasant for us, inhabiting 
     <lb/>
     a country able to sustain ten times its present 
     <lb/>
     population, to find capital and immigrants alike 
     <lb/>
     fleeing from our shores, even if they had to 
     <lb/>
     take refuge in a land desolated by civil war? 
     <lb/>
     Was it pleasant for us, sir, the only colony 
     <lb/>
     of England which has ever vindicated its 
     <lb/>
     attachment to the Empire in fair fight, to 
     <lb/>
     know that our apathy and negligence in 
     <lb/>
     taking steps for our own defence was fast 
     <lb/>
     making us the byword to both friend and 
     <lb/>
     foe? And lastly, Mr. SPEAKER, I ask was 
     <lb/>
     it pleasant for us, needing and knowing that 
     <lb/>
     we needed a strong Government above all 
     <lb/>
     things, one which should maintain a firm 
     <lb/>
     and steady policy, and possess the good-will 
     <lb/>
     and support of at least a large majority of 
     <lb/>
     our people—I say, sir, was it pleasant for 
     <lb/>
     us at such a crisis to find ourselves the 
     <lb/>
     victims of a mere political see-saw—to be 
     <lb/>
     sure only of this one fact, that whatever course 
     <lb/>
     of policy was adopted, the circumstance that 
     <lb/>
     it emanated from one party would cause it 
     <lb/>
     to be viewed with jealousy and suspicion by 
     <lb/>
     the whole remaining moiety of the nation? 
     <lb/>
     I would not have it thought, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     that in saying this, I am blind to the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties with which our statesmen have had to 
     <lb/>
     struggle. So far from this I believe that it 
     <lb/>
     has been quite too much the fashion to 
     <lb/>
     underrate them in times past. We have spoken 
     <lb/>
     of them as if it were the easiest task in the 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="823" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0823.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">828</fw>
         

     world to blend together, in less than one gen<lb break="no"/>eration, two distinct peoples—peoples differ<lb break="no"/>ing from one another in race, in language, in 
     <lb/>
     laws, customs and religion—in one word, in 
     <lb/>
     almost every point in which it is possible for 
     <lb/>
     men of European origin, and professing one 
     <lb/>
     common Christianity, to difler from each 
     <lb/>
     other. Sir, this could never have been an 
     <lb/>
     easy task. It is one which has again and 
     <lb/>
     again baffled the ablest statesmen of the 
     <lb/>
     most powerful monarchies of Europe ; and I 
     <lb/>
     will not undertake to say whether it is ever 
     <lb/>
     capable of complete accomplishment. Be 
     <lb/>
     that as it may, I know that in every empire 
     <lb/>
     which has ever existed, from the English to 
     <lb/>
     the Roman, which has held different races 
     <lb/>
     under its sway, it has always been found 
     <lb/>
     necessary to make large allowances for dis<lb break="no"/>tinctive national traits—has, in fact, been 
     <lb/>
     found necessary to introduce in some measure 
     <lb/>
     the Federal element, though it is equally 
     <lb/>
     true that in every state which deserved the 
     <lb/>
     name of an empire, the supreme authority 
     <lb/>
     of the central power in all that concerns the 
     <lb/>
     general welfare has been acknowledged un<lb break="no"/>reservedly. And, sir, it is just because this 
     <lb/>
     seems to have been effectual in all essential 
     <lb/>
     points in the scheme now before us—because, 
     <lb/>
     while reserving to the General Government 
     <lb/>
     the power of the purse and the sword, it accords 
     <lb/>
     the amplest defensive powers to the various 
     <lb/>
     local bodies—because, even where there 
     <lb/>
     may besome conflict of jurisdiction on minor 
     <lb/>
     matters, every reasonable precaution seems 
     <lb/>
     to have been taken against leaving behind 
     <lb/>
     us any reversionary legacies of sovereign 
     <lb/>
     state rights to stir up strife. and discord 
     <lb/>
     among our children. For all these reasons, 
     <lb/>
     I say, I am disposed to give my hearty sup<lb break="no"/>port to the scheme as a whole, without 
     <lb/>
     criticising too narrowly the innumerable 
     <lb/>
     details wnich it must inevitably present to 
     <lb/>
     attack. All I hope is that in adjusting our 
     <lb/>
     new constitutions, local and general, we 
     <lb/>
     shall not allow our minds to be warped by 
     <lb/>
     antiquated notions of the dangers which 
     <lb/>
     threaten our liberty. No fear here, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, for many a day to come at least, 
     <lb/>
     of perils which await us from the tyranny of 
     <lb/>
     hereditary rulers, or the ambition of aristo<lb break="no"/>cratic oligarchies. No, sir, no ; and while it 
     <lb/>
     is true that here as elsewhere, there are 
     <lb/>
     always dangers enough to retard our pro<lb break="no"/>gress, I think that every true reformer, 
     <lb/>
      every real friend of liberty will agree with 
     <lb/>
     me in saying that if we must erect safe<lb break="no"/>guards, they should be rather for the security 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
         

     
    of the individual than of the mass, and 
     <lb/>that our chiefest care must be to train 
     <lb/>the majority to respect the rights of the 
     <lb/>minority, to prevent the claims of the 
     <lb/>few from being trampled under foot by 
     <lb/>the caprice or passion of the many. For 
     <lb/>myself, sir, I own frankly I prefer British 
     <lb/>liberty to American equality. I had rather 
     <lb/>uphold the majesty of the law than the 
     <lb/>majesty of Judge Lynch. I had rather be 
     <lb/>the subject of an hereditary monarch, who 
     <lb/>dare not enter the hut of the poorest peasant 
     <lb/>without leave had and obtained, than be the 
     <lb/>free and sovereign elector of an autocratic 
     <lb/>President, whose very Minister can boast the 
     <lb/>power of imprisoning one man in New York 
     <lb/>and another in St. Louis by the touching of 
     <lb/>a bell-wire! I said, sir, that there were 
     <lb/>many reasons why we should all unite in 
     <lb/>furthering this project. It is not merely 
     <lb/>because of the barriers to material progress 
     <lb/>which it will remove—though I am far from 
     <lb/>undervaluiug their importance ; it is not 
     <lb/>merely because of the higher prizes which 
     <lb/>it will throw open to individual ambition— 
     <lb/>though I do not affect to despise this either ; 
     <lb/>but it is chiefly, after all, because I believe it 
     <lb/>will be found to have the most beneficial 
     <lb/>results, in elevating our politics and in 
     <lb/>inspiring our people with those feelings of 
     <lb/>dignity and self-respect which lie at the 
     <lb/>bottom of all real national greatness. 
     <lb/>Sir, I can only liken our position for 
     <lb/>some time past to that of a youth 
     <lb/>who has been allowed to take possession of 
     <lb/>his inheritance at an age when he is not yet 
     <lb/>legally responsible for his actions. I do not 
     <lb/>believe that such a position is good either 
     <lb/>tor a nation or an individual, and I for one 
     <lb/>rejoice that it is about being brought to a 
     <lb/>close. There were several other subjects, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, which I had intended to 
     <lb/>allude to ; but I find my voice is still too 
     <lb/>weak to allow more than a few remarks. 
     <lb/>Still, sir, I do not wish to sit down without 
     <lb/>saying briefly that I am glad to find one 
     <lb/>lesson at least, which the British Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion ought to teach us, is beginning to be 
     <lb/>impressed upon our people. That Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, Mr. SPEAKER—though we have not 
     <lb/>always been sufficiently alive to the fact- 
     <lb/>while it does not require the possession of 
     <lb/>those lofty, impracticable virtues which 
     <lb/>most republican institutions demand from 
     <lb/>their votaries, does nevertheless presuppose 
     <lb/>a reasonable amount of discretion at the 
     <lb/>hands of those who are intrusted with the 
   

            <pb n="824" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0824.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">824</fw>
          

     carrying out of its details. And, sir, though 
     <lb/>
     it is true that it does recognise the calm, de<lb break="no"/>liberate, just decision of the majority—and 
     <lb/>
     the calm and deliberate decision is almost 
     <lb/>
     always just—as final in the last resort, it 
     <lb/>
     does still so abound with safeguards—with 
     <lb/>
     latent checks of all kinds—checks estab<lb break="no"/>lished, many of them, more by custom and 
     <lb/>
     usage than by positive law—as to make it 
     <lb/>
     all but impossible for any majority, how<lb break="no"/>ever strong, to perpetrate any gross act 
     <lb/>
     of injustice on a minority, so long as that 
     <lb/>
     minority could command but one or two 
     <lb/>
     resolute representatives on the floor of Par<lb break="no"/>liament. Sir, it is impossible not to feel 
     <lb/>
     that it is in a very great degree to this fact, 
     <lb/>
     to the instinctive sense of the inherent 
     <lb/>
     powers of self-defence which our customs 
     <lb/>
     give to the weak against the strong—to the 
     <lb/>
     conviction that to drive any party to despair 
     <lb/>
     would create an inevitable dead-lock—that 
     <lb/>
     England owes it that she has contrived to 
     <lb/>
     administer her affairs for near two hundred 
     <lb/>
     years without any overt acts of tyranny or 
     <lb/>
     one direct collision or irregular interference 
     <lb/>
     with the ordinary course of law. Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     rejoice to see that we will continue to adhere 
     <lb/>
     to a system which has borne such good fruit, 
     <lb/>
     as a whole, in the parent land ; and I think 
     <lb/>
     the reflection how difficult, if not how dan<lb break="no"/>gerous, it is to oppress a determined minority 
     <lb/>
     under such a system, may serve to calm the 
     <lb/>
     fears of those honorable gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     dread the loss of local rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges at the hands of the stronger race. 
     <lb/>
     For the rest, Mr. SPEAKER, though I will 
     <lb/>
     venture upon no predictions—though I know 
     <lb/>
     we must expect many difficulties, many 
     <lb/>
     checks before we can hope to bring so great 
     <lb/>
     an enterprise to a successful issue—I trust I 
     <lb/>
     may be pardoned for expressing my con<lb break="no"/>viction that the loyalty and fidelity of the 
     <lb/>
     early settlers of this country—and I speak 
     <lb/>
     here without regard to any special nation<lb break="no"/>ality—is destined to be rewarded in the 
     <lb/>
     way in which they would most have desired 
     <lb/>
     to see it rewarded if they had lived to see 
     <lb/>
     this day, by the establishment of a kingdom 
     <lb/>
     on the banks of the St. Lawrence, which, 
     <lb/>
     without binding itself down to a slavish 
     <lb/>
     adherence to the customs of the old world, 
     <lb/>
     would yet cherish and preserve these time- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     honored associations our American neighbors 
     <lb/>
     have seen fit so recklessly to cast away. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, our forefathers may have had their 
     <lb/>
     faults ; but still, in spite of all, I dare affirm 
     <lb/>
    that the brave, self-sacrificing spirit they dis<lb break="no"/>
     

            <cb/>

played—their manful struggle against heavy 
     <lb/>
     odds—and last, but not least, the patient, 
     <lb/>
     law-abiding spirit which has ever induced 
     <lb/>
     them to prefer reform to revolution, even 
     <lb/>
     when engaged in sweeping away the last ves<lb break="no"/>tiges of worn-out feudal systems in Church and 
     <lb/>
     State from their midst—I say, sir, that that 
     <lb/>
     afford us ample proof that the men to whom, 
     <lb/>
     I hope, we shall soon look back as the founders 
     <lb/>
     of a new nation, were ancestors of whom any 
     <lb/>
     people might be proud ; and I trust that 
     <lb/>
     we, their descendants, may prove ourselves 
     <lb/>
     but half as capable of administering and 
     <lb/>
     developing the vast inheritance which awaits 
     <lb/>
     us. Sir, I believe that even we ourselves 
     <lb/>
     are but just beginning to grow aware of the 
     <lb/>
     immense resources, whether in field or forest, 
     <lb/>
     in mine or in minerals, in seas or in fisheries, 
     <lb/>
     with which it abounds ; that we are but 
     <lb/>
     just beginning to appreciate the advantages 
     <lb/>
     which surround us—our all but unparalled 
     <lb/>
     internal navigation ; a healthy and far from 
     <lb/>
     over-rigorous climate, and a country which, 
     <lb/>
     even if it does not present the same 
     <lb/>
     facilities for accumulating enormous fortunes 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of a few individuals which 
     <lb/>
     some other lands may afford, still promises, 
     <lb/>
     and, I think, will continue for many a day 
     <lb/>
     to promise, comfort and competence to every 
     <lb/>
    man who is willing to work for it. Older 
     <lb/>nations, Mr. SPEAKER, are working for us 
     <lb/>even now. Older nations are accumulating 
     <lb/>the skill and the capital which will yet be 
     <lb/>transferred to our shores, if our own folly 
     <lb/>do not prevent it. Older nations are even 
     <lb/>now busied in solving those problems which 
     <lb/>advanced civilization is sure to bring to us in 
     <lb/>our turn ; and we, if we are wise, may learn 
     <lb/>and profit by their example. A little patience, 
     <lb/>a little forbearance, a little timely concession 
     <lb/>to mutual prejudices, a little timely prepar<lb break="no"/>ation against possible dangers, and we may 
     <lb/>well hope to establish a state which, in all 
     <lb/>essential attributes of power and happiness, 
     <lb/>need not fear comparison with any other on 
     <lb/>this continent. Let us not be daunted by 
     <lb/>any accidental checks—we must lay our 
     <lb/>account to meet such in matters of not one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>tenth its importance—this is the time and 
     <lb/>this the hour ; never again can we hope to 
     <lb/>enter on our task under circumstances better 
     <lb/>fitted to remove the natural, the inevitable 
     <lb/>prejudices which must exist between so 
     <lb/>many different provinces—never again can 
     <lb/>we hope to receive a warmer and more 
     <lb/>energetic support from the Imperial autho<lb break="no"/>rities—never again can we hope to see a

     Ministry in office which shall command more 
     <lb/>
     completely the confidence of the great mass 
     <lb/>
     of our people, and which shall possess the 
     <lb/>
     same or equal facilities for adjusting those 
     <lb/>
     sectional difficulties which have disturbed 
     <lb/>
     us so long ; and I trust that in this most 
     <lb/>
     important crisis, this House will show itself 
     <lb/>
     not altogether unworthy to be intrusted 
     <lb/>
     with the destinies of three millions of their 
     <lb/>
     countrymen. My own years are not very 
     <lb/>
     many, Mr. SPEAKER, but yet even I can 
     <lb/>
     remember when Canada was but a petty pro<lb break="no"/>vince, an obscure dependency, scarce able to 
     <lb/>
     make its voice heard on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic without a rebellion ; forgotten 
     <lb/>
     or ignored, as if, as the French Minister said 
     <lb/>
     when he signed the treaty for its surrender, 
     <lb/>
     "it mattered not what became of a few 
     <lb/>
     barren acres of snow !" And yet, sir, in 
     <lb/>
     less than thirty years I have lived to see 
     <lb/>
     Canada expand into a state equal in numbers, 
     <lb/>
     in resources and power of self-government 
     <lb/>
     to many an independent European kingdom 
     <lb/>
     —lacking only the will to step at once from 
     <lb/>
     the position of a dependency to that of an 
     <lb/>
     ally—a favored ally of the great country to 
     <lb/>
     which we belong, and to take that rank 
     <lb/>
     among the commonwealth of nations which 
     <lb/>
     is granted to those people, and to those only, 
     <lb/>
     who have proved that they possess the power 
     <lb/>
     as well as the wish to defend their liberties. 
     <lb/>
     This, sir, is what I think Canada can do ; 
     <lb/>
     this is what I think Canada ought to do; 
     <lb/>
     and if, as I believe, this project of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation would contribute most powerfully to 
     <lb/>
     enable us to do so, there are few sacrifices 
     <lb/>
     which I would refuse to make for such an 
     <lb/>
     object—much more, forgive my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friends yonder for having in time past spoken 
     <lb/>
     somewhat over harshly and hastily of each 
     <lb/>
     other. Let them only persevere, let them 
     <lb/>
     only go on and complete the task which I 
     <lb/>
     will say they have so nobly begun, and they 
     <lb/>
     will have made good their claim—I do not 
     <lb/>
     say to the forgiveness—but to the regard, 
     <lb/>
     the affection, the esteem of every man who 
     <lb/>
     shall hereafter bear the name of Canadian.

     <persName ref="pers:HARW1">MR. HARWOOD</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     the importance of the proposed measure ; the 
     <lb/>
     fatal consequences which would result to the 
     <lb/>
     country if the plan of Confederation were 
     <lb/>
     rejected by this House ; the sources of social, 
     <lb/>
     political and commercial prosperity with 
     <lb/>
     which the measure of Confederation is preg<lb break="no"/>nant, if it is adapted with a firm deter<lb break="no"/>mination on the part of all to contribute their 
     <lb/>
     part towards its perfect working, are such, 


            <cb/>


     that notwithstanding the eloquent speeches 
     <lb/>
     delivered on the subject on both sides, and 
     <lb/>
     which seem to have completely exhausted 
     <lb/>
     it, I consider it my duty to make known to 
     <lb/>
     the country the reasons which influence me 
     <lb/>
     to assist in passing it. Called, as we all are, 
     <lb/>
     to record our votes either for or against this 
     <lb/>
     great constitutional change, it is no more 
     <lb/>
     than right that every one should in his own 
     <lb/>
     way account for the part which he may 
     <lb/>
     take in a measure which will naturally 
     <lb/>
     inaugurate a new era in the parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     annals of Canada. (Hear, hear.) I have 
     <lb/>
     listened attentively to the opponents of the 
     <lb/>
     measure, and read their speeches again and 
     <lb/>
     again, and truly the only effect they have 
     <lb/>
     had on my mind is a stronger conviction that 
     <lb/>
     in the anomalous position of the country,a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union of all the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     North America is the only remedy for all 
     <lb/>
     the innumerable difficulties which are sha<lb break="no"/>dowed forth on our political horizon. 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) The opponents of the measure, 
     <lb/>
     not being able positively to deny the advan<lb break="no"/>tages of Confederation to all the five pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of British America, endeavor to get 
     <lb/>
     up a cry that this union would involve the 
     <lb/>
     loss to us French-Canadians, and Catholics, 
     <lb/>
     of our nationality, our language, our laws 
     <lb/>
     and institutions. I, for my part, cannot look 
     <lb/>
     upon it in so terrible a light—having all 
     <lb/>
     history before me, I cannot come to that 
     <lb/>
     conclusion. I shall soon shew clearly that 
     <lb/>
     there exists throughout the world confeder<lb break="no"/>ations in which are included different nation<lb break="no"/>alities, different religions sects, and in which, 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless, the most thorough equilibrium 
     <lb/>
     prevails of the political, civil and religious 
     <lb/>
     rights pertaining to the different classes 
     <lb/>
     of which they consist. Do we find any 
     <lb/>
     other means of settling our difficulties of all 
     <lb/>
     kinds besides this of Confederation ? No, 
     <lb/>
     I find none ; and none is proposed to us 
     <lb/>
     by the opponents of the plan now before the 
     <lb/>
     House ! Mr. SPEAKER, the country is come 
     <lb/>
     to a political dead-lock ; we have arrived at 
     <lb/>
     a crisis ; ambition, the thirst of power, 
     <lb/>
     political passions worked upon in all ways 
     <lb/>
     and on all sides, have so clogged the wheels 
     <lb/>
     of the machine of government, that it has 
     <lb/>
     been brought to a stand-still ; and those who 
     <lb/>
    guided its movements have had to rack their 
     <lb/>brains to find some way of continuing the 
     <lb/>transaction of public business---a way by which 
     <lb/>we may arrive at a solution of the difficulty, 
     <lb/>and escape from the slough of <hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi> in 
     <lb/>which the wheels of government are stuck 
     <lb/>fast, and by which we may return to the

     high road of progress and improvement. 
     <lb/>
     Truly, Mr. SPEAKER, if the bitterest enemy 
     <lb/>
     of Canada had had it in his power to invent 
     <lb/>
     an inclined plane on which he might place 
     <lb/>
     as to hurry us to ruin, he could not have 
     <lb/>
     done it better than the different political 
     <lb/>
     parties have done it within the last few 
     <lb/>
     years. Elections on elections, one Ministry 
     <lb/>
     succeeding another; one crying out, extrav<lb break="no"/>agance, the other issuing commissions of 
     <lb/>
     inquiry to try to make places for its friends 
     <lb/>
     --what, in short, has been the course of 
     <lb/>
     events for the last few years? Since the 
     <lb/>
     21st May, 1862, have we not had four or 
     <lb/>
     five governments who have managed the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of the country? One we had which 
     <lb/>
     seemed to be " the darling of the nations," 
     <lb/>
     the paragon government of economy and 
     <lb/>
     retrenchment, the MACDONALD—DORION 
     <lb/>
     Government. What did it do for the 
     <lb/>
     country? Nothing, absolutely nothing; it 
     <lb/>
     had not even the moral courage to stand by 
     <lb/>
     its own measures. In the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     February, 1864, it brought in a bill (that 
     <lb/>
     respecting sheriffs). Well, what did it do 
     <lb/>
     in the circumstances? Afraid of its own 
     <lb/>
     work, it stood aghast at the remonstrances 
     <lb/>
     of some of its own partisans, who were con<lb break="no"/>tumacious—despair fell upon the leaders— 
     <lb/>
     the camp was a scene of confusion ; and lo! 
     <lb/>
     one fine day this Ministry, which was to 
     <lb/>
     bring back the golden age of happiness and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity, sank placidly to rest—became a 
     <lb/>
     thing of the past, and left " not a wreck 
     <lb/>
     behind" to mark its accession to power. In 
     <lb/>
     a word, that pattern Administration died in 
     <lb/>
     its virginity, died with the famous scheme of 
     <lb/>
     retrenchment in its hand, and a still-born 
     <lb/>
     " budget" on its conscience! (Continued 
     <lb/>
     laughter and cheers.) I ask every man of 
     <lb/>
     sense how many such governments as that 
     <lb/>
     we should require to take the ship of the 
     <lb/>
     country's welfare into port—to redeem us 
     <lb/>
     from our unhappy condition—to calm the 
     <lb/>
     strife of parties—to settle the many questions, 
     <lb/>
     often irreconcilably incompatible with each 
     <lb/>
     other, which had so long agitated the differ<lb break="no"/>ent sections of the country—a strife which 
     <lb/>
     threatened to become perpetual? What 
     <lb/>
     would have become of us if a providential 
     <lb/>
     piece of good fortune had not brought to<lb break="no"/>gether the men who compose the present 
     <lb/>
     Administration? Ever one can conceive 
     <lb/>
     that the Coalition Government, the only pos<lb break="no"/>sible one in such circumstances, came in just 
     <lb/>
     in the nick of time ; and, as a proof of its 
     <lb/>
     fitness for its mission, it "took fortune by 
 

            <cb/>
         

     the forelock," as the proverb says, and cle<lb break="no"/>verly made use of opportunity. In fact, 
     <lb/>
     three months after the present Ministry was 
     <lb/>
     formed, three of the Lower Provinces, com<lb break="no"/>prehending the utility of a union among 
     <lb/>
     themselves, conceived the idea of forming 
     <lb/>
     one from which might flow strength and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity to all ; being convinced that a state 
     <lb/>
     of disunion such as theirs had always been— 
     <lb/>
     their commerce paralysed by hostile tariffs— 
     <lb/>
     was a political suicide. They therefore seat 
     <lb/>
     delegates to Charlottetown, to devise a plea 
     <lb/>
     among themselves for the purpose of solving, 
     <lb/>
     in some profitable manner, the diffculties 
     <lb/>
     which beset them, the three provinces. 
     <lb/>
    What course did our Government then take? 
     <lb/>The members of the Cabinet—too wise to 
     <lb/>disregard the importance of the movement— 
     <lb/>too statesmanlike to neglect its advantages— 
     <lb/>found means to take part in the proceedings 
     <lb/>at Charlottetown; and being convinced that 
     <lb/>a Federal union of all the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>North America would be the real salvation of 
     <lb/>the country, laid before the delegates at 
     <lb/>Charlottetown a large, well-digested scheme 
     <lb/>based on a regard for justice and equality in 
     <lb/>respect of the rights and privil of all; 
     <lb/>a scheme by which each origin an each belief 
     <lb/>will enjoy full and complete protection; a 
     <lb/>scheme of Federal union, in a word, having for 
     <lb/>its apex the powerful aegis of England; for its 
     <lb/>foundation, social, political and commercial 
     <lb/>prosperity; and for its cornerstone, constitu<lb break="no"/>tional liberty in all its amplitude and strength. 
     <lb/>(Cheers.) This idea of a Confederation of 
     <lb/>the provinces is not a new one. All who are 
     <lb/>in the slightest degree acquainted with the 
     <lb/>parliamentary history of the country, are 
     <lb/>aware that a plan for the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>British North American Provinces was one 
     <lb/>of the base upon which the programme of the 
     <lb/>CARTIER-MACDONALD Administration rested 
     <lb/>in 1858. It may be asked—" Why should 
     <lb/>we have Confederation ?" " Why should we 
     <lb/>not remain as we are ?" It is impossible, and 
     <lb/>its impossibility is proved by the past. Let 
     <lb/>those who do not see the seasonableness of 
     <lb/>the Confederation look at what is going on 
     <lb/>on the other side of the line—what do they 
     <lb/>see there ? The threatened abrogation of the 
     <lb/>Reciprocity treaty. The abrogation of the 
     <lb/>transit system is threatened. A passport 
     <lb/>system, which throws the greatest possible 
     <lb/>obstacles in the way of our free travel 
     <lb/>through the States, and does serious injury to 
     <lb/>the development of our trade, has been in<lb break="no"/>augurated. We have no means of com<lb break="no"/>

municating during the winter with the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, except by passing over American soil, 
     <lb/>
     and our passage over that soil is merely toler<lb break="no"/>ated ; we may at any moment be deprived of 
     <lb/>
     this privilege, and in that case we should find 
     <lb/>
     ourselves all at once, during the long winter 
     <lb/>
     season, without any possible means of com<lb break="no"/>munication with Europe. These reasons are 
     <lb/>
     more than sufficient to cause us to seek to im<lb break="no"/>prove our position, and the only possible 
     <lb/>
     means by which to effect that object, is a 
     <lb/>
     commercial, social and political union with 
     <lb/>
     our sister colonies, the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I hear honorable members say—" Why not 
     <lb/>
     rather have the repeal of the union ?" 
     <lb/>
     " Why not leave Upper and Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     separate as they were previous to 1840 ?" 
     <lb/>
     Such a measure would probably put an end 
     <lb/>
     to the reiterated demands of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     for representation based upon population, and 
     <lb/>
     the fears entertained by Lower Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     fear of seeing her institutions endangered, 
     <lb/>
     should that system of representation be con<lb break="no"/>ceded ; but that measure would be rather a 
     <lb/>
     retrograde one, which would throw the 
     <lb/>
     country back, and would place it in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion which it occupied revious to the union. 
     <lb/>
     That measure would abrogate an agreement 
     <lb/>
     which has long existed—a union which has 
     <lb/>
     proved to the country a well-spring of pro<lb break="no"/>gress, riches and prosperity. Such a dissolu<lb break="no"/>tion would only tend to weaken us still more, 
     <lb/>
     and we should be but two weak and insignifi<lb break="no"/>cant provinces, whereas our union has con<lb break="no"/>verted us into one province comparatively 
     <lb/>
     strong. We can realize the gigantic works 
     <lb/>
     which have been carried out when we look 
     <lb/>
     upon our canals and our railways. Is there 
     <lb/>
     any one man endowed with ordinary fairness 
     <lb/>
     —any one man who has not completely taken 
     <lb/>
     leave of his senses, who will venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada would have been 
     <lb/>
     as far advanced, each of them, as they now 
     <lb/>
     are, if they had remained separate, with 
     <lb/>
     tariffs inimical the one to the other ? " Soon<lb break="no"/>er than have Confederation," will exclaim an 
     <lb/>
     opponent, root and branch, of the scheme pro<lb break="no"/>posed, " let us concede to Upper Canada repre<lb break="no"/>sentation adjusted on the basis of population 
     <lb/>
     wholly and entirely, as the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Hochelaga would appear in his celebrated 
     <lb/>
     manifesto of 1865 to desire," but this is 
     <lb/>
     positively absurd—it is a violation of the 
     <lb/>
     spirit and the letter of the Union Act of 1840 ; 
     <lb/>
     it is the principal source of all the difficult es 
     <lb/>
     of a sectional nature which have proved 
     <lb/>
    the source of difficulty, both in this House  
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
          

     and throughout the country, for several years 
     <lb/>
     past. It would be asking for the utter ruin 
     <lb/>
     of the civil and religious rights of the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians. Under such melancholy circum<lb break="no"/>stances, Mr. SPEAKER, what is then left for 
     <lb/>
     us ? There is left for us the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of all the British Provinces in North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca. That is the only possible remedy under 
     <lb/>
     existing circumstances. Of two alternatives 
     <lb/>
     we must select one. Either we shall form 
     <lb/>
     part of a Confederation of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces, or we shall fall into the 
     <lb/>
     unfathomable gulf of the Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     the neighboring States, formerly the United 
     <lb/>
     States. (Hear, hear.) How absurd are they 
     <lb/>
     who believe that the United States do not 
     <lb/>
     want us, with our mineral wealth and our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, which latter are of themselves an 
     <lb/>
     inexhaustible source of riches to the country ! 
     <lb/>
     The United States did not, in 1776, number 
     <lb/>
     more than four millions of inhabitants ; there 
     <lb/>
     were then only thirteen states ; now there are 
     <lb/>
     thirty-one states and seven territories—at 
     <lb/>
     least that was the number before the war— 
     <lb/>
     and a population of more than thirty millions. 
     <lb/>
     We know that the prodigious growth of the 
     <lb/>
     United States is owing to their purchases, 
     <lb/>
     their treaties and their conquests. They 
     <lb/>
     want us, and would stir heaven and earth to 
     <lb/>
     have us in their grasp. (Hear, hear.) Let 
     <lb/>
     us beware ! We stand on the brink of the 
     <lb/>
     yawning gulf of the American Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     falling into which we encounter, first, our 
     <lb/>
     share of liability to pay a national debt of  
     <lb/>
     three thousand millions of dollars, and an an<lb break="no"/>nual expenditure of five hundred millions ; 
     <lb/>
     and next, a share of their national quarrels  
     <lb/>
     and civil wars. Exposed to persecution by 
     <lb/>
     the conqueror, and loaded with the heavy 
     <lb/>
     burthen of enormous debts incurred in the 
     <lb/>
     prosecution of a cruel and fratricidal war—a  
     <lb/>
     war of which, be it said, everybody knows the  
     <lb/>
     beginning, but of which nobody knows the 
     <lb/>
     end — the uncalculating opponents of the 
     <lb/>
     measure before us will regret their obstinacy  
     <lb/>
     and their disregard of their country's weal. 
     <lb/>
     Then they will see the naked features of  
     <lb/>
     those democratic institutions which are in  
     <lb/>
     reality inconsistent with true liberty—of those  
     <lb/>
     boasted institutions, under whose influence  
     <lb/>
     the last vestiges of liberty have faded away,  
     <lb/>
     as does the light at the close of a bright day.  
     <lb/>
     Under them the liberty of the press is un<lb break="no"/>known ; under them, liberty is but a name, a 
     <lb/>
     dream, an illusion, a mockery, often a snare ;  
     <lb/>
     under them no man can venture to speak 
     <lb/>
     frankly what he thinks, and must take care 
     <lb/>

     that what he says is in unison with the opin<lb break="no"/>ions of the majority of his audience ; under 
     <lb/>
     them the rights of the minority are unac<lb break="no"/>knowledged, ignored, as if they had no exist<lb break="no"/>ence : the will of the majority is law. For 
     <lb/>
     my part, Mr. SPEAKER, democratic institu<lb break="no"/>tions have no charms for me. Liberty, 
     <lb/>
     Equality, Fraternity ! How many sad and 
     <lb/>
     mournful memories are connected with those 
     <lb/>
     three words in France ? In the name of 
     <lb/>
     Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, in the year 
     <lb/>
     1793, that country saw the best of kings led 
     <lb/>
     to the guillotine, provinces laid waste, blood 
     <lb/>
     flowing like water ; the standard of rebellion 
     <lb/>
     and insubordination raised and borne triumph<lb break="no"/>antly ; the pillage of churches and monas<lb break="no"/>teries, the desecration of the altar ; priests, 
     <lb/>
     nuns, old men, women, and even children, 
     <lb/>
     murdered ! Those three magic words were 
     <lb/>
     the signal and vindication of the " drownings 
     <lb/>
     at Nantes," sometimes called by the fine 
     <lb/>
     sounding name of " republican marriages." 
     <lb/>
     Yes, Mr SPEAKER, civil war rages among 
     <lb/>
     our neighbors ; but let us hope that Divine 
     <lb/>
     Providence will guard these new countries 
     <lb/>
     from the disasters and the horrid crimes 
     <lb/>
     which, to the eternal shame of civilization, 
     <lb/>
     stain the history of certain portions of Eu<lb break="no"/>rope at the close of the last century. It 
     <lb/>
     was after a civil war that the terrible pro<lb break="no"/>scriptions of MARIUS and SYLLA commenced. 
     <lb/>
     Let peace once be made between the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral and Confederate States, then we shall 
     <lb/>
     see the harvest of rancorous hatred cover 
     <lb/>
     the earth, the fires of revenge burst forth ; 
     <lb/>
     then woe to those who have given offence to 
     <lb/>
     men of the type and character of the famous 
     <lb/>
     General BUTLER. What is incumbent on us, 
     <lb/>
     then, if we would escape sharing the horrors 
     <lb/>
     of the situation ? What but to unite, one 
     <lb/>
     and all—to combine all our means, our re<lb break="no"/>sources, our energies, and to have confidence 
     <lb/>
     in ourselves and in one another — to show 
     <lb/>
     England that we intend to emerge from the 
     <lb/>
     state of isolation in which each several pro<lb break="no"/>vince has lain as regards the others ; that we 
     <lb/>
     intend to organize a system, so as to be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to do our part in the hour of danger ? 
     <lb/>
     We have every assurance that England will 
     <lb/>
     spend her last man, her last shilling, in de<lb break="no"/>fending and protecting us. Having a Fed<lb break="no"/>eral union, all the wealth which abounds in 
     <lb/>
     the five provinces will be most highly devel<lb break="no"/>oped ; our mineral riches, our timber, our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, our commerce, internal and external, 
     <lb/>
     our industrial arts and manufactures, will all 
     <lb/>
     receive a fresh impulse ; capital will flow in, 
     <lb/>
     and with it the means of defence of every 
     <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
           

     description. I do not pretend to say that 
     <lb/>
     the mere fact of a " Confederation " will ren<lb break="no"/>der us invincible. No, far from it, especial<lb break="no"/>ly when opposed to so formidable, so warlike 
     <lb/>
     a fee as the neighboring Confederation has 
     <lb/>
     now become ; but I do venture to say that if 
     <lb/>
     we do our best, England will never desert us, 
     <lb/>
     and if the armies of the neighboring Con<lb break="no"/>federacy should occupy our country, it would 
     <lb/>
     not be hers to keep it long. It is not essen<lb break="no"/>tially a necessity, Mr. SPEAKER, that a small 
     <lb/>
     Confederation cannot exist by the side of a 
     <lb/>
     large one without being swallowed up and 
     <lb/>
     absorbed. If all great nations are bound to 
     <lb/>
     subject to their yoke all the little ones, 
     <lb/>
     why are there so many small states in 
     <lb/>
     Europe ? (Hear, hear.) It may be that the 
     <lb/>
     mutual jealousies of the great powers are the 
     <lb/>
     cause ; then who shall say that France— 
     <lb/>
     France which fought side by side with 
     <lb/>
     England in the Crimea—France which, look<lb break="no"/>ing at Mexico, is so deeply interested in the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of this continent—would not join with 
     <lb/>
     England in a war between that power and the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring States, if the latter should un<lb break="no"/>dertake to drive the English from the banks 
     <lb/>
     of the St. Lawrence ? When a nation, strong 
     <lb/>
     in its rights, is determined to preserve them, 
     <lb/>
     it is often invincible. When XERXES, with 
     <lb/>
     a million of men, fell upon Greece, was he not 
     <lb/>
     driven back with the total loss of his immense 
     <lb/>
     army ? When war was declared against the 
     <lb/>
     South, was not the North, with its population 
     <lb/>
     of twenty millions, going to annihilate the 
     <lb/>
     South in three months ? It is now more 
     <lb/>
     than four years that the war has been raging, 
     <lb/>
     and the South, without friends, without allies, 
     <lb/>
     is not yet conquered and made to pass under 
     <lb/>
     the yoke. The history of Prussia affords a 
     <lb/>
     proof of what bravery can achieve, even when 
     <lb/>
     opposed to an enemy infinitely superior in 
     <lb/>
     numbers. In 1740, the youthful Prince 
     <lb/>
     FREDERIC ascended the Throne of Prussia. 
     <lb/>
     The country contained no more than 48,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles, and had a population of only 
     <lb/>
     two millions and a half, less than the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Canada alone, as it now is. Her fron<lb break="no"/>tier northward was a wall of ice, all the sea<lb break="no"/>ports were closed during the winter season ; 
     <lb/>
     her only ally was lukewarm ; to the east, west 
     <lb/>
     and south, she was bounded by powerful em<lb break="no"/>pires, the population of each of which alone 
     <lb/>
     far exceeded that which she could boast. 
     <lb/>
     The country was long and narrow ; it was flat 
     <lb/>
     and well adapted at all points for the move<lb break="no"/>ments of troops ; no country could be more 
     <lb/>
     exposed to an invasion ; nevertheless the 
     <lb/>
     Prince, unchallenged, threw himself headlong 
     <lb/>
  

            <pb n="829" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0829.jpg"/>

     into a bloody war—as the aggressor—with all 
     <lb/>
     his neighbors. Alone, and simultaneously, 
     <lb/>
     he had on his hands Austria, France and 
     <lb/>
     Russia. Yet he left to his successor a king<lb break="no"/>dom of 74,000 square miles, and a people 
     <lb/>
     numbering nearly six millions. The small 
     <lb/>
     and heroic republic of Holland did not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate to enter into a war with the mighty 
     <lb/>
     monarchy of Spain, then mistress of the wealth 
     <lb/>
     of the Indies. At this day her vessels are 
     <lb/>
     found in every sea. Java and Sumatra belong 
     <lb/>
     to her. Yet her population is smaller than 
     <lb/>
     that of the Provinces of British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica. Single-handed in 1848, Piedmont dared 
     <lb/>
     to enter on a struggle with Austria. The 
     <lb/>
     King of Piedmont had then four millions of 
     <lb/>
     subjects ; he now reigns over twenty-two 
     <lb/>
     millions. Even poor little Greece, with a 
     <lb/>
     million of inhabitants, must have its share in 
     <lb/>
     revolutions, choose a king, and talk of its 
     <lb/>
     rights, its pretensions, and its aspirations. 
     <lb/>
     No, Mr. SPEAKER, the one, the only means 
     <lb/>
     of safety for us, in the circumstances, is to 
     <lb/>
     have a Federal union of all our provinces—a 
     <lb/>
     social, political, commercial and military 
     <lb/>
     union. Happen what may, when we have 
     <lb/>
     done all that men of courage and energy 
     <lb/>
     can be expected to do to mend our position, 
     <lb/>
     our future will not be so dark as the friends 
     <lb/>
     and advocates of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi> would have us 
     <lb/>
     believe. Do these wonderful patriots really 
     <lb/>
     believe in their hearts, that continuing to be 
     <lb/>
     isolated as they are from each other, having 
     <lb/>
     no cordial alliance, almost no relations or in<lb break="no"/>tercourse, the Provinces of British North 
     <lb/>
     America would be either stronger or less ex<lb break="no"/>posed to the attacks of the Northern States 
     <lb/>
     than they would be if united ? Are those 
     <lb/>
     persons not original in their ideas who allege 
     <lb/>
     that the endeavor of the Provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     North America to form a Confederation is a 
     <lb/>
     kind of provocation and defiance to the North<lb break="no"/>ern States ? If the Northern States made 
     <lb/>
     this allegation, the most that could be said of 
     <lb/>
     it would be, that it would be a vain pretext, 
     <lb/>
     as futile as it would be absurd. Not less 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous and misjudging are those persons 
     <lb/>
     who pretend that the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     Provinces of British North America would be 
     <lb/>
     a step towards annexation to the Northern 
     <lb/>
     States. Truly, there are some minds which 
     <lb/>
     have an odd way of looking at things. If, 
     <lb/>
     indeed, the opponents of Confederation would 
     <lb/>
     only prescribe some other remedy to obviate 
     <lb/>
     the evils which threaten us as an effect of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, we should have at least the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of a choice ; but no—nothing of the 
     <lb/>
     sort—they attack, criticise, but suggest 
   

            <cb/>
         

     nothing. On the other hand, the principa 
     <lb/>
     journals of Europe and several respectable 
     <lb/>
     journals in the neighboring States have re<lb break="no"/>corded their approbation of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation submitted by the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and predict a brilliant future for the new 
     <lb/>
     empire which is about to arise on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the frontier line. (Hear, hear.) Re<lb break="no"/>ferring to history, we find that confederations 
     <lb/>
     have been formed in nearly all ages, and that 
     <lb/>
     the principal cause of their formation has 
     <lb/>
     been, not only the purpose of mutual protec<lb break="no"/>tion, but a military object. These two mo<lb break="no"/>tives combined with a third, that of com<lb break="no"/>mercial advantages, suggested the project 
     <lb/>
     which now occupies our attention. Among 
     <lb/>
     the ancient Greeks there were several Federal 
     <lb/>
     unions, the two principal being the Ætolian 
     <lb/>
     and the Achœan ; the former, dating from a 
     <lb/>
     period long antecedent to that of ALEXAN<lb break="no"/>DER, was broken up by the subjection of the 
     <lb/>
     states composing the league to Rome, about 
     <lb/>
     180 years B. C. ; the second, which was 
     <lb/>
     formed about 280 years B. C., was destroyed 
     <lb/>
     by the Romans about 150 years before the 
     <lb/>
     vulgar era. The Ætolian Confederation com<lb break="no"/>prised all the northern parts of Greece on the 
     <lb/>
     confines of Thessaly and Epirus, a portion of 
     <lb/>
     Central Greece, and several of the islands of 
     <lb/>
     the Ægean sea. This was a union rather of 
     <lb/>
     provinces than of cities. It had a " Consti<lb break="no"/>tution," " States General," a chief magistrate, 
     <lb/>
     a commander-in-chief, and different public 
     <lb/>
     officers, with different functions or powers ; 
     <lb/>
     the power of declaring war and that of mak<lb break="no"/>ing peace, of levying taxes, coining money 
     <lb/>
     current at that time—all were intrusted to the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government. The Achœan League, 
     <lb/>
     on the contrary, was a union, not of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, but of cities or towns—not less than 
     <lb/>
     seventy in number. There was a Federal 
     <lb/>
     capital, a " Constitution," different public 
     <lb/>
     officers, each invested with privileges and cer<lb break="no"/>tain powers and duties, too many to be enu<lb break="no"/>merated in this place. Who has not read the 
     <lb/>
     life of ARATUS and that of PHILOPŒMEN, 
     <lb/>
     the latter one of the greatest statesmen, the 
     <lb/>
     other the greatest captain of the Achœan 
     <lb/>
     union ? In reading the history of these na<lb break="no"/>tions we shall find that it was their union 
     <lb/>
     which saved them so long from the inroads of  
     <lb/>
     their enemies, and which, for ages, preserved 
     <lb/>
     their autonomy. We next come to the Ital<lb break="no"/>ian Confederation of the middle ages. Like 
     <lb/>
     those of Greece, they derived their origin from 
     <lb/>
     military necessity. The League of Lom<lb break="no"/>bardy, and that of the Tuscans, were pro<lb break="no"/>jected principally as a mutual protection 
  

            <pb n="830" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0830.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">830</fw>
        

     against the emperors, who were greedy 
     <lb/>
     conquest, and among them against 
     <lb/>
     FREDERIC BARBAROSSA. In that of the 
     <lb/>
     Tuscans, there was even an ecclesiastical 
     <lb/>
     element of a decided character, inspired by 
     <lb/>
     Pope INNOCENT III., its principal author. 
     <lb/>
     The famous Roman Tribune RIENZI tried to 
     <lb/>
     form a Confederation of all the Italian States, 
     <lb/>
     but perished without realizing this dream of 
     <lb/>
     his existence. Rome was to be the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Capital. RIENZI died in 1352. The Swiss 
     <lb/>
     or Helvetic Confederacy existed from the 
     <lb/>
     twelfth century. In 1474 LOUIS XI. of France 
     <lb/>
     endeavored to subdue it, but lost his trouble. 
     <lb/>
     In 1477 CHARLES THE BOLD of Burgundy 
     <lb/>
     lost his kingdom and life while foolishly assail<lb break="no"/>ing this Confederate power. In 1488 the Em<lb break="no"/>peror MAXIMILIAN tried also in vain to sub<lb break="no"/>jugate the country. Spain likewise endeavored 
     <lb/>
     on many occasions to subdue the Confederate 
     <lb/>
     States, but failed. In 1798 the Cantons of 
     <lb/>
     Switzerland became the Helvetian Republic. 
     <lb/>
     In 1803 they fell under the protection of 
     <lb/>
     NAPOLEON I., and in 1813 the allies overran 
     <lb/>
     them. In virtue of the Federal Act signed 
     <lb/>
     at Zurich in 1815, important amendments 
     <lb/>
     were made in their Constitution. The pur<lb break="no"/>pose of the Helvetian Confederation is the 
     <lb/>
     protection of the country against foreigners, 
     <lb/>
     the maintenance of peace and tranquility at 
     <lb/>
     home, the preservation of public liberty in the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, and the increase of its general 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. This Confederation has survived 
     <lb/>
     two European revolutions, without mentioning 
     <lb/>
     internal troubles, and it is now fifty years 
     <lb/>
     old. We must bear in mind that a popula<lb break="no"/>tion the most various, the most mixed in 
     <lb/>
     point of origin, language and religion, lives 
     <lb/>
     under this Constitution. The people number 
     <lb/>
     about two millions and a half ; about one 
     <lb/>
     and two-thirds of a million speak Ger<lb break="no"/>man, half a million speak French, and the 
     <lb/>
     remainder Italian and other languages. One 
     <lb/>
     half of the population is Catholic, the other 
     <lb/>
     Protestant. Their interests arising from 
     <lb/>
     locality, race and faith, are as complicated and 
     <lb/>
     as various as are their manners, language and 
     <lb/>
     customs, and yet they all are free, all live se<lb break="no"/>curely, respected, happy and prosperous. They 
     <lb/>
     all enjoy the greatest and the purest liberty. 
     <lb/>
     There are twenty-two Cantons, and what is 
     <lb/>
     astonishing is that the chief of the Canton of 
     <lb/>
     Neufchâtel is a king, the King of Prussia. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I shall not speak of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the United States of the Nether<lb break="no"/>lands, which had their day, their glory and 
     <lb/>
     their use ; but I shall say a word of the great 
     <lb/>
     Germanic Confederation. This is composed 
  

            <cb/>
      

     of forty states of very different size, and con<lb break="no"/>tains thirty-four millions of inhabitants. 
     <lb/>
     There belong to it kingdoms, grand duchies, 
     <lb/>
     duchies, principalities and free cities. In 
     <lb/>
     this vast association are Catholics, Protest<lb break="no"/>ants, Jews, in  short different religions and 
     <lb/>
     nationalities, and yet none tyrannise over 
     <lb/>
     others ; all live happily under the same Feder<lb break="no"/>al union and under the protectorate of the 
     <lb/>
     Emperor of Austria. Of these states, Aus<lb break="no"/>tria is, properly speaking, the first in import<lb break="no"/>ance ; her army in time of peace is 280,000 
     <lb/>
     men, in time of war she can bring into the 
     <lb/>
     field 800,000. Prussia is the second, with 
     <lb/>
     an army of 200,000 men, and a national mili<lb break="no"/>tia of 400,000 men. There are, as I have 
     <lb/>
     said, in these states various nationalities and 
     <lb/>
     different sects of religion, and, nevertheless, 
     <lb/>
     the rights of each are preserved in all their 
     <lb/>
     integrity. Why then should not we, French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians and Catholics, become a component 
     <lb/>
     part of the Confederation of the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America, without any appre<lb break="no"/>hension of seeing our language, our laws, our 
     <lb/>
     religion and our institutions endangered ? 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that we could find no perfect 
     <lb/>
     and complete protection otherwise than by a 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of this nature, inasmuch as it 
     <lb/>
     is a union based on equity towards the inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of the five provinces as its most vital 
     <lb/>
     and fundamental principle. As to the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the United States, I shall merely 
     <lb/>
     name them. Every one knows that in 1776, 
     <lb/>
     when the thirteen colonies revolted against 
     <lb/>
     England, they believed that the only means 
     <lb/>
     of securing internal prosperity and of de<lb break="no"/>fending themselves against the common 
     <lb/>
     enemy, was to unite together for their mu<lb break="no"/>tual protection ; clearly perceiving that 
     <lb/>
     if they remained separate, and without any 
     <lb/>
     bond of union, as the uncalculating oppo<lb break="no"/>nents of the present plan of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     would wish the Provinces of British North 
     <lb/>
     America to remain, their defeat was certain, 
     <lb/>
     and instead of coming victoriously out of the 
     <lb/>
     struggle, they would be easily conquered. I 
     <lb/>
     shall now, Mr. SPEAKER, ask to be allowed 
     <lb/>
     to say a few words on the other confedera<lb break="no"/>tions which have existed on the continent of 
     <lb/>
     America. In the first place I shall mention 
     <lb/>
     that of Central America, or Guatimala. That 
     <lb/>
     Confederation was situated on the shores of 
     <lb/>
     the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. 
     <lb/>
     It consisted of five states—Guatimala, Hon<lb break="no"/>duras, San Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa 
     <lb/>
     Rica. These states were peopled by Creoles, 
     <lb/>
     Mestizos, Indians and Negroes. Until the 
     <lb/>
     year 1821 this Confederation was rich and 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="831" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0831.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">831</fw>
          

     prosperous. <choice><sic>Guatimala</sic><corr>Guatemala</corr></choice>, then, imitating the 
     <lb/>
     ill-advised example of other Spanish colonies, 
     <lb/>
     declared its independence, and thought fit to 
     <lb/>
     set up as a Federal republic ; but in 1839 an 
     <lb/>
     insurrection detached the state of Honduras 
     <lb/>
     from the Confederation, and shortly after the 
     <lb/>
     other states also declared themselves to be in<lb break="no"/>dependent (1847) ; and what are they now ? 
     <lb/>
     They have fallen into complete insignificance, 
     <lb/>
     a prey to the ambition of numerous dictators, 
     <lb/>
     without any common bond, disunited, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore without vitality or strength. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We next come to the united provin<lb break="no"/>ces of Rio de la Plata, now constituting the 
     <lb/>
     Argentine republic. The Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     La Plata comprised fourteen states, the great<lb break="no"/>er part of which formed at one time a por<lb break="no"/>tion of the immense Viceroyalty of Peru. 
     <lb/>
     In 1778, being united to the present province 
     <lb/>
    of Bolivia, to Paraguay and Uruguay, they 
     <lb/>formed a particular viceroyalty, that of Rio 
     <lb/>dela Plata. In 1810 they took part in the 
     <lb/>important insurrectionary movement which 
     <lb/>shook all the transatlantic dependencies of 
     <lb/>Spain ; from that time everything tended to 
     <lb/>republicanism ; separate and independent 
     <lb/>states became republics. They are now a 
     <lb/>prey to anarchy and the confusion which at<lb break="no"/>tends such institutions. The industrial arts 
     <lb/>are unheeded, and the commerce limited. If, 
     <lb/>sir, that Confederation had proved to be 
     <lb/>faithful to the cause which gave it life, if 
     <lb/>union had prevailed instead of disunion, 
     <lb/>strength, power, prosperity and wealth would 
     <lb/>have fallen to the lot of the association, in place 
     <lb/>of poverty, misery, and decay, which seem now 
     <lb/>to be their inevitable fate. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>But some of the honorable members of this 
     <lb/>House have maintained that the union would 
     <lb/>be beneficial to none but the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, that they alone would derive advan<lb break="no"/>tage from it, as they are comparatively poor, 
     <lb/>while Canada is rich by means of its trade, 
     <lb/>through its industrial pursuits, its manufac<lb break="no"/>tures and its agriculture. I maintain for my 
     <lb/>part that we are as much in need of them as 
     <lb/>they are of us—(hear, hear)—both in regard 
     <lb/>to industry, to trade, and to military power. 
     <lb/>In the first place, let us consider the various 
     <lb/>resources of the several Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia is not, certainly, altogether an 
     <lb/>agricultural country, but it contains valleys in 
     <lb/>which the soil is as deep, as rich, and as well 
     <lb/>suited for farming as the best lands of the 
     <lb/>West. A large portion of the population are 
     <lb/>devoted to fishing, and skilled in drawing 
     <lb/>from the bosom of the deep the inexhaustible 
     <lb/>treasures which will be a perennial source of 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     wealth and prosperity to that country ; more<lb break="no"/>over, such a life tends to form men to brave 
     <lb/>
     the dangers of the sea, and, in case of need, 
     <lb/>
     these hardy seamen would be ready and will<lb break="no"/>ing to lend their aid and do their part in the 
     <lb/>
     defence of the country. Nor is this all ; the 
     <lb/>
     country exports prodigious quantities of tim<lb break="no"/>ber of all kinds, which will not be exhausted 
     <lb/>
     for ages to come. Every year they build a 
     <lb/>
     great number ot ships, and, in proportion, to 
     <lb/>
     its population, Nova Scotia has a larger amount 
     <lb/>
     of " tonnage" than any other country in the 
     <lb/>
     whole world. (Hear, hear.) Another source 
     <lb/>
     of wealth is possessed by that country, ever 
     <lb/>
     abounding, never failing. One would say 
     <lb/>
     that nature has especially favored it and en<lb break="no"/>dowed it with the most bountiful of her gifts 
     <lb/>
     —I mean the rich mines of coal which super<lb break="no"/>abound in that country, which the hand of 
     <lb/>
     Providence has placed, as if by express de<lb break="no"/>sign, not in the interior of the country, but 
     <lb/>
     along the sea side. Everybody knows that 
     <lb/>
     coal at the present day, when steam does 
     <lb/>
     so much that the hand of man formerly 
     <lb/>
    did, is one of the principal aliments which 
     <lb/>nourish the industry of mankind through<lb break="no"/>out the civilised world. Situated on the 
     <lb/>shores of the Atlantic, these mines can be 
     <lb/>worked very cheaply, and are easily acces<lb break="no"/>sible to ships of all nations. The charges 
     <lb/>of loading are small indeed, there is scarcely 
     <lb/>any land carriage required to convey it to the 
     <lb/>bays and ports to which the different trading 
     <lb/>ships resort for their lading. Geologists 
     <lb/>celebrated for their knowledge have explored 
     <lb/>these regions, and declare that there are 
     <lb/>thousands of square miles of coal, and in 
     <lb/>some places seventy-six beds or layers of coal 
     <lb/>one above the other. What a fertile source of 
     <lb/>revenue, of wealth ! And when we reflect that 
     <lb/>the main source of the prosperity of England 
     <lb/>has been and still is her mines of coal, small 
     <lb/>in comparison with those of Nova Scotia, we 
     <lb/>shall find that no change of circumstances, 
     <lb/>no political ties or relations could ever prevent 
     <lb/>that province from possessing in it coal 
     <lb/>measures, a source, an element of wealth, in<lb break="no"/>comparably greater than the famous gold and 
     <lb/>silver mines of Peru. Thousands of years 
     <lb/>must pass away, no doubt, before they will be 
     <lb/>exhausted. I say nothing of the mines of 
     <lb/>gold, silver and copper, with which the 
     <lb/>country seems to be covered. And now, am 
     <lb/>I to be told that Canada, having the benefit 
     <lb/>of free trade with such a country, is to be 
     <lb/>no better for it ? Does not everybody know 
     <lb/>that firewood is beginning to run short in the 
     <lb/>district of Montreal and elsewhere in Lower  
     <lb/>
      
    
            <pb n="832" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0832.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">832</fw>
           

     Canada, and that if we have no coal to 
     <lb/>
     take its place, the country people will in thirty 
     <lb/>
     years' time be obliged to abandon their farms 
     <lb/>
     for want of means to enable them to bear the 
     <lb/>
     cold of our long winters ? We shall obtain 
     <lb/>
      wood from a distance, some will tell you ; but 
     <lb/>
     thinking men know very well that firewood is 
     <lb/>
     not to be carried far without great expense, 
     <lb/>
     which must raise the price so as to put it 
     <lb/>
     beyond the reach of the great majority of con<lb break="no"/>sumers. Perhaps we shall find coal in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. No, says Sir WM. LOGAN, our 
     <lb/>
     learned geologist—impossible ; science tells us 
     <lb/>
     that it does not exist. (Hear, hear.) Now 
     <lb/>
     every man who has the least idea of public 
     <lb/>
     order, of political economy, must be well aware 
     <lb/>
     that a mere commercial union, a union for 
     <lb/>
     the levying of customs—a " Zollverein," in a 
     <lb/>
     word—would not suffice to create the well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     being and general prosperity of the five pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The Maritime Provinces are im<lb break="no"/>mensely important to us in a social, indus<lb break="no"/>trial, commercial, political, and especially a 
     <lb/>
     military point of view. New Brunswick has 
     <lb/>
     also considerable resources. Looking at the 
     <lb/>
     seasonableness, and the other points making 
     <lb/>
     for the union of the provinces, we must not 
     <lb/>
     omit to consider it in its relation to our means 
     <lb/>
     of defence. In this point of view, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land is of paramount importance. Casting a 
     <lb/>
     glance at it on the chart, we find it lying 
     <lb/>
     across the Gulf of St. Lawrence, commanding 
     <lb/>
     the two straits by which the trade of the 
     <lb/>
     countries surrounding the gulf and the river 
     <lb/>
     reaches the ocean. Let that island but fall 
     <lb/>
     into the hands of foreigners, the trade of Can<lb break="no"/>ada would in war time be as completely 
     <lb/>
     stopped as if the ice of winter had erected its 
     <lb/>
     permanent domicile in the middle of the gulf. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) These are the reasons which 
     <lb/>
     have led our statesmen to secure, by all possi<lb break="no"/>ble means, the alliance of that province, as 
     <lb/>
     they well understood that, that wanting, the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation would lose the benefit of all 
     <lb/>
     other advantages and would be in continual 
     <lb/>
     danger. The seaboard of Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     1,200 miles in length, and it possesses the 
     <lb/>
     finest harbours in the world, roadsteads which 
     <lb/>
     might shelter whole fleets. The main source 
     <lb/>
     of her wealth is her fisheries, in which more 
     <lb/>
     than 30,000 men are annually engaged—men 
     <lb/>
     accustomed to brave the waves of a tempestu<lb break="no"/>ous sea. Her trade in fish with foreign na<lb break="no"/>tions brings her in contact with nearly all the 
     <lb/>
     maritime countries of Europe, and with the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and yet she has at present 
     <lb/>
     scarcely any such connection with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     What is her position with relation to us at 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
       

     this moment ? Her merchants are forced to 
     <lb/>
     resort to the States to transact their business, 
     <lb/>
     for, in order to reach Montreal, they must 
     <lb/>
     pass through Halifax and Boston. The es<lb break="no"/>tablishment of a line of steamers between 
     <lb/>
     that island and Canada would be a great ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to both provinces ; for Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     possesses what we want and requires what we 
     <lb/>
     have. It appears that the Island buys from 
     <lb/>
     the United States to the amount of several 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars yearly, and exactly those 
     <lb/>
     articles which we are able to furnish ; and 
     <lb/>
     that the current of trade having taken its 
     <lb/>
     present direction, is owing to certain fiscal 
     <lb/>
     impediments to trade between the two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. With free trade, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would buy from Canada woollen stuffs, cutlery 
     <lb/>
     and hardware—everything, in short, which 
     <lb/>
     she requires. Under Confederation, the town 
     <lb/>
     of St. Johns, in Newfoundland, would be the 
     <lb/>
     most easterly sea-port of the union, and by 
     <lb/>
     making it a port of call for our transatlantic 
     <lb/>
     steamers, it would bring us within six days of 
     <lb/>
     the Mother Country As to Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, that also has its importance. Its 
     <lb/>
     revenue is well managed ; it is in a prosperous 
     <lb/>
     state, and has no debt ; on the contrary, it has 
     <lb/>
     a considerable reserve fund. Accordingly, 
     <lb/>
     now is the time to take a step in the right 
     <lb/>
     direction. This union of the provinces is a 
     <lb/>
     political necessity, and any delay would entail 
     <lb/>
     the danger of losing the opportunity alto<lb break="no"/>gether, which might never occur again. Can<lb break="no"/>ada, with her immense commerce, is indebted 
     <lb/>
     for her access to the seaboard during six 
     <lb/>
     months of the year to the tolerant good-will 
     <lb/>
     of a neighboring nation. If that permission 
     <lb/>
     were withdrawn, our merchants must import 
     <lb/>
    during the summer all the goods which they 
     <lb/>require in the year. This would, in the long 
     <lb/>run, he the loss of the consumer, because 
     <lb/>everything must, of course, be paid for at a 
     <lb/>higher rate. Finally—and this is the most 
     <lb/>important consideration of all for every one, 
     <lb/>and one which would of itself be sufficient to 
     <lb/>make us desire the union of the provinces—it 
     <lb/>would be the most effectual means of procuring 
     <lb/>the building of the Intercolonial Railway—a 
     <lb/>road which would open an uninterrupted line 
     <lb/>of communication between Sarnia and Halifax, 
     <lb/>thus connecting the two extremities of the 
     <lb/>Confederation. Three things are necessary, 
     <lb/>nay, indispensable, to the prosperity of a great 
     <lb/>empire—the personal element, the territorial, 
     <lb/>and the maritime element. In Canada we have 
     <lb/>the personal and the territorial elements ; the 
     <lb/>maritime element alone is wanting, and this we 
     <lb/>may obtain by the union of the provinces.

     (Hear, hear.) As to us, French-Canadians 
     <lb/>
     and Catholics, what have we to fear from Con<lb break="no"/>federation ? Our language, our rights and 
     <lb/>
     our privileges are guaranteed to us. Look 
     <lb/>
     at the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
     <lb/>
     Ireland ; does it not consist of three distinct 
     <lb/>
     nations, holding several religious creeds ? 
     <lb/>
     Those three nations have fought side by side 
     <lb/>
     on sea and land for ages, against the enemies 
     <lb/>
     of their country. What glorious victories, 
     <lb/>
     what noble deeds in arms have they achieved ! 
     <lb/>
     And the most perfect harmony exists among 
     <lb/>
     them. In England, are the Jews persecuted, 
     <lb/>
     deprived of their rights and privileges ? Are 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholics ? Is there not residing 
     <lb/>
     in the very capital of England a prince of 
     <lb/>
     the Romish Church—Cardinal WISEMAN ? 
     <lb/>
      And, Mr. SPEAKER, who would have believed 
     <lb/>
     the fact ?—the last census shows that the city 
     <lb/>
     of London contains 100,000 Catholics more 
     <lb/>
     than Rome itself—Rome the seat of the Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic Church ! And a greater number of 
     <lb/>
     Jews than there are in Judea or all Pales<lb break="no"/>tine ! (Hear, hear.) And yet all these peo<lb break="no"/>ple enjoy their respective rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges, and worship their Creator according to 
     <lb/>
     the traditions of their forefathers, unmolest<lb break="no"/>ed, undisturbed by any. (Cheers.) I now 
     <lb/>
     come to the plan of Confederation considered 
     <lb/>
     intrinsically. I shall not enter into a discus<lb break="no"/>sion of its details ; four members of the Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration have given us explanations of it 
     <lb/>
     which were so clear and lucid, that it is use<lb break="no"/>less to enter on the subject anew. There 
     <lb/>
     are, no doubt, certain points which are not 
     <lb/>
     all that we could desire ; there are certain 
     <lb/>
     articles which I should be disposed to reject 
     <lb/>
     if I were not aware that we are to look at 
     <lb/>
     the question from five different points of 
     <lb/>
     view, and not from one sectional point of 
     <lb/>
     view. I can conceive that the Conference con<lb break="no"/>sidered the plan as a compromise—a treaty in 
     <lb/>
     which the five provinces were the contracting 
     <lb/>
     parties ; that many concessions were found to 
     <lb/>
     be necessary, to satisfy the interests of indi<lb break="no"/>viduals or of localities ; that great conciliation 
     <lb/>
     was an important element, wit a strong 
     <lb/>
     wish, by great concessions on all sides, to 
     <lb/>
     carry forward an important negotiation, 
     <lb/>
     which in their absence would have utterly 
     <lb/>
     failed ! I am, moreover, convinced that the 
     <lb/>
     Ministers of Canada did everything in their 
     <lb/>
     power to promote and guard our general and 
     <lb/>
     local interests ; that their only aim was to 
     <lb/>
     make us a great and strong nation ; that the 
     <lb/>
     dominant idea in their minds was that " a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union," under the protection of 
     <lb/>
    England, would be for Canada a harbor of 
  

            <cb/>
           

     refuge from all storms, particularly that 
     <lb/>
     which now assails us, as well as conducive  
     <lb/>
     to advance the best interests and the pros<lb break="no"/>perity of all the provinces ; that this union 
     <lb/>
     would secure to us the continued enjoyment 
     <lb/>
     of our laws and institutions, of our liberties 
     <lb/>
     and our relations with the Mother Country, 
     <lb/>
     while it would facilitate the development of 
     <lb/>
     our national, social, commercial and politi<lb break="no"/>cal prosperity. If we do not adopt it as a 
     <lb/>
     whole, if we meddle with its clauses to make 
     <lb/>
     radical changes in it, the other contracting 
     <lb/>
     parties, justly offended, will reject it wholly, 
     <lb/>
     as they understand that we have no right to 
     <lb/>
     depart from its provisions without their 
     <lb/>
     consent ; or if following our example, the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces should also make changes 
     <lb/>
     in it, the whole plan would be so mutilated 
     <lb/>
     and disfigured, that it would become a 
     <lb/>
     mark for universal disapprobation, and all 
     <lb/>
     the labors of the Conference would be ren<lb break="no"/>dered useless and abortive. Moreover, if in 
     <lb/>
     the meantime the Maritime Provinces, tak<lb break="no"/>ing up again their old scheme of a union 
     <lb/>
     among themselves, should refuse to listen 
     <lb/>
     to any overtures we might make, we should, 
     <lb/>
     like madmen, have lost the golden op<lb break="no"/>portunity. Nothing would remain for us 
     <lb/>
     but annexation to the United States— 
     <lb/>
     an idea most abhorren' to my feelings, 
     <lb/>
     but one which is, perhaps, in reality, 
     <lb/>
     the cherished desire of the unreasoning 
     <lb/>
     opponents of the present measure. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     As a British subject, I find most pleasure in 
     <lb/>
     that article of the scheme which declares 
     <lb/>
     the Sovereign of Great Britain to be the 
     <lb/>
     head of the Executive. The monarchical 
     <lb/>
     element will predominate in the Constitution, 
     <lb/>
     and we shall thus escape that weakness 
     <lb/>
     which is inherent in the Constitution of the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring States. Their President, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, is no more than the fortunate 
     <lb/>
     chief of a party ; he can never be regarded 
     <lb/>
     as the father of his people ; his reign is but 
     <lb/>
     temporary ; he is, for four years, a kind of 
     <lb/>
     despot, with unlimited power and in mense 
     <lb/>
     patronage ; his favors fall on those only who 
     <lb/>
     have elected him, and who can elect him 
     <lb/>
     anew at the expiration of four years ; none 
     <lb/>
     feel the refreshing dews of his favors, save 
     <lb/>
     his party. Woe to the unlucky ones who 
     <lb/>
     have voted against him at his election ! For 
     <lb/>
     them there is no smile, no gracious accep<lb break="no"/>tance, no favors. Under the working of our 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, on the contrary, as the 
     <lb/>
     sovereign is permanent ("the King is dead— 
     <lb/>
     God save the King ! ") we have at all times 
     <lb/>
     in him a father, whose interest and whose 
  

            <pb n="834" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0834.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">834</fw>
        

     inclination it is to extend his protection 
     <lb/>
     equally over the cottage of the poor and over 
     <lb/>
     the palace of the rich, and to dispense equal 
     <lb/>
     justice to both. (Cheers.) Our Ministers 
     <lb/>
     will still be responsible to the people. In 
     <lb/>
     the States, the President is under no obliga<lb break="no"/>tion to consult his Cabinet, which is 
     <lb/>
     composed merely of the heads of depart<lb break="no"/>ments. In the scheme which now engages 
     <lb/>
     our attention, all matters of general interest, 
     <lb/>
     which are not left to be disposed of by the 
     <lb/>
     local legislatures, will be settled by the 
     <lb/>
     General or Central Government, and the 
     <lb/>
     disposal of local matters will belong to the 
     <lb/>
     local governments. Accordingly all neces<lb break="no"/>sary power has been assigned to the general 
     <lb/>
     as to the local legislatures ; and that source 
     <lb/>
     of weakness has been avoided which has 
     <lb/>
    been so frequent a cause of trouble in the 
     <lb/>neighboring States—the conflict of jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion and authority between single states and 
     <lb/>the Federal or Central authority. It is 
     <lb/>really astonishing to see the different means 
     <lb/>employed by the journals in the interest 
     <lb/>of the unreasoning opponents of the plan of 
     <lb/>Confederation. They utter cries of distress, 
     <lb/>amidst which the veil of party is easily seen 
     <lb/>through. According to their views, no good 
     <lb/>can come out of the system for either party in 
     <lb/>the commonwealth. " Think twice of what 
     <lb/>you are doing, you English Protestants of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada ! The Local Government will 
     <lb/>swallow you up," cries the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Montreal Witness</hi>. 
     <lb/>" Take care of yourselves, you French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians of the Catholic Church !" bellows the 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Montreal True Witness</hi> ; " if the plan of Con<lb break="no"/>federation is sanctioned by the Legislature, 
     <lb/>you will disappear like a dream : the hydra 
     <lb/>of the Central Government will poison you 
     <lb/>with its pestiferous breath." (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>And the other journals of the same party, 
     <lb/>inspired by the same spirit, open full cry on 
     <lb/>the plan of Confederation, as nothing less 
     <lb/>than a " political suicide !" Others there 
     <lb/>are—and some in the interest of the present 
     <lb/>Government—who have some misgivings, 
     <lb/>some doubts, touching the clauses relating 
     <lb/>to marriage and divorce. With respect to 
     <lb/>the provisions of the instrument which bears 
     <lb/>on these two important questions, they seem 
     <lb/>at first sight, I confess, a little alarming to 
     <lb/>Catholics—to us who have learned from the 
     <lb/>Church the indissolubility of the marriage 
     <lb/>bond, who look upon marriage not only as a 
     <lb/>civil contract, but " a sacrament." With 
     <lb/>reference to this subject, I answer that the 
     <lb/>system on which the new Constitution will 
     <lb/>be based is to be considered in the aspect 
  

            <cb/>
     

     which it bears to all the provinces. We are 
     <lb/>
     not all  Catholics. and the majority are Pro<lb break="no"/>testants. Again, if the control of matters 
     <lb/>
     connected with marriage and divorce had 
     <lb/>
    been assigned to the local governments, what 
     <lb/>would have been the fate of our co-religion<lb break="no"/>ists in Upper Canada, who are in a minority in 
     <lb/>that province ? Add to this, we have not 
     <lb/>in Canada at present any divorce law, and 
     <lb/>we need not apprehend that the Federal 
     <lb/>Government will impose one upon us. 
     <lb/>Nothing indicates that the proportion of 
     <lb/>Catholic members in the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>will not be about equal to what it is in the Par<lb break="no"/>liament of United Canada. Moreover, every<lb break="no"/>body is aware that it was by the help of the 
     <lb/>Protestants, who think as we do on this 
     <lb/>subject, that we have hitherto escaped the 
     <lb/>passing of a divorce law. Divorce is not 
     <lb/>looked upon with a favorable eye by all 
     <lb/>Protestants ; far from it, and we must hope 
     <lb/>that at no distant time that source of disorder 
     <lb/>and scandal of every species will be effaced 
     <lb/>from the parliamentary records of every 
     <lb/>Christian community. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>must bear in mind, also, that there are 
     <lb/>Catholics elsewhere besides in Lower and Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada ; they are to be found in all the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces, and what would be their 
     <lb/>position if these questions were left to the 
     <lb/>local legislatures ? The Catholics, there<lb break="no"/>fore, of both Upper and Lower Canada, as 
     <lb/>well as those of the Lower Provinces, are 
     <lb/>directly interested in the removal of these 
     <lb/>questions from the local legislatures. It 
     <lb/>seems to me that every man who studies 
     <lb/>this question in a Catholic point of view, 
     <lb/>as it stands in the five provinces, will find 
     <lb/>that the Conference was perfectly right in 
     <lb/>not leaving the question of divorce to the 
     <lb/>control of the local governments. I shall 
     <lb/>not enter into all the details of the plan of 
     <lb/>Confederation, inasmuch as hereafter each 
     <lb/>of its clauses will be discussed. I shall 
     <lb/>reserve, however, the right of adding a few 
     <lb/>words. I think, therefore, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>that every man who has the interests of his 
     <lb/>country at heart—every man who will take 
     <lb/>the pains to read history, the great teacher 
     <lb/>of kings and nations, will be convinced that 
     <lb/>situated as are the five provinces of British 
     <lb/>North America, separated, disunited, with no 
     <lb/>social, political or commercial ties to bind 
     <lb/>them together, but having tariffs calculated to 
     <lb/>injure each other, but no free interchange of 
     <lb/>commodities—without railways by which they 
     <lb/>might hold communication during the long 
     <lb/>winters, when the rivers are obstructed with

     ice, and taking into consideration the excep<lb break="no"/>tional position of Canada in respect of its near 
     <lb/>
     neighborhood to the United States, and the 
     <lb/>
     political troubles which have so long wounded 
     <lb/>
     it in its bosom—a Federal union of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces is our only harbor of refuge, and the 
     <lb/>
     only means of securing to the Provinces of 
     <lb/>
     British North America sure and durable pros<lb break="no"/>perity. (Hear, and cheers.) Now, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, we have seen that in ancient days, in the 
     <lb/>
     middle ages, and in modern times, states, 
     <lb/>
     provinces and kingdoms desirous of growing 
     <lb/>
    in strength, wealth and prosperity—desirous 
     <lb/>of acquiring power internally, and making 
     <lb/>themselves formidable to rivals abroad— 
     <lb/>desirous of means to repeal ambitious assail<lb break="no"/>ants and enterprising neighbors—combined 
     <lb/>together—formed confederations with a view 
     <lb/>to increase the general prosperity, and the 
     <lb/>means of a common defence and mutual pro<lb break="no"/>tection. We have seen that it was the surest, 
     <lb/>the most rational, and the most generally 
     <lb/>adopted plan in all ages ; and why should 
     <lb/>not we, profiting by the experience of 
     <lb/>others, do the same ? How long has union 
     <lb/>been a cause of weakness ? Is not England, 
     <lb/>united under one ruler, infinitely more 
     <lb/>powerful than in the days of the Heptarchy 
     <lb/>or Seven Kingdoms ? Are not the forty 
     <lb/>states which compose the Germanic Confed<lb break="no"/>eration stronger, more powerful, united, 
     <lb/>than they would be if isolated and separate ? 
     <lb/>Would each individual state, if alone, left to 
     <lb/>its own resources, without free trade, with its 
     <lb/>neighbors, without social, political or com<lb break="no"/>mercial relations, be richer, more prosperous 
     <lb/>than it is now, joined, united and allied to 
     <lb/>the rest ? And in the United Kingdom of 
     <lb/>Great Britain, where a kind of Federal 
     <lb/>union is found, is not each nationality, every 
     <lb/>sect and every religion fully and entirely 
     <lb/>protected and guarded from the attacks of 
     <lb/>bigotry and of political and religious intoler<lb break="no"/>ance ? After the States had separated from 
     <lb/>England in 1775, would they have done better 
     <lb/>to remain in the position of thirteen colonies 
     <lb/>detached from each other, without social, 
     <lb/>commercial, or political relations, as the 
     <lb/>colonies of British North America now are, 
     <lb/>than to form a compact as they did ? Is it 
     <lb/>not from that union that their strength has 
     <lb/>grown, that they have become so powerful, 
     <lb/>so rich, so independent of the rest of the 
     <lb/>world, and the admiration of modern times ? 
     <lb/>So would they have continued to advance 
     <lb/>too, with giant strides, in the path of 
     <lb/>progress and improvement, if the demon 
     <lb/>of civil war had not arisen to break up a 
 

            <cb/>
    

     union but lately so happy and so pros<lb break="no"/>perous ! Let us avail ourselves of the 
     <lb/>
     example of others, and of the auspicious 
     <lb/>
     circumstances which seem to have occurred 
     <lb/>
     expressly and opportunely for our benefit, 
     <lb/>
     and let us resolve to become a great empire. 
     <lb/>
     Is it not asserted that, if a union of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be effected, we should be, at 
     <lb/>
     the least, the fourth maritime power in the 
     <lb/>
     world ? Are there not kingdoms—confeder<lb break="no"/>ations—in Europe which would be numeri<lb break="no"/>cally inferior to us ? Belgium has no more 
     <lb/>
     than 4,500,000 of inhabitants ; Denmark, 
     <lb/>
     including the Duchies, no more than 
     <lb/>
     2,500,000 ; the Kingdom of Bavaria, 4,500,<lb break="no"/>000 ; the Kingdom of Greece, 1,000,000 
     <lb/>
     the States of the Church, 3,000,000 ; Por<lb break="no"/>tugal, 3,500,000 ; Sweden, 3,500,000 ; Nor<lb break="no"/>way, 1,500,000 ; the Helvetic Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, 2,500,000 ; while the proposed Con<lb break="no"/>federation will soon contain 5,000,000 ; and 
     <lb/>
     yet these provinces are but in their infancy, 
     <lb/>
     we may say. Any one who has the slightest 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of the natural riches and the 
     <lb/>
     resources of the five provinces, and of the 
     <lb/>
     energy and love of labor which characterise 
     <lb/>
     the different races which people them, may 
     <lb/>
     safely predict a brilliant future for our new 
     <lb/>
     Confederacy. (Hear, hear.) Is there a 
     <lb/>
     single Canadian who does not know that 
     <lb/>
     Canada will always hold the first and most 
     <lb/>
     exalted position in the Confederacy ? Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, especially, will be the centre of the 
     <lb/>
     industrial arts and commerce, the point 
     <lb/>
     towards which all the rich produce of the 
     <lb/>
     west, and the oil, fish and coal of the east, 
     <lb/>
     will naturally be brought ; Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     especially, which is so rich in mines, ores, and 
     <lb/>
     minerals. Do we not know that certain great  
     <lb/>
     capitalists have recently formed companies 
     <lb/>
     on a vast scale, to work the rich gold and 
     <lb/>
     silver mines of the district of Beauce ? Do 
     <lb/>
     not the geologists, who have explored 
     <lb/>
     that region, tell us that it contains copper,  
     <lb/>
     silver and gold, scattered in rich abundance 
     <lb/>
     over hundreds of square miles. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     Canada possesses a territory of about 360,<lb break="no"/>000 square miles—160,000,000 of acres 
     <lb/>
     of land, of which 40,000,000 are con<lb break="no"/>ceded ; 11,000,000 are under cultivation. 
     <lb/>
     Canada possesses above 2,000 miles of rail<lb break="no"/>way, which intersect the province in all 
     <lb/>
     directions ; it has 4,500 miles of telegraph 
     <lb/>
     line; it possesses, moreover, 250 miles of 
     <lb/>
     canal, which carried, in 1863, 3,000,000 tons 
     <lb/>
     of freight, and gave a revenue to the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Government of nearly $400,000. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There are hundreds of 
  

            <pb n="836" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0836.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">836</fw>
    

     rivers in Canada, three of which, with 
     <lb/>
     their tributaries, water a surface of 150,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles. Five or six of the lakes cover 
     <lb/>
     a surface of 84,000 square miles. The 
     <lb/>
     mails are carried over 15,000 miles of road, 
     <lb/>
     in which distance there are 2,000 post offices, 
     <lb/>
     which annually distribute 11,000,000 of 
     <lb/>
     letters, besides newspapers. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The mineral wealth of Canada is almost 
     <lb/>
     fabulous, and awaits only the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of English and American capital to astonish 
     <lb/>
     the world. (Hear, hear.) The Acton copper 
     <lb/>
     mine, in Lower Canada, is perhaps the 
     <lb/>
     richest existing. The copper mines of Lake 
     <lb/>
     Superior are already famous for their extent 
     <lb/>
     and the richness of the ore ; and the iron 
     <lb/>
     mines of St. Maurice and Lake Superior are 
     <lb/>
     supposed to be inexhaustible. According 
     <lb/>
     to Sir WILLIAM LOGAN, our learned geolo<lb break="no"/>gist, there are iron mines of great value in 
     <lb/>
     the seigniory of Vaudreuil and on the out<lb break="no"/>skirts of the parish of St. Martha, in the 
     <lb/>
     county of Vaudreuil. The diggings in the 
     <lb/>
     auriferous river of the Chaudière and the 
     <lb/>
     Gilbert, in the Eastern Townships, have 
     <lb/>
     been very productive during the last two 
     <lb/>
     years. A new company has just been 
     <lb/>
     formed at New York, with a capital of five 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars, to work on the Chaudière. 
     <lb/>
     The capital stock of the companies and 
     <lb/>
     private persons now engaged in this pursuit 
     <lb/>
     is reckoned by millions. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trade 
     <lb/>
     Returns</hi> shew that the produce of the mine 
     <lb/>
    exported from Canada has been nearly nine- 
     <lb break="yes"/>hundred thousand dollars. The manufac<lb break="no"/>tures of Canada are extensive. Those of 
     <lb/>lumber occupy upwards of two thousand saw<lb break="no"/>mills, which turn out annually nearly eight 
     <lb/>million feet of timber. There are more 
     <lb/>than two hundred distilleries and breweries, 
     <lb/>which produced last year more than nine 
     <lb/>million gallons of spirituous or fermented 
     <lb/>liquors, yielding an excise duty of more 
     <lb/>than $700,000. (Hear, hear.) These dis<lb break="no"/>tilleries and breweries consume more 
     <lb/>than 1,500,000 bushels of grain and malt. 
     <lb/>The country contains at least 1,000 grist 
     <lb/>mills for the grinding of wheat and oats ; 
     <lb/>250 carriage factories, nearly 200 foundries, 
     <lb/>200 carding mills, 130 cloth mills, and 
     <lb/>500 tanneries. Other establishments of less 
     <lb/>account are innumerable. Canada produces 
     <lb/>annually between 25,000,000 and 30,000,000 
     <lb/>bushels of wheat, 12,000,000 bushels of peas, 
     <lb/>40,000,000 bushels of oats, more than 
     <lb/>1,500,000 tons of hay. 13,000,000 bushels of 
     <lb/>buckwheat, 28,000,000 bushels of potatoes, 
    

            <cb/>
         

     and 10,000,000 bushels of turnips. Canada 
     <lb/>
     consumes 30,000,000 pounds of beef, shears 
     <lb/>
     5,500,000 pounds of wool, and makes from 
     <lb/>
     42,000,000 to 45,000,000 pounds of butter. 
     <lb/>
     The cattle, milch cows, horses, sheep and 
     <lb/>
     pigs owned in Canada are above two millions 
     <lb/>
     in number. The fisheries yield to the value 
     <lb/>
     of two million dollars annually. It appears 
     <lb/>
     that Lower Canada alone owns 2,500 fishing 
     <lb/>
     vessels. The Magdalen Islands, which 
     <lb/>
     belong to Canada, send out to the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     270 boats. The capital stock of the banks 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, which have a charter, amounts to 
     <lb/>
     $33,000,000. Here is real wealth, and yet 
     <lb/>
     our country is still in its infancy, if I may 
     <lb/>
     be allowed to use the expression ; and the 
     <lb/>
     third part of this beautiful country is still 
     <lb/>
     uninhabited ; what will it be when inhabited, 
     <lb/>
     cleared and settled in every direction ? From 
     <lb/>
     all quarters men will come—some to obtain 
     <lb/>
     a neck of land which they can really call 
     <lb/>
     their own ; others to escape from the horrors 
     <lb/>
     of civil war and the ruinous taxes which bow 
     <lb/>
     them down to the earth. Here we have peace 
     <lb/>
     and tranquillity—good air—room enough— 
     <lb/>
     a superabundance of land—and the virgin 
     <lb/>
     forest wooing the axe of the woodman, to be 
     <lb/>
     converted into fertile farms ; here, above all, 
     <lb/>
     we have the " birth-right of man," liberty 
     <lb/>
     in all its purity. (Hear, hear ) It is time, 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, that we should withdraw from the 
     <lb/>
     political dilemma in which we are involved. 
     <lb/>
     If we reject the plan of Confederation, we fall 
     <lb/>
     back into a species of <hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi> ; now, for a 
     <lb/>
     new country like ours, to remain stationary is 
     <lb/>
     to retrogade ! Let us not forget that British 
     <lb/>
     North America contains other provinces 
     <lb/>
     besides these of ours, namely, British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia, Vancouver, &amp;c., which will hereafter 
     <lb/>
     form a part of the Confederation ; that those 
     <lb/>
     vast countries are in extent as large as all 
     <lb/>
     Europe ; that the soil in many places is of 
     <lb/>
     marvellous fertility ; that the day will come 
     <lb/>
    when the greater part of all those countries  
     <lb/>and provinces will be inhabited ; that there 
     <lb/>will be a net-work of railway connecting the 
     <lb/>extremities of all those possessions, and 
     <lb/>lines of steamboats connecting us, not with 
     <lb/>the Mother Country only, but with the 
     <lb/>whole of Europe, and that at all seasons of 
     <lb/>the year. When we all, without exception, 
     <lb/>animated by the same spirit, struggling after 
     <lb/>the good, after the prosperity of our common 
     <lb/>country, shall see rising around us a vast 
     <lb/>empire under the protectorate of England, 
     <lb/>we shall then understand the political saga<lb break="no"/>city of those who, now steering the vessel  
   

            <pb n="837" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0837.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">837</fw>
         

     of State, have brought before us and car<lb break="no"/>ried through the scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     proposed. There may be certain faults of 
     <lb/>
     detail in the system : I grant that there are. 
     <lb/>
     But does not every work of man bear the 
     <lb/>
     impress of imperfection ? Is the celebrated 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Code Napoléon</hi> perfect ? The most cele<lb break="no"/>brated French lawyers do not think it so ; and 
     <lb/>
     yet this production is a master-piece of 
     <lb/>
     legislation in many respects. Does not the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution of the United States contain 
     <lb/>
     faults ? and yet it is said to be a model 
     <lb/>
     work of its kind. I am of opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     plan of Confederation, taken as a whole, is 
     <lb/>
     the best we could desire or hope for, adapted, 
     <lb/>
     as it had to be, to the well-understood 
     <lb/>
     interests of the five provinces. To consider 
     <lb/>
     it from a purely sectional point of view, 
     <lb/>
     would be to misunderstand the position which 
     <lb/>
     a statesman should occupy. If however, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, the unreasoning opponents of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed measure were able to suggest any 
     <lb/>
     means of meeting eventualities, and point 
     <lb/>
     out a way by which, while rejecting the 
     <lb/>
     scheme proposed, we might find some prac<lb break="no"/>tical mode of escape from our difficulties, 
     <lb/>
     I should then be disposed to listen to them, 
     <lb/>
     and to compare their scheme with that 
     <lb/>
     which is now before us ; but those gentle<lb break="no"/>men think it sufficient to blame and criticise. 
     <lb/>
     The celebrated Mr. RAMEAU even (the 
     <lb/>
     author of <hi rendition="simple:italic">La France aux Colonies</hi>), from 
     <lb/>
     his retirement in distant France, sends forth 
     <lb/>
     a cry of alarm at the dangers with which 
     <lb/>
     he thinks Confederation is pregnant, but 
     <lb/>
     not a word of good counsel or of a better 
     <lb/>
     remedy of his own. Others cry aloud from 
     <lb/>
     the house-tops that this scheme is not a 
     <lb/>
     " Federal union," but a Legislative one in 
     <lb/>
     every point ! If it were so, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I should be the first—and I proclaim it 
     <lb/>
     here before the whole country—I should 
     <lb/>
     be the first to scout and reject the scheme 
     <lb/>
     with all the power which Providence has 
     <lb/>
     given me ; but as it is, on the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     a Federal union, in the full force of the 
     <lb/>
     term, having a Central Government invested 
     <lb/>
     with all the power necessary to obviate and 
     <lb/>
     remedy the weakness which characterises 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government in the American union, 
     <lb/>
     giving, in a special manner, to each province 
     <lb/>
     the management of its own local affairs, 
     <lb/>
     and to its inhabitants full and unrestricted 
     <lb/>
     power to make its own laws, I cannot, for 
     <lb/>
     the interest of my constituents, for my 
     <lb/>
     country's interest, help approving of a mea<lb break="no"/>sure which, while it respects the rights and 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     privileges of all, will have the effect of 
     <lb/>
     increasing the individual and collective 
     <lb/>
     strength of the five provinces, will secure to 
     <lb/>
     us the confidence of the Mother Country, 
     <lb/>
     and make of this section of British North 
     <lb/>
     America, under the powerful ægis of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, another <hi rendition="simple:italic">imperium in imperio</hi>. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
      I return to those whose cry is, " But our 
     <lb/>
     nationality will be lost ! Our language, our 
     <lb/>
     civil and religious institutions will disap<lb break="no"/>pear." O ye who cry so loudly, and who 
     <lb/>
     find such charms in the neighboring re<lb break="no"/>public, do you think that if we fell into 
     <lb/>
     that whirl of divers nations and different 
     <lb/>
     religions composing the American Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy, which have no common traditions nor 
     <lb/>
     common history with us, French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     nationality would long enjoy a separate 
     <lb/>
     existence, or that it would not speedily 
     <lb/>
     be lost amidst so many others ? Answer if 
     <lb/>
     you can, and I will believe you. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>Consider the fate of Louisiania, inhabited 
     <lb/>chiefly by French ! Is not the English 
     <lb/>element in a majority in the Parliament of 
     <lb/>United Canada ? And have I not, never<lb break="no"/>theless, the honor to address you at this 
     <lb/>moment in French ? in that beautiful lan<lb break="no"/>guage of our ancestors in which JACQUES 
     <lb/>CARTIER, in 1535, extolled the glories of 
     <lb/>our majestic St. Lawrence ! (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>Would you know one of the reasons assigned 
     <lb/>against General FRÉMONT when he was a 
     <lb/>candidate for the Presidency of the United 
     <lb/>States a few years ago ? " Do not vote for 
     <lb/>FRÉMONT," was the cry on the hustings and 
     <lb/>in the papers of the day ; " FRÉMONT is a 
     <lb/>Frenchman"—"FRÉMONT is a Catholic"— 
     <lb/>and FRÉMONT lost his election accordingly. 
     <lb/>However, FRÉMONT was not a Catholic ! but 
     <lb/>they said he was, and it was a crime suffi<lb break="no"/>cient in their eyes to disqualify him in his 
     <lb/>candidateship for their confidence, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing that they proclaim " liberty of con<lb break="no"/>science !" (Hear, hear.) Do they reject a 
     <lb/>man in England because he is a Catholic ? 
     <lb/>Does that fact debar him from enjoying the 
     <lb/>confidence of his Sovereign and his fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>citizens ? Certainly it does not, and there 
     <lb/>are instances to prove it. Have we not often 
     <lb/>seen, in Canada, Catholics representing coun<lb break="no"/>ties essentially Protestant ? Was not the 
     <lb/>county of Vaudreuil, a county in which 
     <lb/>Catholics are a majority, lately represented 
     <lb/>by an English Protestant ? Why should the 
     <lb/>English, under the Confederation, seek to 
     <lb/>destroy French-Canadian nationality? What 
     <lb/>interest could they serve in doing so ? In 
   

            <pb n="838" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0838.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">838</fw>
         

     1775, and in 1812, the French-Canadians, at 
     <lb/>
     the call of their clergy, rose as one man to 
     <lb/>
     defend the Crown of England. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     What interest have the English to induce 
     <lb/>
     them to sweep away our religious institu<lb break="no"/>tions ? In what school or college are youth 
     <lb/>
     educated with greater talent or greater 
     <lb/>
     success—where do they receive a more 
     <lb/>
     thorough classical education—than in our 
     <lb/>
     colleges ? Where does a young man 
     <lb/>
     learn his duty to God, to himself, to 
     <lb/>
     his country and to his Sovereign better 
     <lb/>
     than in our Catholic colleges ? (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     I passed ten years of my life, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     in a Catholic college, that of Montreal, and 
     <lb/>
     if I did not profit by the instruction I re<lb break="no"/>ceived, mine is the fault ; in that house, I 
     <lb/>
     heard none but the counsels of wisdom, saw 
     <lb/>
     only examples of virtue in the venerable 
     <lb/>
     priests who were intrusted with the care of 
     <lb/>
     my youth. (Cheers.) Where is better in<lb break="no"/>struction in agriculture to be had—agricul<lb break="no"/>ture, the source of the prosperity of a country 
     <lb/>
     —than in two or three Catholic colleges in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada ? Who has better appreciated 
     <lb/>
     the force of the maxim, " The soil is the 
     <lb/>
     country," than the Catholic clergy ? What 
     <lb/>
     are the model farms founded by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment compared with the model farms of two 
     <lb/>
     or three of our colleges ? (Hear, hear.) Is 
     <lb/>
     it the Catholic clergy themselves who would 
     <lb/>
     be endangered by the Confederation ? There 
     <lb/>
     is not a single right-thinking Englishman 
     <lb/>
     in the land who will not stand up and testify 
     <lb/>
     to the virtues of our clergy and their useful<lb break="no"/>ness in the country ! Wherever there is an 
     <lb/>
     asylum to be built, or a house of refuge for 
     <lb/>
     the poor, the insane, the aged or the orphan, 
     <lb/>
     then and there you see the clergy foremost 
     <lb/>
     in the work, first to set the example, and 
     <lb/>
     often defraying all the cost ! (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     If the Queen of England desires to see a 
     <lb/>
     faithful subject, on this side of the Atlantic, 
     <lb/>
     She will assuredly find him in the ranks of 
     <lb/>
     the clergy ! If the country calls for a zeal<lb break="no"/>ous citizen, animated by the noblest patriotism, 
     <lb/>
     the call will first be answered unmistakably 
     <lb/>
     by a priest—by one of those men who seek 
     <lb/>
     no other reward for their actions than the 
     <lb/>
     approbation of their own conscience—by one 
     <lb/>
     of those who perfectly comprehend the 
     <lb/>
     maxim that " the poetry of life is the fulfil<lb break="no"/>ment of duty"—by one of those wise but 
     <lb/>
     modest men, as humble as they are pious, 
     <lb/>
     who, standing ever constant at the post which 
     <lb/>
    Providence has assigned to them, instruct 
     <lb/>the young, encourage the good, seek to bring 
 

            <cb/>
       

     back the sinner into the paths of virtue, obey 
     <lb/>
     the laws and teach that obedience to others, 
     <lb/>
     pray daily for the happiness and prosperity 
     <lb/>
     of " Our Gracious Sovereign" and of the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, visit the poor in garret 
     <lb/>
     and cellar, soothe the sufferings, moral and 
     <lb/>
     physical, of the sick and dying, and finally 
     <lb/>
     point out the road to heaven—they them<lb break="no"/>selves leading the way ! (Prolonged cheers ) 
     <lb/>
     What have such men to fear from Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation ? Nothing. No, Mr. SPEAKER, such 
     <lb/>
     men have nothing to fear ! England loves 
     <lb/>
     and reveres our clergy, and sees in them 
     <lb/>
     loyal and faithful subjects of the Queen. 
     <lb/>
    (Cheers.) Would you see an instance of 
     <lb/>what the Catholic clergy can do when the 
     <lb/>country wants a man of courage ? All know 
     <lb/>that the country is in a political dilemma, 
     <lb/>that the machine of government is at a 
     <lb/>stand, that the sound of a mighty tempest 
     <lb/>is heard from afar ; that the fate of 
     <lb/>the country is traced out in feeble and 
     <lb/>wavering lines in an uncertain future, over<lb break="no"/>shadowed with threatening clouds filling a 
     <lb/>void of conjecture and doubt ; that the 
     <lb/>moment is come for the true friends of their 
     <lb/>country—for men of education—to declare 
     <lb/>their views on the course to be taken to save 
     <lb/>the country from the danger impending and 
     <lb/>the perils of actual events. Well, here too 
     <lb/>we have a member of the Catholic clergy 
     <lb/>boldly standing forth to give his opinion on 
     <lb/>the subject, and counsel us in this melan<lb break="no"/>choly crisis ! I will read to you an extract 
     <lb/>of the letter of the Catholic Archbishop 
     <lb/>CONNOLLY of Halifax, on the subject of 
     <lb/>Confederation :— 
     <lb/>

     Instead of cursing, like the boys in the up<lb break="no"/>turned boat and holding on until we are fairly 
     <lb/>
     on the brink of the cataract, we must at once 
     <lb/>
     begin to pray and strike out for the shore by all 
     <lb/>
     means, before we get too far down on the current. 
     <lb/>
     We must, at this most critical moment, invoke the 
     <lb/>
     Arbiter of nations for wisdom, and abandoning 
     <lb/>
     in time our perilous position, we must strike out 
     <lb/>
     boldly, and at some risk, for some rock on the 
     <lb/>
     nearest shore—some resting place of greater 
     <lb/>
     security. A cavalry raid visit from our 
     <lb/>
     Fenian friends through the plains of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the fertile valleys of New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, may cost more in a single week 
     <lb/>
     than Confederation for the next fifty years ; 
     <lb/>
     and if we are to believe you, where is the security, 
     <lb/>
     even at the present moment, against such a disas<lb break="no"/>ter ? Without the whole power of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country by land and sea, and the concentration in 
     <lb/>
     a single hand of all the strength of British Ame<lb break="no"/>rica, our condition is seen at a glance. Whenever 
     <lb/>
    the present difficulties will terminate—and who can

     tell the moment ?—we shall be at the mercy of 
     <lb/>
     our neighbors; and victorious or otherwise, the 
     <lb/>
    will be eminently a military people, and with all 
     <lb/>their apparent indifference about annexing this 
     <lb/>country, and all the friendly feelings that may be 
     <lb/>talked of, they will have the power to strike when 
     <lb/>they please, and this is precisely the kernel and 
     <lb/>the only touch-point of the whole question. No 
     <lb/>nation ever had the power of conquest that did 
     <lb/>not use it, or abuse it, at the very first favorable 
     <lb/>opportunity. All that is said of the magnanimity 
     <lb/>and forbearance of mighty nations can be explain<lb break="no"/>ed on the principle of sheer expediency, as the 
     <lb/>world knows. The whole face of Europe has 
     <lb/>been changed, and the dynasties of many hundred 
     <lb/>years have been swept away within our own time, 
     <lb/>on the principle of might alone—the oldest, the 
     <lb/>strongest, and as some would have it, the most 
     <lb/>sacred of titles. The thirteen original states 
     <lb/>of America, with all their professions of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>denial, have been all the time, by money power 
     <lb/>and by war, and by negotiation, extending their 
     <lb/>frontier until they more than quadrupled their ter<lb break="no"/>ritory within sixty years ; and believe it who may, 
     <lb/>are they now of their own accord to come to a 
     <lb/>full stop? No ; as long as they have the power, 
     <lb/>they must go onward: for it is the very nature 
     <lb/>of power to grip whatever is within its reach. It 
     <lb/>is not their hostile feelings, therefore, but it is 
     <lb/>their power, and only their power, I dread; and 
     <lb/>I now state it as my solemn conviction, that it 
     <lb/>becomes the duty of every British subject in these 
     <lb/>provinces to control that power, not by the insane 
     <lb/>policy of attacking or weakening them, but by 
     <lb/>strengthening ourselves—rising, with the whole 
     <lb/>of Britain at our back, to their level, and so, 
     <lb/>be prepared for any emergency. There is no 
     <lb/>sensible or unprejudiced man in the community 
     <lb/>who does not see that vigorous and timely pre<lb break="no"/>paration is the only possible means of saving us 
     <lb/>from the horrors of a war such as the world has 
     <lb/>never seen. To be fully prepared is the only 
     <lb/>practical argument that can have weight with a 
     <lb/>powerful enemy, and make him pause beforehand 
     <lb/>and count the cost. And as the sort of prepara<lb break="no"/>tion I speak of is utterly hopeless without the 
     <lb/>union of the provinces, so at a moment when 
     <lb/>public opinion is being formed on this vital point, 
     <lb/>as one deeply concerned, I feel it a duty to declare 
     <lb/>myself unequivocally in favor of Confederation as 
     <lb/>cheaply an as honorably obtained as possible— 
     <lb/>but Confederation at all hazards and at all 
     <lb/>reasonable sacrifices. After the most mature 
     <lb/>consideration, and all the arguments I have 
     <lb/>heard on both sides for the last month. these are 
     <lb/>my inmost convictions on the necessity and merits 
     <lb/>of a measure which alone, under Providence, can 
     <lb/>secure to us social order, peace, and rational 
     <lb/>liberty, and all the blessings we now enjoy under 
     <lb/>the mildest Government and the hallowed institu<lb break="no"/>tions of the freest and happiest country in the 
     <lb/>world.

     This letter is dated in January, 1865. The 
     <lb/>
    Catholic Bishop of the Island of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, Monseigneur MULLOGH, has also written 
    

            <cb/>
        

     a magnificent letter in favor of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, Mr. SPEAKER, when the time 
     <lb/>
     comes, our Catholic clergy—our Canadian 
     <lb/>
     clergy—will make their voices heard in favor 
     <lb/>
     of the preposed measure, and will show the 
     <lb/>
     whole world that now, as formerly, they can 
     <lb/>
     keep pace with the times—that they can 
     <lb/>
     distinguish the true from the false, and that 
     <lb/>
     their paternal eyes watch with the tenderest 
     <lb/>
     solicitude over the destinies of their children. 
     <lb/>
     (Loud cheers.) Now, Mr. SPEAKER, let us 
     <lb/>
     cast a glance over the English colonies in 
     <lb/>
     Australia. They, like us, are desirous of 
     <lb/>
     taking steps to form a Confederation, to 
     <lb/>
     break from their state of isolation, stretching 
     <lb/>
     forth their arms to each other as beloved 
     <lb/>
     sisters, and making efforts to lay the founda<lb break="no"/>tion of a great empire on the distant shoes 
     <lb/>
     of Oceania. (Hear, hear.) As to ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     let us show England that our hearts yearn 
     <lb/>
     to maintain our connection with her, and she 
     <lb/>
     will spend her last soldier and last shilling 
     <lb/>
     to keep and defend us against all the world, 
     <lb/>
     and to assist us to become a great and 
     <lb/>
     powerful nation Back ! back ! those who 
     <lb/>
     think that England will east us off, and leave 
     <lb/>
     us to our hard fate. Back ! all those who, 
     <lb/>
     like BRIGHT, CORDEN, GOLDWIN SMITH, 
     <lb/>
     and others of that school, weary the ear with 
     <lb/>
     crying that England loses more than she 
     <lb/>
    gains by her colonies ! They are confronted 
     <lb/>by the logic of facts. England, without her 
     <lb/>colonies, would be a power of the second 
     <lb/>class. Let us hear what Mr. LAING, late 
     <lb/>Minister of Finance for India, said, in answer 
     <lb/>to GOLDWIN SMITH and others :—

     I would have you observe, said he, that our for<lb break="no"/>eign possessions are by far our best customers. 
     <lb/>
     Taken together, they make up nearly a third of 
     <lb/>
     our import trade, and a half of our export trade. 
     <lb/>
     British India holds the first place on the list, and 
     <lb/>
     gives us nearly £50,000.000 sterling of imports, 
     <lb/>
     taking in return £20,000,000 of exports. In the 
     <lb/>
     present year these figures will be greatly exceeded, 
     <lb/>
     and the rate of progress is more distinctly 
     <lb/>
     marked : the imports having been, 10 years ago, 
     <lb/>
     £10,672,000 only, and the exports £9,920,000. 
     <lb/>
     We find in Australia still more astonishing re<lb break="no"/>sults, if we consider the recent date of her estab<lb break="no"/>lishment as a colony, and her limited population. 
     <lb/>
     Besides gold, she sends about £7,000,000 of im<lb break="no"/>ports, and takes from us £13,000. 00 of exports. 
     <lb/>
     The North American colonies, with a population 
     <lb/>
     also British, give us £8,00 ,000 of imports, and 
     <lb/>
     take from us nearly £5,000,00  of  xports. 
     <lb/>
     The small island of the Mauritius. which enjoys 
     <lb/>
     British Government and thrives with British capi<lb break="no"/>tal, sends us nearly £2,000, 00 worth per year, 
     <lb/>
     and takes in return £5,000,000. These figures 
     <lb/>
     clearly show the advantages derived to commerce

      from colonies, and confute the false theories of 
     <lb/>

     Observe, Mr. SPEAKER, that these enormous 
     <lb/>
     amounts are not in dollars, but pounds ster<lb break="no"/>ling : each pound being worth nearly five 
     <lb/>
     dollars of our money. This is information 
     <lb/>
     for those who think that colonies are of no 
     <lb/>
     importance to England ; that they add noth<lb break="no"/>ing to her grandeur, her power, or her com<lb break="no"/>merce ! Those who know anything at all 
     <lb/>
     of England, know perfectly well that she is 
     <lb/>
     an essentially commercial nation—perhaps 
     <lb/>
     the most commercial nation in the world— 
     <lb/>
     'that "that nation of shop-keepers," as it 
     <lb/>
     was called by NAPOLEON I., has always 
     <lb/>
     found in its commerce the chief element of 
     <lb/>
     its strength ; for with commerce comes 
     <lb/>
     money, from money men to carry on its 
     <lb/>
     wars. The ancient Romans knew how to 
     <lb/>
     conquer provinces, countries, kingdoms, be<lb break="no"/>cause their genius was essentially warlike ; 
     <lb/>
     but they did not know how to keep them, 
     <lb/>
     because they had not what chiefly distin<lb break="no"/>guishes England—a genius for commerce. 
     <lb/>
     Accordingly, when the English make them<lb break="no"/>selves masters of any territory, you imme<lb break="no"/>diately see a crowd of traders rush into it, 
     <lb/>
     build stores, find out the resources of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and next come a body of soldiers 
     <lb/>
     to second the authority of justice, and enforce 
     <lb/>
     respect for law and order. In a short space 
     <lb/>
     of time you see a nation, but lately barbarian, 
     <lb/>
     buried in sloth and inaction, shake off the 
     <lb/>
     slough of infancy, assume a different aspect, 
     <lb/>
     grow rich and prosperous, and in turn 
     <lb/>
     coöperate in adding to the greatness of the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country. (Hear, hear.) Yes, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, England is bound to keep us. 
     <lb/>
     Losing us, she would, at a future day, lose 
     <lb/>
     her West Indian possessions, and would enter 
     <lb/>
     on the first phase of an eclipse which she is 
     <lb/>
     too far-seeing not to anticipate and avoid. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) England sees with pleasure 
     <lb/>
     the efforts which our Government is making 
     <lb/>
     to carry out the union of all the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and looks upon our future union as a step in 
     <lb/>
     the right direction—the only practical 
     <lb/>
     means of increasing our resources and 
     <lb/>
     strengthening our power. One word, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, on the appeal to the people. 
     <lb/>
     There are three classes of men in society : 
     <lb/>
     those who deceive, those who are deceived, 
     <lb/>
     and those who are neither deceivers nor 
     <lb/>
     deceived. I take my place advisedly among 
     <lb/>
     the last. I will not rank as a deceiver ; and 
     <lb/>
     as I have promised my constituents that I 
    

            <cb/>
         

     would lay before them, and explain the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation. with all its details 
     <lb/>
     before giving my vote finally, I am at all 
     <lb/>
     times ready to do so. For the present, I 
     <lb/>
     shall vote purely and simply for the "reso<lb break="no"/>lutions," because I am in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     principle of Confederation, and because, 
     <lb/>
     hereafter, when the Ministry shall have laid 
     <lb/>
     before us the plan for the local governments 
     <lb/>
     with its details, then will be the time to 
     <lb/>
     demand an appeal to the people, if my county 
     <lb/>
     requires it of me. To ask for it only with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the principle of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and to ask for it again when we shall have 
     <lb/>
     the plan and all the details relating to the 
     <lb/>
     local governments, would be an absurdity ; 
     <lb/>
     for it would be a double appeal to the people 
     <lb/>
     on two parts of the same scheme of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, and consequently two elections on 
     <lb/>
     the back of each other—a needless excess of 
     <lb/>
     expense and trouble, both for the country 
     <lb/>
     and the members. We must bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     that after the two elections constituting the 
     <lb/>
     double appeal to the people, we must have 
     <lb/>
     still more general elections to inaugurate the 
     <lb/>
     new Parliament, for the present session is the 
     <lb/>
     third of this Parliament. I would not be 
     <lb/>
     one of the deceived ; and I should be so in 
     <lb/>
     a striking degree if I allowed myself to be 
     <lb/>
     cajoled by the gentle purrings of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, who make a show of agitation 
     <lb/>
     for the appeal to the people, only that they 
     <lb/>
     may have an opportunity, at any cost, of 
     <lb/>
     defeating the scheme of Confederation. I 
     <lb/>
     maintain, Mr. SPEAKER, that the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     have not the slightest wish to go to the 
     <lb/>
     country ; and why ? because if the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion had really and truly wished for an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people, they would at any time, 
     <lb/>
     within this last fortnight at least, have made 
     <lb/>
     a motion in this House expressive of their 
     <lb/>
     desire—as a preliminary—for such an 
     <lb/>
     appeal ! The House has been debating this 
     <lb/>
     measure three or four weeks, but the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition have not shewn the least disposition 
     <lb/>
     to move for an appeal to the people ; and, 
     <lb/>
     when it is too late, they will come forward 
     <lb/>
     with such a motion—(hear, hear)—and then, 
     <lb/>
     when they do not carry it, they would go 
     <lb/>
    crying throughout the land, in town and 
     <lb/>country, that if the people have had no 
     <lb/>voice in the business, it is no fault of 
     <lb/>theirs ; that they moved heaven and earth 
     <lb/>—but such was the bull-headed obstinacy 
     <lb/>of the Ministry, it was not to be obtained ; 
     <lb/>and the people will believe them ; and 
     <lb/>we, who are the real, the best friends of the 
     <lb/>people, we shall be pointed at as the real

     criminals ! Poor people ! why do you allow 
     <lb/>
     yourselves to be deceived ? If the Ministers 
     <lb/>
     are desirous of pushing on the measure, it 
     <lb/>
     is because of the check which the Ministry 
     <lb/>
     of New Brunswick have just had, and 
     <lb/>
     because it is for us to use all diligence to 
     <lb/>
     show the Mother Country that we do not 
     <lb/>
     hang fire, but are ready to do our part to 
     <lb/>
     carry out the treaty or compromise agreed 
     <lb/>
     on by the delegates at the Conference held 
     <lb/>
     at Quebec. It is time we should do some<lb break="no"/>thing to improve our position ; for the 
     <lb/>
     intended revocation of the treaty of recipro<lb break="no"/>city, the probable abolition of the " transit" 
     <lb/>
     system, and other tokens of ill-feeling with 
     <lb/>
     which President LINCOLN'S Message of the 
     <lb/>
     present year is filled, are enough to warn us 
     <lb/>
     to prepare to meet the storm which is 
     <lb/>
     blowing up on the political horizon, that we 
     <lb/>
     ought immediately to look out for better 
     <lb/>
     shelter than we have at present. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     If, hereafter, an appeal to the people, relative 
     <lb/>
     to the plan and details of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, becomes necessary, I am convinced 
     <lb/>
     that a majority of the counties of both 
     <lb/>
     Canadas will understand their true interests, 
     <lb/>
     will be able to distinguish their real friends 
     <lb/>
     from those who aim at deceiving them by 
     <lb/>
     flattering their prejudices, and that we shall 
     <lb/>
     be sent back to this place with full powers to 
     <lb/>
     vote the final adoption of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. (Cheers.) But if I, for 
     <lb/>
     one, am civilly told that I must stay at home, 
     <lb/>
     I shall have the satisfaction of saying that 
     <lb/>
     I have fallen like a man who preferred his 
     <lb/>
     duty to a fleeting popularity ; and although it 
     <lb/>
     may be an easy matter for the fair and 
     <lb/>
     intelligent county of Vaudreuil to send to 
     <lb/>
     this House, as its representative, a member 
     <lb/>
     more competent in many respects than I 
     <lb/>
     am, I venture to affirm that it will be difficult 
     <lb/>
     to find any one who has more at heart than 
     <lb/>
     I have the interests, the happiness and the 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of his country ! (Continued 
     <lb/>
     cheers ) I have abundant reason to believe 
     <lb/>
     that the people will comprehend the position 
     <lb/>
     of the country, will see that a measure of this 
     <lb/>
     kind is necessary—nay, indispensable, and 
     <lb/>
     that when once the union of the five provinces 
     <lb/>
     of British North America has been perfectly 
     <lb/>
     settled, we shall enter on a new era, an era 
     <lb/>
     of progress in all things—industrial, manu<lb break="no"/>facturing and commercial, and shall begin to 
     <lb/>
     take a prominent place among the nations of 
     <lb/>
     this vast continent ; the people will under<lb break="no"/>stand. finally, that the vessel of the state 
     <lb/>
     has fallen into the hands of able pilots, well 
     <lb/>
     qualified to take it into port, notwithstanding 


            <cb/>
       

     the storms and rocks with which its course 
     <lb/>
     is beset. ( Cheers.) I for one, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     have full confidence in our future in the 
     <lb/>
     bosom of Confederation. The day is, I think, 
     <lb/>
     not far distant when the " Good Genius" 
     <lb/>
     who rules over the future destiny of the new 
     <lb/>
     Empire of British North America will cry 
     <lb/>
     aloud, with one foot on the shores of the 
     <lb/>
     Pacific while the other rests on that of the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic—" All this is ours This wealth, 
     <lb/>
     these fair fields, those pretty hamlets, those 
     <lb/>
     vast cities, in which thousands of people 
     <lb/>
     enjoy the fruits of their toil, and live without 
     <lb/>
     fear under the English flag, belong to us ! 
     <lb/>
     See those factories, those works of all kinds, 
     <lb/>
     those canals and railways crossing each other 
     <lb/>
     in every direction, fostering trade throughout 
     <lb/>
     the length and breadth of this vast domain ! 
     <lb/>
     We are now a numerous and a mighty people— 
     <lb/>
     our population has grown—Europe has contri<lb break="no"/>buted its contingent of brave and courageous 
     <lb/>
     hearts, who have been attracted hither by 
     <lb/>
     the hope of an amount of happiness and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity which their native country had 
     <lb/>
     denied them." Then too, this "Good Genius," 
     <lb/>
     turning his eyes in the direction of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, will say with truth—" Mother, behold 
     <lb/>
     your eldest-born, worthy of such a parent !" 
     <lb/>
     (Cheers.) And posterity, glorying in their 
     <lb/>
     ancestors, will exclaim—" Behold the fruits 
     <lb/>
     of the conscientious and patriotic labors of 
     <lb/>
     that chosen band of thirty-three, who sat in 
     <lb/>

     population; with the permission of this hon<lb break="no"/>orable House, I will read for his benefit the 
     <lb/>
     letter of a Lower Canadian priest, who, having 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of a somewhat closer view of 
     <lb/>
     things than the bishops of the Maritime Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, is in a better position to judge whether 
     <lb/>
     our special institutions and our nationality 
     <lb/>
     will be sufficiently guaranteed under the 
     <lb/>
     Federal system now about to be imposed upon 
     <lb/>
     us. (Hear, hear.) This letter appeared in 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi> :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     To the Editor of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir—If the Confederation of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     may be considered a thing decided upon, there is 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless no denying the fact that the minds of 
     <lb/>
     the people are filled with a fear and anxiety which 
     <lb/>
     nothing can remove. I have read the speeches 
     <lb/>
     of our representatives ; I have heard their explan<lb break="no"/>ations ; and far from being reassured, I am more 
     <lb/>
     uneasy than ever. The necessity of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     has indeed been demonstrated, but has there 
     <lb/>
     been any attempt to explain certain clauses of a 
     <lb/>
     dangerous character in a French-Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     Catholic point of view ? Promises, eulogies, 
     <lb/>
     dazzling pictures of our future prospects, figures 
     <lb/>
     more or less successfully grouped,all these we have 
     <lb/>
    had <hi rendition="simple:italic">ad nauseam</hi> ; but what I have looked for in 
     <lb/>vain is a satisfactory explanation as to our future 
     <lb/>liberty of action under Confederation. With your 
     <lb/>permission, sir, 1 will state as briefly as pos<lb break="no"/>sible my objections to the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and the features which cause it to be 
     <lb/>dreaded so much by almost all those who have 
     <lb/>studied it. I leave aside the question of divorce ; 
     <lb/>the ecclesiastical authorities being silent upon the 
     <lb/>matter. I do not pretend to be more Catholic 
     <lb/>than the Pope. Let every one bear his own 
     <lb/>responsibility. When, at some future day, 
     <lb/>Catholic Lower Canada will be dishonored by 
     <lb/>the presence of a divorce court, every one will, 
     <lb/>no doubt hasten to wash his hands of the matter, 
     <lb/>and repudiate all responsibility for • • • • • the 
     <lb/>circumstances in which we are placed. My ob<lb break="no"/>jections to Confederation as proposed are— 
     <lb/>first, the dangerous centralization it establishes ; 
     <lb/>second, the enormous expense it entails. Cen<lb break="no"/>tralization ! Behold the great danger of modern 
     <lb/>governments. In place of endeavoring to confer 
     <lb/>on each of our provinces the greatest measure of 
     <lb/>liberty compatible with a central power, one 
     <lb/>would fancy that our Ministers had done their 
     <lb/>best to leave us but the very smallest measure 
     <lb/>possible. In endeavoring to avoid the excess of 
     <lb/>power vested in the states of the American Con<lb break="no"/>federation, they have given us a scheme tolerably 
     <lb/>closely copied from the Swiss Confederation. 
     <lb/>They wished to avoid state independence, which 
     <lb/>caused the war between the North and the South, 
     <lb/>and they expose us to a new Sonderbund with all 
     <lb/>its disasters. Let us see what are the powers of 
     <lb/>the Central Government, and the rights of the 
     <lb/>provinces, and of Lower Canada in particular, 
     <lb/>under our Confederation. The Central Govern<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
      
ment will be composed of—first, an elective 
     <lb/>
     Chamber, based on pepulation ; second, a Senate ; 
     <lb/>
     third, an Executive Council, and Responsible 
     <lb/>
     Ministers, and a Governor. The Lower House 
     <lb/>
     will be composed of 194 members. Of these 194 
     <lb/>
     sixty-five will be Lower Canadians, and fifty 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians. In the House of Representa<lb break="no"/>tives we shall therefore be one to three, or, if we 
     <lb/>
     count as French-Canadians, 1 to 4. How many 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadians or French-Canadians are we to 
     <lb/>
     have in the Executive Council ? One, perhaps ; 
     <lb/>
     two at most. Such is the measure of our influ<lb break="no"/>ence in the Central Government. And this is the 
     <lb/>
     Government that is to appoint our senators after 
     <lb/>
     the first selection is made. lt will appoint, or 
     <lb/>
     rather impose upon us, a governor. lt will have 
     <lb/>
     the power of veto over all our local measures. 
     <lb/>
     lt will also enjoy that power through the gov<lb break="no"/>ernor, its creature ! Was there ever a more 
     <lb/>
     dangerous centralization ? What liberty of 
     <lb/>
     action, then, is there left to our legislature? An 
     <lb/>
     Orangeman will perhaps be sent to govern 
     <lb/>
     us ; and what can we say ? Our senators will be 
     <lb/>
     selected, if it should please the central power, 
     <lb/>
     from the ranks of our enemies; to whom shall we 
     <lb/>
     apply for redress ? All our most cherished local 
     <lb/>
     measures, our acts of incorporation, will be re<lb break="no"/>served or vetoed ; and who will redress our 
     <lb/>
     grievances ? But all these are mere imaginary 
     <lb/>
     dangers ! Imaginary, forsooth ! Heaven grant 
     <lb/>
     that they may be ! But do we not know the Orange<lb break="no"/>men ? Is not the example of Ireland before our 
     <lb/>
     eyes ? But the Sonderbund war ! Be quiet, we 
     <lb/>
     are told ; men so well tried, so honorable as our 
     <lb/>
     leaders, would never propose the measure for our 
     <lb/>
     adoption if it could possibly be of a fatal charac<lb break="no"/>ter. 1 do not desire, in any way, to accuse our 
     <lb/>
     statesmen or to question their motives. But have 
     <lb/>
     our statesmen always avoided contradiction—dan<lb break="no"/>gerous measures ? Is it prudent to trust solely 
     <lb/>
     to men, without scrutinizing their measures ? 
     <lb/>
     What of the experience of the past ? What of 
     <lb/>
     the maxim, " Measures, not men ?" "Fear not," 
     <lb/>
     we are told again, "none of the dangers you fear 
     <lb/>
     can arise ; the thing is impossible." Impossible ! 
     <lb/>
     Why, then, leave a possibility of danger in the 
     <lb/>
     law ? Why so much haste with a measure of 
     <lb/>
     such importance ? The authors of the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the United States labored for months and 
     <lb/>
     years at the draft of their Confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     after eighty years it is found defective. Our 
     <lb/>
     statesmen elaborate a Constitution in a few days, 
     <lb/>
     in the midst of the noisy rejoicings of hospitality, 
     <lb/>
     and we are told that Constitution is perfect ! 
     <lb/>
     " You must not touch it; you shall not amend 
     <lb/>
     it." But, we say, it contains dangerous clauses, 
     <lb/>
     it gives our enemies power to annihilate us. 
     <lb/>
     The answer is : " Be silent ! It is the creation of 
     <lb/>
     our Ministers, our leaders ! Trust in their honor, 
     <lb/>
     in their talents." Excellent reasons, no doubt ! 
     <lb/>
     And yet, strange to say, people are still uneasy, 
     <lb/>
     still distrustful ! But, are not the clergy, are not 
     <lb/>
     the people for Confederation ? As to the clergy, 
     <lb/>
     no ; they are not all for your Confederation as it 
     <lb/>
     is proposed. A great many of them, it is true, 
     <lb/>
     feel no uneasiness, and trust all to our statesmen ; 
   

            <pb n="843" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0843.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">848</fw>
         

     but many of them, also, dread it, and would wish 
     <lb/>
     to see it amended. As to the people they know 
     <lb/>
     nothing about your scheme, and until the time 
     <lb/>
     comes when they shall undergo the ordeal of 
     <lb/>
     taxæ and imposts, they will, I fancy. exhibit the 
     <lb/>
     utmost indifference. But let the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     be carried out. let the fabulous expenses be com<lb break="no"/>menced connected with the defence of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, the support of a militia. the creation of a 
     <lb/>
     marine, the construction of the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway and other public works, and, as the pro<lb break="no"/>verb save, " Time will tell." Yes, we shall then 
     <lb/>
     perceive the disastrous results of this measure, 
     <lb/>
     but it will be a little too late. I now come to 
     <lb/>
     my second objection to the scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. With your permission I shall treat it on a 
     <lb/>
     future occasion. A CITIZEN.

     Well, Mr. SPEAKER, if I am not mistaken,

     that reverenrl gentleman, a member of our

     <lb/>
     than our Ministers and the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Vaudreuil of the safety of our religious 
     <lb/>
     interests, and of our nationality. Are not his 
     <lb/>
     expressions sufficiently energetic and signifi<lb break="no"/>cant. But let us now see whether the rever<lb break="no"/>end gentleman has grounds for his alarm, and 
     <lb/>
     whether he is not somewhat carried away by 
     <lb/>
     his seal and patriotic anxiety for the welfare 
     <lb/>
     of his fellow-countrymen. Let ussee whether, 
     <lb/>
     on the contrary, he does not appreciate more 
     <lb/>
     correctly than our LoWer Canada Ministers 
     <lb/>
     the position in which we shall be placed by 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. I think we shall be enabled 
     <lb/>
     to judge from an article which appeared in a 
     <lb/>
     late number of the organ of the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council. The Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>

     of the 6th March inst.,—a paper which is now 
     <lb/>
     one of the principal organs of the present 
     <lb/>
     Government—publiera an article, written 
     <lb/>
     perhaps by the Honorable President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council himself, in which I find the following 
     <lb/>
     kindly expression applied to our honored 
     <lb/>
     clergy :— °

     We trust that those well-meaning but mistaken 
     <lb/>
     friends of the Common School system of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, who have been censuring the educational 
     <lb/>

     it is never safe to say that tile Romish bishops in

    If the honorable gentleman is not satisfied 
     <lb/>new that the fears of the clergy are well 
     <lb/>founded, I really cannot see how he can 
     <lb/>sibly be convinced. (Hear, hear.) That 
     <lb/>honorable member gave-us a splendid and 
     <lb/>perfectly just eulogium of the admirable merits 
     <lb/>and devotedness of our Lower Canadian clergy 
     <lb/>--an eulogium which expresses the thought 
     <lb/>of every man who has any feeling of admiration 
     <lb/>for deserving merit, wherever it may be found, 
     <lb/>and whatever may be his own nationality or 
     <lb/>religion—an eulogium which I endorse with 
     <lb/>my whole heart. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, I am not the less convinced that 
     <lb/>everything foreshadowed by the extract I have 
     <lb/>just read from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> is destined to occur 
     <lb/>one day, if we adopt the measure now before 
     <lb/>us. And what is the meaning of the petitions 
     <lb/>pouring in every day by thousands, why all 
     <lb/>these crosses aflixed to these energetic and 
     <lb/>patriotic protests—crosses formed by rude 
     <lb/>hands guided by noble hearts? Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>I will tell you, Mr. SPEAKER, why there are 
     <lb/>so many crosses; it is because, previous to 
     <lb/>the union of the Cnnadas, the Legislative 
     <lb/>Council was composed of enemies of the Lower 
     <lb/>Canadians, who refused, for a great number of 
     <lb/>years, to make even the most paltry grants for 
     <lb/>our Lower Canada schools. Thanks to this 
     <lb/>tyrannical prescription, the schools were closed 
     <lb/>by hundreds, and the children of our people 
     <lb/>were unable to obtain the benefits of educa<lb break="no"/>tion, of which they would most certainly have 
     <lb/>availed themselves. Hence it is that the 
     <lb/>petitions pouring in upon us from all quarters, 
     <lb/>to protest against   about to be 
     <lb/>established, are in great part signed with 
     <lb/>crosses—crosses certainly of equal value with 
     <lb/>the magnificent signatures of certain honor<lb break="no"/>able members of this House, who has at<lb break="no"/>tempted to turn into ridicule the signatures of 
     <lb/>these petitions. At that period, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>the Canadian clergy were, as they are to-day, 
     <lb/>the leaders of the education movement, and 
     <lb/>the British oligarchy did all in its power to 
     <lb/>contract the limits of their noble work—the 
     <lb/>education of the children of the soil. Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) But thanks to the constant an ener<lb break="no"/>getic protests of patriotic men—thanks to the 
     <lb/>struggles they maintained for many a long 
     <lb/>year—struggles which culminated at last in 
     <lb/>open rebellion against the authority of Great 
     <lb/>Britain—we gained the liberties we now enjoy. 
     <lb/>And with reference to the rebellion, I think

     the Honorable Attoruey General East must 
     <lb/>
     remember that he himself was one of those 
     <lb/>
     who raised the flag of freedom at St. Charles, 
     <lb/>
     and donned the cap of liberty. At that 
     <lb/>
     period, Mr. SPEAKER. the Honorable Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General East did not shrink from open 
     <lb/>
     rebellion against the Crown, in order to secure 
     <lb/>
     what he considered the legitimate liberties of 
     <lb/>
     his fellow-citizens; to-day he does not shrink 
     <lb/>
     from a baronetcy, the reward of the treason 
     <lb/>
     he is prepared to consummate against his 
     <lb/>
     same follow—citizens. (Hear, hear.) I said 
     <lb/>
     a moment ago that French-Canadians had 
     <lb/>
     every reason to fear for the safety of their 
     <lb/>
     institutions under Confederation, and I will 
     <lb/>
     prove it by quoting a few passages from the 
     <lb/>
     celebrated report of Lord DURHAM—a report 
     <lb/>
     which has been used as a model by the 
     <lb/>
     Government in preparing their scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation—in fact the latter is copied 
     <lb/>
     almost word for word from that able sum<lb break="no"/>mary of the means to be adopted for the 
     <lb/>
     utter annihilation of French nationality in 
     <lb/>
     this country. (Hear, hear.) To those who 
     <lb/>
     may feel inclined to consider my fears un<lb break="no"/>founded, I have but one thing to say: you 
     <lb/>
     may rest assured that the English members 
     <lb/>
     will not allow themselves to be led by the 
     <lb/>
     few French-Canadian members of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government, and that they will strive con<lb break="no"/>scientiously, and in some sort naturally, to 
     <lb/>
     carry out the work initiated by Lord DUR<lb break="no"/>HAM, and carried on up to this day with a 
     <lb/>
     degree of skill and ability which, though de<lb break="no"/>feated in some instances, was none the less 
     <lb/>
     calculated to produce the results foreseen and 
     <lb/>
     desired by Great Britain. I will read to 
     <lb/>
     the House an extract from the report in ques<lb break="no"/>tion ; for it is good to remind the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of Lower Canada of these facts :—

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Never again will the British population toler<lb break="no"/>ate the authority of a House of Assembly in

            <p>
     Such, Mr. SPEAKER, are the expressions used 
     <lb/>
     by Lord DURHAM in his despatch to the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish Government; and I will sbow how faith<lb break="no"/>fully the plan has been carried out. It was 
     <lb/>
     begun by a union of the two Canadas, and it 
     <lb/>
     is to be continued by a Confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the Provinces of British North America, and 
     <lb/>
     consummated at last by a legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     under which the French race will be absorbed 
     <lb/>
     and annihilated for ever. (Hear, hear.) An 
     <lb/>
     honorable member who addressed the House 
     <lb/>
     during yesterday's sitting, told us that Con<lb break="no"/>federation would be the beginning of the 

<cb/>

end, and the destruction of the Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>dians. It would have been impossible to de<lb break="no"/>scribe more truly the position in which we 
     <lb/>shall find ourselves placed under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear, hear.) The honorable member 
     <lb/>for Vaudreuil (Mr. HARWOOD) said there 
     <lb/>were as many Catholics in London as there 
     <lb/>were in Rome itself, the centre of Catholicity. 
     <lb/>Well, what is the value of that assertion? 
     <lb/>Does it prove anything in favor of his argu<lb break="no"/>ment? How many members are there in 
     <lb/>the English Parliament to represent the Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics of Great Britain? If I am not mis<lb break="no"/>taken, I think there are but two or three. 
     <lb/>Now I ask what influence can the Catholic 
     <lb/>population have in that Parliament, and what 
     <lb/>power have they to protect their institu<lb break="no"/>tions and their liberties ? If the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Vaudreuil thinks he has brought 
     <lb/>forward an unanswerable argument, he is 
     <lb/>very much mistaken, for the argument 
     <lb/>turns entirely against him. (Hear, hear. ) 
     <lb/>The honorable member for Vaudreuil also 
     <lb/>brought forward, in favor of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, an argument which bears a cer<lb break="no"/>tain appearance of plausibleness and weight. 
     <lb/>He said that if we adopt Confederation, 
     <lb/>Lower Canada will enjoy the rich coal 
     <lb/>mines of New Brunswick. Does the honor<lb break="no"/>able member fancy that the coal is to be de<lb break="no"/>livered to us free of all cost and charges, and 
     <lb/>without our having to give anything in ex<lb break="no"/>change for it? (Hear, hear.) Really, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, it seems to me that when only 
     <lb/>such arguments as these are available in sup 
     <lb/>port of a case, it would be quite as well to 
     <lb/>say nothing about it. It may be that the 
     <lb/>praises profusely bestowed by the Honorable 
     <lb/>Attorney General East on the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Vaudreuil are well deserved. It 
     <lb/>may be that the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>thinks so; but for my part—I say it in all 
     <lb/>sincerity—I consider that the style of elo 
     <lb/>quence displayed here by the hon. member 
     <lb/>or Vaudreuil was better calculated to win 
     <lb/>the applause of a parish meeting; the hollow 
     <lb/>tinsel of that styl  of eloquence may take 
     <lb/>with a certain class of men, but I do not hes 
     <lb/>itate to assert that it is hardly the kind of   
     <lb/>speech suited to this House. What is re<lb break="no"/>quired here is a speech calculated to bring 
     <lb/>conviction to the minds of those who listen. 
     <lb/>No doubt the hon.membcr for Vaudreuil 
     <lb/>turned many pretty and elegant phrases, but 
     <lb/>for all that, I cannot help thinking that the 
     <lb/>Honorable Attorney General's compliments 
     <lb/>were somewhat extravagant, and that he only 
     <lb/>spoke as he did in order to remove the im<lb break="no"/>

     pression of the contempt he affects to enter<lb break="no"/>tains for his fellow-countrymen holding seats 
     <lb/>
     in this House, who hold opinions different 
     <lb/>
     from his, and for all the French speeches de<lb break="no"/>livered on this side of the House since he 
     <lb/>
     brought down his Confederation scheme. Af<lb break="no"/>ter all, the Honorable Attorney General has 
     <lb/>
     a perfect right to pay compliments to any one 
     <lb/>
     he likes, and whenever he likes ; and in mak<lb break="no"/>ing these remarks I do not complain of his 
     <lb/>
     having formed that opinion of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Vaudreuil. The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber also told us that the Government had 
     <lb/>
     done everything in their power, and that they 
     <lb/>
     had examined the question of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     from the stand-point of the five parties to the 
     <lb/>
     contract. I think so too, and I do not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate to say that if our French-Canadian Min<lb break="no"/>isters present at the Conference had exam<lb break="no"/>ined the question from a Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     point of view—since they were charged with 
     <lb/>
     the protection of our interests—it is highly 
     <lb/>
     probable that many things unfavorable to 
     <lb/>
     those interests, which the scheme now pre<lb break="no"/>sents, would have been removed. But the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Vaudreuil must know 
     <lb/>
     that the Lower Canadian Ministers at the 
     <lb/>
     Conference ought to have gone there to re<lb break="no"/>present the interests of their fellow-country<lb break="no"/>men, and to defend those interests if neces<lb break="no"/>sary, in the same way that the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the other nationalities went there to repre<lb break="no"/>sent those of their fellow-countrymen ; and the 
     <lb/>
     event shows but too clearly how strenuously 
     <lb/>
     the latter worked for their own interests. 
     <lb/>
     The scheme of Confederation shows clearly 
     <lb/>
     that the English race have in this, as in every 
     <lb/>
     other instance, been favored, to the detriment 
     <lb/>
     of the French element. They obtained every<lb break="no"/>thing, or nearly everything, they desired.

     It being six o'clock, the Speaker left the

            <p>
     After the recess,

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAFR1">HON. MR. LAFRAMBOISE</persName> resumed his 
     <lb/>
     remarks as follows—Mr. SPEAKER, as a pre<lb break="no"/>lude to the remarks I proposed making against 
     <lb/>
     Confederation during the first part of this 
     <lb/>
     sitting, I answered some of the arguments 
     <lb/>
     brought forward by the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Vandreuil, in support of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     as proposed for the consideration of this 
     <lb/>
     House. I  shall now proceed to examine 
     <lb/>
     certain portions of the scheme, and show the 
     <lb/>
     absurdity of the arguments brought forward 
     <lb/>
     in support of it. It has been stated by honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen opposite that Confederation is 
     <lb/>
     a compromise. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, what 
     <lb/>
     is the meaning of the word " compromise" ? 
 

            <cb/>
         

     It means an understanding arrived at by 
     <lb/>
     means of mutual concessions ; and in the case 
     <lb/>
     now before us, I find concessions made only on 
     <lb/>
     one side and none whatever on the other. I 
     <lb/>
     find that the concessions have all been made 
     <lb/>
     by Lower Canada to Upper Canada : the con<lb break="no"/>cession of representation based upon popula<lb break="no"/>tion, the concession to the Federal Parliament 
     <lb/>
     of the right to legislate on marriage and 
     <lb/>
     divorce. Not a single concession to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. All the Lower Canadian members 
     <lb/>
     of the Administration have, in their turn, told 
     <lb/>
     us that Upper Canada has made concessions 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada, but not one of those honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen have pointed out a single 
     <lb/>
     instance of the kind. In looking over a 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet which has become celebrated for 
     <lb/>
     many reasons which I need  not enumerate— 
     <lb/>
     I mean the pamphlet of the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Montmorency—I find that Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada has made one concession to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The honorable gentleman says, 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the concession of represen<lb break="no"/>tation based upon population :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Every confederation is a compromise, and 
     <lb/>
     where would be the compromise if nothing were 
     <lb/>
     conceded by both sides ? The compromise made 
     <lb/>
     by Lower Canada is representation based upon 
     <lb/>
     population in the Lower House, and the compro<lb break="no"/>mise on the part of Upper Canada is the conces<lb break="no"/>sion of equality in the Upper House in exchange 
     <lb/>
     for representation based upon population in the 
     <lb/>
     Assembly. The same compromise occurs between 
     <lb/>
     the two Canadas and the Maritime Provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     it is based upon the same principle. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, the only concession the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montmorency has suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in shewing in favor of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding the eminent talents we all 
     <lb/>
     admit he possesses, and his well-known zeal 
     <lb/>
     for the Ministerial scheme, is that which I 
     <lb/>
     have just mentioned, and in my opinion it is 
     <lb/>
     no concession at all, since Lower Canada had 
     <lb/>
     and still has the right to claim an equal repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in both Houses of the Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     Let us now see what is the nature of the con<lb break="no"/>cessions made by Lower Canada to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. In the first place, I find this, the 
     <lb/>
     most important of all, and which by itself is 
     <lb/>
     worth all the rest—I mean the concession of 
     <lb/>
     representation based upon population. No 
     <lb/>
     one has forgotten the animated discussions 
     <lb/>
     which occurred, both in this House and else<lb break="no"/>where, relative to this question. What means 
     <lb/>
     were not employed and what efforts were not 
     <lb/>
     made by the Conservative party in order to 
     <lb/>
    make political capital out of that question, 
     <lb/> and what success have not this same party,

     who now concede representation based upon 
     <lb/>
    population, obtained in Lower Canada by 
     <lb/>loudly proclaiming that the Liberal party, 
     <lb/>or rather the "<hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge</hi> party," as they were 
     <lb/>pleased to style us, were ready to grant to 
     <lb/>the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>representation based upon population ? Well, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, the accusation made against 
     <lb/>the Liberal party,  of being prepared to grant 
     <lb/>to the Honorable President of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil his cherished measure, I shall leave to 
     <lb/>that hon. gentleman himself the task of 
     <lb/>answering. We heard him declare in this 
     <lb/>House that he had  offered the hon. member 
     <lb/>for Hochelaga to continue to work with him 
     <lb/>if he was willing to concede the principle of  
     <lb/>representation based upon population, and 
     <lb/>that that gentleman having refused to 
     <lb/>comply with the demand, he had accepted 
     <lb/>the alliance of the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>East, who gave him all he asked. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, there is some<lb break="no"/>thing still more important than that. A 
     <lb/>few days ago, the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>Council, addressing the hon. members for 
     <lb/>Hochelaga and Chateauguay, said, "I had 
     <lb/>long considered that you were the best 
     <lb/>friends of Upper Canada, but I can see to-day 
     <lb/>that your are not, and that our real friends 
     <lb/>are the Hon. Attorney  General for Lower 
     <lb/>Canada and his Lower Canada colleagues." 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) After having granted the favor<lb break="no"/>ite measure of the great  Clear Grit chief, the 
     <lb/>Lower Canada delegates doubtless considered 
     <lb/>that that was not sufficent, since they also 
     <lb/>made another important concession to Upper 
     <lb/>Canada and to the Protestants of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, by vesting in the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment the power of legislating on marriage 
     <lb/>and divorce—(hear, hear)—two questions 
     <lb/>upon which the French-Canadians were 
     <lb/>united by the bonds of a common faith, and 
     <lb/>on which they could not tolerate any discus<lb break="no"/>sion ; and the Ministers, therefore, ought 
     <lb/>not to have made those concessions, which 
     <lb/>are utterly opposed to the religious doctrines 
     <lb/>they themselves profess. I say that power 
     <lb/>has been given to the Federal Government 
     <lb/>to legislate on divorce and to legalize it, and 
     <lb/>I am not mistaken in saying it, for the 
     <lb/>principle is adopted by the fact or giving to 
     <lb/>the Federal Legislature the right of legislat<lb break="no"/>ing on this question. This power ought to 
     <lb/>have been granted to the local legislatures, 
     <lb/>and not to the Federal Legislature, as has 
     <lb/>been done ; and I shall prove it in this way : 
     <lb/>the other day, the Hon. Solicitor General 


            <cb/>
          

     for Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN)  
     <lb/>
     told us, that as regards Lower Canada, there 
     <lb/>
     was no necessity for granting to its legisla<lb break="no"/>ture the power of legislating on divorces, 
     <lb/>
     because, said he, " the religious authorities 
     <lb/>
     are recognized ; but it was necessary and 
     <lb/>
     proper to grant that power to Upper Canada." 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, I ask, if Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     did not require that power of legislating, 
     <lb/>
     why has it been given to the Federal Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, which will be composed in great 
     <lb/>
     majority of Protestants, who do not hold the 
     <lb/>
     same opinion that we do on these questions, 
     <lb/>
     when it is evident that that Legislature will 
     <lb/>
     probably grant bills of divorce to all persons 
     <lb/>
     who apply for them, without considering 
     <lb/>
     whether the parties are Catholics or Pro<lb break="no"/>testants ? If divorce is condemned by the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic religion, I maintain that it is 
     <lb/>
     wrong to grant that power to a Legislature 
     <lb/>
     which will be composed in great part of 
     <lb/>
     Protestant members, ready to legislate on 
     <lb/>
     divorce, and to grant divorces to those who 
     <lb/>
     bring forward what they may consider 
     <lb/>
     reasonable grounds, sufficient to entitle them 
     <lb/>
     to obtain divorce, without considering 
     <lb/>
     whether the religious faith of the parties 
     <lb/>
     permits or does not permit divorce. If 
     <lb/>
     divorce be condemned by the Catholic Church 
     <lb/>
     —and all the world knows that it is so 
     <lb/>
     condemned in the most formal manner—the 
     <lb/>
     power of the Legislature in this matter ought 
     <lb/>
     to have been restricted, and not made general, 
     <lb/>
     as it is proposed to make it in the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation submitted to us. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I have shown, I think, that Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     has gained nothing, but that she has con<lb break="no"/>ceded everything in this compromise ; true, 
     <lb/>
     in order to cover these guilty concessions, 
     <lb/>
     we are told, "But the protection of our 
     <lb/>
     institutions and the maintenance of our laws 
     <lb/>
     are fully and amply guaranteed to us by the 
     <lb/>
     new Constitution." In the first place, under 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation , our institutions will not be 
     <lb/>
     protected—as it has vainly been attempted to 
     <lb/>
     demonstrate they will ; but, even though 
     <lb/>
     it were the case, does not the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     under which we now live afford us infinitely 
     <lb/>
     better guarantees for all our dearest liberties ? 
     <lb/>
     Let us examine for a moment, what species 
     <lb/>
     of guarantee we have under the present 
     <lb/>
     system, and what guarantees we shall have 
     <lb/>
     under the Federal system.  The guarantee 
     <lb/>
     which the French-Canadians have under the 
     <lb/>
     present system, consists in the fact that out 
     <lb/>
     of 65 members, they count at least 51 of 
     <lb/>
     their own origin and faith, and that they 
   

            <pb n="847" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0847.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">847</fw>
    

     possess in the country and in the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     so powerful an influence, that the existence 
     <lb/>
     of any and every government depends on 
     <lb/>
     their good-will, and that no legislation can be 
     <lb/>
     carried on without their consent ; whereas, 
     <lb/>
     under the new Constitution, the General 
     <lb/>
     Legislature will be composed of 194 mem<lb break="no"/>bers, Lower Canada having 65, of whom 
     <lb/>
     14 at least will be English and Protest<lb break="no"/>ants, leaving thus 51 French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     or Catholic members. Now, even if these 
     <lb/>
     51 members act together as one man, 
     <lb/>
     they will have to struggle against 143 
     <lb/>
     members of a different origin and a dif<lb break="no"/>ferent faith from themselves. Thus, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I am convinced that the guaran<lb break="no"/>tees we enjoy under our present Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion—guarantees which are assured to us as 
     <lb/>
     long as we do not change our system of 
     <lb/>
     government—are infinitely superior to those 
     <lb/>
     offered to us by the new Constitution which 
     <lb/>
     it is sought to force upon the people. But 
     <lb/>
     we are told that the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     will have the Catholic minority to deal with, 
     <lb/>
     and that the assistance of the latter will be 
     <lb/>
     absolutely necessary to carrying it on. Well, 
     <lb/>
     I ask, Mr. SPEAKER, what can a minority 
     <lb/>
     composed of 51 members do against a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 143 ; and what protection can it 
     <lb/>
     offer to our laws, our institutions and our 
     <lb/>
     language ? No ; it is evident that all these 
     <lb/>
     things which we hold so dear may, under 
     <lb/>
     the Federal system, disappear and be anni<lb break="no"/>hilated at any moment ; they will be con<lb break="no"/>stantly at the mercy of our natural enemies. 
     <lb/>
     In order to secure Confederation, you have 
     <lb/>
     granted to Upper Canada representation 
     <lb/>
     based on population—a principle against 
     <lb/>
     which the people of Lower Canada have 
     <lb/>
     always voted as one man, and you have also 
     <lb/>
     granted everything that the Upper Canadian 
     <lb/>
     delegates desired to obtain for themselves 
     <lb/>
     and their co-religionists. It is quite natural 
     <lb/>
     that the English members in Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     should be nearly all in favor of the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     since they have a sure guarantee in the veto 
     <lb/>
     power of the Federal Legislature. Thus 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     cannot pass a single law without submitting 
     <lb/>
     it to the sanction of the Federal Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     which can, by its veto, amend, change or 
     <lb/>
     completely annul, if it thinks proper, any 
     <lb/>
     law or any measure so submitted to it. But 
     <lb/>
     what guarantee will the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>
     offer to the French-Canadian majority of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, and to the Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada ? None whatever. How 
     <lb/>
     can the great Conservative party which 
  

            <cb/>
          

     boasts so loudly of representing the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the Catholics of Lower Canada, which 
     <lb/>
     takes its stand as the natural protector of 
     <lb/>
     the religion and the faith of Catholics— (hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear)—very absurdly I must admit—how can 
     <lb/>
     that great party, I say, have forgotten, as it 
     <lb/>
     evidently has forgotten, that there are Catho<lb break="no"/>lics in Upper Canada who expected and 
     <lb/>
     are entitled to its protection ? How will the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority in Upper Canada be pro<lb break="no"/>tected in the Local Legislature of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, composed of Englishmen and 
     <lb/>
     Protestants ? Shall I tell you how, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER ? Well, they will be protected 
     <lb/>
     by two members only, the hon. members for 
     <lb/>
     Cornwall and Glengarry (Hon. Mr. J. S. MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD and Mr. DONALD A. MCDONALD). 
     <lb/>
     The great Conservative party, which styles 
     <lb/>
     itself the protector of Catholicism, has 
     <lb/>
     simply handed over the Catholic minority of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada to the tender mercies of their 
     <lb/>
     enemies. And to give an idea of the kind 
     <lb/>
     of protection they will enjoy under the new 
     <lb/>
     system, it is sufficient to state that a few 
     <lb/>
     days ago, Bishop LYNCH, of Toronto, was 
     <lb/>
     forced to address himself publicly, through 
     <lb/>
     the press, to the citizens of Toronto, to 
     <lb/>
     protest against the insults offercd in broad 
     <lb/>
     daylight, in the public streets of that city 
     <lb/>
     and elsewhere, to revered Sisters of 
     <lb/>
     Charity, and to ask protection for the vener<lb break="no"/>able ladies of that community ; and then 
     <lb/>
     look at the fanatical and intolerant writings, 
     <lb/>
     such as those I read to this Honorable House 
     <lb/>
     before the recess, from an article in the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> of the 6th March—a paper which 
     <lb/>
     represents the opinions of the present 
     <lb/>
     Government, and which is the organ and 
     <lb/>
     preperty of the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Executive Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN). 
     <lb/>
     Can it be said that we have nothing to fear, 
     <lb/>
     that the religious institutions of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada will be perfectly safe under the 
     <lb/>
     system sought to be introduced into the 
     <lb/>
     country ? Does not the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmorency admit, in his famous pamphlet 
     <lb/>
     of 1865, that our religious institutions have 
     <lb/>
     many a time been insulted in this House ? 
     <lb/>
     And has not the Bishop of Toronto just 
     <lb/>
     complained that Sisters of Charity have been 
     <lb/>
     insulted in the streets of the capital of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, and that they have been 
     <lb/>
     turned into ridicule at masquerades and 
     <lb/>
     masked balls, frequented by the best society 
     <lb/>
     of that locality ? And in order that every 
     <lb/>
     one may be convinced of the fact, I take 
     <lb/>
     the liberty of reading his letter, which is as 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     But even though many hon. members of this 
     <lb/>
     House doubted the truth of the statements 
     <lb/>
     made in that letter, is not the danger we 
     <lb/>
     shall incur, as Catholics, once we are placed 
     <lb/>
     at the mercy of our enemies, exemplified by 
     <lb/>
     facts which they cannot have forgotten ? I 
     <lb/>
     mean the numberless injuries and insults 
     <lb/>
     offered by an honorable member of this 
     <lb/>
     House to everything Catholics hold dear. 
     <lb/>
     Have we forgotten the infamous charges 
     <lb/>
     uttered by one of the friends and warm 
     <lb/>
     supporters of the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>
     Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN) on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     this House ? Well, I ask you now—you, 
     <lb/>
     the great Conservative party, the natural 
     <lb/>
     protectors of our religion and of its admirable 
     <lb/>
     institutions—what have you done to secure 
     <lb/>
     protection for the Catholics of Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada in the new Confederation ? Nothing 
     <lb/>
     whatever ! (Hear, hear.) But if Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada has obtained no new concession, and 
     <lb/>
     if her position is no better under the new 
     <lb/>
     system than under the present one, why are 
     <lb/>
     we to have Confederation ? I can answer 
     <lb/>
     the question, and, in fact, the answer is 
     <lb/>
     patent to every one : our Ministers had re<lb break="no"/>course to Confederation simply because it 
     <lb/>
     presented a pretext for clinging to office, 
     <lb/>
     and enjoying the sweets of power for a few 
     <lb/>
     years longer. That is the reason, and the 
     <lb/>
     one only reason, for their alliance with a 
     <lb/>
     man who despises them in his heart, and 
     <lb/>
     who joined them only because they advance 
     <lb/>
     his plans and ambitious designs. The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General for Lower Canada ex<lb break="no"/>plained to us the other evening the inten<lb break="no"/>tions of the Government. It sounded very 
     <lb/>
     well, no doubt ; but every one knows that the 
     <lb/>
     intentions of a government are not un<lb break="no"/>changable, that they may change them, and 
     <lb/>
     that they have, in fact, already done so. At 
     <lb/>
     the time of the formation of the present 
     <lb/>
     Ministry, did not the Lower Canada Min<lb break="no"/>isters tell their friends in this House, and 


            <cb/>
     

     was it not repeated in every shape by their 
     <lb/>
     newspapers, " Don't be uneasy, Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion will not be carried out." The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner of Public Works (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     CHAPAIS) did not deny having stated to 
     <lb/>
     a priest of this district, " that he must be 
     <lb/>
     quiet ; that there was nothing to fear ; that 
     <lb/>
     Confederation would not be carried out ; 
     <lb/>
     that the whole thing was done in order to 
     <lb/>
     entrap the great Clear Grit leader and to get 
     <lb/>
     rid of him for ever, and of the Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada Liberal party." (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     seems that our Lower Canadian Ministers did 
     <lb/>
     not take into account the pressure of the 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada members, nor that of the 
     <lb/>
     delegates from the Maritime Provinces, who, 
     <lb/>
     by combining together, obtained all the 
     <lb/>
     concessions they desired from the infinitesi<lb break="no"/>mal Lower Canadian minority representing us 
     <lb/>
     at the Conference of Quebec. They were 
     <lb/>
     told that Confederation must be carried out 
     <lb/>
     under such and such conditions ; and these 
     <lb/>
     brave patriots, in order to avoid losing their 
     <lb/>
     cherished ministerial places, did not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate to sacrifice their fellow-countrymen. 
     <lb/>
     They accepted all the conditions of the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant delegates, and now they are 
     <lb/>
     striving to induce the House, and particu<lb break="no"/>larly the Lower Canadian members of it, to 
     <lb/>
     ratify their shameful concessions. Unhap<lb break="no"/>pily for Lower Canada, I fear the House 
     <lb/>
     will vote for the destruction of French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian nationality in this province. There 
     <lb/>
     is one important point which must not be 
     <lb/>
     lost sight of, namely, that the great majority 
     <lb/>
     of the Upper Canadian members are in favor 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, because everything in it is 
     <lb/>
     entirely to their advantage ; but I cannot 
     <lb/>
     conceive how a majority of Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members can be in favor of the measure. 
     <lb/>
     True, many of these members are repudiated 
     <lb/>
     by their counties, and do not represent the 
     <lb/>
    opinions of the majority of their constituents 
     <lb/>on this question, and it is certain that many 
     <lb/>of those who will vote for this scheme will 
     <lb/>never have an opportunity of voting for the 
     <lb/>project, if an appeal be made to the people. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) With reference to divorce, I 
     <lb/>say that if the doctrines of the Catholic 
     <lb/>religion tell us that it is wrong and crim<lb break="no"/>inal to grant it, and that Catholics cannot 
     <lb/>accept it, it was the duty of our Ministers 
     <lb/>at the Conference to do all in their power to 
     <lb/>restrict it. True, it was not possible to pre<lb break="no"/>vent it in Upper Canada and in the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces, but it might have been 
     <lb/>done as regards Lower Canada ; and if it 
     <lb/>was deemed right to grant the power of 
 

            <pb n="849" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0849.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">849</fw>
           

     legislating on this question, it ought to 
     <lb/>
     have been given to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. But divorce was granted in this 
     <lb/>
     way because England had established a 
     <lb/>
     special tribunal for this matter, and Eng<lb break="no"/>land desired that divorce should be granted 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada as well as in every 
     <lb/>
     other province of British North America. 
     <lb/>
     Our Lower Canadian Ministers have simply 
     <lb/>
     yielded to the British influence which has 
     <lb/>
     been omnipotent in the Convention. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) They say " It is very true that the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic religion prohibits divorce, but vote 
     <lb/>
     in favor of its establishment ; for if you do 
     <lb/>
     not, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge</hi> party will return to power 
     <lb/>
     and destroy all your religious institutions, if 
     <lb/>
     you give them the control of the government 
     <lb/>
     of the country." Well, gentlemen upholders 
     <lb/>
     of religion, ought you not to use every means 
     <lb/>
     to prevent these dreadful <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouges</hi> from mak<lb break="no"/>ing use of the law, which you yourselves are 
     <lb/>
     about to establish, which will enable them to 
     <lb/>
     obtain divorce whenever they please, and 
     <lb/>
     thus to insult the dogmas and doctrines of 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic Church ? The Hon. Sol. Gen. 
     <lb/>
     East (Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN) gave us, the 
     <lb/>
     other night, what he pretended were satis<lb break="no"/>factory explanations—satisfactory to him, 
     <lb/>
    perhaps—on the law of divorce. Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER,  let us examine these wonderful 
     <lb/>explanations. That hon. gentleman told us 
     <lb/>that it was simply a law authorizing the de<lb break="no"/>claration that a marriage contracted in any 
     <lb/>of the confederated provinces, in accordance 
     <lb/>with the laws of the province in which it 
     <lb/>was contracted, should be deemed to be valid 
     <lb/>in Lower Canada in case the husband and, 
     <lb/>wife came to reside there. Well, I ask you, 
     <lb/> Mr. SPEAKER, if there was any necessity for 
     <lb/>making this provision in the new Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion ? Would not a marriage, under the 
     <lb/>present Constitution, contracted under the 
     <lb/>circumstances referred to by the Hon. Solicitor 
     <lb/>General for Lower Canada, be as valid as it 
     <lb/>would be under the Confederation ? Certainly 
     <lb/>it would ! Then what do the Government 
     <lb/>mean ? I am well aware that the Catholic 
     <lb/>members from Lower Canada will not admit it, 
     <lb/>and I know that they refused to believe me 
     <lb/>when I made the assertion, but I do not 
     <lb/>hesitate to repeat it here, that it is the 
     <lb/>intention of the Convention to legalize civil 
     <lb/>marriages. The Lower Canadian section of 
     <lb/>the Ministry has not ventured to admit it, 
     <lb/>because they well knew that they would 
     <lb/>draw down upon themselves the disapproba<lb break="no"/>tion of the clergy of the country, and of all 
     <lb/>their fellow-countrymen. If the power con<lb break="no"/>
    
            <cb/>
        

     ferred on the Federal Legislature in relation 
     <lb/>
     to this matter means anything at all, it is 
     <lb/>
     that and nothing else, and all the explana<lb break="no"/>tions given by the Hon. Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada and his colleagues are 
     <lb/>
     utterly valueless, and cannot be accepted by 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic members. Why say that divorce 
     <lb/>
     will be permitted ? If the existing law 
     <lb/>
     authorizes divorce now, it was quite unne<lb break="no"/>cessary to make a new law on the subject, 
     <lb/>
     and to make it an article of the new Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. The Government takes every means 
     <lb/>
     in its power to conceal the real intentions of 
     <lb/>
     the Conference on this important point of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, but I am firmly convinced that 
     <lb/>
     their object is perfectly understood, and the 
     <lb/>
     future will prove whether or not I am mis<lb break="no"/>taken when I assert that it is intended to 
     <lb/>
     make civil marriages legal in this country. 
     <lb/>
     One of the reasons—and the only one which 
     <lb/>
     I have been able to discover—for which the 
     <lb/>
     present Government has granted power to 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Legislature to decree divorce, is 
     <lb/>
     that the Protestants of Lower Canada would 
     <lb/>
     never, but for that provision, have given 
     <lb/>
     their support to the Confederation measure 
     <lb/>
     proposed by our Ministers. I am well aware 
     <lb/>
     that there are certain Protestant denomina<lb break="no"/>tions whose doctrines forbid divorce, but I 
     <lb/>
     do not hesitate to say that the only reason of 
     <lb/>
     the concession is the one I have just stated. 
     <lb/>
     Besides, in the pamphlet of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Montmorency, I find a very strong 
     <lb/>
     admission :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Catholic opinion urged that a question of such 
     <lb/>
     social importance should be left to the local 
     <lb/>
     governments, but let it be understood that in 
     <lb/>
     leaving it as regards Lower Canada to a Protest<lb break="no"/>ant majority, we only maintain the present condi<lb break="no"/>tion of that important question. By so referring 
     <lb/>
     it to the Federal Government, we avoid many 
     <lb/>
     causes of contention and many violent complaints 
     <lb/>
     which might eventually he listened to by the

     Mother Country, where divorce is legalized and 
     <lb/>
     operates as a social institution.

            <p>
     Who can say that the Protestants—who are in 
     <lb/>
     great majority in our present Parliament, and who 
     <lb/>
     will constitute the two-thirds of the Confederation 
     <lb/>

     The hon, member for Montmorency knows 
     <lb/>
     just as well as I do that the Protestants of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada would not have liked it, and 
     <lb/>
     that to obtain their support, it has been said 
     <lb/>
     to them, " Oh yes, let us concede that too ;

     <lb/>
     are justified in believing and in saying that 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Solicitor General for Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     has either renounced his former opinions on 
     <lb/>
     divorce, inasmuch as he authorizes the

     Federal Legislature to legislate on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, and to grant divorces either to Protest<lb break="no"/>ants or Catholics, and either to Upper or 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, or he could not have been 
     <lb/>
     very sincere in his opposition to the Benning 
     <lb/>
     Bill. (Hear, hear.) There is one certain 
     <lb/>
     fact, and that is that the Protestants of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada have said to the Government, 
     <lb/>
     " Pass a measure which shall guarantee to us 
     <lb/>
     the stability and protection of our educational 
     <lb/>
     system and of our religious institutions, and 
     <lb/>
     we will support your scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ; unless you do, we will never support 
     <lb/>
     you, because we do not wish to place our<lb break="no"/>selves at the mercy of a Local Legislature 
     <lb/>
     the three-fourths of the members of which 
     <lb/>
     will be Catholics." They were perfectly 
     <lb/>
     justifiable in acting as they did, although it 
     <lb/>
     is generally admitted that we Catholics have 
     <lb/>
     much more liberality than the Protestants— 
     <lb/>
     and this is to a certain extent proved by the 
     <lb/>
     fact that several of our Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     counties are represented by Protestants. 
     <lb/>
     I do not, however, Mr. SPEAKER, I do 
     <lb/>
     not wish to reproach the Protestant min<lb break="no"/>ority of Lower Canada for having pro<lb break="no"/>tected its own interests. I admit that in 
     <lb/>
     doing this they have only done their duty ; 
     <lb/>
     for who can say, after all, what ten years 
     <lb/>
     may bring forth ? Ten years hence ideas 
     <lb/>
     may be changed upon this question, and if 
     <lb/>
     it be true, as stated by the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>—and 
     <lb/>
     the Ministry cannot say that this journal 
     <lb/>
     does not speak the truth, as it is the organ 
     <lb/>
     of the present Government—if it be true 
     <lb/>
     that the Catholic clergy are an encroaching 
     <lb/>
     body, that they are never satisfied, and that 
     <lb/>
     they seek to take possession of all they see— 
     <lb/>
     if that be true, Mr. SPEAKER, who will say 
     <lb/>
     that in a few years the Lower Canadians will 
     <lb/>
     not be disposed to say to the Protestant 
   

            <cb/>
        

     minority, " We insist that all the schools 
     <lb/>
     should be Catholic," as the majority in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada has said to the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority there, many and many a time, and 
     <lb/>
     as it will before long say again if Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation takes place. (Hear, hear.) I need 
     <lb/>
     not say that I do not believe that the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics of this section will ever push 
     <lb/>
     intolerance to that extent ; but on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, I cannot but approve of the determin<lb break="no"/>ation of the Protestant minority to protect 
     <lb/>
     themselves from all eventualities of this 
     <lb/>
     nature ; and for the same reason, I say that 
     <lb/>
     we also ought to take every precaution, and 
     <lb/>
     that we ought not to suffer our dearest 
     <lb/>
     interests to be at the mercy of a Protestant 
     <lb/>
     majority in the Federal Legislature. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) We are not justified in asking for 
     <lb/>
     any concessions which we are not ourselves 
     <lb/>
     prepared to yield. (Hear, hear.) Before 
     <lb/>
     the House rose at six o'clock, I stated, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, that the plan of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     was, so to speak, traced word for word upon 
     <lb/>
     the famous report of Lord DURHAM. With 
     <lb/>
     the permission of the House, I will take the 
     <lb/>
     liberty of reading a few extracts from that 
     <lb/>
     report, in which the author, after having 
     <lb/>
     asserted a number of falsehoods in relation 
     <lb/>
     to our race, which I will not trouble the 
     <lb/>
     House with reading. declares that we ought 
     <lb/>
     to be merged into the English nationality. 
     <lb/>
     Observe how similar the ideas of the noble 
     <lb/>
     lord are to those which are expressed in 
     <lb/>
     the plan of Confederation. I cite for the 
     <lb/>
     second time the following paragraph :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Never again will the British population tolerate 
     <lb/>
     the authority of a House of Assembly in which 
     <lb/>
     the French shall possess, or even approximate 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Here, Mr. SPEAKER, we have a sentiment 
     <lb/>
     which shews that England has followed, 
     <lb/>
     step by step, the advice of Lord DURHAM. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for South Leeds said the 
     <lb/>
     other night that he hoped that we should 
     <lb/>
     soon attain to a legislative union. Well, a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union was also one of Lord DUR<lb break="no"/>HAM'S dreams. I proceed to read another

     extract from his report :—

     It will be acknowledged by every one who has

     <lb/>
     their superior knowledge, energy, enterprise and

            <p>
     A little further, Mr. SPEAKER, I read as 
     <lb/>
     follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     These general principles apply, however, only to 
     <lb/>
     those changes in the system of government which 
     <lb/>
     are required in order to rectify disorders common 
     <lb/>
     to all the North American colonies ; but they do 
     <lb/>
     not, in any degree, go to remove those evils in 
     <lb/>
     the present state of Lower Canada, which require 
     <lb/>
     the most immediate remedy. The fatal feud of 
     <lb/>
     origin, which is the cause of the most extensive 
     <lb/>
     mischief, would be aggravated at the present 
     <lb/>
     moment by any change which should give the 
     <lb/>
     majority more power than they have hitherto 
     <lb/>
     possessed. A plan, by which it is proposed to 
     <lb/>
     insure the tranquil government of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     must include in itself the means of putting an end 
     <lb/>
     to the agitation of national disputes in the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature by settling, at once and for ever, the 
     <lb/>
     national character of the province. I entertain 
     <lb/>
     no doubts as to the national character which must 
     <lb/>
     be given to Lower Canada—it must be that of 
     <lb/>
     the British Empire—that of the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     population of British America—that of the great 
     <lb/>
     race which must, in no long period of time, be 
     <lb/>
     predominant over the whole North American 
     <lb/>
     continent. Without effecting the change so 
     <lb/>
     rapidly or so roughly as to shock the feelings and 
     <lb/>
     trample on the welfare of the existing generation, 
     <lb/>
     it must henceforth be the first and steady purpose 
     <lb/>
     of the British Government to establish an English 
     <lb/>
     population, with English laws and language, in 
     <lb/>
     this province, and to trust its government to none 
     <lb/>
     but a decidedly English Legislature.

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     And further on I find what follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It may be said that this is a hard measure 
     <lb/>
     to a conquered people ; that the French were 
     <lb/>
     originally the whole, and still are the bulk, 
     <lb/>
     of the population of Lower Canada ; that the 
     <lb/>
     English are new comers, who have no right 
     <lb/>
     to demand the extinction of the nationality 
     <lb/>
     of a people, among whom commercial enterprise 
     <lb/>
     has drawn them. It may be said that if the 
     <lb/>
     French are not. so civilized, so energetic, or 
     <lb/>
    so money-making a race as that by which they  
     <lb/>are surrounded, they are an amiable, a virtuous 
     <lb/>and a contented people, possessing all the essen<lb break="no"/>tials of material comfort, and not to be despised 
     <lb/>or ill-used because they seek to enjoy what they 
     <lb/>have without emulating the spirit of accumula<lb break="no"/>tion which influences their neighbors. Their 
     <lb/>nationality is, after all, an inheritance, and they 
     <lb/>must not be too severely punished because they 
     <lb/>have dreamed of maintaining, on the distant banks 
     <lb/>of the St. Lawrence, and transmitting to their 
     <lb/>posterity the language, the manners and the insti<lb break="no"/>tutions of that great nation that, for two centuries, 
     <lb/>gave the tone of thought to the European conti<lb break="no"/>nent. if the disputes of the two races are 
     <lb/>irreconcilable, it may be urged that justice 
     <lb/>demands that the minority should be compelled 
 

            <cb/>
           

     to acquiesce in the supremacy of the ancient and 
     <lb/>
     most numerous occupants of the province, and not 
     <lb/>
     pretend to force their own institutions and cus<lb break="no"/>toms on the majority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But before deciding which of the two races is 
     <lb/>
     now to be placed in the ascendant, it is but 
     <lb/>
     prudent to enquire which of them must ultimately 
     <lb/>
     prevail ; for it is not wise to establish to-day that 
     <lb/>
     which must, after a hard struggle, be reversed to<lb break="no"/>morrow. The pretensions of the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians to the exclusive possession of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     would debar the yet larger English population of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada and the townships from access to 
     <lb/>
     the great natural channel of that trade which 
     <lb/>
     they alone have created and now carry on. The 
     <lb/>
     possession of the mouth of the St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     concerns not only those who happen to have 
     <lb/>
     made their settlements along the narrow line 
     <lb/>
     which borders it, but all who now dwell, or will 
     <lb/>
     hereafter dwell in the great basin of that river. 
     <lb/>
     For we must not look to the present alone. 
     <lb/>
     The question is, by what race is it likely 
     <lb/>
     that the wilderness which now covers the 
     <lb/>
    rich and ample regions surrounding the 
     <lb/>comparativel small and contracted districts in 
     <lb/>which the reach-Canadians are located, is 
     <lb/>eventually to be converted into a settled and 
     <lb/>flourishing country? If this is to be done in the 
     <lb/>British dominions as in the rest of North America, 
     <lb/>by some speedier process than the ordinary growth 
     <lb/>of population, it must be by immigration from 
     <lb/>the English Isles or from the United States—the 
     <lb/>countries which supply the only settlers that 
     <lb/>have entered, or will enter, the Canadas in any 
     <lb/>large numbers. This immigration can neither be 
     <lb/>debarred from a passage through Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>nor even be prevented from settling in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The whole interior of the British domin<lb break="no"/>ions must, ere long, be filled with an English 
     <lb/>population, every year rapidly increasing its 
     <lb/>numerical superiority over the French. Is it just 
     <lb/>that the prosperity of this great majority, and of 
     <lb/>this vast tract of country, should be forever, or 
     <lb/>even for a while, impede by the artificial bar 
     <lb/>which the backward laws and civilization of a 
     <lb/>part, and a part only, of Lower Canada, would 
     <lb/>place between them and the ocean? Is it to be 
     <lb/>supposed that such an English population will 
     <lb/>ever submit to such a sacrifice of its interests ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The French-Canadians, on the other hand, are 
     <lb/>
     but the remains of an ancient colonization, and  
     <lb/>
     are and ever must be, isolated in the midst of an 
     <lb/>
     Anglo-Saxon world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And is this French-Canadian nationality one 
     <lb/>
     which, for the good merely of that people,we ought 
     <lb/>
     to strive to perpetuate, even if it were possible ? 
     <lb/>
     I know of no national distinctions marking and 
     <lb/>continuing a more hopeless inferiority. The 
     <lb/>language, the laws, the character of the North 
     <lb/> American continent are English, and every race 
     <lb/>but the English (I apply this to all who speak 
     <lb/> the English language) appears there in a condi<lb break="no"/>tion of inferiority. It is to elevate them from 
     <lb/>that inferiority that I desire to give to the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians our English character.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    
   
    

            <p>
     There can hardly be conceived a nationality

     more destitute of all that can invigorate and 
     <lb/>
     elevate a people than that which is exhibited by 
     <lb/>
     the descendants of the French in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     owing to their retaining their peculiar language 
     <lb/>
     and manners. They are a people with no history 
     <lb/>
     and no literature. The literature of England is 
     <lb/>
     written in a language which is not theirs, and the 
     <lb/>
     only literature which their language renders 
     <lb/>
     familiar to them is that of a nation from which 
     <lb/>
     they have been separated by eighty years of a 
     <lb/>
     foreign rule, and still more by those changes 
     <lb/>
     which the revolution and its consequences have 
     <lb/>
     wrought in the whole political, moral and social 
     <lb/>
     state of France.

     which, from its first to its last page, breathes

     The plan of Confederation now submitted

     <lb/>
     by Lord DURHAM. Our Ministers have 
  

            <cb/>
       

     copied it, so to speak, word for word. Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM indicates all its essential points ; 
     <lb/>
     and if I cite his report, it is with the view 
     <lb/>
     of proving that the real author of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation, which it is sought to impose

     (Hear, hear.) I quote again from his

     The only power that can be effectual at once in

     obliterating the nationality of the French-Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, is that of the numerical majority of a loyal

     race without disorder or oppression, and with 
     <lb/>
     little more than the ordinary animosities of party

     the history of the State of Louisiana, the laws

     of its cession to the American union. And the

     Lord DURHAM was perfectly correct in sug<lb break="no"/>gesting the adoption of this policy. He did 
     <lb/>
     not wish to put his foot on our necks, but 
     <lb/>
     he advised that we should be made to dis<lb break="no"/>appear little by little under English influ<lb break="no"/>ence, and when we should be weak enough 
     <lb/>
     to be no longer dangerous, then that we 
     <lb/>
     should. have the <hi rendition="simple:italic">coup de grâce</hi>. As in

     <persName ref="pers:SCOB1">MR. SCOBLE</persName>—Will the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     permit me to observe to him, that it is only 
     <lb/>
     justice to the memory of that great states<lb break="no"/>man to say, that he wrote his report having 
     <lb/>
     only in view a legislative union, and that 
     <lb/>
     circumstances have changed since that day? 
     <lb/>
     Now we are only discussing a Confederation,

     and consequently Lord DUBHAM'S views do

     not apply to it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAFR1">HON. MR. LAFRAMBOISE</persName>—I think 
     <lb/>
     that the plan conceived by Lord DURHAM 
     <lb/>
     was that of a legislative union and a Con<lb break="no"/>federation of all the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. We are about to begin with 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, but we shall finish with a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union. Confederation, as has 
     <lb/>
     been well observed by that eminent states<lb break="no"/>man, is the first step to a legislative union. 
     <lb/>
     " Act with prudence," he says in his famous 
     <lb/>
     report to the British Government ; " we 
     <lb/>
     must not crush the French race too suddenly

     in these colonies; they might resist and give 
     <lb/>
     trouble, but make use of diplomacy, lavish 
     <lb/>
     honors and titles on their leading men, and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps you will succeed." I am convinced 
     <lb/>
     that we shall have a legislative union in a 
     <lb/>
     very few years if the plan of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     is adopted, and I am not the only one who 
     <lb/>
     says so, for the other night the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Leeds stated in this House that 
     <lb/>
     in a short time we should have a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union and all its consequences. Well, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, if we are threatened in this way, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for South Leeds ought not 
     <lb/>
     to be surprised that as a Lower Canadian I 
     <lb/>
     have something to say against the opinions 
     <lb/>
     expressed by Lord DURHAM in his report. 
     <lb/>
     I can perfectly understand that he could 
     <lb/>
     not possibly have the feelings of a Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, and that he could not consequently 
     <lb/>
     feel as I can feel, the affront and the wrong 
     <lb/>
     which that statesman inflicted on my fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen. (Hear, hear.) But neither, 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, does he feel as I do that 
     <lb/>
     the plan of Confederation will bring the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian race to the social condition 
     <lb/>
     conceived and predicted by the noble lord 
     <lb/>
     whose report I have just cited. That hon. 
     <lb/>
     member, as an Englishman and a Protestant, 
     <lb/>
     is in favor of a legislative union, in 
     <lb/>
     preference to any other system of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. He would behold with pleasure but 
     <lb/>
     one race—and that the British race—in- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     habiting these colonies of Great Britain. I 
     <lb/>
     do not blame him for these sentiments, 
     <lb/>
     which are perfectly justifiable when held by 
     <lb/>
     an Englishman; but, on the other hand, I 
     <lb/>
     am thoroughly convinced that he will not 
     <lb/>
     deem it a strange thing that a French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian should entertain entirely different 
     <lb/>
     views on these points. (Hear, hear. ) Thus, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, that great statesman, Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM, the most dangerous enemy of 
     <lb/>
     French nationality, makes use of the follow<lb break="no"/>ing language in his famous report :—

     Lord DURHAM came into this country after 
     <lb/>
     the rebellion, and perceived that his pre<lb break="no"/>decessors in the government had been guilty 
     <lb/>
     of political errors which had alienated the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadians from Great Britain, and 
     <lb/>
     he thought that he ought to leave behind 
     <lb/>
     him, to serve as a guide to his successors, 


            <cb/>
      

     that famous report in which he has collected 
     <lb/>
     together all the means that diplomacy could 
     <lb/>
     furnish him with, to crush out a nationality 
     <lb/>
     which he saw with regret living happily 
     <lb/>
     and contentedly on the soil of its birth, and 
     <lb/>
     from which it drew its sustenance. Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM, like the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     Leeds would have preferred a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union of all the British Provinces to the 
     <lb/>
     union of the two Canadas ; but the British 
     <lb/>
     Government considered it more prudent 
     <lb/>
     to begin with this partial union knowing 
     <lb/>
     well that later it would easily find the means 
     <lb/>
     of accomplishing a legislative union. Eng<lb break="no"/>land reasoned in this way : if we give the 
     <lb/>
     English race time to develope itself, we can 
     <lb/>
     easily, at some future period, impose a legis<lb break="no"/>lative union on the French-Canadians. To<lb break="no"/>day the Canadian Government, accepting 
     <lb/>
     the views of Lord DURHAM, come down and 
     <lb/>
     ask us to take this first step towards annihil<lb break="no"/>ation. by accepting Confederation, which 
     <lb/>
     they present to us in the most brilliant and 
     <lb/>
     tempting guise. (Hear, hear.) For want 
     <lb/>
     of argument, they say such things as these 
     <lb/>
     to excuse the culpable step which they are 
     <lb/>
     ready to take—"What is the use of resisting? 
     <lb/>
     We must have sooner or later the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation now proposed to you, and ultimately a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union ?" Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
     <lb/>
     think, for my part, that we might easily 
     <lb/>
     escape this last danger to our nationality, if 
     <lb/>
     all the Catholics and French-Canadians in 
     <lb/>
     this House were to league themselves to<lb break="no"/>gether to defeat the measure before us, 
     <lb/>
     which denies to the latter that legitimate 
     <lb/>
     influence which they ought to have in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government. Why not concede to 
     <lb/>
     us the guarantees and concessions which we 
     <lb/>
     have given to our fellow-countrymen of other 
     <lb/>
     origins ? The Lower Canadian Ministers, who 
     <lb/>
     have not insisted upon obtaining for us that 
     <lb/>
     protection, have rendered themselves highly 
     <lb/>
     culpable towards their follow—countrymen. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Under the Federal union, 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada can never have more than 
     <lb/>
     sixty-five members in the Federal Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, notwithstanding the explanations to 
     <lb/>
     the contrary made on this head by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General East. All who have dis<lb break="no"/>cussed the question in this House could not 
     <lb/>
     do otherwise than admit it. Well, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing this injustice, and notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     any increase that our population may attain 
     <lb/>
     under the Federal <hi rendition="simple:italic">régime</hi>, our representation 
     <lb/>
     will always remain at the same figure, and 
     <lb/>
     we shall pay our share of the public debt in 
     <lb/>
     the ratio of the number of our population. 
  


            <pb n="854" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0854.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">854</fw>
          

     Well, Mr. SPEAKER, is there not injustice 
     <lb/>
     in this provision? We have been told that 
     <lb/>
     we shall have the management of our public 
     <lb/>
     lands. I admit that this would be of great 
     <lb/>
     benefit to us, if we were in a position to 
     <lb/>
     assure those who might settle in our midst 
     <lb/>
     that they would have a voice in the councils 
     <lb/>
     of the nation. But no, Mr. SPEAKER; im<lb break="no"/>migration to this country will always be 
     <lb/>
     impossible under the Confederation perparing 
     <lb/>
     for us, and it will be diverted towards the 
     <lb/>
     territories of Upper Canada, where the 
     <lb/>
     settlers can be represented in the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, where the climate is more 
     <lb/>
     favorable and the soil more fertile. But 
     <lb/>
     from another point of view, can we consider 
     <lb/>
     advantageous to Lower Canada the possession 
     <lb/>
     and administration of its public domain 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances in which we shall 
     <lb/>
     be placed by Confederation? Assuredly 
     <lb/>
     not, and for this reason : each province is to 
     <lb/>
     assume its public lands, with the debts due 
     <lb/>
     upon the lands. On the public lands 
     <lb/>
     situated in Upper Canada, and which she 
     <lb/>
     is to assume, there is a debt of six millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars due to the province, whilst on 
     <lb/>
     those in Lower Canada there is only a debt 
     <lb/>
     of one million, consequently Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     will obtain from Lower Canada a claim for 
     <lb/>
     five million of dollars in excess of that which 
     <lb/>
     she yields to Lower Canada. Here we have 
     <lb/>
     one of the few great advantages which have 
     <lb/>
     been pointed out to us since the beginning 
     <lb/>
     of the discussion; and I ask you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, whether it is advantageous to 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada? On the contrary, while 
     <lb/>
     highly advantageous to Upper Canada, it 
     <lb/>
     is grossly unjust to Lower Canada. Is 
     <lb/>
     it not evident that the Confederation is 
     <lb/>
     entirely for the benefit of Upper Canada? 
     <lb/>
     And is not a sufficient proof of it to be 
     <lb/>
     found in the fact that we find in this House 
     <lb/>
     but two or three members from that section 
     <lb/>
     of the province who are opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme? If all the members from Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, to what party soever they may be<lb break="no"/>long, unite to-day to support the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     the Government, it is because they perfectly 
     <lb/>
     understand that everything has been con<lb break="no"/>ceded to them, and that they have obtained 
     <lb/>
     all that they wished for—all the concessions 
     <lb/>
     that they sought for, and for which they 
     <lb/>
     labored and struggled so energetically and 
     <lb/>
     so long. (Hear, hear.) That is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     well understood. But if influences hostile 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada, which worked against us 
     <lb/>
     during the preparation in England of the 
     <lb/>
     law respecting the change in the constitution 
  

            <cb/>
        

     of the Legislative Council, had not caused 
     <lb/>
    the removal from the Union Act of the 
     <lb/>clause requiring the assent of two-thirds of 
     <lb/>the members of the Legislature to effect a 
     <lb/>change in the basis of our representation — 
     <lb/>if those influences had not worked to re<lb break="no"/>move that safeguard of our interests, Upper 
     <lb/>Canada would never have been so persistent 
     <lb/>in striving to obtain representation based on 
     <lb/>population. She would have seen the im<lb break="no"/>possibility of obtaining it, and the inutility 
     <lb/>of asking for it, and would, in consequence, 
     <lb/>have abandoned it. But from the moment 
     <lb/>when that clause was removed from the 
     <lb/>Union Act, it was competent to the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture to enact a change in the Constitution by 
     <lb/>a mere majority; and it may consequently 
     <lb/>be said that through that influence which 
     <lb/>worked against us, Upper Canada now 
     <lb/>obtains representation based on population. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) The members from Upper 
     <lb/>Canada will observe that I do not maintain 
     <lb/>that the principle of representation based 
     <lb/>upon population is in itself an unjust prin<lb break="no"/>ciple; but I maintain that as they refused 
     <lb/>us the application of it when the population 
     <lb/>of Lower Canada was in a majority, it is 
     <lb/>unjust of them to demand it now because 
     <lb/>they are in a majority, and I cannot see by 
     <lb/>what right they wish to obtain it now. I 
     <lb/>say that if the application of that principle 
     <lb/>was unjust twenty years ago, it is also unjust 
     <lb/>to-day; and that if it is just to-day, it was 
     <lb/>equally just twenty years ago. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>A member considered it very extraordinary 
     <lb/>that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge</hi> party—let us call it by that 
     <lb/>name, since it is the one by which the 
     <lb/>Liberal party is designated in this country, 
     <lb/>and we have no reason to take exception to 
     <lb/>it—since the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge</hi> party in Canada have 
     <lb/>washed away from that name all the stains 
     <lb/>with which the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge</hi> party in France had 
     <lb/>covered it, and that here the banner of that 
     <lb/>party is spotless—(hear, hear)—a member, 
     <lb/>I say, considered it extraordinary, and 
     <lb/>ridiculed the idea that the Rouge party 
     <lb/>should have constituted themselves the 
     <lb/> protectors and defenders of the religion, the 
     <lb/>nationality and the institutions of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, during the discussion of the scheme 
     <lb/>of Confederation. But when we see at the 
     <lb/>head of the movement, hostile to that 
     <lb/>Confederation, a man like Mr. CHERRIER of 
     <lb/>Montreal, who will certainly very favorably 
     <lb/>bear comparison with all the members of the 
     <lb/>Conservative party of Lower Canada in 
     <lb/>respect of devotion, honor, national feeling 
     <lb/>and ability—when we see, I repeat, a man 
 

            <pb n="855" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0855.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">855</fw>
         

     like Mr. CHERRIER at the head of the move<lb break="no"/>ment hostile to Confederation, I say that it 
     <lb/>
     is wrong to cast ridicule on that movement, 
     <lb/>
     and to make a pretence of believing that the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Liberal party, or of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge</hi> 
     <lb/>
     party, have no religious, national or patriotic 
     <lb/>
     feelings. I say that the Conservative party 
     <lb/>
     were greatly in the wrong in endeavoring to 
     <lb/>
     ridicule Mr. CHERRIER, because he is a man 
     <lb/>
     who is too well known as a man of probity 
     <lb/>
     and of religious sentiments—and the same 
     <lb/>
     cannot be said of several of those who have 
     <lb/>
     attacked him; and I am convinced that that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman sincerely believes that the nation<lb break="no"/>ality, the institutions and the religion of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada are in danger. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Besides, admitting, as the Ministerial party 
     <lb/>
     pretend, that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouge</hi> party were not 
     <lb/>
     authorized to speak for the clergy and to 
     <lb/>
     defend our religious and national rights, it 
     <lb/>
     does not follow that all that the members on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House stated on this subject 
     <lb/>
     is not strictly true ; and if it had been possi<lb break="no"/>ble to reply to it, it would have been better 
     <lb/>
     to meet it by arguments of a serious charac<lb break="no"/>ter than by personal attacks, the latter means 
     <lb/>
     being only employed as a blind. And those 
     <lb/>
     who exclaim so loudly to-day against the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party, and who pretend to see in that 
     <lb/>
     party nothing but disloyalty and treason, did 
     <lb/>
     not always hold the monarchical and loyal 
     <lb/>
     ideas which they profess to-day; they were 
     <lb/>
     not always such ardent supporters of mon<lb break="no"/>archical government as they are now. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Thus, all the world knows right well 
     <lb/>
     that the Hon. Attorney General for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) was at the 
     <lb/>
     head of the party which stirred up the 
     <lb/>
     troubles of 1837-38. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI3">MR. J. B. E. DORION</persName>—No, no! he was 
     <lb/>
     at the tail of it! (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAFR1">HON. MR. LAFRAMBOISE</persName>—I do not 
     <lb/>
     know whether he was at the head or at the 
     <lb/>
     tail of it; but at any rate, he was in it. He 
     <lb/>
     was at St. Denis a few minutes before the 
     <lb/>
     battle. (Laughter.) I do not know whether 
     <lb/>
     he remained there; but I know that it is 
     <lb/>
     reported that he was deputed by the rebel 
     <lb/>
     camp to go and fetch provisions, although 
     <lb/>
     they could not then have been in any great 
     <lb/>
     need of provisions, for the moment at least. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter.) At any rate, he was in the 
     <lb/>
     rebel camp. But he has now corrected all 
     <lb/>
     his democratic errors; he has renounced all 
     <lb/>
     ideas of that nature, and has substituted 
     <lb/>
     monarchical ideas for them; he is now in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a great monarchical power on this 
     <lb/>
     continent, and would be prepared to accept 
   

            <cb/>
       

     the position of Royal Prince if it should be 
     <lb/>
     offered to him. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. Solicitor General for Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada (Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN) explained to us 
     <lb/>
     why he had so assumed monarchical ideas, 
     <lb/>
     when he told us that he would receive his 
     <lb/>
     reward. (Hear, hear.) After having as<lb break="no"/>sumed monarchical ideas, he is ready to 
     <lb/>
     assume their livery. (Hear.) But why 
     <lb/>
     should he be rewarded as the Hon. Solicitor 
     <lb/>
     General has said he will be? He will be 
     <lb/>
     so, that gentleman says, because the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General brought about the passing 
     <lb/>
     of a measure for the abolition of the seigniorial 
     <lb/>
     tenure—because the <hi rendition="simple:italic">censitaires</hi> and the 
     <lb/>
     seigniors brought their title-deeds to him, 
     <lb/>
     and he returned them a measure which was 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory both to the seigniors and to the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">censitaires</hi>. Now, I am really surprised 
     <lb/>
     that the Hon. Solicitor General, who, in 
     <lb/>
     the position which he occupies, ought 
     <lb/>
     to be acquainted with the history of the 
     <lb/>
     laws of this country, is not aware that 
     <lb/>
     it was the Honorable Mr. Justice DRUM<lb break="no"/>MOND who prepared and brought about the 
     <lb/>
     passing of the law for the abolition of the 
     <lb/>
     seigniorial tenure, and not the Hon. Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General for Lower Canada at all. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) That is, therefore, no reason why 
     <lb/>
     he should deserve a reward. The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General also said that the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General was entitled to the grati<lb break="no"/>tude of his country, because he had brought 
     <lb/>
     about the passing of the law for judiciary 
     <lb/>
     decentralisation, and had thereby conduced 
     <lb/>
     to the interests of suitors, advocates, judges, 
     <lb/>
     and every one in general. The Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General is free to admire the laws 
     <lb/>
     of his chief, the Hon. Attorney General; but 
     <lb/>
     I may say, that if ever an Attorney General 
     <lb/>made crude, incomprehensible and imprac<lb break="no"/>ticable laws, it was undoubtedly the present 
     <lb/>Hon. Attorney General for Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>He has never been able to make a single 
     <lb/>law which it has not been absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary to amend and touch up every session, 
     <lb/>and the worst in this respect is his judicature 
     <lb/>law. "But," says the Hon. Solicitor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, "he has passed a registration law." 
     <lb/>Well, his registration law contains similar 
     <lb/>defects, and proves his complete inability to 
     <lb/>prepare a passable law. And to so great a 
     <lb/>degree is this the case, that it has been 
     <lb/>impossible to put it in practice, and it has 
     <lb/>been necessary to amend it during five con<lb break="no"/>secutive sessions, without that course having 
     <lb/>very greatly improved it. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>Those two laws, then, do not entitle him to 


            <pb n="856" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0856.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">856</fw>
         

     a reward. The Hon. Solicitor General also 
     <lb/>
     says that the Hon. Attorney General deserves 
     <lb/>
     a reward for having introduced the French 
     <lb/>
     law of Lower Canada into the townships. 
     <lb/>
     But here again he awards him praise and 
     <lb/>
     reward which are not his due, for it was 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Judge LORANGER who made that law, 
     <lb/>
     and had it passed and enacted by the House. 
     <lb/>
     For this law, then, also he is not deserving 
     <lb/>
     of reward. (Hear.) These are the three 
     <lb/>
     reasons for which the Hon. Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     says that the Hon. Attorney General is enti<lb break="no"/>tled to a reward ; but I consider that he hardly 
     <lb/>
     deserves any, as it was not he who brought 
     <lb/>
     about the passing of the first and the last of 
     <lb/>
     those laws, and the other two are so ill-made 
     <lb/>
     that he deserves anything but a reward for 
     <lb/>
     having conferred them upon the country. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Yet I must say that he 
     <lb/>
     deserves a reward, but from whom, and 
     <lb/>
     why? Ah! he deserves a reward from 
     <lb/>
     England for having done exactly what Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM advised the doing of in relation to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadians, in his famous report on the 
     <lb/>
     means to be taken to cause us to disap<lb break="no"/>pear; he deserves a reward for having 
     <lb/>
     caused the setting aside of the French 
     <lb/>
     laws and the substitution for them of Eng<lb break="no"/>lish laws; he deserves a reward for having 
     <lb/>
     done the will of England in every respect; 
     <lb/>
     and, lastly, he deserves a reward for having 
     <lb/>
     devised the present scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and caused it to be accepted by a majority 
     <lb/>
     of this House. (Hear, hear.) While on 
     <lb/>
     this subject, and to show how he has deserved 
     <lb/>
     and received rewards, it will be well to read 
     <lb/>
     a passage from Lord DURHAM'S report, in 
     <lb/>
     which he points out the means to be adopted 
     <lb/>
     to corrupt the leaders and to get the mastery 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Canadian people. The follow<lb break="no"/>ing is the passage to which I allude :— 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     While I believe that the establishment of a 
     <lb/>
     comprehensive system of government, and of an 
     <lb/>
     effectual union between the different provinces, 
     <lb/>
     would produce this important effect on the gene<lb break="no"/>ral feelings of its inhabitants, I am inclined to

     which it would have in giving greater scope and

     <lb/>
     As long as personal ambition is inherent in human

     afford the means of pacifying the turbulent ambi<lb break="no"/>tions, and of employing in worthy and noble oc<lb break="no"/>cupations the talents which are now only exerted

     Lord DURHAM well knew what he was 
     <lb/>
     about when he recommended the bestowal 
     <lb/>
     of places and honors on the ambitious in<lb break="no"/>dividuals who made a disturbance, and the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General for Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     made a great disturbance and stir in 1836 
     <lb/>
     and 1837; he was present at the meeting of 
     <lb/>
     the five counties, when he donned the cap 
     <lb/>
     of liberty. (Hear, hear.) Lord DURHAM 
     <lb/>
     says, "Give places to the principal men, and 
     <lb/>
     you will see how they will sacrifice their 
     <lb/>
     countrymen and submit to England." And 
     <lb/>
     indeed it is that course which has met with 
     <lb/>
     the greatest success; and it has been seen 
     <lb/>
     that all those who impeded the movement 
     <lb/>
     in Lower Canada against the union, and all 
     <lb/>
     those who exclaimed, "Hold your tongues; 
     <lb/>
     the union has saved us!" have been re<lb break="no"/>warded. Some have been knighted; on 
     <lb/>
     others, honors, places and power have been 
     <lb/>
     conferred; and the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada will receive his reward, 
     <lb/>
     as they did, and will be made a baronet, if 
     <lb/>
     he can succeed in carrying his measure of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation—a measure which England so 
     <lb/>
     ardently desires. (Hear, hear.) For my 
     <lb/>
     part, I do not envy him his reward; but I 
     <lb/>
     cannot witness with satisfaction the efforts 
     <lb/>
     he makes to obtain it by means of a measure 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation which I believe to be fatal 
     <lb/>
     to the interests of Lower Canada. I am 
     <lb/>
     determined, therefore, to do everything in

     my power to prevent the realization of

     <persName ref="pers:DORI3">MR. J. B. E. DORION</persName>—Before I proceed 
     <lb/>
     to examine the question which engages our 
     <lb/>
     attention, Mr. SPEAKER, I wish to premise 
     <lb/>
     that in any expression of my sentiments, I 
     <lb/>
     speak on behalf of no political party, but for 
     <lb/>
     myself only. In discussing a proposition 
     <lb/>
     which so intimately affects the destiny of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and all that we value most, I would 
     <lb/>
     rise above personal and party considerations, 
     <lb/>
     in order that I may look at it from a vantage 
     <lb/>
     point removed from party influences. Why, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, are we engaged this evening 
     <lb/>
     in discussing a Confederation of the Provinces 
     <lb/>
     of British North America? Because we had, 
     <lb/>
     last year, a Ministerial crisis, from which 
     <lb/>
     arose a proposal for the union of the two 
     <lb/>
     political parties who divided public opinion. 
    

            <pb n="857" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0857.jpg"/>

     The MACDONALD-TACHÉ Ministry, who re<lb break="no"/>presented the Conservative party in the coun<lb break="no"/>try, had just been defeated in the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Assembly; they were obliged to resign. It 
     <lb/>
     will be recollected that the Government were 
     <lb/>
    beaten on a question of mal-administration of  
     <lb/>the public business. I allude to the advance 
     <lb/>of $100,000 made to the Grand Trunk Rail<lb break="no"/>way without authority of Parliament, for 
     <lb/>which act several members of the Cabinet 
     <lb/>were responsible. Could you inform me, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, what has become of the $100,000 
     <lb/>question? Alas! it disappeared in the Minis<lb break="no"/>terial crisis, and left us the extraordinary 
     <lb/>Coalition which now governs us, composed of 
     <lb/>men who for ten years treated each other as 
     <lb/>men devoid of political principle! (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) The Conservative party clung so 
     <lb/>tenaciously to power, that they were not 
     <lb/>appalled by the position to which they had 
     <lb/>brought the country. Any union or coalition 
     <lb/>between two political parties, of opposite 
     <lb/>principles, proves an abandonment of prin<lb break="no"/>ciple by one or the other. All coalitions are 
     <lb/>vicious in their very foundation: they have 
     <lb/>always been held as proofs of political profli<lb break="no"/>gacy, in England as everywhere else; and they 
     <lb/>are the more dangerous that they are generally 
     <lb/>strong. To the present Coalition we are in<lb break="no"/>debted for the scheme of the Confederation 
     <lb/>of the British Provinces in a tangible 
     <lb/>form. Had that Coalition never been formed, 
     <lb/>we should never have heard of the Quebec 
     <lb/>Conference, nor of the resolutions adopted 
     <lb/>at that meeting in October last, and now sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to our consideration. Now, who au<lb break="no"/>thorised the holding of that Conference? 
     <lb/>What right had that body to arrogate to itself 
     <lb/>the power of proposing a radical change in 
     <lb/>our political condition? How was Canada 
     <lb/>represented there? Three-fourths of the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian delegates were men under the ban of 
     <lb/>parliamentary condemnation. How was the 
     <lb/>voting carried on at that Convention? Was 
     <lb/>it not by provinces? Have not the four little 
     <lb/>provinces below had twice as many votes on 
     <lb/>each question as the two large provinces of 
     <lb/>Canada? These questions all occur naturally. 
     <lb/>If to each of them a categorical answer were 
     <lb/>rendered, we should be able to throw some light 
     <lb/>on the way in which the interests of the country 
     <lb/>have been neglected,overriddcn, and sacrificed. 
     <lb/>If we only think that to the last question no 
     <lb/>other answer could be rendered than an affirm<lb break="no"/>ative, there is no room for wonder that the 
     <lb/>Lower Provinces had all the advantage in the 
     <lb/>arrangements concluded at the Conference. 
     <lb/>Notwithstanding that the compromise was in 


            <cb/>
  

     their favor, the great number of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces concerned now repudiate its provisions, 
     <lb/>
     according to information which reaches us 
     <lb/>
     every day. They seem to be afraid of us; 
     <lb/>
     and notwithstanding the offers of money 
     <lb/>
     made to them, they will have nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with a union. Our reputation for extrava<lb break="no"/>gance must be very bad to frighten them to 
     <lb/>
     that degree; and, no doubt, when they saw 
     <lb/>
     us spend in the course of a month or two, for 
     <lb/>
     receptions, in traveling and in feasting, sums 
     <lb/>
     equalling in amount the whole of revenue of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, they must have gone 
     <lb/>
     back with a sorry idea of our way of manag<lb break="no"/>ing public business. (Hear, hear.) I do 
     <lb/>
     not mean to repeat what has been said during 
     <lb/>
     the debate; but before proceeding, I may be 
     <lb/>
     allowed to draw a contrast between our 
     <lb/>
     manner of acting and that of our neigh<lb break="no"/>bors in the United States when con<lb break="no"/>stitutional changes are in question. In 
     <lb/>
     the United States—that country which people 
     <lb/>
     take so much pains to represent as the hotbed 
     <lb/>
     of all political, social, moral and physical hor<lb break="no"/>rors—they do not play with the written con<lb break="no"/>stitutions of the several states, any more than 
     <lb/>
     with that of the American union. There, 
     <lb/>
     whenever a constitution is to be amended, 
     <lb/>
     generally, it requires a vote of two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of each of the two Houses. If it is the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the United States which is to be 
     <lb/>
     amended, the measure must also be sanctioned 
     <lb/>
     by a majority in each of the legislatures of the 
     <lb/>
     several states. If the amendment relates to a 
     <lb/>
     local constitution, besides a two-thirds vote of 
     <lb/>
     the two Houses, the amendment must be rati<lb break="no"/>fied by a convention of delegates from the 
     <lb/>
     different parties in the state, selected specially 
     <lb/>
     for the occasion. The United States are now 
     <lb/>
     occupied with the consideration of an amend<lb break="no"/>ment of their Constitution, the object of which 
     <lb/>
     is the abolition of slavery. The amendment 
     <lb/>
     has been adopted by the Congress and by the 
     <lb/>
     Senate of the American union, and must be 
     <lb/>
     ratified by a majority of the local legislatures, 
     <lb/>
     before it forms a part of the Constitution. It 
     <lb/>
     will even be necessary to take into the account 
     <lb/>
     the states which are now in rebellion. We 
     <lb/>
     see at once the guarantees they are provided 
     <lb/>
     with, that no radical change shall be adopted 
     <lb/>
     without the consent of the people, who are 
     <lb/>
     allowed sufficient time to weigh all the consi<lb break="no"/>derations which may operate in favor of any 
     <lb/>
     projected change. This is the method of pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding among our sagacious neighbors in 
     <lb/>
     matters of importance; and, as a thing of 
     <lb/>
     course, they have established a political status 
     <lb/>
     which leaves far behind it all that human 


            <pb n="858" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0858.jpg"/>

     wisdom had previously devised to secure the 
     <lb/>
    peace and prosperity of the nations of the New 
     <lb/>World. But in our dear Canada, with all the 
     <lb/>English precedents of which so much account 
     <lb/>is made, we do not require such precautions. It 
     <lb/>is quite enough that men should have been 
     <lb/>found guilty of misapplication of the public 
     <lb/>money, that they shall have abused each other 
     <lb/>as political robbers for ten years, to bring 
     <lb/>about a coalition of the combatants, to make 
     <lb/>them hug each other till all feeling of personal 
     <lb/>dignity is lost, and all regard for principle is 
     <lb/>forgotten. It is enough, I say, that we have 
     <lb/>a scandalous union—a state of political pro<lb break="no"/>fligacy—like that perpetrated in 1864, to 
     <lb/>believe in our right to do what we please. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) With a majority of thirty 
     <lb/>or forty votes, we hesitate at nothing. The 
     <lb/>Constitution, which hampers the curvetings 
     <lb/>and prancings of our leading chiefs too much, 
     <lb/>and rather curbs their personal ambition— 
     <lb/>which circumscribes in short the range of 
     <lb/>their speculative operations, is found to be 
     <lb/>inconvenient. It is assailed with relentless 
     <lb/>blows; it is to be thrown down without asking 
     <lb/>the leave of those most concerned; and in its 
     <lb/>place is to be set up a new order of things 
     <lb/>under which there is to be no more regard for 
     <lb/>political principles than for the rights and 
     <lb/>wants of the people. A simple parliamentary 
     <lb/>majority of one will be sufficient with us to 
     <lb/>overthrow the entire political order of things, 
     <lb/>and we have no appeal from so important a 
     <lb/>decision, save an appeal to an authority three 
     <lb/>thousand miles off, which may add something to 
     <lb/>the scheme to make it less acceptable to us than 
     <lb/>it already is. (Hear, hear.) The people may 
     <lb/>hereafter condemn their representatives, but 
     <lb/>the mischief will be done! This is all the 
     <lb/>consolation we shall have. Is not the contrast 
     <lb/>between our stupid method of doing things, 
     <lb/>and the prudent rational proceeding of our 
     <lb/>neighbors, a very striking one? And truly 
     <lb/>they are our superiors in all political respects.  
     <lb/>Now, let me justify my opposition to the 
     <lb/>projected change. I am opposed to the 
     <lb/>scheme of Confederation, because the first 
     <lb/>resolution is nonsense and repugnant to truth; 
     <lb/>it is not a Federal union which is offered 
     <lb/>to us, but a Legislative union in disguise. 
     <lb/>Federalism is completely eliminated from this 
     <lb/>scheme, which centres everything in the 
     <lb/>General Government. Federalism means the 
     <lb/>union of certain states, which retain their 
     <lb/>full sovereignty in everything that imme<lb break="no"/>diately concerns them, but submitting to the 
     <lb/>General Government questions of peace, of 
     <lb/>war, of foreign relations, foreign trade, cus<lb break="no"/>
          

    
            <cb/>
        
     toms and postal service. Is that what is 
     <lb/>
     proposed to us? Not at all. In the scheme 
     <lb/>
     we are now examining, all is strength and 
     <lb/>
     power, in the Federal Government; all is 
     <lb/>
     weakness, insignificance, annihilation in the 
     <lb/>
     Local Government! I am opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation, because, far from 
     <lb/>
     removing the difficulties complained of 
     <lb/>
     between Upper Canada and Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     it must, if adopted, simply multiply them 
     <lb/>
     tenfold. There will be a constant conflict of 
     <lb/>
     authorities, particularly as to questions sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the double action of the local and 
     <lb/>
     general   legislatures. I am opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation, because the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion in which it is to be embodied will be 
     <lb/>
     faulty in its very basis. We are told that 
     <lb/>
     the representation is to be based upon popu<lb break="no"/>lation in one House, and that the principle of 
     <lb/>
     equality is to prevail in the other; and to-day 
     <lb/>
     that principle is violated as regards New<lb break="no"/>foundland, as it will be, no doubt, tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     in favor of British Columbia and Vancouver 
     <lb/>
     Island, should these colonies think proper to 
     <lb/>
     enter into our proposed Confederation. What 
     <lb/>
     is to prevent the smaller provinces forming a 
     <lb/>
     league together, and thus getting the upper 
     <lb/>
     hand of the larger but less numerous provinces, 
     <lb/>
     on purely local questions? That is one of the 
     <lb/>
     great defects of the Ministerial scheme, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion. But, moreover, the autonomy of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada is menaced and placed at the 
     <lb/>
     mercy of a parliament of one hundred and 
     <lb/>
     ninety-four members, of whom forty-seven, or 
     <lb/>
     at most forty-eight only, will represent the 
     <lb/>
     views of the majority of its people. I am 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the scheme of Confederation, be<lb break="no"/>cause it takes away from the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country political rights which they have won 
     <lb/>
     by many years of struggles; among others 
     <lb/>
     that of electing its representatives in the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council, as it does its representa<lb break="no"/>tives in the Assembly. Since 1856, we 
     <lb/>
     have enjoyed an elective Council. For 
     <lb/>
     more than half a century that reform had 
     <lb/>
     been asked for. Our claims were urged in 
     <lb/>
     the press, in public meetings, in petitions 
     <lb/>
     to Parliament and to the home Government, 
     <lb/>
     and in the form of direct motions in the 
     <lb/>
     House. The Legislative Council, as constitu<lb break="no"/>ted previous to the Act of 1856, had become 
     <lb/>
     highly unpopular; it had also fallen into a 
     <lb/>
     state of utter insignificance. By infusing 
     <lb/>
     into it the popular element by means of 
     <lb/>
     periodical elections, it was galvanised into life 
     <lb/>
     and became quite another body in the estim<lb break="no"/>ation of the people. The electoral system 
     <lb/>
     completely restored its prestige, entitled it to 


            <pb n="859" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0859.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">859</fw>
         

     the respect of the people, and gave it an im<lb break="no"/>portance it did not previously possess. Since 
     <lb/>
     the Council has been made elective, not 
     <lb/>
     a single complaint has appeared against 
     <lb/>
     its new constitution, in the press, or in 
     <lb/>
     the form of public meetings, petitions or 
     <lb/>
     motions in the House. Has it produced 
     <lb/>
     any evil effects in the administration of 
     <lb/>
     the affairs of the country? Has the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment suffered from it? Has the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country found any bad results from it? Has 
     <lb/>
     the country been the worse for it? And in 
     <lb/>
     what respect? Answer, you who desire to 
     <lb/>
     deprive the people of the right to elect that 
     <lb/>
     House, though they have not asked you to 
     <lb/>
     do so, and though you yourselves hold your 
     <lb/>
     seats by their will? The elective Legislative 
     <lb/>
      Council represents better the character, the 
     <lb/>
     wants and the aspirations of our Canadian 
     <lb/>
     society, than the Council appointed for life 
     <lb/>
     ever did. With regard to the talent of the 
     <lb/>
     country, it has represented it as well as it 
     <lb/>
     was represented under the old system. With 
     <lb/>
     regard to its moderation and its conservative 
     <lb/>
     spirit, experience has shewn that it possessed 
     <lb/>
     these two qualities to a degree surpassing the 
     <lb/>
    expectation of all parties. I do not hesitate,  
     <lb/>therefore, to say that the change was a change 
     <lb/>for the better in every respect; that it satis<lb break="no"/>fied and tranquillized public opinion, and that 
     <lb/>it secured to the country a more direct control 
     <lb/>over public affairs. Lower Canada has tested 
     <lb/>both systems of nomination, that by the 
     <lb/>Crown and that by the people, and it does 
     <lb/>not ask to return to the former. We had a 
     <lb/>life-nominated Council for half a century in 
     <lb/>Canada. Every one knows that the acts of 
     <lb/>that very Council drove the people of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada into rebellion in 1837! One of the 
     <lb/>great arguments advanced in support of 
     <lb/>the proposed scheme is that the electoral 
     <lb/>divisions are very extensive, and that 
     <lb/>the rich alone, by means of their wealth, 
     <lb/>can attain a seat in that House. It costs 
     <lb/>so much now-a-days, it is said, to carry 
     <lb/>an election! If that argument were of any 
     <lb/>value as regards the Legislative Council, it 
     <lb/>should have equal weight as regards the 
     <lb/>House of Assembly. To be consistent, you 
     <lb/>you should have asked also for the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of the members of the Assembly, in 
     <lb/>place of having them elected by the people! 
     <lb/>But that is not the true reason. And besides, 
     <lb/>let those who do not wish to spend money 
     <lb/>remain at home, if the people refuse to elect 
     <lb/>them without being paid. Let corruption 
     <lb/>cease; adopt vote by ballot, which will des<lb break="no"/>troy corruption, and there will be no need of 


            <cb/>
         

     inventing imaginary grievances in order to 
     <lb/>
     restrict the liberties of the people. This 
     <lb/>
     Tory scheme will throw us back fifty years. 
     <lb/>
     It is nothing else than a plot! (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am opposed to this scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     because we are offered local parliaments which 
     <lb/>
     will be simply nonentities, with a mere semblance 
     <lb/>
     of power on questions of minor importance. 
     <lb/>
     When we shall have seen the Local Parliament 
     <lb/>
     in operation with its restricted powers (res<lb break="no"/>tricted except as regards expenditure, extrav<lb break="no"/>agance, and the power of taxing real property), 
     <lb/>
     it will soon be found, as it is in fact destined 
     <lb/>
     to become, a mere taxing machine. Nothing 
     <lb/>
     more, nothing less! The expenditure of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada for justice, education, asylums, 
     <lb/>
     hospitals, courts, prisons, interest on the debt, 
     <lb/>
     &amp;c., &amp;c., added to the expense of a Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and Parliament, will exceed $2,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     The revenue will fall far short of that amount. 
     <lb/>
     Direct taxation would be a necessary conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the establishment of the new sys<lb break="no"/>tem, without any compensation for the fresh 
     <lb/>
     burthen which the people must bear. I have 
     <lb/>
     said enough to shew the difference between 
     <lb/>
     the American federal system and that proposed 
     <lb/>
     for our adoption. In the American union 
     <lb/>
     each state is sovereign over all that immediate<lb break="no"/>ly concerns it. Here, everything would be 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the General Parliament. Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada is opposed to free trade in money, 
     <lb/>
     and desires to limit the rate of interest; and 
     <lb/>
     yet this she could not do, inasmuch as that 
     <lb/>
     very ordinary question would be under 
     <lb/>
     the control of the General Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     Whether the principle be a sound one or not, 
     <lb/>
     it is admitted that nine-tenths of our people 
     <lb/>
     desire that the rate of interest should be fixed. 
     <lb/>
     Each state of the American union regulates 
     <lb/>
     questions of this kind as it chooses, without 
     <lb/>
     the intervention of neighboring states, or of 
     <lb/>
     the Washington Government. Thus, the rate 
     <lb/>
     of interest varies in a great many of the 
     <lb/>
     states, and in others it is not fixed. In 
     <lb/>
     Vermont the rate is six per cent.; in New 
     <lb/>
     York, seven per cent.; in Ohio, ten per cent.; 
     <lb/>
     in Illinois, thirty per cent.; and in the other 
     <lb/>
     states, trade in money is free. These are facts 
     <lb/>
     which prove that the real Federal system 
     <lb/>
     resembles in no sense that which we are asked 
     <lb/>
     to adopt. (Hear, hear.) I might give a 
     <lb/>
     host of facts of this kind in support of my 
     <lb/>
     postion; but I shall confine myself to one. 
     <lb/>
    It is well known that the people of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada are almost unanimous in repudiat<lb break="no"/>ing the principle of divorce. Nevertheless, 
     <lb/>under Confederation the Parliament of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada is not to have the right of regulating 
  

            <pb n="860" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0860.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">860</fw>
           

     that question according to its wishes; but the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament, sitting at Ottawa, will be 
     <lb/>
     empowered to force upon us principles utterly 
     <lb/>
     opposed to our own, and even to establish a 
     <lb/>
     Court of Divorce at Quebec. Under the 
     <lb/>
     Federal system, nothing so unjust, nothing so 
     <lb/>
     revolting to the feelings of the people could 
     <lb/>
     occur. In the American union there are 
     <lb/>
     some states in which divorce is permitted, and 
     <lb/>
     others in which it is not—another proof that 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty may be vested in each state, 
     <lb/>
     without detriment to the union. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am opposed to the scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     because the courts of justice of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada will be under the control of the General 
     <lb/>
    Government. We should have courts of 
     <lb/>justice in Lower Canada, but the judges who 
     <lb/>would sit in them would be appointed by the 
     <lb/> Government of the Confederation. It would 
     <lb/>be the same in the other provinces; but Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, with her laws, which are peculiar to 
     <lb/>her, ought especially to resist the interference 
     <lb/>of the General Government in the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of justice. It will be said that the Con<lb break="no"/>ference endeavored to cause their intentions 
     <lb/>to be suspected, and it has already been urged 
     <lb/>that this arrangement is a stroke of the 
     <lb/>lawyers, who would prefer to see the nomina<lb break="no"/>tion of the judges vested in the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, because they would receive higher 
     <lb/>salaries, rather than see them appointed by the 
     <lb/>local governments, who would be obliged to 
     <lb/>have recourse to direct taxation in order to 
     <lb/> pay their salaries. But setting aside this 
     <lb/>idea, I assert that the appointment of the 
     <lb/> judges in each province by the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment appears to me an uncalled-for inter<lb break="no"/>ference, an anomaly which cannot be too 
     <lb/>strongly opposed. (Hear, hear.) I am opposed 
     <lb/>to the scheme of Confederation, because the 
     <lb/>local governors would only be tools in the 
     <lb/>hands of the General Government, who would 
     <lb/>interfere in the local matters by the continual 
     <lb/>pressure they would bring to bear on them 
     <lb/>whenever they desired to change the opinions 
     <lb/>of the local parliaments, elected by the people 
     <lb/>in each province, on any question which they 
     <lb/>might have to discuss. Why have the local 
     <lb/>governments, with the insignificant powers 
     <lb/>which it is proposed to confer upon them— 
     <lb/>why, I say, have they not been allowed to 
     <lb/>elect their respective governors ? Would there 
     <lb/>be any more harm in this than results from 
     <lb/>the elections of mayors in our large towns? 
     <lb/>There was once a time when even the wardens 
     <lb/>were appointed by the Government. Has the

     tive of evil or discontent throughout the coun<lb break="no"/>try? I am opposed to the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, because by means of the right of <hi rendition="simple:italic">veto</hi> 
     <lb/>
     vested in the Governor by the 51st resolution, 
     <lb/>
     local legislation will be nothing but a farce. 
     <lb/>
     They may try to make us believe that this 
     <lb/>
     power would be but rarely examined, and that 
     <lb/>
     it differs in nowise from that exercised by the 
     <lb/>
     present Governor when he reserves bills for 
     <lb/>
     the Royal assent; but all the country knows 
     <lb/>
     that it would not be so. From the moment 
     <lb/>
     that you bring the exercise of the right of 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">veto</hi> more nearly within the reach of interested 
     <lb/>
     parties, you increase the number of oppor<lb break="no"/>tunities for the exercise of the right—you 
     <lb/>
     open the door to intrigues. As, for instance, 
     <lb/>
     a party will oppose the passing of a law, and 
     <lb/>
     not succeeding in his opposition in Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, he will approach the Ministers and the 
     <lb/>
     Governor General, intriguing to obtain as a 
     <lb/>
     favor that the law may be disallowed. Take 
     <lb/>
     an example. I suppose your Confederation to 
     <lb/>
     be established; that a bill is passed for the 
     <lb/>
     protection of settlers, such as we have seen 
     <lb/>
     pass the House six times in ten years without 
     <lb/>
     becoming law, on account of the opposition to 
     <lb/>
     it in the Legislative Council by the council<lb break="no"/>lors from Upper Canada; what would happen? 
     <lb/>
     The few interested parties who were opposed 
     <lb/>
     to the measure would rush to the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General to induce him to disallow the law. 
     <lb/>
     By an appeal to the right of property, to the 
     <lb/>
     respect due to acquired rights, and to other 
     <lb/>
     sophistries, they would override the will of 
     <lb/>
     the people on a measure which is just in itself, 
     <lb/>
     and which is sought for and approved of by 
     <lb/>
     all legal men of Lower Canada in the present 
     <lb/>
     House. The people of Lower Canada will be 
     <lb/>
     prevented from obtaining a law similar to 
     <lb/>
     those now existing in thirteen different states 
     <lb/>
     of the American union, and which would in 
     <lb/>
     no way affect the principles of the existing 
     <lb/>
     law in Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) This 
     <lb/>
     is one instance out of a thousand, and will 
     <lb/>
     serve to illustrate the effect of this right of 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">veto</hi>. I am opposed to the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, because I cannot see why, on the 
     <lb/>
     one hand, it has been agreed to give all the 
     <lb/>
     public lands to the Government of each pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and on the other hand that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should purchase the lands in the Island 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. The General Government 
     <lb/>
     gives up the fertile lands of Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, but it purchases the barren 
     <lb/>
     lands of Newfoundland at the enormous price 
     <lb/>
     of $150,000 per annum, a sum representing a 
     <lb/>
     capital of $2,500,000. Is not this a grand 
   

            <pb n="861" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0861.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">861</fw>
         

     speculation for the country? The Government 
     <lb/>
     at Ottawa will not possess a single inch of land 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     but they will have a Land Department for 
     <lb/>
     the management of their superb possessions in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland? Is it imagined that if the pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands of that island had been of any value, 
     <lb/>
     they would have been given up to the Gen<lb break="no"/>eral Government for any amount? No, the fact 
     <lb/>
     is that these lands are utterly useless for cul<lb break="no"/>tivation, that the whole island does not produce 
     <lb/>
     hay enough for the town of St. Johns, and 
     <lb/>
     that every year large quantities of it are im<lb break="no"/>ported. I know a farmer in Three Rivers 
     <lb/>
     who has sent cargoes of hay to Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and who is now only waiting for the naviga<lb break="no"/>tion to open to send more—and these are the 
     <lb/>
     lands which it is proposed to buy for a fabu<lb break="no"/>lous price, in order to induce that province to 
     <lb/>
     come into the Confederation. (Hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     there is also another matter for consideration 
     <lb/>
     with respect to this arrangement regarding 
     <lb/>
     the public lands. I am of opinion that it is 
     <lb/>
     more advantageous to the progress of coloni<lb break="no"/>zation of our wild lands that they should 
     <lb/>
     remain in the hands of the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, rather than come into the possession of 
     <lb/>
     a local government, which might, perhaps, be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to maintain itself by direct taxation; 
     <lb/>
     for in that case the very uttermost farthing due 
     <lb/>
     on these lands will have to be collected. In 
     <lb/>
     a country like Lower Canada, with its 
     <lb/>
     rigorous climate, colonization must be aided 
     <lb/>
     and encouraged if reasonable progress is de<lb break="no"/>manded. In that view the Government have 
     <lb/>
     made free grants, and have remitted many 
     <lb/>
     claims for interest on the public lands. Had 
     <lb/>
     they not done so, the population in certain 
     <lb/>
     sections would have been forced to leave the 
     <lb/>
     country. Remissions and free grants will dis<lb break="no"/>appear with the appearance of direct taxation. 
     <lb/>
     I am opposed to the scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     because it is most unjustly proposed to enrich 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces with annuities and dona<lb break="no"/>tions, to persuade and induce them to enter 
     <lb/>
     into a union which will be injurious to all 
     <lb/>
     the contracting parties. I am opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation, because the division 
     <lb/>
     of the public debts of the several provinces 
     <lb/>
     has been made in an unjust way, and because 
     <lb/>
     no portion of these debts ought to have been 
     <lb/>
     imposed on the local governments, which, in 
     <lb/>
     the event of the union, ought to have begun 
     <lb/>
     anew without being burthened with debt. I am 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the Confederation, because I foresee 
     <lb/>
     difficulties without number in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     concurrent powers on several points conferred 
     <lb/>
     on the general and local governments. Col<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
       
lisions on these points will always be settled 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the stronger party, to the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of the General Government, and to the 
     <lb/>
     detriment of the often just claims of the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent provinces. I am opposed to Con<lb break="no"/>federation, because the premium offered to 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick is of a most extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     character. It has been agreed to pay her 
     <lb/>
     $63,000 per annum for ten years. The sum 
     <lb/>
     to pay this will have to be borrowed every 
     <lb/>
     year. Interest will have to be paid upon it, 
     <lb/>
     so that at the expiration of ten years the Con<lb break="no"/>federation will have paid to New Brunswick: 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     And what will it have received in exchange? 
     <lb/>
     Nothing whatever! For the sum agreed to 
     <lb/>
     be paid to Newfoundland there is at least a 
     <lb/>
     semblance of direct compensation in the ces<lb break="no"/>sion which it makes of its barren lands. But 
     <lb/>
     in the case of New Brunswick, there is no<lb break="no"/>thing to be got from her for these $735,000, 
     <lb/>
     on which interest will have to be paid long 
     <lb/>
     after the ten years have expired. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) And that is not all; we are to pay 
     <lb/>
     interest to New Brunswick, at the rate of five 
     <lb/>
     per cent., on $1,250,000, for the difference 
     <lb/>
     between her debt and that of Canada in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to their respective populations. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I am opposed to the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, because it has been agreed to con<lb break="no"/>struct the Halifax Railway without a notion 
     <lb/>
     of what it will cost, and at a time when we 
     <lb/>
     have already as much to pay as our resources 
     <lb/>
     can bear, without plunging into ruinous and 
     <lb/>
     unproductive enterprises of this kind. There 
     <lb/>
     is no exaggeration in the statement that at 
     <lb/>
     least $20,000,000 will be required for the ex<lb break="no"/>ecution of that enterprise. Of what use will 
     <lb/>
     it be? Doubly useless in a military and in a 
     <lb/>
     commercial point of view. We are not in a 
     <lb/>
     position to undertake it for the mere pleasure 
     <lb/>
     of having a road which will place us in direct 
     <lb/>
     communication with the sea over English ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. What would the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way be worth in a commercial point of view? 
     <lb/>
     In summer we have the St. Lawrence, which 
     <lb/>
     affords means of communication much more 
     <lb/>
     economical in their nature than any railway. 
     <lb/>
     In winter, without taking into account the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties caused by the vast quantity of 
     <lb/>
     snow which falls between Quebec and Hali<lb break="no"/>fax, is it supposed that there will be many 
     <lb/>
     travellers who will adopt that route, six hun<lb break="no"/>dred miles in length, to reach the seaboard at

     Halifax, when they may reach Portland by a 
     <lb/>
     railway not more than one-third as long as 
     <lb/>
     the proposed road? Does any suppose that 
     <lb/>
     a person having flour to export will send it to 
     <lb/>
     Halifax, when he can despatch it by Port<lb break="no"/>land? There is no sentiment in trade; it 
     <lb/>
     takes the road which it finds to be the short<lb break="no"/>est and the most profitable, and all your Con<lb break="no"/>federation will not change this immutable law 
     <lb/>
     of trade in all countries. (Hear, hear.) But, 
     <lb/>
     it is said, this road will be of great use in 
     <lb/>
     time of war as a military route. Have those 
     <lb/>
     who talk in this way ever thought of the 
     <lb/>
     trifling distance that separates that road from 
     <lb/>
     American territory in certain places? Have 
     <lb/>
     they ever thought how easy it would be, in a 
     <lb/>
     single night, to destroy enough of it to make 
     <lb/>
     it unserviceable for months together? Have 
     <lb/>
     they ever thought how many soldiers would 
     <lb/>
     be required to protect it and keep it in opera<lb break="no"/>tion? The experience of the present Amer<lb break="no"/>ican war teaches us that to keep a railway in 
     <lb/>
     operation, nearly as many soldiers are required 
     <lb/>
     as there are lineal feet to protect. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I am opposed to the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, because it is proposed to ensure, 
     <lb/>
     to guarantee the fulfilment of all engage<lb break="no"/>ments which shall have been entered into 
     <lb/>
     with the Imperial Government by all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces up to the time of union on the subject 
     <lb/>
     of the defence of the country, without the 
     <lb/>
     nature and extent of those engagements 
     <lb/>
     being known. There is perhaps no question 
     <lb/>
     in all the resolutions of the Conference of 
     <lb/>
     higher importance than this. Yet it is wished 
     <lb/>
     to make us ratify all these engagements with 
     <lb/>
     our eyes shut. What do we know about the 
     <lb/>
     engagements which the Governments of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island may have entered into 
     <lb/>
     on the subject of their respective defences? 
     <lb/>
     What do we know even of the engagements 
     <lb/>
     entered into by our own Government with 
     <lb/>
     the English Government in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     same question ? Nothing; we can know 
     <lb/>
     nothing of them. We are told that the cor<lb break="no"/>respondence on the subject of the defences 
     <lb/>
     cannot be submitted to Parliament under 
     <lb/>
     existing circumstances. Why then should we 
     <lb/>
     blindly vote on questions of such grave im<lb break="no"/>portance? I am opposed to Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     because it is wished to make us enter into a 
     <lb/>
     financial arrangement which it is frightful to 
     <lb/>
     consider, and one which is most diametri<lb break="no"/>cally opposed to the interests of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Let us see what is proposed in this respect.

     The Confederation would have us to pay—

            <p>
     Here we have a pretty balance-sheet, not one 
     <lb/>
     item of which is exaggerated, and which is 
     <lb/>
     offered to us by Confederation. All this is 
     <lb/>
     exclusive of the enormous expense of the 
     <lb/>
     general and local governments. Some of 
     <lb/>
     the sums just mentioned will not be payable at 
     <lb/>
     once, but nearly all of them will be so before 
     <lb/>
     five years have elapsed; sums as considerable 
     <lb/>
     will be payable at once, it may be said, if we 
     <lb/>
     enter in the account the expenses of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation and its unforeseen enterprises. At 
     <lb/>
     the last census, all the provinces only con<lb break="no"/>tained 3,294,056 souls. Supposing them to 
     <lb/>
     contain 3,500,000 at the time of the union, 
     <lb/>
     the debt, with the foregoing liabilities, would 
     <lb/>
     amount to $45 for each man, woman and 
     <lb/>
     child, and of that debt we should have to pay 
     <lb/>
     the interest. (Hear, hear.) I am opposed 
     <lb/>
     to Confederation, because I cannot see the use 
     <lb/>
     or the necessity of it in a commercial point of 
     <lb/>
     view. Countries yielding different products 
     <lb/>
     may gain considerably by uniting. What do 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Colonies produce? Do they not 
     <lb/>
     live in a climate similar to ours? Do they 
     <lb/>
     not produce similar grain to that grown in 
     <lb/>
     Canada? What trade could there be between 
     <lb/>
     two farmers who produced nothing but oats? 
     <lb/>
     Neither one nor the other would want for 
     <lb/>
     them. They might stand and stare at each 
     <lb/>
     other with their oats before them, without 
     <lb/>
     ever being able to trade together; they would 
     <lb/>
     require a third person—a purchaser. In such 
     <lb/>
     a position are we with regard to the adjacent

     colonies. Should we go for ice to the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Colonies? I think there is enough of it in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, especially at Quebec, and will be so 
     <lb/>
     long as sufficient spirit of enterprise is not 
     <lb/>
     displayed to export it to hot climates. They 
     <lb/>
     talk to us of fish—but those we have in our 
     <lb/>
     own waters—and of coal as a very great affair.

     <lb/>Provinces have reserved the right of placing

            <p><persName ref="pers:DORI3">MR. J. B. E. DORION</persName>—My honorable 
     <lb/>friend reminds me that we shall not be able 
     <lb/>to obtain coal from the provinces which will 
     <lb/>form part of the Confederation, without paying 
     <lb/>them a tax. Is not that admirable? We are 
     <lb/>to constitute a single people, a single country, 
     <lb/>but there will be taxes to pay for trading with 
     <lb/>each other in certain articles. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>I should understand the commercial advan<lb break="no"/>tages which we should gain if the English 
     <lb/>Provinces were situated in different climates, 
     <lb/>yielding every kind of produce, which should 
     <lb/>be freely exchanged. That which built up 
     <lb/>the commercial prosperity of the United States 
     <lb/>'is their geographical position—their immense 
     <lb/>territory, in which is to be found every climate 
     <lb/>imaginable, from the north producing ice, to 
     <lb/>the south producing the most delicious fruits. 
     <lb/>An inhabitant of Maine may load a vessel 
     <lb/>with ice, proceed to New Orleans and barter 
     <lb/>his cargo of ice for rice, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c., 
     <lb/>with which he may return home without 
     <lb/>paying a single farthing of customs duties. 
     <lb/>It is this free and continual exchange of their 
     <lb/>various products from Maine to California 
     <lb/>which has placed the United States in the 
     <lb/>first rank of commercial nations in so short a 
     <lb/>time. (Hear, hear.) Let us not, therefore, 
     <lb/>be lulled with fancies of the great commercial 
     <lb/>advantages we shall derive from a Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of the provinces. We have wood, they 
     <lb/>produce it; we produce potash, and so do 
     <lb/>they. All that they would require would be 
     <lb/>a little flour, and that Upper Canada can sup<lb break="no"/>ply to them now without paying any tax for 
     <lb/>doing so. Again, our trade with them cannot 
     <lb/>be very considerable, because there are natural 
     <lb/>obstacles in the way to prevent its being so. Si<lb break="no"/>tuated in the same degree as ourselves in respect 
     <lb/>of climate, they produce what we produce, and 
     <lb/>what we want they want—a foreign market 
     <lb/>wherein to dispose of their surplus products. 
     <lb/>Besides, the commercial advantages may all be 
     <lb/>obtained by a mere commercial union, apart 
     <lb/>from a political union. England concluded a 
     <lb/>commercial treaty with the United States, by 
     <lb/>means of which we trade freely with them in 
     <lb/>all products of the soil and of the fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     What objection could there be to the estab<lb break="no"/>lishment of a system of free trade between the 
     <lb/>
     colonies, which are all subject to the same 
     <lb/>
     authority? They would then enjoy all 
     <lb/>
     the advantages that could result, without 
     <lb/>
     entering into a political union, the depths 
     <lb/>
     of which we are not able to fathom. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I am opposed to Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, because instead of giving us strength to 
     <lb/>
     defend ourselves, it will prove to be a source 
     <lb/>
     of incalculable weakness. How can it be 
     <lb/>
     believed that by adding 700 miles to our long 
     <lb/>
     frontier, we shall strengthen ourselves against 
     <lb/>
     the enemy, when the territory to be added 
     <lb/>
     does not yet contain inhabitants enough to 
     <lb/>
     defend it? Is it supposed that if we had a 
     <lb/>
     war with the Americans, they would not attack 
     <lb/>
     the English Provinces at all points? They 
     <lb/>
     would attack Newfoundland, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as 
     <lb/>
     well as the two Canadas. A country without 
     <lb/>
     depth, like that which it is proposed to form 
     <lb/>
     here, has not its like under the sun. It 
     <lb/>
     would be vulnerable at all points along its 
     <lb/>
     frontier of 1,600 to 1,800 miles. In geo<lb break="no"/>graphical form it would resemble an eel. Its 
     <lb/>
     length would be everything, its breath nothing. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing would be easier than to cut it into 
     <lb/>
     little pieces, and none of the parts so sliced off 
     <lb/>
     could send help to the others. The more of 
     <lb/>
     such country as the provinces which it is 
     <lb/>
     wished to unite to us that we have, the 
     <lb/>
     weaker shall we be, and the greater will be 
     <lb/>
     our difficulties in relation to military defence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I am opposed to the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, because I consider that it is 
     <lb/>
     the result of a conspiracy against popular 
     <lb/>
     rights in Canada, and that the hope is to impel 
     <lb/>
     the people into a course fatal to their real 
     <lb/>
     interests, by causing to shine before their 
     <lb/>
     eyes all sorts of wonders which would be 
     <lb/>
     accomplished in the end to the prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     the country, if that country would only 
     <lb/>
     accept the new form of Government which 
     <lb/>
     it is proposed to force upon it. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am opposed to the scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     because it is proposed to perpetuate, on a 
     <lb/>
     still greater scale, a state of things which is 
     <lb/>
     not suitable to the populations of America 
     <lb/>
     when they attain to years of discretion—a 
     <lb/>
     state of things which evidently was not in<lb break="no"/>tended for a country in which there are no 
     <lb/>
     castes, no privileged classes and no heredi<lb break="no"/>tary aristocracy—in which all are equal, 
     <lb/>
     socially and politically, by force of circum<lb break="no"/>stances. I am opposed to the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, because I am desirous that 
     <lb/>
     we should be as untrammelled as possible in

     the selection of the future form of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for Canada, when we shall emerge 
     <lb/>
     from the colonial condition. I am free to 
     <lb/>
     admit that I do not participate in the illu<lb break="no"/>sions of certain persons in respect to the 
     <lb/>
     magnificent destinies of the empire to be 
     <lb/>
     founded by us in North America, and that 
     <lb/>
     I am far from believing that it would be to our 
     <lb/>
     advantage. I am opposed to the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, because I deny that this House has 
     <lb/>
     power to change the political constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the country, as it is now proposed to do, 
     <lb/>
     without appealing to the people and obtain<lb break="no"/>ing their views on a matter of such impor<lb break="no"/>tance. These are the principal reasons which 
     <lb/>
     induce me to oppose the scheme brought 
     <lb/>
     down by the Government. But these are 
     <lb/>
     not all ; I have yet many other considera<lb break="no"/>tions to urge. The gate of the future 
     <lb/>
     destinies of the country was opened when 
     <lb/>
     this scheme was laid before us, and I too am 
     <lb/>
     desirous of penetrating within its portals. I 
     <lb/>
     have said that the new organization which 
     <lb/>
     it is wished to establish here decs not suit 
     <lb/>
     either our resources or our wants. It would 
     <lb/>
     appear that we cannot attain in Canada a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable limit as regards the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of public affairs. Our system is not 
     <lb/>
     found to be extravagant enough, and it is 
     <lb/>
     wished to substitute for it one still more 
     <lb/>
     costly. Our neighbors have established an 
     <lb/>
     economical political system, which is much 
     <lb/>
     more advantageous to them than ours would 
     <lb/>
     be to any country. We pay here much 
     <lb/>
     more than is paid in the United States, 
     <lb/>
     although that peeple is infinitely richer than 
     <lb/>
     we are. If we prepare a list of the salaries 
     <lb/>
     paid to the governors of the states in the 
     <lb/>
     union, with a view of comparing it with the 
     <lb/>
     list of salaries which we pay here to our 
     <lb/>
     principal public employés, we shall be sur<lb break="no"/>prised at the difference which will be found 
     <lb/>
     to exist to our disadvantage. Here is a

     There are also ten other states which 
     <lb/>
     were in rebellion at the beginning of the 
     <lb/>
     year 1864, the date of the table which 
     <lb/>
     I have given. It will be seen that Ver<lb break="no"/>mont pays only $1,000 a year to an elec<lb break="no"/>tive governor. That is less than we pay 
     <lb/>
     here to the mayors of our great cities. 
     <lb/>
     The State of New York, which is by itself 
     <lb/>
     more rich and populous than the whole 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, only pays $4,000 a year to her 
     <lb/>
     Governor. I will not compare this salary 
     <lb/>
     with that of our Governor, amounting to 
     <lb/>
     $32,000 ; but by comparing it with that of 
     <lb/>
     our judges of the second-class, it will be 
     <lb/>
     found that the latter receive higher salaries 
     <lb/>
     than the Governor of the State of New 
     <lb/>
     York. (Hear, hear.) The State of Ohio, 
     <lb/>
     more rich and more populous than Canada, 
     <lb/>
     only pays $l,800 to her Governor. If the 
     <lb/>
     salaries are comparatively small in the United 
     <lb/>
     States, it is because it was understood there 
     <lb/>
     that good administration of public affairs 
     <lb/>
     might be obtained by the practice of a wise 
     <lb/>
     economy, without that display of luxury 
     <lb/>
     which is ruining us here. Another com<lb break="no"/>parison, on a smaller scale, might be made 
     <lb/>
     between the State of New York and Canada, 
     <lb/>
     in respect of another matter. It is this :— 
     <lb/>
     The State of New York possesses magnifi<lb break="no"/>cent canals, which cost her an enormous 
     <lb/>
     price ; but the revenue produced by them 
     <lb/>
     has paid their cost, whilst here our canals, 
     <lb/>
     which also cost us very dear, do not even 
     <lb/>
     pay the interest of the debt which was 
     <lb/>
     contracted for their construction, and that 
     <lb/>
     is a point of difference by no means of small 
     <lb/>
     magnitude. The State of New York con<lb break="no"/>tracted a further debt for the enlargement of 
     <lb/>
     her canals after the revenue produced by 
     <lb/>
     them had paid off that which had been 
     <lb/>
     contracted for their construction ; and the 
     <lb/>
     revenue which they yield is sufficient not 
     <lb/>
     only to pay the interest of that debt, but 
     <lb/>
     also to create a sinking fund which will 
     <lb/>
     allow of its liquidation in five years from 
     <lb/>
     the present day. Last year the State of 
     

            <pb n="865" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0865.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">865</fw>
        

     New York received from her canals the sum 
     <lb/>
     of $5,118,501.35 ; the expenses of manage<lb break="no"/>ment amounted to $111,503.78, and those 
     <lb/>
     of repaire to $659,378.74, forming a total 
     <lb/>
     of $770,882.52, which left a net revenue 
     <lb/>
     of $4,347,618.83, after paying all expenses 
     <lb/>
     of management and costs of maintenance. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Do you know what was done 
     <lb/>
     with that surplus ? It was applied as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :—

     Leaving a balance of $981,876.17 after hav<lb break="no"/>ing met all engagements in relation to the

     Sinking Fund, and paid a sum of $200,000 
     <lb/>
     towards the cost of the government of the 
     <lb/>
     state. Here, when a school or sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     is created, it is expended, or borrowing has 
     <lb/>
     to be had recourse to in order to meet it. 
     <lb/>
     Let us then compare the management of our 
     <lb/>
     canals with that of the canals of New York. 
     <lb/>
     Here the tolls on certain of our canals are 
     <lb/>
     abolished with the view of favoring trade, 
     <lb/>
     instead of a reasonable revenue being levied 
     <lb/>
     from those great works ! (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>
     total debt of the State of New York on the 
     <lb/>
     30th September, 1863, was as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

</table>
   
            <p>
     In the course of the same year, $3,116,242 
     <lb/>
     was paid into the sinking fund, and there 
     <lb/>
     remained still five and a half millions in hand 
     <lb/>
     produced by the canals, so that in less than 
     <lb/>
     ten years the canal debt and the special debt 
     <lb/>
     of the state will be entirely paid off. Shall 
     <lb/>
     we be able to say as much of our own debt in 
     <lb/>
     ten years time ? (Hear, hear.) I repeat then, 
     <lb/>
     that the financial system of our neighbours 
     <lb/>
    is greatly superior to ours, and that they pay 
     <lb/>reasonable salaries to their public officers, 
     <lb/>while such payments here are on an extra<lb break="no"/>vagant scale, If I speak of all this, it is 
     <lb/>because I am opposed to the scheme, and be<lb break="no"/>cause it is wished to establish a monarchy, 
     <lb/>a new kingdom on this continent, and 
     <lb/>because a desire is manifested to have a 
     <lb/>court, a nobility, a viceroy, tinsel, and so on. 
     <lb/>I am alarmed at the position in which it is 
     <lb/>wished to place us, for from extravagance it 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
    

     is proposed, with all these absurd and ridic<lb break="no"/>ulous schemes, to pass to folly. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The commercial crisis through which we 
     <lb/>
     passed in 1846, when England repealed the 
     <lb/>
     import duty on foreign grain brought to 
     <lb/>
     her markets, will be remembered. Before 
     <lb/>
     that period our grain and other produce 
     <lb/>
     were protected on the English markets in 
     <lb/>
     being admitted free of duty, while that from 
     <lb/>
     the Black Sea and the United States was 
     <lb/>
     subject to a duty which was high enough 
     <lb/>
     to afford great protection in favor of ours.  
     <lb/>
     This new policy in relation to the colonies 
     <lb/>
     was productive of disastrous consequences  
     <lb/>
     to Canadian trade. The exportation of 
     <lb/>
     grain to England was completely put a stop 
     <lb/>
     to. There was no longer an outlet for that 
     <lb/>
     produce. To get to the United States mar<lb break="no"/>kets twenty per cent. had to be paid. Well, 
     <lb/>the long and terrible crisis which followed 
     <lb/>the abolition of this protection of our pro<lb break="no"/>duce, and which raged during the years 
     <lb/>1847, '48, '49, may be remembered. Begin<lb break="no"/>ning in 1847 there was a disastrous commer<lb break="no"/>cial crisis in Canada. Failures followed 
     <lb/>each other with rapidity, and difficulty was 
     <lb/>everywhere felt. Matters had not greatly 
     <lb/>improved in 1848. It was evident that a 
     <lb/>fresh outlet for the agricultural produce of 
     <lb/>Canada must be found in order to ensure to 
     <lb/>her satisfactory relief. Discontent mani<lb break="no"/>fested itself, and agitation became apparent. 
     <lb/>Arguments and negotiations were had with 
     <lb/>the political men of England, but without 
     <lb/>any satisfactory result being attained. It 
     <lb/>was then thought that a solution of the  
     <lb/>commercial difficulties of the country was 
     <lb/>to be found in political changes. Hence 
     <lb/>followed the annexation movement of 1849. 
     <lb/>The obtention of a political change of this 
     <lb/>character would at once open to Canada all 
     <lb/>the markets of the United States, and 
     <lb/>would, without any doubt, have ensured 
     <lb/>the material prosperity of the country. 
     <lb/>The annexation movement met with con<lb break="no"/>siderable sympathy in the Northern States 
     <lb/>of the American union, but in the South it 
     <lb/>excited alarm. Fear was entertained of the 
     <lb/>influence which would have been conferred 
     <lb/>upon the North, by the accession of territory 
     <lb/>of such considerable extent as the two 
     <lb/>Canadas, at first, and subsequently of all the 
     <lb/>English Provinces. The Government of 
     <lb/>the United States was in the hands of poli<lb break="no"/>tical men from the South. To avert the 
     <lb/>danger which threatened their influence, 
     <lb/>that Government shewed themselves favor<lb break="no"/>able to a commercial agreement with the 


    
            <pb n="866" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0866.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">866</fw>
          

     English Government. Both were interested 
     <lb/>
     in a commercial connection which left us 
     <lb/>
     nothing to envy in the lot of our neighbors. 
     <lb/>
     In the Canadian Parliament the question of 
     <lb/>
     commercial reciprocity with the United 
     <lb/>
     States was taken up. The Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment approved of the steps taken by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government, which tended to place 
     <lb/>
     their agriculturists on a footing of equality 
     <lb/>
     with the Americans on their markets. On 
     <lb/>
     the 16th March, 1855, the Reciprocity 
     <lb/>
     treaty entered into by the United States 
     <lb/>
     and England, came into force, after having 
     <lb/>
     been ratified by the Canadian Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     Lengthy debates took place in the American 
     <lb/>
     Congress upon the question, but southern 
     <lb/>
     influence carried the measure through. The 
     <lb/>
     Reciprocity treaty was to continue for ten 
     <lb/>
     years, from the 16th March, 1855, without 
     <lb/>
     its being possible to repeal it ; but if one or 
     <lb/>
     the other of the contracting parties should 
     <lb/>
     think fit, after the expiration of the ten 
     <lb/>
     years, they might demand the abrogation of 
     <lb/>
     the treaty, by giving the other party one 
     <lb/>
     year's notice. The question of the repeal of 
     <lb/>
     that treaty has, therefore, for two or three 
     <lb/>
     years, been agitated in the American Con<lb break="no"/>gress with some warmth, by those who found 
     <lb/>
     their interests to suffer by it. The opponents 
     <lb/>
     of the Reciprocity treaty succeeded in 
     <lb/>
     Congress for two reasons : first, on ac<lb break="no"/>count of a feeling of indignation raised 
     <lb/>
     up against Canada, by a part of our press, 
     <lb/>
     which displayed hostility to the Northern 
     <lb/>
     States ; and second, because the rebellious 
     <lb/>
     Southern States were not represented in 
     <lb/>
     the American Government. On the 16th 
     <lb/>
     March next, the President is to give that 
     <lb/>
     notice, and on the 16th March, 1866, the 
     <lb/>
     markets of the United States will be closed 
     <lb/>
     to us. (Hear, hear.) We have seen that 
     <lb/>
     at the time the American Government. which 
     <lb/>
     was then in the hands of politicians from 
     <lb/>
     the Southern States, was not favorable to the 
     <lb/>
     annexation of Canada to the United States, 
     <lb/>
     because those statesmen dreaded the influ<lb break="no"/>ence which two new free states in the union 
     <lb/>
     would bring to bear in relation to slavery. 
     <lb/>
     The ten years of the treaty consequently 
     <lb/>
     terminate on the 16th March in the present 
     <lb/>
     year, and thanks to the behavior of a very 
     <lb/>
     large portion of the Canadian press in re<lb break="no"/>lation to the Government of the United 
     <lb/>
    States. since the beginning of the war which 
     <lb/>now desolates the American Republic, the no<lb break="no"/>tice of the final abrogation of that treaty within 
     <lb/>a year is to be given to us. It will have 
  

            <cb/>
   

     existed for eleven years, and its abrogation 
     <lb/>
     will certainly be a great misfortune to our 
     <lb/>
     country. It may be said that the treaty is 
     <lb/>
     as advantageous to the United States as it is 
     <lb/>
     to ourselves, and that its abrogation will do 
     <lb/>
     as much harm to them as to us ; but the ill 
     <lb/>
     they will undergo in consequence will not 
     <lb/>
     remedy our evil, and will not prevent the 
     <lb/>
     United States markets from being closed to 
     <lb/>
     us, and our being subsequently compelled to 
     <lb/>
     pay a considerable duty for the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     carrying our produce thither, such as our 
     <lb/>
     cats, our horses, our horned cattle, our sheep, 
     <lb/>
     our wool. our butter, &amp;c. The 16th March, 
     <lb/>
     1865, will be a day of mourning for Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but the 16th March, 1866, will be a day of 
     <lb/>
     much deeper mourning, for it will mark the 
     <lb/>
     commencement of a commercial crisis such 
     <lb/>
     as we have never perhaps undergone. and 
     <lb/>
     the disastrous results of which to the future 
     <lb/>
     of the country are beyond calculation. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) In order to understand the whole 
     <lb/>
     importance of this treaty to the prosperity 
     <lb/>
     of the country, it is necessary to know what 
     <lb/>
     passes in the country parts, as I myself am 
     <lb/>
     in a position to know through my constant 
     <lb/>
     relations with those parts. All the oats pro<lb break="no"/>duced in the country from Trois Pistoles to the 
     <lb/>
     upper extremity of the province are exported 
     <lb/>
     to the United States, where they find a ready 
     <lb/>
     market, because they are wanted there. This 
     <lb/>
     year persons went as far as Three Rivers 
     <lb/>
     for them by way of the Arthabaska Railway. 
     <lb/>
     This branch of trade is now very consider<lb break="no"/>able ; but the very moment we have to pay 
     <lb/>
     an export duty of 25 per cent. upon our 
     <lb/>
     produce on entering the United States, we 
     <lb/>
     shall have a commercial crisis which will 
     <lb/>
     derange all business operations throughout 
     <lb/>
     the land. When the Reciprocity treaty is 
     <lb/>
     declared at an end, our oats will be worth no 
     <lb/>
     more than 1s. or 1s. 3d., as in former times, 
     <lb/>
     instead of 13. 8d. or 2s., as at present ; and 
     <lb/>
     it is clear to all that the farmer can derive 
     <lb/>
     no profit from growing them at that price. 
     <lb/>
     Formerly, before the treaty was made, the 
     <lb/>
     farmer could make something by selling his 
     <lb/>
     oats at that price, because food was cheaper 
     <lb/>
     and taxes less than they now are. The 
     <lb/>
     latter were no more than 2½ per cent. and 
     <lb/>
     5 per cent., whereas they are now 20 per 
     <lb/>
     cent., and will be increased rather than 
     <lb/>
     diminished, under Confederation, as certain 
     <lb/>
     members of this House have alleged. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I am thoroughly acquainted with all 
     <lb/>
     that passes in the country parts ; and when 
     <lb/>
     I think of the consequences of the repeal 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="867" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0867.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">867</fw>
         

     of the Reciprocity treaty, I say again, I am 
     <lb/>
     alarmed. What is going on at this present 
     <lb/>
     moment? We all know that for several 
     <lb/>
     years past there have been bad harvests; 
     <lb/>
     that of last year was not good, not in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada only, but also in Upper Canada; 
     <lb/>
     and since New Year's day, half the country 
     <lb/>
     people in Lower Canada have been buying 
     <lb/>
     the flour necessary for their subsistence. 
     <lb/>
     All they spend in the purchase of flour, 
     <lb/>
     from this time till the harvest is gathered 
     <lb/>
     in, is capital which ought to be applied to 
     <lb/>
     the payment of their numerous debts. It 
     <lb/>
     is capital withdrawn from the working and 
     <lb/>
     improvement of their lands. Trade already 
     <lb/>
     feels the effects of it. The imports are more 
     <lb/>
     limited; a good deal of last year's stock of 
     <lb/>
     goods in the cities remains unsold. The 
     <lb/>
     public revenue will be considerably affected 
     <lb/>
     by it, and the surplus of 1864 will in 1865 
     <lb/>
     become a deficit. It is not necessary to be a 
     <lb/>
      prophet to augur so much. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I say, then, that we are on the brink of a 
     <lb/>
     commercial crisis, and it is not such a scheme 
     <lb/>
     as that before us that will enable us to 
     <lb/>
     avoid it, when we need rather to practise 
     <lb/>
     the strictest economy in our public expendi<lb break="no"/>ture. There is a great movement in pro<lb break="no"/>gress from Lower Canada to the United 
     <lb/>States, notwithstanding the war; that is to 
     <lb/>say, people are obliged to leave Canada for 
     <lb/>the United States in order to earn money to 
     <lb/>pay debts which they have been compelled 
     <lb/>to contract for the necessaries of life. In 
     <lb/>many country places people are shutting up 
     <lb/>their houses and setting off to the States; if 
     <lb/>any proof of this assertion is necessary, visit 
     <lb/>Acton—Acton which has become a small 
     <lb/>city since the discovery of the copper mines 
     <lb/>now worked there. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>half the houses in Acton are now shut up, 
     <lb/>although as lately as last year the village 
     <lb/>presented every appearance of the highest 
     <lb/>prosperity. This year the inhabitants are 
     <lb/>driven to leave home and country to support 
     <lb/>their families. (Hear, hear.) I say that 
     <lb/>a movement of self-banishment like that 
     <lb/>which is now going on in the winter season, 
     <lb/>is alarming; for when half the country people 
     <lb/>are obliged to buy their flour as they now 
     <lb/>are, it proves that they must continue to buy 
     <lb/>it until next autumn, after the harvest is 
     <lb/>gathered in; and as many of them have not 
     <lb/>the means of waiting till then, they must 
     <lb/>leave the country to try to supply the wants 
     <lb/>of their families, by applying for work to our 
     <lb/>neighbors. (Hear, hear.) This move<lb break="no"/>ment is in progress among the rural popula<lb break="no"/>
      
            <cb/>
           

     tion as well as among the mechanics, in the 
     <lb/>
     new townships as well as in the old. After 
     <lb/>
     the commencement of the war, a considerable 
     <lb/>
     number of Canadians, who had returned 
     <lb/>
     home to escape from its evils, brought with 
     <lb/>
     them a small capital; but seeing the situation 
     <lb/>
     of affairs in this country, and having spent 
     <lb/>
     what they had, they are going back to the 
     <lb/>
     United States, preferring rather to take their 
     <lb/>
     chance of the conscription for the army than 
     <lb/>
    to eke out a miserable existence here. I 
     <lb/>repeat, then, Mr. SPEAKER, that a great 
     <lb/>many houses are shut up in the new settle<lb break="no"/>ments. I can specify them by the numbers of 
     <lb/>the range and lot in the counties which I 
     <lb/>represent. An unseen but very extensive 
     <lb/>influence is at work in all the country south 
     <lb/>of the St. Lawrence, above Nicolet and 
     <lb/>as far as the frontier. I shall explain it 
     <lb/>to you. In all that part of the country, a 
     <lb/>great many young men go to the United 
     <lb/>States to look for employment. These chil<lb break="no"/>dren of the people find there a wider field 
     <lb/>for their enterprising minds; in fact, they 
     <lb/>are forced to leave Canada in order to earn 
     <lb/>money. When once they are established in 
     <lb/>the United States, they correspond with 
     <lb/>their relatives whom they have left behind 
     <lb/>them. In all their letters they describe the 
     <lb/>treatment they receive, and boast of their 
     <lb/>position, the footing they are on in their 
     <lb/>social relations with the Americans, the good 
     <lb/>wages which they receive, and the state of 
     <lb/>prosperity at which they soon arrive. Not 
     <lb/>only do they correspond, they visit Canada to 
     <lb/>see their families from time to time. On 
     <lb/>these occasions, Mr. SPEAKER, their com<lb break="no"/>munications are made with greater freedom; 
     <lb/>they relate all that they have seen, and heard, 
     <lb/>and all they have learned. Be sure of this, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, these communications, these 
     <lb/>intimacies between Canadians established in 
     <lb/>the States and their home friends, have 
     <lb/>greater effect to produce favorable feelings 
     <lb/>towards the Americans in our country than 
     <lb/>all the newspapers in the world. It is a 
     <lb/>portion of the heart of the country removed 
     <lb/>into a strange land by the force of circum<lb break="no"/>stances. The accounts they hear from their 
     <lb/>friends prove to them that the Americans 
     <lb/>are not such horrible monsters as they are 
     <lb/>said to be in certain quarters, and that 
     <lb/>their political institutions are far superior 
     <lb/>to ours; that every man is on a footing of 
     <lb/>equality with his neighbor, and that he 
     <lb/>possesses political rights of which he cannot 
     <lb/>be deprived. This influence of which I am 
     <lb/>speaking is very great, and certainly it is 
  

            <pb n="868" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0868.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">868</fw>
      

     not to be counteracted, nor the feeling of 
     <lb/>
     sympathy for the people and the institutions 
     <lb/>
     of the United States to be repressed in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of those who confess it, by such 
     <lb/>
     changes as those now proposed to be made. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I say that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada are alarmed at the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, and the unknown changes 
     <lb/>
     which are on foot. I do not say that this 
     <lb/>
     feeling prevails in the district of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     for in that locality everybody seems to be 
     <lb/>
     fast asleep; but it exists, beyond doubt, 
     <lb/>
     and very warmly, in that of Montreal, 
     <lb/>
     and even as far as Three Rivers, on both 
     <lb/>
     sides of the river. Nothing tends more 
     <lb/>
     to alienate the people from their govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and render them disaffected to 
     <lb/>
      England, than the attempts now made to 
     <lb/>
     impose on them a new Constitution without 
     <lb/>
     consulting them; for we must recollect that 
     <lb/>
     we are no longer in the same social state as 
     <lb/>
     in 1812; we no longer think in the same 
     <lb/>
     manner, and people would be greatly in 
     <lb/>
     error who should believe that the same feel<lb break="no"/>ings prevail which then prevailed. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I will not say that the people are 
     <lb/>
     disloyal; far be it from me to express such 
     <lb/>
     an idea!—they are as loyal as those who 
     <lb/>
     accuse them of disloyalty, but they are in<lb break="no"/>clined to form free opinions on the acts 
     <lb/>
     of their government and their own interests, 
     <lb/>
     and there is a great difference between being 
     <lb/>
     loyal to Great Britain and fighting for a 
     <lb/>
     system of government and a principle im<lb break="no"/>posed on us and accepted regretfully. I 
     <lb/>
     maintain, then, that the people are affrighted 
     <lb/>
     at the expense proposed to be made to 
     <lb/>
     organize what is called the defences of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and naturally ask each other whe<lb break="no"/>ther it is right to call upon them to bear a 
     <lb/>
     share of the burthen of such defences, in 
     <lb/>
     the event of a war between our neighbors 
     <lb/>
     and England, a war in which they could 
     <lb/>
     neither say anything to avoid it, nor in its 
     <lb/>
     progress take any other part than that of 
     <lb/>
     shedding their blood and paying their 
     <lb/>
     money. They ask, moreover, whether it 
     <lb/>
     would not be better to remain in our present 
     <lb/>
     condition—whether it would not be better, 
     <lb/>
     even, to be smaller than to seek greatness— 
     <lb/>
     to try to compete with our neighbors in 
     <lb/>
     order that we may be the sooner crushed. 
     <lb/>
     They say, moreover, that a struggle between 
     <lb/>
     us and the United States would be a strug<lb break="no"/>gle between a dwarf and a giant; for no 
     <lb/>
     man in his senses will say that we could 
     <lb/>stand out against them. It is pretended<lb/>that in case of a war with them, we should<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

      have assistance from England. That is 
     <lb/>
     very well; but to any body who recollects 
     <lb/>
     the Crimean war, it will be very evident, 
     <lb/>
     that when England shall have sent us 30,000 
     <lb/>
     soldiers, she will have given to the extreme 
     <lb/>
     limits of her power, and that she must resort 
     <lb/>
     to Spain, and France, and Germany and the 
     <lb/>
     whole continent of Europe to find soldiers. 
     <lb/>
     When we have 1,600 miles of frontier to 
     <lb/>
     defend, where should we be with our 30,000 
     <lb/>
     English troops? It would not be nineteen 
     <lb/>
     men to a mile. (Hear, hear.) No, we are 
     <lb/>
     not to imagine that a war with the United 
     <lb/>
     States now would be like that of 1812, and 
     <lb/>
     that a company of 60 men would put the 
     <lb/>
     American army to flight, as in the palmy days 
     <lb/>
     of Chateauguay! (Hear, hear.) At this 
     <lb/>
     time, the army and navy of the United 
     <lb/>
     States are the strongest in the world, and 
     <lb/>
     the resources of the country inexhaustible. 
     <lb/>
     In four years they have built 600 vessels of 
     <lb/>
     war; and the number of their soldiers is told 
     <lb/>
     by hundreds of thousands. Now, peace will 
     <lb/>
     be made between the North and South, 
     <lb/>
     although it may happen not to please our 
     <lb/>
     politicians, who are friends to slavery, and 
     <lb/>
     have always despised and depreciated the 
     <lb/>
     Government of the United States; for the 
     <lb/>
     South cannot hold out long now that it has 
     <lb/>
     lost all the towns and cities through which 
     <lb/>
     it could receive assistance from abroad. The 
     <lb/>
     American Constitution will come out trium<lb break="no"/>phant from the trial which it is now under<lb break="no"/>going. It will come out purified and refined, 
     <lb/>
     and stronger than ever in the affections of 
     <lb/>
     the people who live under it. It was not 
     <lb/>
     against the form of Republican Government 
     <lb/>
     that the rebellion was undertaken in the 
     <lb/>
     United States, seeing that the Rebel States 
     <lb/>
     adopted exactly the same system when they 
     <lb/>
     declared their independence. They too have 
     <lb/>
     a President, a Senate, Representatives, a 
     <lb/>
     Government and a Legislature for every 
     <lb/>
     state, just the same as under the American 
     <lb/>
     Republic. (Hear, hear.) When peace is 
     <lb/>
     made between the North and South, should 
     <lb/>
     we be able to resist the combined forces of both 
     <lb/>
     sections of the United States of America? 
     <lb/>
     Should we be able to make a stand against 
     <lb/>
     their ships of war, which would overspread 
     <lb/>
     the ocean and the lakes—their guns which 
     <lb/>
     throw balls of several hundred pounds' 
     <lb/>
     weight a distance of eight or ten miles— 
     <lb/>
     from one end of a parish to the other? 
     <lb/>
     The State of New York, with it four millions 
     <lb/>
     of souls, can turn out more soldiers than all 
     <lb/>
    the colonies of England together; and there 
     <lb/>are still thirty-four rich and populous states

     besides, to help in case of war. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) No, we are not to imagine that a 
     <lb/>
     war at this time would be a war of 1812, 
     <lb/>
     and the people know it perfectly well. If a 
     <lb/>
     Confederation like this which is now pro<lb break="no"/>posed is imposed upon the people without 
     <lb/>
     consulting them, and even against their 
     <lb/>
     will—if they are forced to bear a burthen 
     <lb/>
     much heavier than they now bear —and if 
     <lb/>
     the treaty of reciprocity is not continued— 
     <lb/>
     if a commercial crisis should ensue, and if 
     <lb/>
     war should break out between England and 
     <lb/>
     the United States, you must not suppose that 
     <lb/>
     the people will fight as they fought in 1812, 
     <lb/>
     when you have driven them to discontent, 
     <lb/>
     and rendered their position harder than it 
     <lb/>
     now is. You may toll off the population 
     <lb/>
     into regiments, and they will not rebel, be<lb break="no"/>cause they are loyal and submissive, but 
     <lb/>
     their hearts will not be in the cause, and 
     <lb/>
     they will assuredly not fight with the same 
     <lb/>
     spirit as they would shew if they were de<lb break="no"/>fending a constitution and a state of things 
     <lb/>
     of their own choosing. They will not fight 
     <lb/>
     with the same courage as the southern rebels 
     <lb/>
     have shewn, for they were fighting to defend 
     <lb/>
     institutions—bad ones it is true, but which 
     <lb/>
     they were attached to, and which they were 
     <lb/>
     desirous of preserving. (Hear, hear.) ln 
     <lb/>
     the event of a war with the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and being under a Confederation, the people 
     <lb/>
     would be called upon to defend a state of 
     <lb/>
     things which they dislike—a Constitution 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon them, to which they would 
     <lb/>
     not be attached—a Constitution in which 
     <lb/>
     they would have no interest. The war 
     <lb/>
     might result from a difficulty originating 
     <lb/>
     in China! They would be compelled to 
     <lb/>
     fight against a people whom they look 
     <lb/>
     upon not as enemies, but as friends, with 
     <lb/>
     whom they keep up daily relations; and, 
     <lb/>
     I repeat it, it would not be possible for 
     <lb/>
     them to fight as they did in the last war. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But I return to the Recipro<lb break="no"/>city treaty, and I say that we shall feel its 
     <lb/>
     great value once it has been repealed. It is 
     <lb/>
     like a bridge over a river between two 
     <lb/>
     parishes ; so long as the bridge stands, every 
     <lb/>
     one takes advantage of it without a thought 
     <lb/>
     of its utility, but let the bridge be carried 
     <lb/>
     away or destroyed, and every one feels what 
     <lb/>
     an advantage it was, and the people realize 
     <lb/>
      the loss they have suffered, when they are 
     <lb/>
     once more compelled to resort to the old 
     <lb/>
     system of flats and boats every time they 
     <lb/>
     require to cross the river. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
    And if the Reciprocity treaty be repealed,  
     <lb/>it will be due to the conduct of several mem<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
      
bers of the Ministry, and to the papers that 
     <lb/>
     support them, and which they support in re<lb break="no"/>turn; it will be due to the conduct of Tory 
     <lb/>
     politicians and journalists in Canada, who, 
     <lb/>
     since the beginning of the war, have con<lb break="no"/>stantly done everything in their power to 
     <lb/>
     irritate our neighbors and to embroil us 
     <lb/>
     with them, by displaying misplaced sym<lb break="no"/>pathy. (Hear, hear.) For my part, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I know that the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     do not ask for annexation to the United 
     <lb/>
     States, for they are in the enjoyment of 
     <lb/>
     peace and contentment as things now stand. 
     <lb/>
     The people do not desire any change; but 
     <lb/>
     if you wish to establish a new order of 
     <lb/>
     things, if you desire to create a new nation<lb break="no"/>ality, I fancy we have the right to say what 
     <lb/>
     we consider suited to us; and if you desire 
     <lb/>
     to establish a new kingdom on this continent, 
     <lb/>
     we surely are entitled to examine what it 
     <lb/>
     is to be, and the basis upon which it is to be 
     <lb/>
     erected. I say it would be a misfortune 
     <lb/>
     for us if we attempted to establish a system 
     <lb/>
     founded upon a political principle contrary 
     <lb/>
     to that of the United States—on the mon<lb break="no"/>archical principle. If we must inaugurate 
     <lb/>
     a policy, let it not be a policy calculated to 
     <lb/>
     give umbrage, a policy of distrust and pro<lb break="no"/>vocation. Let it rather be a policy of con<lb break="no"/>ciliation and peace. Let it not be a policy 
     <lb/>
     of armies, of useless walls and fortifications— 
     <lb/>
     a policy of ruin and desolation! What 
     <lb/>
     would be the use of all these fortifications, 
     <lb/>
     all these walls, if they load us with an 
     <lb/>
     unbearable burthen of taxation, restrict 
     <lb/>
     our commerce, paralyse our industry, shut 
     <lb/>
     us up within our own narrow limits, with 
     <lb/>
     our vast products cut off from a profit<lb break="no"/>able market? (Hear, hear.) Do you fancy 
     <lb/>
     that the people would then care much 
     <lb/>
     whether the flag floating over them bore a 
     <lb/>
     cross or a stripe? The people are satisfied to 
     <lb/>
     remain as they are; they do not wish for 
     <lb/>
     anything better now; but if you desire to 
     <lb/>
     change their political relations, they have 
     <lb/>
     the right to examine your scheme in all its 
     <lb/>
     phases. They have the right to ask them<lb break="no"/>selves whether what you offer them is not a 
     <lb/>
     permanent state of war for themselves and 
     <lb/>
     their children. (Hear, hear.) The Consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the United States is certainly far 
     <lb/>
     superior to that proposed to us, and far better 
     <lb/>
     suited to our habits and the state of society 
     <lb/>
     amongst us. This scheme of Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     this scheme of an independent monarchy, 
     <lb/>
     can lead but to extravagance, ruin and 
     <lb/>
     anarchy! You may decry as much as you 
     <lb/>
     choose the democratic system, and laud the 


            <pb n="870" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0870.jpg"/>

     monarchical system—the people will ever 
     <lb/>
     estimate them both at their proper value, 
     <lb/>
     and will ever know that which will suit them 
     <lb/>
     best. And when the farmers of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada are compelled to sell their wheat, 
     <lb/>
     after sending it to Montreal, ten cents a 
     <lb/>
     bushel lower than they now sell it at home, 
     <lb/>
     in consequence of the repeal of the Recipro<lb break="no"/>city treaty, there will be a general demand 
     <lb/>
     throughout the whole of Upper Canada, as 
     <lb/>
     well as of Lower Canada, for a change other 
     <lb/>
     than Confederation. And as to this point, 
     <lb/>
     here is what was said by a gentleman who, 
     <lb/>
     but a few months ago, held a seat on the 
     <lb/>
     Ministerial benches—I refer to the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. BUCHANAN. He said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The continuation of the Reciprocity treaty with 
     <lb/>
     the United States is favorable, not only to the 
     <lb/>
     farmers of Canada, and to all other classes 
     <lb/>
     through them, but also to the English Govern<lb break="no"/>ment; for, without the existence of that treaty, 
     <lb/>
     the Canadians are in a position to be greatly 
     <lb/>
     benefited, in an industrial and commercial sense, 
     <lb/>
     by the annexation of Canada to the United States, 
     <lb/>
     unless other industrial or intercolonial arrange<lb break="no"/>ments should take place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Annexation is far preferable, in an industrial 
     <lb/>
     point of view, to our "free trade in raw products," 
     <lb/>
     which is unaccompanied by protection for home 
     <lb/>
     industry.

     "Those who speak the truth to the people in 
     <lb/>
     times of crises like the present, are really the 
     <lb/>
     most loyal men," adds Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN; 
     <lb/>
     and he is right; therefore, it is that I take 
     <lb/>
     it upon myself to speak thus frankly and to 
     <lb/>
     tell the truth to the people. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     "But," it will be said, "annexation is 
     <lb/>
     national suicide, and the people will never 
     <lb/>
     consent to it! Look at Louisiana, which 
     <lb/>
     has lost itself in the American union!" 
     <lb/>
     The people of Lower Canada will reply, that 
     <lb/>
     Louisiana contained but 30,000 whites 
     <lb/>
     when it was sold to the United States for 
     <lb/>
     $14,000,000, and that Lower Canada counts 
     <lb/>
     more than 1,000,000 of inhabitants; that 
     <lb/>
     there is, therefore, no comparison between 
     <lb/>
     the position of Louisiana at that time and 
     <lb/>
     that we now occupy. Besides, those 30,000 
     <lb/>
     whites in Louisiana were not all French; 
     <lb/>
     for thirty years previous to 1800, Louisiana 
     <lb/>
     had belonged to the Spaniards. No one can 
     <lb/>
     deny that. It was in 1803 that it was 
     <lb/>
     ceded by France to the United States, and 
     <lb/>
     yet its French population has not been 
     <lb/>
     absorbed and has not disappeared. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Since it was ceded to the United 
     <lb/>
     States, Louisiana has always governed itself 
     <lb/>
     as it liked, and in its own way. It is true 
     <lb/>
     that the official use of the French language 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
       

     has been abolished in its Legislature, but 
     <lb/>
     why and by whom? It was abolished by 
     <lb/>
     the people of the country themselves, to 
     <lb/>
     mark their dissatisfaction at having been 
     <lb/>
     sold by France. But notwithstanding that 
     <lb/>
     fact, and the great influx of foreign popula<lb break="no"/>tion, the original population have remained 
     <lb/>
     French, their laws are published in French, 
     <lb/>
     the judges speak French, pleading is carried 
     <lb/>
     on before the tribunals in French, numerous 
     <lb/>
     journals are published in French; in a word, 
     <lb/>
     the country has remained as thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     French as it was under the domination of 
     <lb/>
     France. (Hear, hear.) To those who tell 
     <lb/>
     our people that annexation would annihilate 
     <lb/>
     them as a people, and destroy their nation<lb break="no"/>ality and their religion, they will reply that 
     <lb/>
     there is no danger of their being transported 
     <lb/>
     like the inhabitants of Acadia, and that 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada would be as independent as 
     <lb/>
     any of the other states of the union; that 
     <lb/>
     they would, therefore, manage their own 
     <lb/>
     affairs, and protect their interests as they 
     <lb/>
     thought proper, without fear of intervention 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the General Government or 
     <lb/>
     of the other states; for they would possess, 
     <lb/>
     like all the other states, full and entire 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty in all matters specially relating 
     <lb/>
     to their own interests. They would be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to submit to the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     only as regards matters of general interest, 
     <lb/>
     such as postal matters, the tariff, foreign 
     <lb/>
     relations, defence against enemies, &amp;c., &amp;c. 
     <lb/>
     With regard to local matters, they would be 
     <lb/>
     perfectly sovereign in their own country, 
     <lb/>
     and they could make all the laws they 
     <lb/>
     thought proper, provided such laws were not 
     <lb/>
     hostile to the other states. Thus, as regards 
     <lb/>
     the question of divorce, they might legislate 
     <lb/>
     so that divorce could not be effected within 
     <lb/>
     their limits. At present some of the states 
     <lb/>
     have divorce laws, while others have not; 
     <lb/>
     divorce is not permitted everywhere. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) In the same way as regards the 
     <lb/>
     militia; the people will tell you that they 
     <lb/>
     might do like Vermont, which has formed 
     <lb/>
     part of the American union since its found<lb break="no"/>ation, and which never adopted a militia 
     <lb/>
     law until January, 1864, because the political 
     <lb/>
     organization of the United States never 
     <lb/>
     rendered it necessary for the American peo<lb break="no"/>ple to maintain armies in each state in time 
     <lb/>
     of peace, and each state is perfectly free as 
     <lb/>
     regards the organization of its militia, pro<lb break="no"/>vided it furnishes the number of soldiers 
     <lb/>
     assigned to its population, in time of war. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) They do not ruin themselves 
     <lb/>
     in time of peace to organize the militia. A

     great obstacle to the political progress of our 
     <lb/>
     country arises from the vast number of per<lb break="no"/>sons who arrive amongst us each year from 
     <lb/>
     the British Islands ; they are here, bodily, it 
     <lb/>
     is true, but their minds wander over the sea 
     <lb/>
     between the two hemispheres, and they act 
     <lb/>
     as though they were in England, in Scot<lb break="no"/>land, or in Ireland, without considering our 
     <lb/>
     position, our social and political relations ; 
     <lb/>
     and they think they need only cry out 
     <lb/>
     " Loyalty, loyalty !" to make the people rush 
     <lb/>
     to arms ; but I repeat again, that if it be 
     <lb/>
     attempted to force the people into a change 
     <lb/>
     such as is new proposed, the people of the 
     <lb/>
     rural districts will become hostile to those 
     <lb/>
     who force it upon them, and they will not 
     <lb/>
     fight in defence of such a Constitution, as 
     <lb/>
     they would fight in defence of a principle 
     <lb/>
     they approved of, and of a political position 
     <lb/>
     with which they were satisfied. (Hear, hear ) 
     <lb/>
     I have but one word more to say on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, and it is this : it is all very well to 
     <lb/>
     say that the debt of the United States is 
     <lb/>
     enormous ; that will not frighten the people, 
     <lb/>
     for, notwithstanding the war between the 
     <lb/>
     North and the South, if we consider the 
     <lb/>
     wealth and resources of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     that debt will not be by any means so formi<lb break="no"/>dable a matter to deal with as we have been 
     <lb/>
     told In January last, the receipts of 
     <lb/>
     the United States Treasury amounted to 
     <lb/>
     $31,000,000—one million a day ; and notwith<lb break="no"/>standing that fact, despite the heavy taxes 
     <lb/>
     paid, and paid willingly, by the American 
     <lb/>
     people, commercial prosperity is far greater 
     <lb/>
     in that country than it is here, as those who 
     <lb/>
     now visit the country cannot fail to notice. 
     <lb/>
     On the first of December last, the close of 
     <lb/>
     the fiscal year, the debt of the United States 
     <lb/>
     was $1,740,690,480. With a population of 
     <lb/>
     32,000,000 this debt does not, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     exceed $56 per head. I have already 
     <lb/>
     shewn that under Confederation, our debt 
     <lb/>
     would be $40 per head in Canada. Com<lb break="no"/>paring our resources with those of the 
     <lb/>
     American union, we were much more deeply 
     <lb/>
     indebted than they were at the period of the 
     <lb/>
     last annual report of the Treasury. It is 
     <lb/>
     easier for them to collect two dollars than 
     <lb/>
     for us to collect one. But with their im<lb break="no"/>mense resources, their boundless commerce, 
     <lb/>
     their ever-increasing manufactures, if the 
     <lb/>
     war were to end to-morrow, the United 
     <lb/>
     States would pay off their debt in a few 
     <lb/>
     years, if the government continued to levy 
     <lb/>
     the same amount of taxes that they now do. 
     <lb/>
     A revenue of a million a day, $365,000,000 
     <lb/>
     per annum, $3,650,000,000 in ten years !— 


            <cb/>
      

     double the amount of the national debt at 
     <lb/>
     the beginning of the year, notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     the terrible four years' war ! If the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were to reduce the present imposts by 
     <lb/>
     one-half, the debt would be paid off in ten 
     <lb/>
     years ; whereas in ten years from now our own 
     <lb/>
     debt, which is prepertionably considerable, 
     <lb/>
     will have doubled itself, or, it may be, in<lb break="no"/>creased in a much greater ratio, if we are to 
     <lb/>
     judge by presentappearances. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I repeat, I do not ask for the annexa<lb break="no"/>tion of Canada to the United States, 
     <lb/>
     nor do the people desire it ; but I assert 
     <lb/>
     that changes such as those proposed in 
     <lb/>
     our social and political condition, are the 
     <lb/>
     surest means of bringing it about, be<lb break="no"/>cause they are of a nature to create serious 
     <lb/>
     discontent, and a constant conflict between 
     <lb/>
     us and our neighbors ; and the people, far 
     <lb/>
     from being satisfied with that, will be but 
     <lb/>
     ill-inclined to defend such a state of things. 
     <lb/>
     I beg, in conclusion, to call the attention of 
     <lb/>
     hon. members to the fact, that while it is 
     <lb/>
     proposed to change our Constitution, the 
     <lb/>
     Government refuse to give us any details or 
     <lb/>
     explanations as to the proposed changes ; 
     <lb/>
     and I assert that it is our duty not to vote 
     <lb/>
     for these changes blindly. With reference 
     <lb/>
     to what I have said, I have not said it with<lb break="no"/>out well weighing the bearing of my words ; 
     <lb/>
     I am ready to abide the consequences that 
     <lb/>
     may follow. I am in a position to speak 
     <lb/>
     frankly, and I have done so ; for I am not 
     <lb/>
     here to represent my own personal interests, 
     <lb/>
     nor the interests of any individual. I have 
     <lb/>
     spoken the language of facts, I have spoken 
     <lb/>
     as the people would speak throughout all the 
     <lb/>
     rural districts on the south side of the St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence, if they were frankly told how matters 
     <lb/>
     stand, and if the consequences of the violent 
     <lb/>
     changes sought to be effected in our political 
     <lb/>
     condition were explained to them. (Cheers.)

            <p><persName ref="pers:DENI2">Mr. DENIS</persName>—MR. SPEAKER, for a few 
     <lb/>days past we have heard very extraordinary 
     <lb/>speeches from the honorable members of the 
     <lb/>Opposition, occupying seats on the other side 
     <lb/>of the House. Those honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>have taken the interests of the country in 
     <lb/>hand, and undertaken to set them right by 
     <lb/>such speeches as we have just heard from the 
     <lb/>honorable member for Drummond. and <choice><sic>Artha<lb break="no"/>baska</sic><corr>Athabaska</corr></choice> (Mr. J. B. E. DORION).  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName>—Don't crush him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DENI2">MR. DENIS</persName>—I do not wish to crush any 
     <lb/>one; but I must say conscientiously what 
     <lb/>think of the extraordinary speech which he has 
     <lb/>just delivered. The honorable members of 
     <lb/>the Opposition have, since the commencement 


            <pb n="872" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0872.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">872</fw>
          

     of this debate, held one course—they have 
     <lb/>
     constantly appealed to the prejudices of a class 
     <lb/>
    who, for the protection of their interests, 
     <lb/>uniformly depend on those who represent 
     <lb/>them here, and who, in order to make sure of 
     <lb/>their allegiance and perpetuate it, work secretly 
     <lb/>and in the dark to obtain the signatures of 
     <lb/>unsuspecting parties to petitions which they 
     <lb/>send round the country, and use afterwards 
     <lb/>to ensnare the confidence of members of this 
     <lb/>House. (Hear, hear.) Fortunately, they 
     <lb/>have hitherto had but little success in their 
     <lb/>undertakings, and have made but small pro<lb break="no"/>gress in their attempts to injure us. These 
     <lb/>gentlemen make a loud outcry against the 
     <lb/>resolutions introduced by the Government; 
     <lb/>but if they are as bad as they say they are, 
     <lb/>why do they not themselves prepare some 
     <lb/>remedy for the troubles and difficulties of the 
     <lb/>country, instead of limiting their exertions to 
     <lb/>cries and reproaches? But no. It is always 
     <lb/>the same thing with them. "Great cry, and 
     <lb/>little wool." (Hear, hear.) The Opposition 
     <lb/>have always had but one object in view, and 
     <lb/>that was, not the good of the country, but the 
     <lb/>attainment of power. This has been the aim 
     <lb/>of  all their actions, and when they did ac<lb break="no"/>tually, by an accident, acquire power, their 
     <lb/>conduct was far worse than that of which they 
     <lb/>accused their predecessors in office. Their 
     <lb/>intention is to frighten the people, as they did 
     <lb/>on the militia question, by enlisting prejudices 
     <lb/>of all kinds against the measure now under 
     <lb/>discussion—trying every petty subterfuge and 
     <lb/>shabby artifice to bring back the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. A. A. 
     <lb/>DORION) to power. But it will not work— 
     <lb/>their little game will have no luck. To be 
     <lb/>sure, we cannot deny the honorable member 
     <lb/>for Drummond and Arthabaska, for his part, 
     <lb/>the credit of knowing how to work upon 
     <lb/>the people, or rather how to agitate them, 
     <lb/>while they, good  souls, trust blindly to the 
     <lb/>integrity of the men who represent them 
     <lb/>here. It was in this spirit of truth that he 
     <lb/>stated in his strictures on the Militia Bill 
     <lb/>introduced by the CARTIER-MACDONALD 
     <lb/>Government that it was a measure which 
     <lb/>would entail a tax of $20 a head on every 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">habitant</hi>, and it is in the same spirit that he 
     <lb/>now tells them Confederation will entail one 
     <lb/>of $40 a head. One assertion is as true as 
     <lb/>the other—neither of them is worth much. 
     <lb/>How can the honorable member venture on 
     <lb/>such assertions, since he knows nothing of the 
     <lb/>details of the measure—that is, the measures 
     <lb/>of detail which are to come after? He can 
     <lb/>only talk on supposition, and his hypothesis 
    

            <cb/>
         

     is false and unfounded. He declares, for 
     <lb/>
     instance, that the intention of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     in moving for Confederation, is to introduce 
     <lb/>
     monarchy into America, and to create princes, 
     <lb/>
     viceroys, and an aristocracy, and make the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Attorney General for Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) Governor of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Such ideas could never enter any 
     <lb/>
     head but those of men who are incapable of 
     <lb/>
     self-government, and who are good for nothing 
     <lb/>
     but to become demagogues. In good truth, 
     <lb/>
     they mean nothing but to agitate—to make 
     <lb/>
     trouble and sow discontent throughout the 
     <lb/>
     land, with relation to the great question 
     <lb/>
     which has for months been the subject of 
     <lb/>
     discussion. For this end, they get up little 
     <lb/>
     petitions, to be signed in the concessions, 
     <lb/>
     saying to the women,—" If you would not 
     <lb/>
     lose your husband, sign. He is sure to be 
     <lb/>
     drafted for the Confederation. Sign, if you 
     <lb/>
     would not have your children deprived of 
     <lb/>
     their religion!"  (Hear, and laughter.) It is 
     <lb/>
     by such means that they gain their little ad<lb break="no"/>vantages. I have just been informed that 
     <lb/>
     these men, who have always cried out that 
     <lb/>
     the clergy ought not to interfere in politics, 
     <lb/>
     are doing all they can to enlist the clergy and 
     <lb/>
     swell the cry against Confederation, by pro<lb break="no"/>claiming that the Church is in danger. But 
     <lb/>
     the clergy know them too well, and will let 
     <lb/>
     them shout. When I hear these hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     of the Opposition pretend that the clergy are 
     <lb/>
     on their side, because two priests have written 
     <lb/>
     against Confederation in the newspapers, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot help laughing. They are now, for<lb break="no"/>sooth, the saviours of religion and of the 
     <lb/>
     clergy, loving and respecting them above all 
     <lb/>
     things. They spoke another language when 
     <lb/>
     they insulted religion and the clergy in their 
     <lb/>
     journals; when they declared, in their <hi rendition="simple:italic">Institut 
     <lb/>
     Canadien</hi>, that priests ought to be forbidden 
     <lb/>
     to talk politics, and not to be allowed to vote 
     <lb/>
     at elections. Let them recollect the famous 
     <lb/>
     parody on excommunication, published in the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pays</hi>, which never existed save in the narrow 
     <lb/>
     and diabolical mind which rules the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Siècle</hi>. 
     <lb/>
     But now all this is to be forgotten; now they 
     <lb/>
     say,—"Give up your leaders—the traitors who 
     <lb/>
     intend to sell the country, betray your reli<lb break="no"/>gion, and drag your nationality through the 
     <lb/>
     mire—and come, follow us!" You smile, be<lb break="no"/>cause you know that all these protestations 
     <lb/>
     which you are making in favor of religion, of 
     <lb/>
     the clergy, and our nationality, are a fine 
     <lb/>
     piece of acting. The people know this, and 
     <lb/>
     will not believe you; they will remain true 
     <lb/>
     to their leaders and to those tried friends 
     <lb/>
     who have always served them well and faith<lb break="no"/>
          
            <pb n="873" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0873.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">873</fw> 
  

     fully. Those who are now in power have on 
     <lb/>
     their side the people and the ecclesiastical 
     <lb/>
     authorities, whom you would use as a stalking 
     <lb/>
     horse in our campaign against Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. All your efforts, all your tricks, will 
     <lb/>
     not succeed in shaking the confidence of the 
     <lb/>
     people in their representatives. You talk of 
     <lb/>
     public meetings, of the people's opinion, pe<lb break="no"/>titions, &amp;c., but why did you not call these 
     <lb/>
     meetings when the members were at home 
     <lb/>
     in their counties, when they might have 
     <lb/>
     met you face to face? You waited, like 
     <lb/>
     cowards, till they had come here to attend 
     <lb/>
     their duties in this House, and set hire<lb break="no"/>ling agents to work to get up those meet<lb break="no"/>ings, expecting an easy victory. We know 
     <lb/>
     perfectly well , for we have proofs, that 
     <lb/>
     agents well paid by a political committee 
     <lb/>
     at Montreal, were sent to all the parishes 
     <lb/>
     to get up meetings against Confederation, at 
     <lb/>
     which they made use of the most contradic<lb break="no"/>tory arguments, varied as occasion required, 
     <lb/>
     to suit their object, which was to induce the 
     <lb/>
     people to declare against the scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     sign petitions accordingly. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     These petitions bear the names of children, 
     <lb/>
     and, in fact, of sucklings, as was proved the 
     <lb/>
     other day by the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Boucherville. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     And if that much is certain, we are justified 
     <lb/>
     in thinking that those agents must have done 
     <lb/>
     something still worse, with which we are not 
     <lb/>
     acquainted, for the purpose of prejudicing 
     <lb/>
     the people against the Government scheme. 
     <lb/>
       Now, I say that in view of all this—in view 
     <lb/>
     of all this underhand trickery and hypocrisy 
     <lb/>
     of the Opposition — all French-Canadians 
     <lb/>
     should unite together in support of a just, 
     <lb/>
     frank and straightforward measure, such as 
     <lb/>
     that now submitted to this House. Was it 
     <lb/>
     not stated, long before the meeting of Parliap 
     <lb/>
     ment, that the measure should receive a calm 
     <lb/>
     and fair consideration ? And yet since the 
     <lb/>
     beginning of the discussion we have had 
     <lb/>
     nothing but appeals to prejudice made by the 
     <lb/>
     adversaries o the measure, in place of dis<lb break="no"/>cussing it on its merits, as they ought to have 
     <lb/>
     done. The honorable member for Richelieu 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. PERRAULT) has distinguished himself 
     <lb/>
     in the way of appealing to national and re<lb break="no"/>ligious prejudices, and in order to attain his 
     <lb/>
     object he cited facts long past——drawn, in 
     <lb/>
     fact, from ancient history. We all know the 
     <lb/>
     facts he mentioned ; but why cite them as he 
     <lb/>
     did in such a body as this? It is neither 
     <lb/>
     politic nor right. Our duty as members of 
     <lb/>
     this House is to make laws for the well-being 
     <lb/>
     and prosperity of the country and of all 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
         

     classes of the population, and not to excite 
     <lb/>
     the hatred and prejudices of one section of 
     <lb/>
     the community against another section. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Then, again, what was the gist 
     <lb/>
     of the speech just made by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Drummond and Arthabaska (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     J. B. E. DORION)—who certainly, I must 
     <lb/>
     admit, possesses oratorical ability, as well as 
     <lb/>
     other gifts? It was just simply a compari<lb break="no"/>son between our Goverment and that of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and of course he gave the 
     <lb/>
     preference to the latter. .The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member is never weary of looking to Wash<lb break="no"/>ington with one eye. (Hear, hear.) Why 
     <lb/>
     does not the honorable member tell us frank<lb break="no"/>ly at once that he desires the annexation of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to the United States? For, if we 
     <lb/>
     are to believe his statements, the American 
     <lb/>
     Government is an extraordinary government, 
     <lb/>
     a model government, a government unequalled 
     <lb/>
     in the world! But no; instead of giving 
     <lb/>
     us the benefit of his real thoughts, he stops 
     <lb/>
     short at insinuations, and comparisons of the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure attending the two forms of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, in order to leave an impression on 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the people. (Hear, hear.) An<lb break="no"/>other hon. member of this House, who is not 
     <lb/>
     in the habit of appealing to the religious or 
     <lb/>
     national prejudices of the people—the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Bagot (Hon.Mr.LAFRAMBOISE)— 
     <lb/>
     has thought proper, this evening, to join in 
     <lb/>
     the outcry of the Opposition on this subject. 
     <lb/>
     He cited an event which has just occurred at 
     <lb/>
     Toronto, and which everybody regrets, and 
     <lb/>
     used it as an argument against the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation submitted to us by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Why drag that fact into the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of a great question, and at a solemn 
     <lb/>
     moment like this? I do think that it was 
     <lb/>
     hardly becoming in an honorable ex-minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Crown to say to this House,—" Two 
     <lb/>
     sisters of charity have been insulted in the 
     <lb/>
     streets of Toronto; <hi rendition="simple:italic">ergo</hi>, sisters of charity 
     <lb/>
     will not be tolerated under Confederation; 
     <lb/>
     the clergy will be persecuted, and religion an<lb break="no"/>nihilate." But this style of argument is re<lb break="no"/>sorted to somewhat too tardily. These pro<lb break="no"/>testations of devotedness to religion and to 
     <lb/>
     the clergy come too late to be believed by the 
     <lb/>
     people of Lower Canada, or to make any im<lb break="no"/>pression on them. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Richelieu also indulgedl   in insin<lb break="no"/>uations against the Honorable President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN), and stated 
     <lb/>
     that he was still as great a fanatic as ever 
     <lb/>
    against our religion and our clergy. Certain<lb break="no"/>ly, the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>was wrong in speaking as he formerly did, 
   

            <pb n="874" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0874.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">874</fw>
         

     when he was in the ranks of the Opposition ; 
     <lb/>
     but how much more culpable was it not in 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rouges</hi> to support him at that very time ? 
     <lb/>
     The members of the Opposition reproach us 
     <lb/>
     to-day with supporting the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council, and blame us for things we have 
     <lb/>
     not done. We blamed the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council for attacking our clergy and in<lb break="no"/>sulting what we respect most. We opposed 
     <lb/>
     him with all our strength, but at that very 
     <lb/>
     time the Opposition supported him, and ap<lb break="no"/>proved of everything he said. The people 
     <lb/>know that perfectly well ; they know and ap<lb break="no"/>preciate thoroughly the difference between 
     <lb/>our motives and yours, in opposing the hon. 
     <lb/>member for South Oxford, and you cannot 
     <lb/>deceive them. The people will say to you,— 
     <lb/>" Give us a proof of what you can do ; and if 
     <lb/>you are better than those you attack, we will 
     <lb/>accept your leadership." What crime are we 
     <lb/>charged with to-day by the Opposition ? Af<lb break="no"/>ter numberless fierce struggles, and two gen<lb break="no"/>eral elections, it had become impossible for 
     <lb/>any party to govern the country. The people 
     <lb/>were weary of the whole thing, and wished for 
     <lb/>a change. It was then that a coalition took 
     <lb/>place between the two parties who formed 
     <lb/>the majority in either section of the province. 
     <lb/>The Opposition should not condemn that al<lb break="no"/>liance ; on the contrary, they ought to con<lb break="no"/>tinue to give their support to the honorable 
     <lb/>member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. BROWN), 
     <lb/>since he has formed an alliance with the Hon. 
     <lb/>Attorney General for Lower Canada, in order 
     <lb/>to find some means of carrying on the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and of removing the difficulties by 
     <lb/>which we are surrounded. It has been stated 
     <lb/>that the delegates to the Quebec Conference 
     <lb/>were not empowered to prepare a scheme such 
     <lb/>'as that now before us ; but can it be said 
     <lb/>that the Government had not the right to do 
     <lb/>so ? The Ministry have prepared a scheme 
     <lb/>which they now submit to us, and the ques<lb break="no"/>tion is not as to whether they were or were 
     <lb/>not empowered to prepare it, but whether the 
     <lb/>scheme is a good one, whether it is deserving 
     <lb/>of the approval of the people, and for the best 
     <lb/>interests of the province. This it is for us to 
     <lb/>say, and it is all we have to say ; but it is not 
     <lb/>right to accuse hon. Ministers, who have en<lb break="no"/>deavored to discharge their duty and to re<lb break="no"/>lieve the country from its difficulties—it is 
     <lb/>not right to reproach them, after they have 
     <lb/>labored day and night at their task, and to 
     <lb/>tell them they had no right to do what they 
     <lb/>have done. We had a right to expect a 
     <lb/>serious discussion of the Government scheme ;  


    
            <cb/>
           

     but no, we have had nothing of the kind ; we 
     <lb/>
     have had nothing but personal attacks, ap<lb break="no"/>peals to prejudice, and underhand attempts 
     <lb/>
     out of doors against the scheme. We have 
     <lb/>
     had a crop of suppositions and insinuations 
     <lb/>
     against this man and that man. It is " sup<lb break="no"/>posed " that the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     for Lower Canada desires to become a gover<lb break="no"/>nor ; another is accused of desiring to be 
     <lb/>
     made a judge of a Federal court, and every 
     <lb/>
     hon. member of this House favorable to the 
     <lb/>
     Government scheme is accused of aiming at 
     <lb/>
     making money, obtaining a place or honors, 
     <lb/>
     by betraying and selling the cause of the 
     <lb/>
     people. This is certainly most unjust, and 
     <lb/>
     every one of these suppositions is utterly un<lb break="no"/>warranted. Those who indulge in them have 
     <lb/>
     not a shadow of proof to bring forward in 
     <lb/>
     support of their assertions, and the would, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, be much better employed in a calm 
     <lb/>
     and deliberate discussion of the measure it<lb break="no"/>self. (Hear, hear.) Other hon. members, 
     <lb/>
     with a view of opposing the Government 
     <lb/>
     scheme and depreciating it in the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the people, have made use of the name of an 
     <lb/>
     honored citizen, now living in the retirement 
     <lb/>
     of private life. The honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Bagot (Hon. Mr. LAFRAMBOISE) told us 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. C. S. CHERRIER, of Montreal, was 
     <lb/>
     strongly opposed to the scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and that his opinion should have great 
     <lb/>
     weight, because he is a " devout " man. Now, 
     <lb/>
     I should like to know, Mr. SPEAKER, what 
     <lb/>
     connection there can possibly exist between 
     <lb/>
     religious devotion and a discussion such as 
     <lb/>
     this ? I was really sorry to hear such lan<lb break="no"/>guage fall from the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Bagot, for he is not in the habit of making 
     <lb/>
     use of arguments of that kind. It is 
     <lb/>
     utterly astounding to see the party who 
     <lb/>
     wanted to shut up the priests in their vestries, 
     <lb/>
     and deny them the right to hold any political 
     <lb/>
     opinions, using Mr. CHERRIER'S devotion as a 
     <lb/>
     weapon wherewith to combat Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But what is the origin of the 
     <lb/>
     great agitation promoted by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION), since the 
     <lb/>
     alliance of the Conservative party with the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. President of the Council ? Has he 
     <lb/>
     forgotten that he himself carried out im<lb break="no"/>plicitly the behests of that hon. gentleman all 
     <lb/>
     the time they worked together ? And if not, 
     <lb/>
     how can be possibly make it a crime in others 
     <lb/>
     to work with him ? Was he not aware that 
     <lb/>
     his own Government—the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Cornwall (Hon. J. S. MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD)—existed only at his will, that the 
   

            <pb n="875" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0875.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">875</fw>
         

     Hon. President of the Council chastised that 
     <lb/>
     Government for its most trifling backslidings ; 
     <lb/>
     and that whenever he threatened, the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment quickly mended its ways? To-day you 
     <lb/>
     speak of the vast expenditure of the province ; 
     <lb/>
     but you formed part of a Ministry which prom<lb break="no"/>ised wonders to the country, and what did it 
     <lb/>
     do after all? The facts are there; and 
     <lb/>
       surely it ill-becomes you to speak of extrav<lb break="no"/>agant expenditure. Hon. gentlemen exclaim<lb break="no"/>" $40 per head!" They do not, it is true, 
     <lb/>
     tell us that the high price of molasses is due 
     <lb/>
     to CARTIER and J. A. MACDONALD—(laugh<lb break="no"/>ter)—but they everywhere assert that these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen want to ruin the people, increase 
     <lb/>
     the taxes, and plunge the country into an 
     <lb/>
     ocean of debt. And yet honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite have themselves been in power, and 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding all their previous denuncia<lb break="no"/>tions of taxation and extravagant expenditure, 
     <lb/>
     they were forced to admit the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     customs duties, and to work out responsible 
     <lb/>
     government ; they found it necessary to 
     <lb/>
     retract all they had said in former speeches, 
     <lb/>
     when they themselves held the reins of power. 
     <lb/>
     But they did not remain in office long enough 
     <lb/>
     to get rid of the old leaven completely, and 
     <lb/>
     now that they are out of power once more, 
     <lb/>
     we find them taking up their former cries. 
     <lb/>
     We have the honorable members for Chateau<lb break="no"/>guay and Hochelaga, who once had a Con<lb break="no"/>federation scheme of their own, opposing the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of the Government, simply because it 
     <lb/>
     did not originate with themselves, and op<lb break="no"/>posing the adoption of any measure-for the 
     <lb/>
     defence of the country. These honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen stated, through their organ <hi rendition="simple:italic">Le 
     <lb/>
     Pays</hi>, that if England desires to retain 
     <lb/>
     Canada, she should pay for its defences. This 
     <lb/>
     is not said so openly now, but the great wealth 
     <lb/>
     of the United States, the immense number of 
     <lb/>
     their guns, ships of war and armies, are used 
     <lb/>
     as arguments to shew the uselessness of any 
     <lb/>
     attempt on our part to defend ourselves in 
     <lb/>
     case of attack, and also to lead the peeple to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that it is better for the country 
     <lb/>
     not to expend anything for defence. When 
     <lb/>
     the CARTIER-MACDONALD Government was 
     <lb/>
     defeated on a question of loyalty towards the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government, the whole Opposition 
     <lb/>
     voted against the principle of organizing the 
     <lb/>
     militia for our defence. The leaders of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition then voted unflinchingly against 
     <lb/>
     a Militia law; but three or four days after, 
     <lb/>
     when they had succeeded in taking the place 
     <lb/>
     of those whom they had defeated, they them<lb break="no"/>selves voted, without scruple or hesitation, 
     <lb/>
     $600,000 for the organization of the militia. 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     They appointed instructors throughout the 
     <lb/>
     whole country, for they had learned that as 
     <lb/>
     British subjects they had duties towards the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government. Today they are 
     <lb/>
     acting as they then acted, and they desire 
     <lb/>
     once more to play a double game. They do 
     <lb/>
     not want Confederation, but they admit that 
     <lb/>
     there is need of a remedy for our sectional 
     <lb/>
     difliculties, of the existence of which there 
     <lb/>
     can be no question. Yet they refuse to say 
     <lb/>
     what reme y they propose for our difliculties. 
     <lb/>
     They keep it all to themselves, shut up in 
     <lb/>
     their own minds, as they did with the cele<lb break="no"/>brated budget of the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Chateauguay, which was to be the cure for all 
     <lb/>
     our financial difliculties, but which never saw 
     <lb/>
     the light. Eighteen months of incubation did 
     <lb/>
     not sufiice to bring forth the bantling. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear, and laughter.) If the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should not succeed in inducing all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces to accept the scheme, they, at all 
     <lb/>
     events, will have kept their word and kept 
     <lb/>
     the faith which is due to a treaty solemnly con<lb break="no"/>tracted between the Provinces of British North 
     <lb/>
     America. The hon. member for Chateau<lb break="no"/>guay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON) has told us that he 
     <lb/>
     had received a telegraphic despatch, by which 
     <lb/>
     he had positive information that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces had rejected Confeder— 
     <lb/>
     ation, and that they had pronounced against 
     <lb/>
     it in New Brunswick. But what does all 
     <lb/>
     that amount to ? Ought we on that account 
     <lb/>
     also to reject the scheme of the Government? 
     <lb/>
     Are we not bound to this scheme by the word 
     <lb/>
     of our Ministers ? No, we hold to this 
     <lb/>
     great scheme of Confederation, and we want 
     <lb/>
     no little schemes such as are proposed by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House—schemes by which they would appoint 
     <lb/>
     little judges and divide Canada into little dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. The Opposition, it is true, have 
     <lb/>
     created a certain amount of distrust in this 
     <lb/>
     scheme among the people, by harping on 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation, and declaring that Canada 
     <lb/>
     will be obliged to tax herself in order to pur 
     <lb/>
     chase and defend the territory of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. They hope by these means to 
     <lb/>
     gain the confidence of the people, and to 
     <lb/>
     return to power; but even if they succeeded, 
     <lb/>
     they would be obliged to do later what they 
     <lb/>
     have already done, what they now con<lb break="no"/>demn, and what the men now in power are 
     <lb/>
     desirous of doing in the interest of the people; 
     <lb/>
     they would be obliged to organize the defences 
     <lb/>
     of the country, as the Government propose to 
     <lb/>
     do, and as the Imperial Government desire. 
     <lb/>
     At the present moment we have to choose one 
     <lb/>
     of two alternatives—either we must annex 


            <pb n="876" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0876.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">876</fw>
        

     ourselves to the United States, or we must 
     <lb/>
     respect the wishes of England and accept 
     <lb/>
     Confederation with the Maritime Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     If we do not desire either Confederation or 
     <lb/>
     annexation, we must remain as we are and 
     <lb/>
     continue to struggle with Upper Canada; and 
     <lb/>
     in the meantime the people will remain behind 
     <lb/>
     their plough, business will be at a stand-still, 
     <lb/>
     and the debt will be increased by millions. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) For several days past, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, we have listened to pompous 
     <lb/>
     speeches made by honorable members of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, appealing incessantly to the reli<lb break="no"/>gious and national prejudices of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Lower Canada, with the view of de<lb break="no"/>feating the Government scheme. These hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen draw pictures which are 
     <lb/>
     really heartrending. They tell the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants that under Confederation they will lose 
     <lb/>
     all their rights in Lower Canada in respect 
     <lb/>
     of the education of their children ; and, on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand, they tell the Catholics that 
     <lb/>
     their religion is in danger, because the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Government will have the right of <hi rendition="simple:italic">veto</hi> 
     <lb/>
     in respect of all the measures of the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government. But this right of <hi rendition="simple:italic">veto</hi> must of 
     <lb/>
     necessity exist somewhere, in order that the 
     <lb/>
     minority may be protected from any injustice 
     <lb/>
     which the majority might attempt to do them. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot hope to have the majority in the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament, when we French Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians and Catholics have never had it 
     <lb/>
     under the existing union. And yet we cannot 
     <lb/>
     but congratulate ourselves upon the relations 
     <lb/>
     which have always existed between us and 
     <lb/>
     our fellow-countrymen of other origins and re<lb break="no"/>ligions. The Benning Divorce Bill affords 
     <lb/>
     a proof that we are in a minority in the present 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, for the Protestants all voted in 
     <lb/>
     favor of that measure, and the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     against it, and the bill was passed. The 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, then, are wrong when they exclaim 
     <lb/>
     that we ought to unite and carry out our own 
     <lb/>
     religious views and secure the triumph of 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian nationality ; doing so will 
     <lb/>
     only have the effect of exciting the Protestants 
     <lb/>
     and the British-Canadians to do the same 
     <lb/>
     thing, and then we should fall into a state 
     <lb/>
     of anarchy. One night last week, about 
     <lb/>
     midnight, an honorable member of this House, 
     <lb/>
     an ex-Minister, the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Cornwall (Honorable J. S. MACDONALD) 
     <lb/>
     forgot his position so far as to seek to excite 
     <lb/>
     religious jealousies and hatreds ; but I am 
     <lb/>
     happy to see that he has not succeeded in his 
     <lb/>
     attempt, and that Catholics and Protestants 
     <lb/>
     have treated his fanatical appeals with con<lb break="no"/>tempt, and have made no response. After 
   

            <cb/>
      

     having heard this, can any one believe in the 
     <lb/>
     reality of all these anticipations of danger 
     <lb/>
     paraded in the newspapers, in the House, and 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country ? No, it is impossi<lb break="no"/>ble to believe in it, and not to perceive that 
     <lb/>
     it is all hypocrisy, with the view of exciting 
     <lb/>
     the prejudices of the people. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It has been also said that the use of our 
     <lb/>
     language was in danger, and that the French 
     <lb/>
     laws would disappear when Confederation 
     <lb/>
     was accomplished. But is it not a well-known 
     <lb/>
     fact that we owe the protection of our French 
     <lb/>
     laws to the Hon. Attorney General for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER), and is not the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Code Civil</hi>, which he has just laid before us, 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient answer to all that can be asserted 
     <lb/>
     on this head ? The French laws will be 
     <lb/>
     maintained and respected in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and this we owe to the Hon. Attorney Gene<lb break="no"/>ral (Hon. Mr. CARTIER). We shall have a 
     <lb/>
     statute to assimilate the law of evidence in 
     <lb/>
     commercial matters in Lower Canada ; but 
     <lb/>
     the French laws will not be abolished. If 
     <lb/>
     there is a man in the whole country who pos<lb break="no"/>sesses real legal judgment, and who is per<lb break="no"/>fectly acquainted with the laws and statutes 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, it is certainly the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Lower Canada, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     GEORGE ETIENNE CARTIER. No one will 
     <lb/>
     deny this, and there is not a man who can 
     <lb/>
     compete with him in this respect. Why 
     <lb/>
     come here and tell us that our language is 
     <lb/>
     about to disappear, and that its use is to be 
     <lb/>
     abolished in the Federal Legislature ? Is it 
     <lb/>
     because lies must be told in order to oppose 
     <lb/>
     the scheme of the Government, and real rea<lb break="no"/>sons for opposition cannot be found ? A 
     <lb/>
     drowning man catches at a straw, and that is 
     <lb/>
     what the Opposition are doing to-day. But 
     <lb/>
     they ought to be just, and to admit that we 
     <lb/>
     shall have our code, which will guarantee to 
     <lb/>
     us the maintenance of our laws in Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, just as the Imperial Act will guar<lb break="no"/>antee to us the use of our language. Why, 
     <lb/>
     too, should personal recrimination be indulged 
     <lb/>
     in, in this discussion ? " CARTIER," they 
     <lb/>
     say, " does this because he wants to be Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor."

     use of here, out of respect for ourselves and 
     <lb/>
     for the French-Canadians in this House. It 
     <lb/>
     is a great mistake on the part of a beardless 
     <lb/>
     youth, with no more experience than the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Richelieu, particularly 
     <lb/>
     when he is addressing men of the ex<lb break="no"/>perience and capacity of the Honorable At<lb break="no"/>torney General for Lower Canada. All 
     <lb/>
     parties agree in saying that the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General East is capable, honest, and of the 
     <lb/>
     highest integrity ; but all do not approve of his 
     <lb/>
     policy, and that is perfectly legitimate. But 
     <lb/>
     that is no reason for attacking his private 
     <lb/>
     character, and putting in his mouth opinions 
     <lb/>
     which he has never uttered. They say he is 
     <lb/>
     honest and upright, and yet we read in the 
     <lb/>
     newspapers that he is willing to sell his coun<lb break="no"/>try, his religion and his nationality for a 
     <lb/>
     title or an appointment as Governor. This 
     <lb/>
     is very unfair. (Hear, hear.) The members 
     <lb/>
     of the Opposition demand an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people upon the question of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
    But if it were granted, you would see, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, to what lengths they would go. 
     <lb/>These demands for an appeal to the people 
     <lb/>are only made with the view of serving the 
     <lb/>purposes of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">clique</hi>, who would say to those 
     <lb/>who desired to discuss frankly the question 
     <lb/>before the country—" Hold your tongues and 
     <lb/>vote against the Government !" This is what 
     <lb/>they have already attempted to do by means 
     <lb/>of meetings which they have caused to be 
     <lb/>held in different counties ; but I must say 
     <lb/>that in mine they did not succeed in their 
     <lb/>designs. They sent three agents there, under 
     <lb/>different pretexts, who tried by every possible 
     <lb/>means to induce the people to pronounce 
     <lb/>against the Ministerial scheme ; but they did 
     <lb/>not succeed ; and yet I am the humblest 
     <lb/>member of this honorable House. But as I 
     <lb/>happened just at that time to be attending to 
     <lb/>the duties of my profession at the court of the 
     <lb/>district of Beauharnois, I observed that these 
     <lb/>agents had been sent by the Montreal com<lb break="no"/>mittee, and I was enabled to defeat their little 
     <lb/>plans and their little games. They tried to 
     <lb/>make little speeches, and hold little meetings, 
     <lb/>but as I was on the spot they gained nothing 
     <lb/>by it. But all this serves to indicate the 
     <lb/>means that have been employed by the par<lb break="no"/>tisans of the Opposition to excite the people 
     <lb/>against the measure of Confederation. I do 
     <lb/>not want to be too hard upon them, because 
     <lb/>they naturally were desirous of obtaining a 
     <lb/>triumph for their party, and they employed 
     <lb/>these means as they might have employed 
     <lb/>others, although they do not care a rush for 
     <lb/>the holy cause of nationality or religion. 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          

     (Hear, hear.) I remember very well what 
     <lb/>
     used to be said and what used to be done in 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Institut Canadien</hi> of Montreal, and I 
     <lb/>
     observe with satisfaction that the present con<lb break="no"/>duct of the honorable members of the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House who belonged to that <hi rendition="simple:italic">Insti<lb break="no"/>tut</hi> is a direct protest against what they did 
     <lb/>
     in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Institut</hi>, in which we have had <hi rendition="simple:italic">Suisses</hi> 
     <lb/>
     coming and preaching religious toleration. 
     <lb/>
     Then it used to be said—" We must advance 
     <lb/>
     with the times," and they used to read the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pucelle</hi>. (Hear, hear.) Now, the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment does not propose to establish the annual 
     <lb/>
     parliaments, that the hon. member for Hoche<lb break="no"/>laga used to cry out for, but they are engaged 
     <lb/>
     in settling the difficulties of the country. They 
     <lb/>
     call upon every man of talent to aid them in this 
     <lb/>
     task, or to invent a better remedy for these 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, and to submit it to the country. 
     <lb/>
     But if those who oppose the Government 
     <lb/>
     measure are contented with mere opposition, 
     <lb/>
     without proposing any better measure in its 
     <lb/>
     stead, what will the people say to them if they 
     <lb/>
     present themselves to their constituents, to 
     <lb/>
     ask them to pronounce between them and the 
     <lb/>
    Government ? They will say—" What have 
     <lb/>you done ; what have you to offer to compare 
     <lb/>with what the Ministers have done and offered 
     <lb/>to us ?" They will ask them for their 
     <lb/>measure, but they will keep it hidden away 
     <lb/>with that famous budget of the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Chateauguay, which has not yet 
     <lb/>been hatched after eighteen months' incuba<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear, hear.) We know perfectly 
     <lb/>well that the Government measure is not per<lb break="no"/>fect, and that it has defects, as all plans made 
     <lb/>by men must have. For my part I admit it 
     <lb/>most willingly ; but it must be remembered 
     <lb/>that it is a compromise, and this the gentle<lb break="no"/>men of the Opposition take care not to 
     <lb/>allow for or to state. In public they say that 
     <lb/>the French-Canadians are going to be over<lb break="no"/>whelmed by the English element in the Con<lb break="no"/>federation, and that they will lose their lan<lb break="no"/>guage. But do they not know that in Upper 
     <lb/>Canada the French language has been pre<lb break="no"/>served as pure and unalloyed as in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, wherever there is the smallest nucleus 
     <lb/>of French inhabitants ? The members on the 
     <lb/>other side propose giving us lessons in the 
     <lb/>art of preserving our language and our nation<lb break="no"/>ality —they, annexationists at heart and in 
     <lb/>their actions, who are always looking to Wash<lb break="no"/>ington. I do not say that it is a crime to be 
     <lb/>an annexationist, but at least let them frankly 
     <lb/>admit what they are. Thus the honorable 
     <lb/>member for Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON) 
     <lb/>is more of a Yankee than any one. He told us 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="878" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0878.jpg"/>

     to-day he did not like great undertakings, 
     <lb/>
     but it seems to me that certain great under<lb break="no"/>takings in which he has had a hand, have not 
     <lb/>
     had the effect of emptying his purse. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Why should the country be prevented 
     <lb/>
     from advancing in the way of progress ; why 
     <lb/>
     prevent the construction of means of com<lb break="no"/>munication, which will have the effect of 
     <lb/>
     keeping our French-Canadians in the country ? 
     <lb/>
     You seem to forget your words and deeds of 
     <lb/>
     yesterday. When he occupied a seat on the 
     <lb/>
     Treasury benches, the honorable member for 
     <lb/>
     Chateauguay was constantly rising to tell us 
     <lb/>
     that we were a factious Opposition, a dreadful 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, because we did not allow the 
     <lb/>
     Government to do just what they liked. 
     <lb/>
     But he does not think his own opposition to<lb break="no"/>day factious, he who has risen fifty-five times 
     <lb/>
     in the course of this debate, and who cuts up 
     <lb/>
     every question like fresh butter. He says to<lb break="no"/>day that the Government wishes to choke off 
     <lb/>
     discussion and to prevent the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition from speaking, and yet he has spo<lb break="no"/>ken fifty-five times ! The hon. member for Lot<lb break="no"/>biniere (Mr. JOLY) told us, the other day, that 
     <lb/>
     the people are in a condition of torpor, and 
     <lb/>
     that they must be awakened. If they are in 
     <lb/>
     a condition of torpor anywhere, they are cer<lb break="no"/>tainly not so in Lower Canada ; but if they 
     <lb/>
     were, they would undoubtedly be awakened 
     <lb/>
     by all the fine speeches delivered by honor<lb break="no"/>able members on the other side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     and on observing the great resistance which 
     <lb/>
     they offer to divorce and their fervent energy 
     <lb/>
     in maintaining family ties unbroken. Those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen loudly proclaim to us that we ought 
     <lb/>
     not to vote for divorce; but it is quite unne<lb break="no"/>cessary for them to tell us so—all Catholics 
     <lb/>
     are perfectly well aware that it is their duty 
     <lb/>
     to vote against divorce. We know that the 
     <lb/>
     laws of Parliament cannot prevail over those 
     <lb/>
     of the Church. And we are not voting for 
     <lb/>
     divorce in voting for the scheme of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation ; and the declamations of hon. members 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House, on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, cannot carry conviction into the minds 
     <lb/>
     of any one. Nobody asks us to enact a law 
     <lb/>
     to allow civil magistrates to celebrate mar<lb break="no"/>riages, and all that is said by the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     in relation to this question only amounts to a 
     <lb/>
     tempest in a tea-pot. At any rate we may 
     <lb/>
     congratulate ourselves upon the conversion of 
     <lb/>
     hen. members, and now they need only tell 
     <lb/>
     the truth for the future, and their past sins 
     <lb/>
     will be forgiven them. However, although 
     <lb/>
     they constitute themselves the protectors of 
     <lb/>
     our religion and nationality, it is evident that 
     <lb/>
     the people do not yet very firmly believe in 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
           

     their conversion, and that they have not yet 
     <lb/>
     attained the confidence of the country ; for 
     <lb/>
     otherwise the plan of the Government is 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently new and sufficiently little under<lb break="no"/>stood to allow of their having a chance of 
     <lb/>
     returning to power. (Hear.) The people, 
     <lb/>
     in view of all their fine declarations, will 
     <lb/>
     probably think that they are going to ally 
     <lb/>
     themselves with our friends ; but if they do 
     <lb/>
     not do so, it will then be perceived that they 
     <lb/>
     are not sincere, and then so much the worse 
     <lb/>
     for them. In the meantime the people will 
     <lb/>
     consider the scheme which is submitted to us, 
     <lb/>
     and will judge it upon its merits, without 
     <lb/>
     allowing themselves to be led away by 
     <lb/>
     appeals to prejudices and insinuations made by 
     <lb/>
     honorable members on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House. I shall, at a later period, upon 
     <lb/>
     the question itself, but I will not follow the 
     <lb/>
     example of the honorable member for Riche<lb break="no"/>lieu, who gave us along speech with the help of 
     <lb/>
     GARNEAU'S <hi rendition="simple:italic">History of Canada</hi>, which he read 
     <lb/>
     out nearly from one end to the other. Nor 
     <lb/>
     will I utter threats either, and no one 
     <lb/>
     of us will say, "If matters do not go on in 
     <lb/>
     this way, or in that, you will see." In a 
     <lb/>
     country like ours, we do not say "you will 
     <lb/>
     see !"  To do so is to try to create useless 
     <lb/>
     excitement among the people, and all honest 
     <lb/>
     men should reprove such conduct. Besides, 
     <lb/>
     who is the man who has influence enough 
     <lb/>
     to raise the people at the present moment? 
     <lb/>
     Certainly not our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     CHERRIER, for he is too peaceable, too devout, 
     <lb/>
     and too good a Catholic to tell the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian people to rise and fight against the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of the Government by force of arms. 
     <lb/>
     No, he will rather tell them to respect 
     <lb/>
     authority, and claim their rights if they 
     <lb/>
     consider themselves injured, because he is 
     <lb/>
     aware that it is better to respect one's father 
     <lb/>
     than to fight against him. As to Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     PAPINEAU, that distinguished man has 
     <lb/>
     undergone mortification enough in his public 
     <lb/>
     life, and feels enough regret for his friends 
     <lb/>
     and fellow-countrymen who perished at St. 
     <lb/>
     Denis and elsewhere, to prevent his wishing 
     <lb/>
     to recommence playing that game. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Bagot reproached the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General for Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     with having been present at St. Denis, and 
     <lb/>
     with having returned from thence. Would 
     <lb/>
     he have preferred to have seen him lying 
     <lb/>
     amid the dead and mingling his ashes with 
     <lb/>
     those of the victims who perished there ? 
     <lb/>

     having done this when he was young, and yet 
     <lb/>
     you say that you would do the same if you 
     <lb/>
     were powerful enough to undertake it. That 
     <lb/>
     is no argument, and that is not what we ought 
     <lb/>
     to do. We ought to say to England that it 
     <lb/>
     is our wish to remain under the shadow of her 
     <lb/>
     noble flag ; that we stand in fear of our neigh<lb break="no"/>bors, and are desirous of knowing what she 
     <lb/>
     can do to help us. It is in this way that our 
     <lb/>
     Ministers should approach the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and if the negotiations do not ter<lb break="no"/>minate in a satisfactory manner, then it will 
     <lb/>
     be time to separate and to seek another state 
     <lb/>
     of existence. The debate has taken too 
     <lb/>
     personal a turn, and we have listened to ac<lb break="no"/>cusations and insinuations against this per<lb break="no"/>son and that person ; but as the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     has nothing better to suggest to us than what 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to us by the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, they cannot hope that members on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House will support them 
     <lb/>
     with the sole object of defeating the Admin<lb break="no"/>istration. Gentlemen on the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     benches call for the details, but their lead<lb break="no"/>ers may be called upon to say what they 
     <lb/>
     suggest to bring the country forth from the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties in which it is plunged. What 
     <lb/>
     they desire is the <hi rendition="simple:italic">status quo</hi>. But let them 
     <lb/>
     propose something practical to us ; let them 
     <lb/>
     say what they want and what they can do. 
     <lb/>
     Instead of this we hear from them nothing 
     <lb/>
     but recriminations and perpetual fault-find<lb break="no"/>ing. They ask why the Government does not 
     <lb/>
     now state how the local governments are to 
     <lb/>
     be organised ; but the reply to this question 
     <lb/>
     made by the Hon. Attorney General for 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, was very just, when he told 
     <lb/>
     them that the Government wished first to 
     <lb/>
     know whether we were favorable to Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and that then they would bring forward 
     <lb/>
     the details. This is perfectly fair, and we 
     <lb/>
     must not mix up the cards. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I do not wish to speak at greater length 
     <lb/>
     at present; but I must allude, however, to 
     <lb/>
     the continual assertion of the. honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. Do<lb break="no"/>RION) with respect to the enormous na<lb break="no"/>tional debt which Confederation will entail. 
     <lb/>
     Why does he not take account of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     which induce the Lower Provinces to refuse 
     <lb/>
     Confederation ? Is it because those reasons 
     <lb/>
     are fatal to his arguments ? In fact the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces declare that our Ministers 
     <lb/>
     wished to obtain too much for Canada, that 
     <lb/>
     the burthens to be laid upon them are too 
     <lb/>
     heavy, and that an alliance with us would 
     <lb/>
     ruin them : whilst honorable members on 

            <cb/>
        

     the other side of the House declare that 
     <lb/>
     they will none of this alliance, because we 
     <lb/>
     grant too much to the Lower Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     'Those provinces say that Confederation will 
     <lb/>
     not be advantageous to them, because they 
     <lb/>
     will be compelled to pay for the canals, the 
     <lb/>
     railways and other improvements in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and because they would derive no advantage 
     <lb/>
     from an alliance with us. Besides, those 
     <lb/>
     provinces are now in the hands of agents of 
     <lb/>
     the United States, whose great object is to 
     <lb/>
     prevent the success of Confederation, be<lb break="no"/>cause it would be fatal to their trade with 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. That is why they labored, 
     <lb/>
     and labored successfully, to prevent the 
     <lb/>
     election of the partisans of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick, just as they would do 
     <lb/>
     all in their power to prevent our elec<lb break="no"/>tions here, if an appeal to the people 
     <lb/>
     should be had on the question, for they 
     <lb/>
     would work in the interest of the United 
     <lb/>
     States. (Opposition laughter.) I see the

     the Seigniorial bill and the Municipal bill—

     two measures which have called forth the

     The instant a man holds a different opinion

     <lb/>
     to the men to whom the peeple have delega<lb break="no"/>ted the duty of watching over and protect<lb break="no"/>ing it, and we shall not follow the leading 
     <lb/>
     of men like those who are opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     plan of Confederation. (Ministerial cheers, 
     <lb/>
     and ironical Opposition laughter.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:POUL2">MR. POULIOT</persName> said - Mr. SPEAKER, it 
     <lb/>
     was my intention, before recording my vote 
     <lb/>
     on the resolutions which are now before the 
     <lb/>
     House, to make some remarks respecting 
     <lb/>
     them at much greater length than I shall 
     <lb/>
     now do ; for now we find that this new 
     <lb/>
     being, which was to be brought forth in 
     <lb/>
     order to save the country, has already per<lb break="no"/>ished while still in embryo, from the violent 
     <lb/>
     blow which it has received in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick ; and if we still turn our attention to 
     <lb/>
     it, our doing so is certainly only in order to 
     <lb/>
     relieve the womb of its mother, whom it 
     <lb/>
     greatly inconveniences, and who would ul<lb break="no"/>timately have been destroyed by it. There 
     <lb/>
     is, therefore, nothing left for us to do, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, but to join in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">libera</hi> and to 
     <lb/>
     chant <hi rendition="simple:italic">requiescat in pace</hi>—(laughter)—and 
     <lb/>
     that, I think, the whole of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     will sing with a great deal of pleasure, 
     <lb/>
     giving, at the same time, thanks to that 
     <lb/>
     Providence which, we love to think, watches 
     <lb/>
     with special care over our beloved Canada, 
     <lb/>
     for having preserved us from being plunged 
     <lb/>
     into the abyss, on the verge of which we 
     <lb/>
     were standing, and to charge the honorable 
     <lb/>
    entlemen who sit on the other side of this 
     <lb/>House to go to England and deliver its 
     <lb/>funeral oration. (Hear, hear.) Yet, though 
     <lb/>such is the case, Mr. SPEAKER, the excep<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
       

     tional position in which the county which I 
     <lb/>
     have the honor to represent here, and the 
     <lb/>
     position which an effort has been made to 
     <lb/>
     describe me as occupying in this House, by 
     <lb/>
     the assertion that I do not represent the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of my constituents in relation to 
     <lb/>
     this great question, compel me, before vot<lb break="no"/>ing, to hold up to view the special situation 
     <lb/>
     of my county and to shew that in voting as 
     <lb/>
     I propose to do, I shall be doing no more 
     <lb/>
     than carrying out and executing the wishes 
     <lb/>
     of the electors whom I represent. I should 
     <lb/>
     wish that several of the members who are 
     <lb/>
     going to vote on the opposite side may be 
     <lb/>
     able to shew as good grounds in support of 
     <lb/>
     their votes. (Hear, hear.) It is true that 
     <lb/>
     a meeting, called by myself in my double 
     <lb/>
     capacity as warden of the county and mem<lb break="no"/>ber representing it, was held in my county, 
     <lb/>
     and that at that meeting there was some 
     <lb/>
     disturbance which prevented an expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion in relation to Confederation; 
     <lb/>
     but, Mr. SPEAKER, it is well to know that 
     <lb/>
     that meeting was held only two days before 
     <lb/>
     the balloting for the militia, and that in con<lb break="no"/>sequence great agitation had been got up 
     <lb/>
     among the young men, who are not even 
     <lb/>
     electors, in order to divert the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the meeting from the subject, to discuss 
     <lb/>
     which it had been called together ; and it is 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged, Mr. SPEAKER, that it is 
     <lb/>
     always easy to find a certain number of 
     <lb/>
     people, in any county whatever, who will 
     <lb/>
     be ever ready to create a disturbance if only 
     <lb/>
     they are provided with what is needful, and 
     <lb/>
     such is what took place on the occasion in 
     <lb/>
     question. Since then, however, several of 
     <lb/>
     the principal parishes have pronounced 
     <lb/>
     upon Confederation, as will be seen by the 
     <lb/>
     following resolutions, which I shall take the

            <p>
     I have also other resolutions, identical in 
     <lb/>
     character, adopted in several other parishes 
     <lb/>
     in the county, but I shall abstain from read<lb break="no"/>ing them. (Hear, hear.) Now, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, in order to explain clearly to honorable 
     <lb/>
     members the peculiar position in which the 
     <lb/>
     county which I have the honor to repre<lb break="no"/>sent is placed, I have to inform them that 
     <lb/>
     whatever line is adopted for the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway, if it should be built—and I hope 
     <lb/>
     that it will be built without Confederation— 
     <lb/>
     it must, in any case, pass through the whole 
     <lb/>
     of the county—an extent of more than fifty 
     <lb/>
     miles—and subsequently be carried through 
     <lb/>
     a great extent of virgin forest, to which the 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of my county are the most nearly 
     <lb/>
     situated. The advantages reaped by the 
     <lb/>
     localities, Mr. SPEAKER, in which works of 
     <lb/>
     such magnitude are being carried out, both as 
     <lb/>
     regards their construction and their subse<lb break="no"/>quent maintenance, and the other advantages 
     <lb/>
     accruing to settlements from the building 
     <lb/>
     of a railway, are well known. All this has 
     <lb/>
     been perfectly well understood by the in<lb break="no"/>habitants of my county ; that is to say, that 
     <lb/>
     in respect of material interests,Confederation 
     <lb/>
     might be beneficial to us—an opinion which 
     <lb/>
     I also hold myself; but they have also, how<lb break="no"/>ever, understood that as it is with individ<lb break="no"/>uals, so it is with nations—that the richest 
     <lb/>
     are not always the happiest. And believ<lb break="no"/>ing that the French-Canadian nationality 
     <lb/>
     would be endangered if Confederation 
     <lb/>
     should be carried out, they did not hesitate 
     <lb/>
     for an instant to pronounce against the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     and charged me, as their representative, 
     <lb/>
     to oppose it here in their name; so that in 
     <lb/>
     acting as I am doing, Mr. SPEAKER, I am 
     <lb/>
     merely carrying out their wishes. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
   
            <cb/>
      

     hear.) I must say, Mr. SPEAKER, that I 
     <lb/>
     greatly regret that several of the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     with whom I have worked and with whom I 
     <lb/>
     still work, should have so strongly based 
     <lb/>
     their objections to Confederation on the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Intercolonial Railway. To 
     <lb/>
     listen to those gentlemen, one would really 
     <lb/>
     believe that Canada ends here at Quebec, or 
     <lb/>
     that the part which is situated below is not 
     <lb/>
     worth occupation. I invite those gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     to examine with a little more attention the 
     <lb/>
     map of the province as far as its lower ex<lb break="no"/>tremity—the Bay of Chaleurs and Gaspé, 
     <lb/>
     and they will perceive that it contains a 
     <lb/>
     tolerably vast territory and good land adapt<lb break="no"/>ed for colonization—a fact of which they 
     <lb/>
     may also convince themselves by glancing 
     <lb/>
     at the colonization reports. They will per<lb break="no"/>ceive, I say, that if the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way were made by the line called Major 
     <lb/>
     ROBINSON'S line, but not by New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     as recommended by the resolutions submit<lb break="no"/>ted to us, we should, before many years had 
     <lb/>
     elapsed, see an immense population settled 
     <lb/>
     on that territory, which is capable of con<lb break="no"/>taining more than 100,000 souls; and sev<lb break="no"/>eral of the gentlemen who oppose the con<lb break="no"/>struction of that road, and who reside in 
     <lb/>
     counties in which there is no room for the 
     <lb/>
     surplus population, might induce that sur<lb break="no"/>plus population to go and settle on the ter<lb break="no"/>ritory in question, and would have no rea<lb break="no"/>son to regret having done so. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     And, Mr. SPEAKER, besides the advantages 
     <lb/>
     which that road would bring to the trade of 
     <lb/>
     Canada in general, it would, if made to com<lb break="no"/>municate with the Gulf of St. Lawrence by 
     <lb/>
     way of Ristigouche, have the immediate effect 
     <lb/>
     of imparting an impulse to the working of 
     <lb/>
     our fisheries, which are capable of giving em<lb break="no"/>ployment to several thousand more persons 
     <lb/>
     than are now engaged in them. The effect 
     <lb/>
     of this would be to keep our young men at 
     <lb/>
     home, and even to bring them back from 
     <lb/>
     the United States, where many of them 
     <lb/>
     now are. I, therefore, invite the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who are opposed to the railway in question 
     <lb/>
     to join with us in hurrying the construction 
     <lb/>
     of it, for it will be one of the best means 
     <lb/>
     of restoring equality of population between 
     <lb/>
     the two provinces, and of stifling the cry 
     <lb/>
     which is so deafening to us Lower Canadians 
     <lb/>
     —the cry for representation by population. I 
     <lb/>
     willingly admit, Mr. SPEAKER, that public 
     <lb/>
     opinion below Quebec appeared at first to be 
     <lb/>
     favorable to Confederation, or at least that 
     <lb/>
     there was a disposition to submit to it, be<lb break="no"/>

     cause the public had been made to believe 
     <lb/>
     that government was no longer possible, and 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation was the only means of 
     <lb/>
     settling our difficulties ; but I believe that 
     <lb/>
     that opinion has greatly changed since the 
     <lb/>
     Ministerial explanations have been made 
     <lb/>
     public; for every one expected, and it was 
     <lb/>
     everywhere asserted, that amendments would 
     <lb/>
     be made, and that we should be informed as 
     <lb/>
     to the nature of the local governments, 
     <lb/>
     and as to the debt of Lower Canada. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) With these few remarks, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I shall conclude by saying that I 
     <lb/>
     shall vote against the resolutions in order to 
     <lb/>
     carry out and to comply with the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     my constituents. (Cheers)

     <persName ref="pers:ROSS6">Mr. J. J. ROSS</persName>—I propose, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, that the speech of the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber should be printed in pamphlet form, 
     <lb/>
     apart from the official debates, and that seve<lb break="no"/>ral thousand copies should be struck off to 
     <lb/>
     be distributed freely throughout the country.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BIGG1">MR. BIGGAR</persName>—As the resolutions on the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation of the Provinces are looked 
     <lb/>
     to with a very great deal of interest by the 
     <lb/>
     country, I think it necessary to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks in explanation of the vote which I 
     <lb/>
     intend to give. But before doing so,I think 
     <lb/>
     it necessary for me to state, as briefly as 
     <lb/>
     possible, the position that I hold toward the 
     <lb/>
     present Government, as also the two govern<lb break="no"/>ments that have preceded them. In my 
     <lb/>
     canvass in 1861, I most distinctly and 
     <lb/>
     unhesitatingly stated to my constituents that 
     <lb/>
     I had no confidence in the CARTIER-MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD Government, who were then in 
     <lb/>
     power, as I considered that they had 
     <lb/>
     managed the finances of the country very 
     <lb/>
     badly, and had, by their extravagance, 
     <lb/>
     brought us to the eve of bankruptcy; and 
     <lb/>
     that if I were elected to the House as their 
     <lb/>
     representative, I should feel it my duty to 
     <lb/>
     vote want of confidence in that Government, 
     <lb/>
     if such a vote was preposed. In 1862 the 
     <lb/>
     Militia Bill was introduced by that Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration. Believing that some legislation was 
     <lb/>
     necessary in that direction, and admitting 
     <lb/>
     the principle of the bill, I voted with the 
     <lb/>
     Government on it. Some of my political 
     <lb/>
     friends, with whom I was then acting, found 
     <lb/>
     fault with me for the course I then took and 
     <lb/>
     the vote I then gave; but I am happy to say 
     <lb/>
     that they have since been induced to take the 
     <lb/>
     same view of the matter that I did at that 
     <lb/>
     time, and they would now be willing to go a 
     <lb/>
     little farther in the same direction than I 
     <lb/>
     would perhaps feel it prudent to go with our 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     great public debt. It is gratifying to me, 
     <lb/>
     however, to find that the course I tool: on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion has been approved of now by 
     <lb/>
     them. That Government was defeated on 
     <lb/>
     that vote; and when the new Government 
     <lb/>
     was formed, known as the MACDONALD- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     SICOTTE Administration, I was not satisfied 
     <lb/>
     with their policy. I had promised my con<lb break="no"/>stituents that I would support representation 
     <lb/>
     by population, and vote against separate 
     <lb/>
     schools; and as that Government proposed 
     <lb/>
     to make representation by population a close 
     <lb/>
     question, and to bring in a Separate School 
     <lb/>
     Bill, I felt that I should have to vote against 
     <lb/>
     them when representation by population 
     <lb/>
     would be moved as an amendment to the 
     <lb/>
     Address. I accordingly voted for the amend<lb break="no"/>ment; and when Mr. SCOTT'S Separate 
     <lb/>
     School Bill was introduced, I felt it my duty 
     <lb/>
     to vote against it, in accordance with the 
     <lb/>
     pledges I had made to my constituents. That 
     <lb/>
     Government was defeated, and a new Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was formed, in which I advised you, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, and my friend the late Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General, to take office. I stated 
     <lb/>
     to you, Mr. SPEAKER, and to the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     MOWAT, that I would not advise you, as my 
     <lb/>
     friends, to take office, unless I would feel it 
     <lb/>
     to be my duty to support you ; and that if 
     <lb/>
     the question of representation by population 
     <lb/>
     was again moved as an amendment to the 
     <lb/>
     Speech from the Throne, I would vote against 
     <lb/>
     the amendment, and that I would go before 
     <lb/>
     my constituents, as a general election was 
     <lb/>
     approaching, and state what I had done, 
     <lb/>
     and if they did not sustain me is what I 
     <lb/>
     had done, I was quite willing to remain 
     <lb/>
     at home. I believe that Government did 
     <lb/>
     right in resigning when they found they 
     <lb/>
     could not carry on the business of the 
     <lb/>
     country in a satisfactory manner; and when 
     <lb/>
     the TACHÉ-MACDONALD Administration was 
     <lb/>
     formed, I decided to give them a test-vote, 
     <lb/>
     but I was willing that they should proceed 
     <lb/>
     without any opposition from me, if they could 
     <lb/>
     control a majority of the House; but when the 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction took place, I felt that I could 
     <lb/>
     not be a party to a government of that kind 
     <lb/>
     —that the demoralizing influence of a co<lb break="no"/>alition such as that Government contained 
     <lb/>
     would counteract all the good they could 
     <lb/>
     ever do, and that the alliance was an un<lb break="no"/>happy one. (Hear, hear.) I was not wil<lb break="no"/>ling, after having voted a want of confidence 
     <lb/>
     in them on the 14th of June last, for having 
     <lb/>
     misapproriated one hundred thousand dol<lb break="no"/>lars of the funds of the province, to come   
     <lb/>
     down to the House eight days after and say 
     <lb/>

     that I would support them, now that they 
     <lb/>
     had promised to give the Hon. GEORGE 
     <lb/>
     BROWN, on behalf of himself and two other 
     <lb/>
     members of the Liberal party, the selection 
     <lb/>
     of three seats in the Cabinet, when they 
     <lb/>
     had done no act to merit my confidence, but 
     <lb/>
     simply state that they would grant constitu<lb break="no"/>tional changes, which they might or might 
     <lb/>
     never do. I was not prepared, however, 
     <lb/>
     to give them any factious opposition, but 
     <lb/>
     was willing to support any good measures 
     <lb/>
     that they might bring forward. That Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment met delegates from the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, at a Conference in this city, and 
     <lb/>
     agreed upon the resolutions that are now 
     <lb/>
     submitted to this House. In them I find 
     <lb/>
     principles which do not harmonize with my 
     <lb/>
     pledges to the people, and without an appeal 
     <lb/>
     to the people I cannot support the measure 
     <lb/>
     now before the House. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     will not here say anything of the merits of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions, but simply state that they 
     <lb/>
     embrace principles which I cannot support on 
     <lb/>
     account of the promises that I have made to 
     <lb/>
     my constituents. The people of my county 
     <lb/>
     have been led by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> to believe that 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway would be a very 
     <lb/>
     dangerous affair for the country, and that it 
     <lb/>
     would not be useful either as a military or 
     <lb/>
     commercial undertaking. Looking at it 
     <lb/>
     from a military point of view, it is well 
     <lb/>
     known that part of the proposed line would 
     <lb/>
     run within twenty-six miles of the American 
     <lb/>
     frontier, and that communication could be 
     <lb/>
     cut off at any moment by an American army; 
     <lb/>
     and that as a commercial undertaking it 
     <lb/>
     could never compete with the water route 
     <lb/>
     during the season of navigation; and in 
     <lb/>
     the winter it would be comparatively useless 
     <lb/>
     on account of the depth of snow. They 
     <lb/>
     have been told that it would never pay for 
     <lb/>
     the grease that would go on the axles. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) When I went before them and 
     <lb/>
     stated that I would support the MACDONALD- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     DORION Government, they said that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should be looked upon with suspicion, 
     <lb/>
     as they had granted ten thousand dollars for 
     <lb/>
     the survey of the Intercolonial Railway; but 
     <lb/>
     I told them that the best guarantee that they 
     <lb/>
     could have that that work would not be pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded with, was that the Hon. Mr. DORION 
     <lb/>
     was in the Cabinet, and that he had previ<lb break="no"/>ously resigned his seat as Provincial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary in the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, rather than agree to the construction 
     <lb/>
     of that railway. Another question that I found 
     <lb/>
     a little embarrassing was that of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. The present Hon. Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     for Canada West came into my riding and 
     <lb/>
     very ingeniously told the people that I was re<lb break="no"/>sponsible for the Separate School Bill having 
     <lb/>
     been forced upon them, inasmuch as I had 
     <lb/>
     supported the general policy of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that had carried the bill, although I 
     <lb/>
     had voted with the hon. gentleman against 
     <lb/>
     the bill in all its stages from the beginning 
     <lb/>
     to the end. They were satisfied, however, 
     <lb/>
     when I told them that I was prepared to 
     <lb/>
     vote to rescind the amendments to the Sepa<lb break="no"/>rate School Bill as introduced by Mr. SCOTT. 
     <lb/>
     Now, as these resolutions propose to perpe<lb break="no"/>tuate separate schools in Upper Canada for 
     <lb/>
     all time to come, I feel that they would con<lb break="no"/>flict with the pledges that I have made to 
     <lb/>
     the people, and that I cannot support them. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I was a little surprised to 
     <lb/>
     find the Honorable President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     get up and say that he did not fear any of 
     <lb/>
     the evil results that might proceed from the 
     <lb/>
     present Separate School Bill. Was that the 
     <lb/>
     language of the hon. gentleman in 1862? 
     <lb/>
     Was that the way the subject had been treated 
     <lb/>
     in the columns of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> when the bill 
     <lb/>
     was being discussed in 1862 and 1863 ? 
     <lb/>
     Every member of this House will remember 
     <lb/>
     how the thirteeen members, even spoken of 
     <lb/>
     in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> in 1862, for having had the 
     <lb/>
    "courage to vote against the second reading 
     <lb/>of Mr. SCOTT's Separate School Bill—when 
     <lb/>95 members of the House were willing to 
     <lb/>vote for the second reading—and in 1863 
     <lb/>when the bill was being passed into law by 
     <lb/>the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Government— 
     <lb/>how the members were warned to be true to 
     <lb/>their pledges, no matter what might become 
     <lb/>of the Government. Even Dr. RYERSON, 
     <lb/>the Superintendent of Education for Upper 
     <lb/>Canada, who had devoted twenty years of the 
     <lb/>best of his life in perfecting a system of 
     <lb/>education, was denounced in the columns 
     <lb/>of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> as a deserter of the best inter<lb break="no"/>ests of education in Upper Canada, for 
     <lb/>having consented to the amendments as pro<lb break="no"/>posed in Mr. SCOTT's Separate School Bill. I 
     <lb/>cannot help referring to another remark made 
     <lb/>by the Hon. President of the Council. He 
     <lb/>said—" Let any one vote against these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions and dare to go before the people." 
     <lb/>Is he not prepared to allow others the same 
     <lb/>freedom of thought which he enjoys himself? 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I can only say that I for 
     <lb/>one will not be coerced into anything of that 
     <lb/>kind. (Hear, hear.) I am not responsible 
     <lb/>to the Hon. President of the Council for my 
     <lb/>votes. I am responsible to the people that 
     <lb/>sent me here, and to a higher power, and I 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="884" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0884.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">884</fw>
       

     am not going to be coerced into giving 
     <lb/>
     a vote which I cannot approve. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I cannot say whether I will ever be 
     <lb/>
     called upon again to represent the county 
     <lb/>
     that I now have the honor to represent; 
     <lb/>
     whether I do or do not, it is a matter of no 
     <lb/>
     consequence to me; but I do say that I will 
     <lb/>
     not, under any circumstances, be coerced by 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman. He should not 
     <lb/>
     forget, however, that his influence in Nor<lb break="no"/>thumberland is not what he might have 
     <lb/>
     anticipated, and that when he thought proper 
     <lb/>
     to come down from Toronto, in April last, to 
     <lb/>
     oppose the Hon. Solicitor General, when he 
     <lb/>
     was contesting the West Riding with a very 
     <lb/>
     respectable farmer, that notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>
     very powerful speeches of the Hon. Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council, the Hon. Solicitor 
     <lb/>
     General was returned for that riding by a 
     <lb/>
     very large majority. I suppose that, had 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. President of the Council antici<lb break="no"/>pated that he was, within two months, to 
     <lb/>have had a seat in the same Cabinet with 
     <lb/>the Hon. Solicitor General, he would have 
     <lb/>acted differently. I myself had a very strong 
     <lb/>invitation to go up to the West Riding to 
     <lb/>oppose the Hon. Solicitor General, but I 
     <lb/>was willing to act upon the principle of 
     <lb/>returning good for evil. I was quite willing 
     <lb/>to allow the electors of West Northumber<lb break="no"/>land to choose for themselves whom they 
     <lb/>would elect for their representative in Par<lb break="no"/>liament ; and in regard to the Hon. Solicitor 
     <lb/>General, I must say that, as far as I can 
     <lb/>learn, he has discharged the duties of his 
     <lb/>office with satisfaction to the Government 
     <lb/>and the people that he represents, and with 
     <lb/>credit to himself. It is not my intention to 
     <lb/>give the Government any factions opposi<lb break="no"/>tion. I will cheerfully support any good 
     <lb/>measures for the benefit of the country which 
     <lb/>they may bring forward for our adoption; 
     <lb/>but I wish the Government to understand, 
     <lb/>as I do not wish to occupy any doubtful 
     <lb/>position in this House, I am no supporter 
     <lb/>of theirs, and if a vote of want of confidence 
     <lb/>is at any time proposed, I am prepared to 
     <lb/>vote against them. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK2">MR. JACKSON</persName>—I think it right to say 
     <lb/>
     a few words on this question before the vote 
     <lb/>
     is taken; but at this late hour, I will not 
     <lb/>
     detain the House very long. The subject 
     <lb/>
     has been discussed from various points of 
     <lb/>
     view. In the early part of the debate, one 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, the hon. member for Hochelaga 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. DOBION), objected to the scheme 
     <lb/>
     mainly on the ground that it approximated 
     <lb/>
     too closely to a legislative union, and that it 


            <cb/>
           

     would interfere with the privileges which 
     <lb/>
     the parties to the union exercise in their 
     <lb/>
     respective localities; and if I remember 
     <lb/>
     rightly, he said that the plan of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would have the effect of interfering 
     <lb/>
     with the language and religion of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians. It occurred to me at the time 
     <lb/>
     he was making his speech, that he was taking 
     <lb/>
     untenable ground, and I felt grateful then, 
     <lb/>
     and I do so now, that that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     is not in a position to exercise more power, 
     <lb/>
     at this crisis, than an ordinary member of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature. I admire the ability of 
     <lb/>
     that honorable gentleman, and I consider it 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate that at this important juncture 
     <lb/>
     he did not rise above narrow and limited 
     <lb/>
     sectional views, and take more statesmanlike 
     <lb/>
     ground. (Hear, hear.) Then the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Ontario (Mr. M. C. 
     <lb/>
     CAMERON) objected to Confederation from 
     <lb/>
     a different point of view, but he arrived at 
     <lb/>
     his conclusions from arguments of an entirely 
     <lb/>
     different character. Strange to say, he did 
     <lb/>
     not regard this with satisfaction, while a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union would meet with his appro<lb break="no"/>val. He professed to believe that the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces would combine with Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and form a union detrimental to the 
     <lb/>
     interests of Upper Canada, placing the 
     <lb/>
     people there in a worse position than that 
     <lb/>
     which they at present occupy with an 
     <lb/>
     equality of representation. As he made 
     <lb/>
     that remark, I asked him what difference it 
     <lb/>
     could make then, whether we had a Federal 
     <lb/>
     or 3 Legislative union, which he professes to 
     <lb/>
     admire, as it would have charge of all the 
     <lb/>
     important general interests. His answer 
     <lb/>
     convinced me that there was nothing to 
     <lb/>
     support his argument. It seemed to me 
     <lb/>
     that he took too much for granted in assum<lb break="no"/>ing that there would be a union between 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada and the Maritime Provinces as 
     <lb/>
     against Upper Canada. It is hardly to be con<lb break="no"/>ceived that gentlemen called together for the 
     <lb/>
     performance of certain high purposes would 
     <lb/>
     attempt to do an injury to one part of the 
     <lb/>
     country over another. (Hear, hear.) If 
     <lb/>
     such a sectional alliance was possible, it 
     <lb/>
     would be much more likely that the union 
     <lb/>
     would be formed with Upper Canada, inas<lb break="no"/>much as that part of the proposed Con<lb break="no"/>federacy has a much larger aggregate busi<lb break="no"/>ness than any or either of the other separate 
     <lb/>
     sections. But I will not dwell upon this, as it 
     <lb/>
     appears to me to carry with it its own refuta<lb break="no"/>tion. This principal reason for opposing this 
     <lb/>
     scheme is, I think, founded on the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentlemen now united together in 


            <pb n="885" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0885.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">885</fw>
         

     the Government do not possess his con<lb break="no"/>fidence. He referred to their antecedents, 
     <lb/>
     and spoke of their being opposed to each 
     <lb/>
     other before, and said that it was impossible 
     <lb/>
     for them to unite now for any good object. 
     <lb/>
     I think, sir, it will scarcely be denied that 
     <lb/>
     in looking back upon the antecedents of our 
     <lb/>
     public men, there is hardly one of any note 
     <lb/>
     who has not, during some portion of his life, 
     <lb/>
     found himself in such a position as to render 
     <lb/>
     it necessary for him to abandon views which 
     <lb/>
     he had previously maintained, and that no 
     <lb/>
     government has been successful which has 
     <lb/>
     not been founded upon mutual concessions. 
     <lb/>
     It is necessary that public men on both 
     <lb/>
     sides should unite in great emergencies in 
     <lb/>
     order to promote the general welfare. We 
     <lb/>
     know very well that those who are open to 
     <lb/>
     conviction very frequently change their 
     <lb/>
     course, and it is no disgrace to any one 
     <lb/>
     that under the influence of increased 
     <lb/>
     knowledge he has shaped his conduct in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the degree of light which 
     <lb/>
     has surrounded him. The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman knows very well that we must 
     <lb/>
     judge the actions of individuals not merely 
     <lb/>
     by their motives—for these we cannot often 
     <lb/>
     penetrate—but by the character and results 
     <lb/>
     of their actions. And so we must look upon 
     <lb/>
     the scheme now before us as it really is. 
     <lb/>
     We must examine it for ourselves, and un<lb break="no"/>less we see clear evidence to the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     we ought to give its promoters credit for 
     <lb/>
     honesty and sincerity. I have no sympathy 
     <lb/>
     with those who willingly attribute the ac<lb break="no"/>tions of public men to the influence of 
     <lb/>
     unworthy motives, when they may fairly 
     <lb/>
     claim to originate in the higher qualities of 
     <lb/>
     the mind and heart. It is the duty, I think, 
     <lb/>
     of all right-minded men to give this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment the credit of acting from high-minded 
     <lb/>
     motives. But supposing, for the sake of 
     <lb/>
     argument, that these honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     had united for dividing among themselves 
     <lb/>
     offices of profit and emolument. It is fortu<lb break="no"/>nate that the germs of evil seldom attain to 
     <lb/>
     their complete development. Professions of 
     <lb/>
     patriotism do not always betoken the absence 
     <lb/>
     of selfishness. He has read history to little 
     <lb/>
     purpose who has not discovered that political 
     <lb/>
     dishonesty has frequently been not only 
     <lb/>
     harmless, but has been practically the min<lb break="no"/>ister of public good. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON) stated 
     <lb/>
     the other day, that under Confederation 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada would contribute an un<lb break="no"/>equally large proportion of the amount 
     <lb/>
     necessary to sustain the machinery of the 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
           

     Confederacy. He had a large array of 
     <lb/>
     figures before him; but as I took no notes 
     <lb/>
     of these figures, I am not prepared to dis<lb break="no"/>pute their correctness. But he forget this, 
     <lb/>
     which is a matter of great importance to 
     <lb/>
     be considered, that under Confederation 
     <lb/>
     there will be a uniformity in the tariffs of 
     <lb/>
     the several provinces, and if the tariff of 
     <lb/>
     Canada is reduced so as to bring it into 
     <lb/>
     conformity with those of the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, the disproportion will disappear. 
     <lb/>
     An hon. gentleman who afterwards addressed 
     <lb/>
     the House, and who, I regret, is absent from 
     <lb/>
     the House by reason of indisposition—the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Brome (Mr. DUNKIN)—I 
     <lb/>
     understood to say that nations and constitu<lb break="no"/>tions and governments owed their origin to 
     <lb/>
     that creative power to which all are indebted 
     <lb/>
     for existence and the means of perpetuating 
     <lb/>
     it. The idea is well expressed in the words 
     <lb/>
     of a celebrated writer :—" There is a Divinity 
     <lb/>
     that shapes our ends, rough hew them as we 
     <lb/>
     may." He (Mr. DUNKIN) then went on to 
     <lb/>
     question the honesty of the purpose of those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, Hon. Messrs. ROSS, GALT and 
     <lb/>
     CARTIER, who signed the despatch of 1858, 
     <lb/>
     which resulted in the Conference of last Sep<lb break="no"/>tember. He described all the intermediate 
     <lb/>
     stages as "accidents," and then found 
     <lb/>
     fault with every item of the conferential 
     <lb/>
     arrangement. The hon. gentleman, on his 
     <lb/>
     own principles, should not criticise too se<lb break="no"/>verely the action of the Government. They 
     <lb/>
     might be only instruments in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the Supreme Architect. The reasonable 
     <lb/>
     method would be to examine the arrange<lb break="no"/>ments or agreements of the Conference, and 
     <lb/>
     if the scheme is found to be based upon just 
     <lb/>
     and equitable principles, it must recommend 
     <lb/>
     itself to favorable consideration, and the ine<lb break="no"/>vitable conclusion is that it ought to be 
     <lb/>
     adopted. I confess I admire the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment, which has no doubt been arrived at 
     <lb/>
     after much care and deliberation. The com<lb break="no"/>mercial and financial parts of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     seem to me to be as just as, under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances, they possibly could be. It is a very 
     <lb/>
     ordinary accomplishment to be able to find 
     <lb/>
     fault. It is much easier to destroy than to build 
     <lb/>
     up. We know that those so disposed might take 
     <lb/>
     up the best schemes ever devised by human 
     <lb/>
     ingenuity, and draw improper conclusions 
     <lb/>
     therefrom. In fact there is no form of 
     <lb/>
     government in the world but what, if badly 
     <lb/>
     administered, would be productive of evil. 
     <lb/>
     On the other hand, a scheme somewhat 
     <lb/>
     defective in itself, if placed in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     good and patriotic men, might be made to

     conduce to the advantage of the country— 
     <lb/>
     " That which is best administered is best." 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, no scheme can be entirely 
     <lb/>
     perfect. Indeed, it is scarcely desirable it 
     <lb/>
     should be so. There should be room for the 
     <lb/>
     exercise of political virtue, and scope for 
     <lb/>
      the exercise of that executive responsibility 
     <lb/>
     which attaches to our system of government. 
     <lb/>
     There is a great deal of discretion left to 
     <lb/>
     our public men, and they are expected to 
     <lb/>
     use their powers for the general weal and 
     <lb/>
     welfare. I am disposed to place confidence 
     <lb/>
     in the Government, and believe that they 
     <lb/>
     will, so far as their ability goes, work out 
     <lb/>
     this scheme to a desirable result, and in 
     <lb/>
     this I hope and trust they will succeed. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Lennox and Addington 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), in his speech to-day, 
     <lb/>
     which, like all his other speeches, was of 
     <lb/>
     the most admirable kind, made some 
     <lb/>
     profound observations. He had thought 
     <lb/>
     deeply upon the subject of which he 
     <lb/>
     was treating. He remarked that the 
     <lb/>
     Government were merely giving eflect 
     <lb/>
     to a foregone conclusion. He, no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     recognized that the public sentiment and 
     <lb/>
     public opinion had attained a certain state— 
     <lb/>
     had arrived at such a point, that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were compelled to go with the stream, 
     <lb/>
     and endeavor to consummate that which the 
     <lb/>
     peeple had already brought into such a con<lb break="no"/>dition of forwardness. And I thought, sir, 
     <lb/>
     that this was the proper and philosophical 
     <lb/>
     view to take of the matter. It is true, to 
     <lb/>
     my mind at all events—and I think that those 
     <lb/>
     who have made themselves acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     political history, and the political history of 
     <lb/>
     England in particular, must come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that those governments act most 
     <lb/>
     wisely who take advantage of existing cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, and adapt legislation to the real 
     <lb/>
     wants and exigencies of the country The 
     <lb/>
     question is not at all times what is best in 
     <lb/>
     the abstract, but what is most useful and 
     <lb/>
     advantageous to the people. My idea of a 
     <lb/>
     statesman is that he should be influenced to 
     <lb/>
     a large extent by motives of expediency. 
     <lb/>
     Abstract propositions can seldom be reduced 
     <lb/>
     to practice. lt is foolish for gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     placed in the position of the Government to 
     <lb/>
     go against the popular stream, and they best 
     <lb/>
     manifest their prudence, their ability, and 
     <lb/>
     their adaptation to the discharge of their im<lb break="no"/>portant duties, who make use of passing 
     <lb/>
     events for directing the vessel of state into 
     <lb/>
     a secure harbour. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Missisquoi (Mr. O'HALLORAN) said the . 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
    

     other night that there was too much legis<lb break="no"/>lation—that the country was governed to 
     <lb/>
     death, and I admit that to a certain extent 
     <lb/>
     there is some propriety in his remarks ; but 
     <lb/>
     they did not apply to the present subject. 
     <lb/>
     I presume we are not here for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of discussing the past acts of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but for the purpose of considering the 
     <lb/>
     scheme now before us, and it will be an 
     <lb/>
     evidence of our good sense and wisdom—it 
     <lb/>
     will show, too, our seriousness—if we give it 
     <lb/>
     our calm and impartial consideration without 
     <lb/>
     reference to extraneous matters. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear ) I think, sir, we are now passing out 
     <lb/>
     of the season of political childhood, and that 
     <lb/>
     we are being called upon, in the course of 
     <lb/>
     events. to enter upon the duties sand respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities incidental to the period of youth. 
     <lb/>
     We are required to practise and inure our<lb break="no"/>selves to the discharge of important duties, 
     <lb/>
     which require discretion and self-reliance. 
     <lb/>
     And as it is in nature, so it is in communi<lb break="no"/>ties—there are various stages of pregress 
     <lb/>
     through which we must pass before we can 
     <lb/>
     arrive at the position of manhood. There 
     <lb/>
     are only two kinds of animals that attain to 
     <lb/>
     eminence—things that fly and things that 
     <lb/>
     creep. Things which fly are never secure 
     <lb/>
     —they are frequently brought down ; whilst 
     <lb/>
     things which creep proceed firmly and cau<lb break="no"/>tiously, if slowly, and by degrees  arrive at 
     <lb/>
     the topmost point. And so people who pass 
     <lb/>
     at a bound from a state of political childhood 
     <lb/>
     to a. state of political manhood, violate the 
     <lb/>
     order and arrangement observed in na<lb break="no"/>ture. We have seen instances where 
     <lb/>
     people have disregarded the various stages 
     <lb/>
     of political existence; but in so doing 
     <lb/>
     they have deprived themselves of the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages of that experience which is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to a vigorous manhood, and which 
     <lb/>
     previous training alone can secure. I trust 
     <lb/>
     we shall not make this mistake, but that we 
     <lb/>
     shall observe the order and gradations of 
     <lb/>
     nature, and pass through the various political 
     <lb/>
     stages of being, from childhood upwards, in 
     <lb/>
     such a way that we may learn to discharge 
     <lb/>
     the duties of our position in a spirit of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     reliance; that we shall have been taught 
     <lb/>
     how to make the best of our circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     and prove that the training we have 
     <lb/>
     received during our pupilage has been such 
     <lb/>
     as to fit us for a vigorous and prosperous 
     <lb/>
     future. (fleur.) I think that this view of 
     <lb/>
     the subject is one of some importance—so 
     <lb/>
     much so, that it has been said the logical 
     <lb/>
     conclusion of it would be our independence.

     Well, I do not think there is anything dis<lb break="no"/>loyal, that there is anything improper, in 
     <lb/>
     supposing that the time may come when 
     <lb/>
     this British North American territory shall 
     <lb/>
     be the abode of a great and independent 
     <lb/>
     people. I do not wish to live to see it. But 
     <lb/>
     I know very well that when the time comes, 
     <lb/>
     there will be no interference on the part 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain with that which seems to be 
     <lb/>
     a condition of the inevitable order of things; 
     <lb/>
     that the country with which we are now con<lb break="no"/>nected and allied—and it is not only a political 
     <lb/>
     alliance, but a social alliance, an attachment 
     <lb/>
     of affection and esteem—would not at all feel 
     <lb/>
     jealous if in the course of events the people 
     <lb/>
     inhabiting British North America should 
     <lb/>
     be prosperous enough and numerous enough 
     <lb/>
     to aspire to independence. (Hear, hear.) Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, the circumstances which have 
     <lb/>
     brought about the contemplated measure— 
     <lb/>
     and I trust it will be a successful one—are 
     <lb/>
     such as have forced themselves on the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the Government. I have already 
     <lb/>
     alluded to one of these circumstances, and 
     <lb/>
     that is the fact that we are passing from the 
     <lb/>
     stage of childhood to a higher and more 
     <lb/>
     responsible position—that the Government 
     <lb/>
     of this country has for some time been in a 
     <lb/>
     state of transition, and that this is the only 
     <lb/>
     relief which the circumstances present to us, 
     <lb/>
     the only way in which an amelioration can 
     <lb/>
     be found. During a number of years, and 
     <lb/>
     especially since 1 have taken an active part 
     <lb/>
     in politics—in the course of my various elec<lb break="no"/>tion contests—I have invariably stated, that 
     <lb/>
     while I looked upon representation by 
     <lb/>
     population as a remedy for the political 
     <lb/>
     inequalities which existed as between the 
     <lb/>
     two sections of the province, a Federal union 
     <lb/>
     of the British North American Provinces 
     <lb/>
     seemed to me to be the only proper and 
     <lb/>
     legitimate conclusion to be ultimately arrived 
     <lb/>
     at. Therefore, in advocating this scheme and 
     <lb/>
     in giving my vote for it, as I shall do when the 
     <lb/>
     matter is brought to that stage which will 
     <lb/>
     enable a vote to be taken, I am only doing 
     <lb/>
     that which I have for a number of years 
     <lb/>
     looked forward to, and which I believe the exi<lb break="no"/>gencies of the country necessitate. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     There are other circumstances besides that 
     <lb/>
     to which I have alluded, which render me 
     <lb/>
     favorable to the adoption of the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     now before the House. The war in the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and the, at one time, ap<lb break="no"/>parently imminent disintegration of that 
     <lb/>
     republic, strongly directed our attention to 
     <lb/>
     the necessity and desirability of uniting 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
        

     with our neighbors for defensive purposes. 
     <lb/>
     I do not say that the desire for a union of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces grew out of the war in the 
     <lb/>
     United States, nor am I going to give any 
     <lb/>
     opinion in reference to that war. We all 
     <lb/>
     regret its existence, and will all be grateful 
     <lb/>
     when it is brought to a close, and the bless<lb break="no"/>ings of peace shall again visit our continent. 
     <lb/>
     I hope that the commercial relations as 
     <lb/>
     between us and the United States will be 
     <lb/>
     continued; that we shall have the freest 
     <lb/>
     intercourse with that people, and that the 
     <lb/>
     passport system being removed, the time is 
     <lb/>
     not far distant when our relations with them 
     <lb/>
     shall be as friendly and as cordial as they 
     <lb/>
    have heretofore been. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>threatened repeal of the Reciprocity treaty 
     <lb/>is another thing that has led to the strong 
     <lb/>feeling that has been aroused in favor of 
     <lb/>this scheme. We hope by this union to 
     <lb/>obtain a large number of customers for our 
     <lb/>products, intercourse with whom will not be 
     <lb/>subject to those interruptions that charac<lb break="no"/>terise trade with foreign nations. We shall 
     <lb/>have a large territory under our own 
     <lb/>government, trade with which and through 
     <lb/>which will secure to us mutual advantages. 
     <lb/>Having made these remarks, I would pass 
     <lb/>on to observe that the expressed desire on 
     <lb/>the part of the leading men, both of the 
     <lb/>Government and of the Opposition, in all 
     <lb/>the provinces, for a close connection, is 
     <lb/>another strong reason why we should at 
     <lb/>once take the necessary steps for enabling 
     <lb/>the union to be carried out.  It is a most 
     <lb/>remarkable and most favorable circumstance 
     <lb/>that the best men, the ablest men, the wisest 
     <lb/>men and the most patriotic men in all the 
     <lb/>provinces—men whose integrity and abilities 
     <lb/>have raised them to the highest places in 
     <lb/>the regards of the people, and whose wisdom 
     <lb/>in the management of public affairs has 
     <lb/>sustained them for a long period in those 
     <lb/>high and honorable positions—met together 
     <lb/>and agreed upon a scheme of union without 
     <lb/>any dissension. This agreement in forming 
     <lb/>a basis of a Constitution, and a foundation 
     <lb/>to what may become a great nation, I look 
     <lb/>upon as a most favorable omen indeed. I 
     <lb/>look upon this union of sentiment as another 
     <lb/>strong reason for our taking the necessary 
     <lb/>steps to carry out the union so happily inaugur<lb break="no"/>ated, as also a strong evidence of the pro<lb break="no"/>priety and wisdom which characterised the 
     <lb/>course of the hon. gentlemen who composed 
     <lb/>the respective delegations. The gentlemen 
     <lb/>representing the Lower Provinces gave 
     <lb/>
  

            <pb n="888" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0888.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">888</fw>
         

     evidence of ability of a very high order, 
     <lb/>
     and I am sure the country will regret that 
     <lb/>
     any of the gentlemen who so well adorned 
     <lb/>
     the Conference, and who occupied such 
     <lb/>
     honorable positions in the government of 
     <lb/>
     their provinces, should have lost those posi<lb break="no"/>tions through attachment to the scheme, 
     <lb/>
     for I had learned to look up to those men 
     <lb/>
     with a great deal of interest and hope for 
     <lb/>
     the future. (Hear, hear.) They are men 
     <lb/>
     of such a superior order, that they would 
     <lb/>
     grace any legislature in which they might 
     <lb/>
     be called upon to take part, and I trust they 
     <lb/>
     may be soon again placed in the positions of 
     <lb/>
     power and trust from which they have been 
     <lb/>
     .so unhappily ejected. (Hear, hear.) There 
     <lb/>
     are other reasons to which I might refer, 
     <lb/>
     that are pressing the subject upon our 
     <lb/>
     attention. I will first, however, briefly 
     <lb/>
     refer to one important point connected with 
     <lb/>
     the subject, about which a good deal has 
     <lb/>
     been said by those who have spoken against 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions, and it is a matter that will 
     <lb/>
     be made the utmost of among the electors 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada. I mean the question of 
     <lb/>
     referring the scheme tea vote of the people, 
     <lb/>
     at a general election or some other way, to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain what their views are upon it before 
     <lb/>
     taking final action in this House. Previous 
     <lb/>
     to the opening of the present session, I took 
     <lb/>
     occasion to visit several townships in the 
     <lb/>
     county I have the honor to represent. I 
     <lb/>
     laid the whole matter as fully before them as 
     <lb/>
     I could well do, and I did not meet with a 
     <lb/>
     single individual who did not recognize it as 
     <lb/>
     the duty of the present House of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to carry the measure into effect as 
     <lb/>
     speedin as possible, so far as it was in the 
     <lb/>
     power of our Legislature and Government 
     <lb/>
     to do. At various meetings resolutions 
     <lb/>
     were voluntarily proposed by individuals in 
     <lb/>
     the audience, instructing me to support the 
     <lb/>
     measure, and further stating that they 
     <lb/>
     would consider it a calamity if a general 
     <lb/>
      election were resorted to for the mere pur<lb break="no"/>pose of obtaining the consent of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple on the subject, nine-tenths of whose 
     <lb/>
     press endorse it. So satisfied were my con<lb break="no"/>stituents of the fairness of the scheme on 
     <lb/>
     the whole, and of the importance of 
     <lb/>
     having it go into operation with the least 
     <lb/>
     delay possible, that I feel that I shall be 
     <lb/>
     sustained in the vote I am about to give, 
     <lb/>
     by the sentiment of those Wth I repre<lb break="no"/>sent in this House. For these reasons, then, 
     <lb/>
     I am prepared to vote for the proposed 
     <lb/>
     union of all the British American Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     as provided for in the resolutions now before 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
       

     the House. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I trust the House will not regard me as 
     <lb/>
     desirous of assuming the oflice of a censor, if 
     <lb/>
     I express my belief that many of the speeches 
     <lb/>
     that have been made upon this question 
     <lb/>
     have contained a vast quantity of matter 
     <lb/>
     quite irrelevant to the question under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. There may be parts of the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment proposed that are unsatisfactory to 
     <lb/>
     many hon. gentlemen, but it is utterly im<lb break="no"/>possible to devise a scheme that will be 
     <lb/>
     acceptable to everybody, or that will not be 
     <lb/>
     Open to the criticism of seeming to bear 
     <lb/>
     harder on one section of the country than on 
     <lb/>
     another. But it should not be judged in 
     <lb/>
     that manner, but by its general fairness and 
     <lb/>
     by its being calculated to promote the wel<lb break="no"/>fare of the entire country embraced and to 
     <lb/>
     be embraced in the Confederacy. It would 
     <lb/>
     be absurd to suppose that a scheme could be 
     <lb/>
     devised for the purpose that would please 
     <lb/>
     and satisfy every section. The scheme 
     <lb/>
     under consideration should not be treated 
     <lb/>
     and criticised in this narrow, contracted 
     <lb/>
     view. Some portions of the country may 
     <lb/>
     have to make concessions and sacrifices for 
     <lb/>
     the public good, but these should be cheer<lb break="no"/>fully borne, if not of too aggravating a 
     <lb/>
     nature. If Upper Canada is blessed with 
     <lb/>
     more wealth than any of the other provinces, 
     <lb/>
     it ought not to be forgotten that its account<lb break="no"/>ability and its responsibility are greater— 
     <lb/>
     that they are in proportion to its riches—and 
     <lb/>
     while the people of that important section of 
     <lb/>
     the Confederacy may be called upon to con<lb break="no"/>cede some things that they have valued very 
     <lb/>
     highly for the general welfare, yet it is not 
     <lb/>
     for a moment to be supposed—and no one 
     <lb/>
     who dispassionately examines the whole sub<lb break="no"/>ject can come to that conclusion—that Upper 
     <lb/>Canada will not receive very important 
     <lb/>advantages , in return, in other respects. 
     <lb/>There must be conciliation and compromise 
     <lb/>between the several conflicting interests 
     <lb/>found in so large and so varied a territory, 
     <lb/>and we never can have a union without 
     <lb/>meeting and accommodating ourselves to 
     <lb/>this difficulty. (Hear, hear.) The question 
     <lb/>of our defences is another important consid<lb break="no"/>eration in connection with the subject; had 
     <lb/>am not going to discuss that, because I am 
     <lb/>not a military man.  I cannot, however, see 
     <lb/>how any hon. gentleman can deliberately 
     <lb/>stand up and express as his candid convic<lb break="no"/>tion, that the proposed union will not in any 
     <lb/>manner increase our defensive power. To 
     <lb/>me, such statements seem most extraordinary. 
     <lb/>But this portion of the question has already 
   

            <pb n="889" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0889.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">889</fw>
           

     been quite fully discussed ; and not being, as 
     <lb/>
     I before remarked, a military man, I do not 
     <lb/>
     think anything I could say upon it would 
     <lb/>
     add much to the enlightenment of the House 
     <lb/>
     at this late stage of the debate. I will, 
     <lb/>
      therefore, Mr. SPEAKER, simply say that I 
     <lb/>
     look forward to the union with great hope 
     <lb/>
     for the future of our land. In the first place, 
     <lb/>
     the union will vastly enlarge our ideas of the 
     <lb/>
     greatness and ultimate destiny of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and give scope for higher aspirations. 
     <lb/>
     It will make the young men of this country 
     <lb/>
     feel that they have a better inheritance than 
     <lb/>
     they now feel to be theirs, and an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of rising to higher points of distinction in this 
     <lb/>
     the land of their birth or adoption. The same 
     <lb/>
     opportunities will also be open to the young 
     <lb/>
     men of the Lower Provinces, and in this con<lb break="no"/>nection I have no hesitation in saying, from 
     <lb/>
     what I know of them, that the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of the Lower Provinces, for enterprise, in<lb break="no"/>dustry and general intelligence, will compare 
     <lb/>
     favorably with any other portion of the ter<lb break="no"/>ritory that will be embraced in the union. 
     <lb/>
     It will be an advantage to us to have their 
     <lb/>
     cooperation in working out the future of 
     <lb/>
     this country, and our connection with them 
     <lb/>
     will give birth and life to those ideas that 
     <lb/>
     lie at the foundation of a nation's prosperity 
     <lb/>
     and happiness. (Hear, hear.) And now, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, having thus rapidly glanced 
     <lb/>
     at some of those important particulars that 
     <lb/>
     to my mind render the proposal under con<lb break="no"/>sideration a wise and desirable one for our 
     <lb/>
     adoption, I shall conclude, because I do not 
     <lb/>
     desire to protract the debate, by stating, 
     <lb/>
     that for the reasons I have briefly adduced, 
     <lb/>
     and from the process of reasoning I have 
     <lb/>
     been led to adopt, it is my intention to sup<lb break="no"/>port the motion for the adoption of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions respecting Confederation, pro<lb break="no"/>posed by my friend the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO2">MR. McCONKEY</persName> said —Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     at this late hour of the night I rise to 
     <lb/>
     address you with very great reluctance, but 
     <lb/>
     I feel that I would not be doing justice to 
     <lb/>
     myself and the people who sent me here, 
     <lb/>
     did I allow the vote on this momentous 
     <lb/>
     question to be taken without expressing my 
     <lb/>
     opinion upon it, however briefly. In doing 
     <lb/>
     so, Mr. SPEAKER, I shall not invoke the aid 
     <lb/>
     of history, or exhume old newspaper files to 
     <lb/>
     give the opinions of other men, but shall 
     <lb/>
     simply confine myself to stating a few of the 
     <lb/>
     ideas which have suggested themselves to 
     <lb/>
     my own mind in considering the subject. 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
          

     The task is the more difficult at this stage 
     <lb/>
     of the debate, as the arguments for and 
     <lb/>
     against the measure have been already so 
     <lb/>
     ably and lengthily elaborated by members 
     <lb/>
     of this honorable House. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     we have had eventful times in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The union of the Canadas was an import<lb break="no"/>ant event in this country; and, sir, although 
     <lb/>
     latterly it has not worked satisfactorily, 
     <lb/>
     I am not one of those who are prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say that under that union we did not prosper. 
     <lb/>
     From a very small population, we have 
     <lb/>
     grown, under the union, to be a very consid<lb break="no"/>erable people, comprising a population of two 
     <lb/>
     millions and a-half. We have also grown 
     <lb/>
     in wealth, intelligence, and everything else 
     <lb/>
     that tends to national greatness. But diffi<lb break="no"/>culties between the provinces have sprung 
     <lb/>
     up ; Upper Canada rapidly increased in po<lb break="no"/>pulation and wealth over Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and has for the last ten or twelve years 
     <lb/>
     demanded an increased representation on the 
     <lb/>
     floor of this House. She argued, and very 
     <lb/>
     properly, that her position was a degraded 
     <lb/>
     one—that with a population in excess of 
     <lb/>
     that of Lower Canada by 400,000 people, 
     <lb/>
     and contributing about three-fourths of the 
     <lb/>
     revenue of this country, she was entitled to 
     <lb/>
     such a constitutional arrangement as would 
     <lb/>
     place her on a perfect equality with the 
     <lb/>
     sister province, and that she would not be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied until that was conceded, as the 
     <lb/>
     demand was a just and honorable one. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     just although this was, Lower Canada, with, 
     <lb/>
     I have no doubt, just as much honesty and 
     <lb/>
     quite as much determination, resisted their 
     <lb/>
     demand. Hence the terrific struggles which 
     <lb/>
     ensued between the sections for the last few 
     <lb/>
     years. Within the past three years we have 
     <lb/>
     had no fewer than three Ministerial crises. 
     <lb/>
     Neither the one party nor the other could 
     <lb/>
     govern, so evenly were parties balanced in 
     <lb/>
     this House and the country. The machinery 
     <lb/>
     of government was almost entirely stopped, 
     <lb/>
     and a chronic crisis had set in. Sir, it was 
     <lb/>
     apparent to every discerning mind that some 
     <lb/>
     solution of existing difficulties must be 
     <lb/>
     sought. The present state of things could 
     <lb/>
     not continue. Mr. SPEAKER, I well recollect 
     <lb/>
     the announcement of the Honorable At<lb break="no"/>torney General West. After the defeat 
     <lb/>
     of his Government, in June last, that  
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman manfully acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged the political difficulty in which this 
     <lb/>
     country was placed. He informed the House 
     <lb/>
     that His Excellency the Governor General 
     <lb/>
     had granted the Government <hi rendition="simple:italic">carte blanche</hi>, 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="890" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0890.jpg"/>

     involving a dissolution of Parliament, if they 
     <lb/>
     chose, but that they, nevertheless, hesitated 
     <lb/>
     to exercise the power; that while individual 
     <lb/>
     changes might be made in the constituencies, 
     <lb/>
     the two great parties would come back nearly 
     <lb/>
     the same; and added, that he had had an inter<lb break="no"/>view with the hon. member for South Oxford 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. BROWN) of a most satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     nature, from which he thought he saw a 
     <lb/>
     solution of our difficulties, and asked an 
     <lb/>
     adjournment of the House. Subsequently, 
     <lb/>
     interviews were bad between the members of 
     <lb/>
     the Government and the member for South 
     <lb/>
     Oxford, which resulted in the present Co<lb break="no"/>alition Government. Sir, after a full con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the subject in all its bearings, 
     <lb/>
     I decided to give the new Government my 
     <lb/>
     support, trusting they would be able, as I 
     <lb/>
     believed they desired, to put the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     this country on a more satisfactory and 
     <lb/>
     enduring basis. But, while I support this 
     <lb/>
     Government, I must not be understood as 
     <lb/>
     approving of coalitions generally. I hold 
     <lb/>
     that to a country enjoying representative 
     <lb/>
     institutions and responsible government, it 
     <lb/>
     is indeed a matter of very little consequence 
     <lb/>
     which of the political parties are in power, 
     <lb/>
     so long as there is a strong party to scruti<lb break="no"/>nise their acts, and exercise a general sur<lb break="no"/>veillance over them. When, however, the 
     <lb/>
     two great parties coalesce, and there is no 
     <lb/>
     strong party in the country to watch them, 
     <lb/>
     there is more or less danger of abuses and 
     <lb/>
     corruption creeping in. I do not, however, 
     <lb/>
     desire that the gentlemen on the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches should understand that I apply this 
     <lb/>
     remark to them. They, sir, I believe, are 
     <lb/>
     not only pure, but, like CÆSAR'S wife, above 
     <lb/>
     suspicion. And, if even a necessity existed 
     <lb/>
     in any country to justify a coalition, it was 
     <lb/>
     in Canada; and I rejoice to know that 
     <lb/>
     we had statesmen among us who could rise 
     <lb/>
     above the petty political and personal 
     <lb/>
     squabbles, in which they had been unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately too long engaged, to grapple with 
     <lb/>
     a great national difficulty. (Cheers.) I 
     <lb/>
     think, too, it was most fortunate—providen<lb break="no"/>tial, I might say—that this country had a 
     <lb/>
     strong, vigorous Government during the 
     <lb/>
     past season, when complications between us 
     <lb/>
    and the United States were gathering. To 
     <lb/>the strength of the Government we owe the 
     <lb/>prompt manner in which raiders and others, 
     <lb/>desirous of creating a difficulty between 
     <lb/>England and America, were put down. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, I have read 
     <lb/>the resolutions of the Conference, now in 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
      

     your hands, carefully; and while, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, many of the details are objection<lb break="no"/>able, from an Upper Canadian point of view, I 
     <lb/>
     have, nevertheless, no doubt they were framed 
     <lb/>
     with a desire to do justice to all the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     No person can read these resolutions without 
     <lb/>
     coming to the conclusion that mutual 
     <lb/>
     concessions must have been made all round. 
     <lb/>
     They clearly bear the impress of compro<lb break="no"/>mise. No doubt, sir, much difficulty was 
     <lb/>
    experienced by the gentlemen composing  
     <lb/>the Conference, in fitting and dovetailing the 
     <lb/>heterogeneous parts or provinces into a 
     <lb/>homogeneous whole. I have listened at<lb break="no"/>tentively to the speeches of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>and have so far failed to hear of a better 
     <lb/>proposition than the one before us; and, 
     <lb/>indeed, I am not surprised that a better 
     <lb/>proposition should not have been presented 
     <lb/>to us, considering that this scheme was com<lb break="no"/>piled by the master minds in British America. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I stated, sir, that some of 
     <lb/>the details were objectionable, and I now 
     <lb/>repeat that had the Government permitted 
     <lb/>amendments to the resolutions, I certainly 
     <lb/>would have supported them ; but in view of 
     <lb/>the very critical position in which this 
     <lb/>country stands, I will not assume the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of opposing this scheme as a 
     <lb/>whole. (Hear, hear.) Although I admit 
     <lb/>the building of the Intercolonial Railroad 
     <lb/>to be just as necessary to the proposed Con<lb break="no"/>federation as the spinal column to the human 
     <lb/>frame; nevertheless, in view of the jobbing 
     <lb/>and extravagance committed with the Grand 
     <lb/>Trunk, I have a dread of the amount its 
     <lb/>construction and working will cost this 
     <lb/>country. Sir, I am not as sanguine as some 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen in this House in 
     <lb/>reference to this road. I have no faith in 
     <lb/>it as a commercial enterprise; I look upon 
     <lb/>it as a military necessity, and a bond of 
     <lb/>union between the Confederated Provinces. 
     <lb/>Sir, we have been told that the Imperial 
     <lb/>Government has been notified of the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Government of the United States 
     <lb/>to abrogate the Reciprocity treaty. To my 
     <lb/>mind this will be most unfortunate for 
     <lb/>Canada, and I sincerely trust that the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Government who will shortly visit 
     <lb/>England will urge the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to secure a renewal of it, if it can 
     <lb/>be obtained on honorable terms. While 
     <lb/>hoping this treaty may be renewed, I 
     <lb/>do not participate in the feeling that its 
     <lb/>abrogation will drive us into the United 
     <lb/>States. (Hear, hear.) Sir, I regret to hear 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="891" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-09_Page_0891.jpg"/>

     gentlemen speak so glibly of annexation. 
     <lb/>
     One tells us that if Confederation is not 
     <lb/>
     consummated, annexation is the other al<lb break="no"/>ternative—that we are already on an "in<lb break="no"/>clined plane"—and that the abrogation of 
     <lb/>
     the treaty and refusal to adopt the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions in your bands will certainly " grease 
     <lb/>
     the ways." Sir, I believe nothing of the 
     <lb/>
     kind. The assertion is a libel on the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, who, I believe, are truly loyal to 
     <lb/>
     the British Crown, and have no desire to 
     <lb/>
     change the state of their political existence. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But while provision is made 
     <lb/>
     in these resoutions for the construction of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railroad, I am sorry to 
     <lb/>
     see that no decisive provision is made for the 
     <lb/>
     western extension. And I would not be at 
     <lb/>
     all satisfied myself with the resolutions as 
     <lb/>
     they stand, were it not for the positive 
     <lb/>
     assurances of the Government that that mat<lb break="no"/>ter would be attended to simultaneously 
     <lb/>
     with the construction of that road. For 
     <lb/>
     I hold it to be of essential importance that 
     <lb/>
     we should proceed, as soon as possible, with 
     <lb/>
     the opening up of the North-West country 
     <lb/>
     and the extension of our canal system. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) And while on this subject, I 
     <lb/>
     may be permitted to say that I hope, that in 
     <lb/>
     going on with the canals, the Government 
     <lb/>
     will not overlook the necessity which exists 
     <lb/>
     for the construction of the great Georgian 
     <lb/>
     Bay Canal. (Hear, hear.) reside on the 
     <lb/>
     shores of the Georgian Bay, and am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that that is the best feasible route by which 
     <lb/>
     we can hope to bring the trade of the Great 
     <lb/>
     West through this country. (Hear, hear.) I do 
     <lb/>
     hope the Government will seriously consider 
     <lb/>
     this when  they are framing their canal 
     <lb/>
     scheme. I am glad to see the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General West listening closely to what I am 
     <lb/>
     saying on this subject, and I trust he will 
     <lb/>
    not overlook it.

     <lb/>
     Hear! hear!

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO2">MR. McCONKEY</persName>—I have no hesitation 
     <lb/>
     in expressing my desire that these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions as a whole may be carried into effect, 
     <lb/>
     and that the whole of the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     will come into the arrangement. I hope 
     <lb/>
     they will. I would be sorry to see the 
     <lb/>
     British Government attempt to coerce them 
     <lb/>
     against their will—but I trust that before 
     <lb/>
     many months they will see the prepriety of 
     <lb/>
     coming in—and that before this time twelve 
     <lb/>
     months we shall have been formed into 
     <lb/>
    one great British American Confederation. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I have no doubt that the 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
    

     consummation of this union will give peace 
     <lb/>
     and contentment to the whole country. I 
     <lb/>
     have no hesitation in stating my own con<lb break="no"/>viction that it will give peace and content<lb break="no"/>ment to Upper Canada, by giving us the 
     <lb/>
     management of our own local affairs without 
     <lb/>
     let or hindrance, while Lower Canada in 
     <lb/>
     like manner will have the management of 
     <lb/>
     her own local affairs. It will also give Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, at least in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, what we have so long contended for— 
     <lb/>
     representation according to our population. 
     <lb/>
     I am happy to find that this is fully conced<lb break="no"/>ed to us in the popular branch of the 
     <lb/>
    Legislature. (Hear, hear.) I cannot do 
     <lb/>otherwise than approve of the roceedings 
     <lb/>of the Government the other day, on the 
     <lb/>intelligence reaching us of the result of the 
     <lb/>elections in one of the eastern provinces. 
     <lb/>When I heard that many of those elections 
     <lb/>in New Brunswick had gone against the 
     <lb/>scheme, I was at a loss to decide what 
     <lb/>would be the proper course—whether the 
     <lb/>scheme should still be pressed, or whether 
     <lb/>we should turn our attention to some other 
     <lb/>scheme. On full consideration of the subject, 
     <lb/>I have arrived at the conclusion that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment have acted properly, and that they 
     <lb/>deserve every credit for the prompt action 
     <lb/>they have taken to get a speedy decision on 
     <lb/>this question. It is clear that the question 
     <lb/>of our defences, and that of our commercial 
     <lb/>relations with the United States, must be 
     <lb/>immediately looked to. Some steps must, 
     <lb/>as soon as possible, be taken to put the 
     <lb/>country in a proper state of defence. The 
     <lb/>season is approaching when we would be in 
     <lb/>a very unsatisfactor condition for meeting 
     <lb/>a hostile force, and it is the duty of the <choice><sic>Gov<lb break="no"/>nerment</sic><corr>Government</corr></choice> to take prompt action, that we may 
     <lb/>be prepared, should the  hour of need arise. 
     <lb/>Hear, hear.) A good deal has been said 
     <lb/>during this discussion about-the propriety of 
     <lb/>an  appeal to the peeple. I hold that great 
     <lb/>revo utions of this kind ought to receive the 
     <lb/>sanction of the people. But, in view of the 
     <lb/>fact that it is well known that ninety out of 
     <lb/>every hundred, in Upper Canada at least, are 
     <lb/>in favor of the scheme, I do not com lain that 
     <lb/>it has not been considered advisab e to sub<lb break="no"/>mit it to a direct vote of the people. For 
     <lb/>my own part, bein fully alive to the great 
     <lb/>responsibility I h to assume in voting upon 
     <lb/>these resolutions, I felt it my duty, before 
     <lb/>coming here, to hold meetings through my 
     <lb/>county, in order to consult my constituents. 
     <lb/>These meetings were held all through the 
     <lb/>

     riding, and at every one of them the people 
     <lb/>
     were unanimous in supporting the scheme. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Some of the details were 
     <lb/>
     objected to, but the scheme as a whole was 
     <lb/>
     approved of. These meetings were attended 
     <lb/>
     by men of all parties, and the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     were moved and seconded in many cases by 
     <lb/>
     my political opponents. I did not find more 
     <lb/>
     than three gentlemen, at all of those meet<lb break="no"/>ings, who gave opposition to the measure. 
     <lb/>
     And I may say further, that, when an appeal 
     <lb/>
     to the people was mentioned, the expression 
     <lb/>
     of opinion was, that it was not at all desirable 
     <lb/>
     or necessary, as it was known that the mea<lb break="no"/>sure was so generally approved of. The 
     <lb/>
     result was, that my constituents instructed 
     <lb/>
     me to support these resolutions, giving me 
     <lb/>
     authority at the same time to propose amend<lb break="no"/>ments to such details as I might disapprove 
     <lb/>
     of, if the Government would allow any 
     <lb/>
     amendments to be made. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     find, from conversation with several hon. 
     <lb/>
     members from the west, that I differ from 
     <lb/>
     them with reference to the composition of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council. I hardly approved 
     <lb/>
     of the proposition of the Government when 
     <lb/>
    an innovation was made on the constitution  
     <lb/>of the Legislative Council in 1855. I felt it 
     <lb/>was a wrong step, and fully sympathized with 
     <lb/>the opposition given to it at that time by the 
     <lb/>present Hon. President of the Council (Hon. 
     <lb/>Mr. BROWN) and the honorable member 
     <lb/>for Peel (Honorable J. H. CAMERON). Had 
     <lb/>I then been in a position to give effect 
     <lb/>to my views, I should have joined those 
     <lb/>honorable gentlemen in protesting against 
     <lb/>that encroachment upon the Constitution. 
     <lb/>I approve entirely of the proposition contain<lb break="no"/>ed in the resolutions now before the House, 
     <lb/>with reference to this matter. If a necessity 
     <lb/>exists at all for a check upon hasty and 
     <lb/>ill-digested legislation of the popular branch, 
     <lb/>that check should not derive its power from 
     <lb/>the same source, and in the same man<lb break="no"/>ner. I have, however, for some time in<lb break="no"/>clined to the opinion that the Legislative 
     <lb/>Council might, with safety, be abolished 
     <lb/>altogether, and that thereby there would be 
     <lb/>effected an immense saving to the country. 
     <lb/>In carrying out this scheme, very much, of 
     <lb/>course, will depend upon the character of 
     <lb/>the local constitutions. If such a system 
     <lb/>can be adopted as will render the working 
     <lb/>of the local governments simple and inex<lb break="no"/>pensive, it will conduce very much to the 
     <lb/>prosperity of the whole Confederation. I 
     <lb/>must say, sir, that if I am permitted to have 
     <lb/>a voice in the framing of a Constitution for 
 

            <cb/>
         

     Upper Canada, I shall insist upon it being 
     <lb/>
     of the most inexpensive kind, dispensing 
     <lb/>
     with a great deal of the paraphernalia that 
     <lb/>
     we see so much of here. (Hear, hear.) In 
     <lb/>
     bringing the new system into operation, and 
     <lb/>
     laying the foundations of the new nationality 
     <lb/>
     of British North America on a permanent 
     <lb/>
     and enduring basis, a weighty responsibility 
     <lb/>
     indeed devolves on the governments of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, and the most rigid economy 
     <lb/>
     consistent with propriety ought to be, and I 
     <lb/>
     trust will be, a leading feature in their 
     <lb/>
     arrangements. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I am no alarmist, but disguise it as we may, 
     <lb/>
     this country is at the present moment deep<lb break="no"/>ly depressed. I entirely dissent from sen<lb break="no"/>timents enunciated by honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the floor of this House as to the general 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of Canada ; the actual state of 
     <lb/>
     matters is not as they represent it. Through 
     <lb/>
     a failure of crops for a number of years back 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada, that section of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince is in a state of agricultural and com<lb break="no"/>mercial prostration ; farmers and others are 
     <lb/>
     unable to meet their engagements to the 
     <lb/>
     merchant, who, in consequence, is unable to 
     <lb/>
     meet his liabilities to the wholesale dealers, 
     <lb/>
     and the result is that scores, I may say 
     <lb/>
     hundreds, are obliged to collapse and go into 
     <lb/>
     liquidation ; bank agencies are being with<lb break="no"/>drawn from the country districts, and bank<lb break="no"/>ing accommodation very much curtailed. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, these are facts that cannot 
     <lb/>
     be gainsayed. Every branch of industry is 
     <lb/>
     almost paralyzed at the present moment, and 
     <lb/>
     a general gloom hangs like a pall over the 
     <lb/>
     land. Under these circumstances, it behoves 
     <lb/>
     the Government to do everything in their 
     <lb/>
     power to revive and foster industry in the 
     <lb/>
     country. Sir, I will not say that this Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment does so, but governments have been 
     <lb/>
     too much in the habit of borrowing from 
     <lb/>
     the banks that capital which ought to go 
     <lb/>
     into circulation for the benefit of the trade 
     <lb/>
     of the country. I hold that it is the duty 
     <lb/>
     of all governments to refrain from doing 
     <lb/>
     anything that will bear upon the people's 
     <lb/>
     industry ; and I implore this Government to 
     <lb/>
     turn their attention to the position of this 
     <lb/>
     country just now, and do all they can to 
     <lb/>
     better the condition of the people. While, 
     <lb/>
     sir, there are features in the proposition 
     <lb/>
     before you which, if they stood alone on 
     <lb/>
     their merits, I should certainly oppose, 
     <lb/>
     yet, as I stated before, I do not think them 
     <lb/>
     of sufficient importance to justify me in 
     <lb/>
     rejecting the scheme, which is certainly 
     <lb/>
     calculated to elevate us from the position of 
     <lb/>

     British American nation, covering as it

     Mr. SPEAKER, I deeply feel the great res— 
     <lb/>
     ponsibility that attaches to the vote I will 
     <lb/>
     shortly be called upon to give. I have 
     <lb/>
     weighed well this matter, and taking all 
     <lb/>
     things into account, I can arrive at no other 
     <lb/>
     conclusion than that it is my duty to vote 
     <lb/>
     for the resolutions in your hands, and I am 
     <lb/>
     now prepared to do so, believing that I am 
     <lb/>
     carrying out the views of the great bulk of 
     <lb/>
     my constituents. (Cheers. )

     On motion of <persName ref="pers:TASC1">Mr. TASHEREAU</persName>, the

<!-- GL, 2018-01-30, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->
   
           <!-- <p>
     FRIDAY, March 10, 1865. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     On the Order, for resuming the debate 
     <lb/>
     upon the motion " That the question he 
     <lb/>
     now put" upon the Resolutions relating to 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, being called— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> rose to a point of 
     <lb/>
     order, objecting that the "previous question" 
     <lb/>
     was in the nature of an amendment, and that 
     <lb/>
     no member could move an amendment to his 
     <lb/>
     own motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After some discussion, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR. SPEAKER decided as follows:— 
     <lb/>
     " The original motion, made by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General for Upper Canada, is that 
     <lb/>
     the House should concur in certain resolu<lb break="no"/>tions relating to a Federal union of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Debate having arisen thereon, 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Attorney General for Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada moves, not in amendment in my Opinion, 
     <lb/>
     ' that that question be now put.' The sub<lb break="no"/>stance of   an amendment is to alter the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal question. Does this motion alter the 
     <lb/>
     original question? So far from that, it is a 
     <lb/>
     proposal to bring that question before the 
     <lb/>
     House for immediate decision. The autho<lb break="no"/>rities cited to show that this motion is an 
     <lb/>
     amendment sustain the contrary view in my 
     <lb/>
     judgment, because they only state that the 
     <lb/>
     previous question is 'in the nature of an 
     <lb/>
     amendment.' If it were really an amend<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     ment, or were to be used as an amendment 
     <lb/>
     it would be stated that it was in fact an 
     <lb/>
     amendment. The motion to adjourn is also 
     <lb/>
     spoken of as being in the nature of an amend<lb break="no"/>ment, but it is not an amendment, and like 
     <lb/>
     'The previous question,' does not displace 
     <lb/>
     the original proposition, if carried. Hence 
     <lb/>
     I conclude that 'The previous question' is 
     <lb/>
     not an amendment. The objection that the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Attorney General for Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     cannot move it, on account of having pro<lb break="no"/>posed the original motion, in my opinion is 
     <lb/>
     not valid." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. TASCHEREAU said—It is not 
     <lb/>
     without hesitation, Mr. SPEAKER, that I 
     <lb/>
     rise at this late period of the debate to offer 
     <lb/>
     a few observations on the measure before 
     <lb/>
     us—the plan of Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     British North American Provinces; and my 
     <lb/>
     hesitation is the greater that I am under the 
     <lb/>
     necessity, not only of speaking on a question 
     <lb/>
     which has been so long and skilfully dis-   
     <lb/>
     cussed, that it would appear almost impos<lb break="no"/>sible to say anything which may interest hon. 
     <lb/>
     members, but also and more especially that 
     <lb/>
     after long and deliberate consideration—after 
     <lb/>
     carefully weighing the gist and tendency of 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions, and tracing out the effects 
     <lb/>
     which cannot fail, I believe, to result from 
     <lb/>
     the measure of which they are the exponents— 
     <lb/>
     I feel myself bound, Mr. SPEAKER, to aban<lb break="no"/>don, on this question, those with whom I 
     <lb/>
     have always acted hitherto, to differ in 
     <lb/>
     opinion from those whose talents and judg<lb break="no"/>ment I have never ceased to admire, and to 
     <lb/>
     record my vote against the new Constitution 
     <lb/>
     which is proposed to us in these resolutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hear ! hear ! from the left.) It could not 
     <lb/>
     fail to be to me a particular cause of regret 
     <lb/>
     that I felt compelled to come to this con<lb break="no"/>clusion. I could not understand that this 
     <lb/>
     measure was a simple party matter—one of 
     <lb/>
     those questions on which those party feelings 
     <lb/>
     which have prevailed in Canada so many 
     <lb/>
     years ought to influence any body. I could 
     <lb/>
     not conceive how, in considering a question 
     <lb/>
     which, in my opinion, imperils all that we 
     <lb/>
     hold most dear, and opens to us, if it is 
     <lb/>
     carried, the prospect of a future, dark with 
     <lb/>
     clouds, portending evil not only to us Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, but perhaps no less to all British 
     <lb/>
     North America—I could not conceive, I say, 
     <lb/>
     how I could be unmindful of my convictions, 
     <lb/>
     and lay aside my fears and the sense of duty 
     <lb/>
     which binds me here, to yield blind obedience 
     <lb/>
     and submission to the influence of political 
     <lb/>
     party. I thought myself at liberty to think 
     <lb/>
