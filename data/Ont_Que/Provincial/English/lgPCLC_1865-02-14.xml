<!-- GL, 2016-11-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

           <!-- <p>
     government in case of war, we must not begin 
     <lb/>
     by rendering them discontened and disafected. 
     <lb/>
     Let a fair and equitable system of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion be proposed, and let the people have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of examining into it and approv<lb break="no"/>ing of it, and then no man will shrink from 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of making the greatest sacrifices 
     <lb/>
     to defend the Constitution which has been 
     <lb/>
     freely accepted by the people. It may be said 
     <lb/>
     that the people would be compelled to march 
     <lb/>
     at the point of the bayonet ; but the risk of 
     <lb/>
     such a course is great, for the arm is but 
     <lb/>
     feeble when it is not animated by the heart, 
     <lb/>
     and to defend a country effectually the heart 
     <lb/>
     of the people must be in the cause. The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister stated that the-object of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was to strengthen the monarchical 
     <lb/>
     principle in this country. I do not see that 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary to confer upon the Crown greater 
     <lb/>
     privileges than it already possesses in England 
     <lb/>
     itself. In England the members of the ease 
     <lb/>
     of Lords are not appointed by the Crown ; 
     <lb/>
     succession in the peerage goes down hereditary 
     <lb/>
     from father to son ; but here it is proposed 
     <lb/>
     that the members of the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>
     which bod corresponds to the House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords, should be selected by the Crown. Why 
     <lb/>
     should this be ? Why go beyond what is 
     <lb/>
     done in England itself? Is it that the Crown 
     <lb/>
     complains that it has not sufficient power here ? 
     <lb/>
     , As to the statement that it is proposed to 
     <lb/>
     establish in America, by means of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, a counterpoise to the influence and power 
     <lb/>
     of the United States, I would ask whether 
     <lb/>
     that would not in itself constitute the best 
     <lb/>
    pretext which the Government of the United 
     <lb/>States could wish for upon which to declare 
     <lb/>war against us. At the present time, I am 
     <lb/>not of opinion that the American people are 
     <lb/>desirous of seeking a quarrel with us; just 
     <lb/>now the have quite enough to attend to. 
     <lb/>But if eir Government should think it to 
     <lb/>their interest to declare war against England, 
     <lb/>the best pretext which they could bring for<lb break="no"/>ward to excite the American people against 
     <lb/>us would certainly be this pretended counter<lb break="no"/>poise which it is sought to establish. It is 
     <lb/>well known that the MONROE doctrine is a 
     <lb/>principle to which all the people of the United 
     <lb/>States are attached, and, should we give them 
     <lb/>an opportunity, they would avail themselves 
     <lb/>of it to put that doctrine into practice. Since 
     <lb/>Confederation does not in reality increase the 
     <lb/>strength of the colonies, why should we give 
     <lb/>umbrage to the Government of the United 
     <lb/>States, and provide them with the means of 
     <lb/>animating their people against us in case of 
     <lb/>the breaking out of hostilities? If the means 
     <lb/>

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     for the defence of the country were increased, 
     <lb/>
     I would say, let us throw aside all these con<lb break="no"/>siderations, but such, in my opinion, is not 
     <lb/>
     the case. In conclusion, I would implore the 
     <lb/>
     Government to grant to the people the time 
     <lb/>
     and the opportunity of convincing themselves 
     <lb/>
     that the Constitution which it has prepared is 
     <lb/>
     agood one, and that it has really been planned 
     <lb/>
     with a view to their interests ; and, in that 
     <lb/>
     case, I predict that when the time for defence 
     <lb/>
     comes, the people will march like one man. 
     <lb/>
     But if it is intended to thrust it upon them 
     <lb/>
     by main force, and without consulting them, 
     <lb/>
     we must not, we cannot, expect them to defend 
     <lb/>
     their land with the like zeal. I consider that 
     <lb/>
     this demand is no more than just, both to 
     <lb/>
     ourselves and to the people whom we represent. 
     <lb/>
     So far as I myself am concerned, I 'd not 
     <lb/>
     come here to fight against Confederation and 
     <lb/>
     destroy it at any price, but I certainly will 
     <lb/>
     not vote for it without being acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     it in all its details. (Cheers) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     TUESDAY, <hi rendition="simple:italic">February</hi> 14, 1865. 
     <lb/></p>

    <p> <persName ref="pers:BELL2">HON. Sir N. F. BELLEAU</persName> said—Hon. 
     <lb/>
    gentlemen, the discussion on the scheme of 
     <lb/>Confederation has already been protracted, 
     <lb/>and little really remains to be said, for all 
     <lb/>the objections to the scheme have been 
     <lb/>made by the one side and replied to by the 
     <lb/>other. I may, however, be permitted to 
     <lb/>offer a few remarks on one or two of the ob<lb break="no"/>jections which were urged again yesterday. 
     <lb/>For the last three years the country has 
     <lb/>witnessed a state of things which by many 
     <lb/>persons has been designated governmental 
     <lb/>anarchy. Government after government in 
     <lb/>rapid succession have grasped the helm of 
     <lb/>state. A state of conflict existed between 
     <lb/>political parties which was hourly on the 
     <lb/>increase; a conflict which threatened to 
     <lb/>arrest the progress of public business, and 
     <lb/>which drew the minds of our statesmen to 
     <lb/>consider whether any means could be adopted' 
     <lb/>to remedy this state of things. The men 
     <lb/>of influence throughout the country at 
     <lb/>length decided to unite, and have come to 
     <lb/>the conclusion that a remedy was to be 
     <lb/>found in a Confederation of the British 
     <lb/>American Provinces. It is not to be won<lb break="no"/>dered at that this plan should have attracted 
     <lb/>the attention of the present Administration, 
     <lb/>for it was not a new one, and the question 
     <lb/>had already been brought before the country 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="181" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-14_Page_0181.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">181</fw>


            on several occasions. In the Confederation
<lb/>
of these provinces are to be found elements <lb/>
which give promise, nay, contain the germ <lb/>
of a power which will one day take its place <lb/>
among the nations of the world. And in <lb/>
considering this Confederation of the British <lb/>
North American Provinces, I am reminded <lb/>
of the fable of the bundle of sticks, which I <lb/>
learned in my childhood, and which so ex<lb break="no"/>actly applies to the present circumstances. <lb/>
This fable tells us that the sticks when <lb/>
bound together were strong enough to resist <lb/>
all the efforts made to break them, but <lb/>
that when separated they were broken one <lb/>
by one with but little effort. It seems to <lb/>
me that the lesson afforded by
this fable <lb/>
may be well applied to the question of Con<lb break="no"/>federation—separated we are weak, united <lb/>
we shall be strong. Commerce, population, <lb/>
manufactures, progress, in a word, all the <lb/>
elements requisite to constitute a powerful <lb/>
nation are contained in the united colonies ; <lb/>
but these become of little consequence if <lb/>
allowed to be utilized by each separate <lb/>
colony. And not only would the union of <lb/>
these elements constitute the Confederation <lb/>
a great power amongst the other nations of <lb/>
the world, but there would be found amongst <lb/>
its population a number of sturdy arms, <lb/>
sufficient, with the aid of Great Britain, to <lb/>
repel foreign aggression. I do not belong <lb/>
to that school which pretends that in case <lb/>
of invasion on the part of the United States, <lb/>
the best thing we could do would be to re<lb break="no"/>main passive with folded arms. That is not <lb/>
my idea. Such actions may flatter the <lb/>
opinions and desires of those who have <lb/>
republican leanings, of annexationists and <lb/>
of anti-Canadians, who are nothing less than <lb/>
enemies
of the monarchical system in this <lb/>
country. I have no sympathy with those <lb/>
who place themselves at the head of the <lb/>
republican and annexationist school, for I <lb/>
see in them none of those national aspira<lb break="no"/>tions of which every man is always proud. <lb/>
With these few remarks to shew the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of Confederation, and that its first result <lb/>
will be the production of a new and power<lb break="no"/>ful people, I propose to consider the terms <lb/>
and conditions of the scheme, and whether <lb/>
Lower Canada will find in them the protec<lb break="no"/>tion its interests demand. The first point <lb/>
to which I directed my attention was to as<lb break="no"/>certain what guarantees Lower Canada would <lb/>
find in Confederation for its laws, its religion <lb/>
and its autonomy. I find the guarantee of <lb/>
all these things in that article of the<lb/>


            <cb/>

           scheme which gives to Lower Canada the <lb/>
local
government of its affairs, and
the con<lb break="no"/>trol of all matters relating to
its institutions, <lb/>
to its laws, to its religion,
its manufactures <lb/>
and its autonomy. Are you not
all prepared, <lb/>
hon. gentlemen, and you
especially members <lb/>
from Lower Canada, to make some
few sacri<lb break="no"/>fices in order to have the
control of all those <lb/>
things to which I have just
referred, and <lb/>
which are all to be within the
jurisdiction of <lb/>
the local governments. Are you
not ready to <lb/>
make some few sacrifices to see
an end put <lb/>
to those struggles which have
been con<lb break="no"/>stantly recurring during the
last few years, to <lb/>
the imminent peril of Lower
Canada and of <lb/>
its institutions—dangers which
still exist and <lb/>
which might even now become only
too ap<lb break="no"/>parent were the friends who have
sustained <lb/>
the combat to grow weary, or to
give way <lb/>
and leave the field to their
adversaries? If we <lb/>
persist in striving to obtain
too much, if we <lb/>
are unwilling to make any
sacrifice, we may <lb/>
lose the whole result of these
struggles and <lb/>
the advantages now offered for
our accep<lb break="no"/>tance. For my part the
consideration that <lb/>
we shall have the control of our
local affairs <lb/>
in Lower Canada, under the
Confederation, <lb/>
is a sufficient inducement to
vote in favor <lb/>
of the scheme now submitted to
us, even <lb/>
although it offered us no other
advantage. <lb/>
But, without entering into the
details, I <lb/>
now propose to reply to certain
objections <lb/>
which have been urged, and prove
that it is <lb/>
for our interest to adopt this
plan. One of <lb/>
the very first objections raised
has been <lb/>
offered by the honorable member
for the <lb/>
Wellington Divison (Hon. Mr. SANBORN). <lb/>
He has stated that he could not
vote for <lb/>
Confederation because he had not
received <lb/>
the sanction of his constituents
to change <lb/>
the Constitution of his country.
Whilst, <lb/>
however, he makes this
statement, the same <lb/>
honorable gentleman proposes,
nevertheless, <lb/>
to change the Constitution which
he declares <lb/>
his electors have not given him
authority <lb/>
to change in any particular.
This is the <lb/>
resolution which he proposes in
amendment : <lb/>
            </p>

           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">Upper Canada to be represented in the

           </quote>

            <p> Well, honorable gentlemen, if the
honorable <lb/>
member from Wellington has not received <lb/>
authority to change the Constitution of this <lb/>
country, certainly he has not the right to <lb/>
make the amendment which he proposes, an <lb/>
amendment which is full of contradiction. <lb/>
The honorable gentleman says that he has <lb/>
no objection to vote for Confederation after <lb/>
having consulted his electors. Well, although <lb/>
he may not have much faith in the maxim <lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Vox populi, vox Dei</hi>, the honorable member <lb/>
has declared that the rule of his conduct <lb/>
has always been, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Salus populi suprema lex</hi>. <lb/>
I have no doubt, however, that he would <lb/>
say, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Salus meus suprema lex est</hi>, if he were <lb/>
appointed a life member, and that he would <lb/>
have no scruple as regards amending the <lb/>
Constitution. The same argument has been <lb/>
urged by the honorable member for Lanau<lb break="no"/>dière (Hon. Mr. OLIVIER). Well, I think <lb/>
that that honorable gentleman will not, <lb/>
without difficulty, extricate himself from <lb/>
the dilemma in which I am about to place <lb/>
him. He has also stated that he had receiv<lb break="no"/>ed no authority from his constituents to <lb/>
alter the Constitution. If he has not re<lb break="no"/>ceived this authority, he ought to vote <lb/>
against the amendment which is now pro<lb break="no"/>posed, the object of which is to alter the <lb/>
Constitution. If this objection were a serious <lb/>
one, why do not members who are desirous <lb/>
of consulting their electors resign their <lb/>
seats, and seek re-election on this question, <lb/>
instead of setting the whole country in a <lb/>
blaze by a dissolution? But no, they fold <lb/>
their arms and say that a dissolution does <lb/>
not affect them, the Council would not be <lb/>
affected by it. They are not, then, serious in <lb/>
asking for an appeal to the people. The hon. <lb/>
member for Grandville (Hon. Mr. LETELLIER <lb/>
DE ST. JUST)
has also read something to the <lb/>
same purpose. I call upon him, then, to <lb/>
resign his seat and to consult his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents ; but as he has already tried the experi<lb break="no"/>ment lately in two important places in his <lb/>
division, he knows that the ground trembles <lb/>
under his feet. I do not think he would <lb/>
care to make the trial, as the result might <lb/>
be very far from gratifying. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LETE1">HON. MR. LETELLIER DE ST. JUST</persName> <lb/>
—I am ready to resign to-morrow, if you <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
         
will come and contest the division with <lb/>
me. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELL2">HON. SIR N. F. BELLEAU</persName>—I will not <lb/>
go myself, but others will, and I venture to <lb/>
predict that you will be left at home. I <lb/>
trust, then, that we shall hear no more about <lb/>
this want of authority to alter the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, for it is only a roundabout way of <lb/>
defeating the scheme of Confederation, out <lb/>
of pure party feeling. It has also been said <lb/>
that the electors were taken by surprise, <lb/>
and that they did not know what was being <lb/>
done—that they did not know what the plan <lb/>
of Confederation was until it was discussed <lb/>
here ; but those who have taken part in pub<lb break="no"/>lic affairs since 1858 cannot say this, for the <lb/>
question has been laid before the country <lb/>
for discussion several times since that period, <lb/>
and always by official acts. No one has <lb/>
forgotten the celebrated speech made by the <lb/>
Hon. Mr. GALT, in 1858, when he join<lb break="no"/>ed the CARTIER-MACDONALD Ministry, in <lb/>
which he declared himself to be in favor <lb/>
of a Confederation of the provinces. It has <lb/>
not been forgotten that Hon. Messrs. GALT, <lb/>
CARTIER and Ross then made a voyage to <lb/>
England to lay before the Minister for the <lb/>
Colonies their views on the subject of Con<lb break="no"/>federation. It is true that from that period <lb/>
up to last year, but little was said about it, <lb/>
because there had been a change in the <lb/>
English Government, and it was necessary <lb/>
to recommence all that had been done ; but <lb/>
if the question was not talked about in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, it was not allowed to sleep here. No one <lb/>
has forgotten the Speech from the Throne, <lb/>
delivered in Toronto in 1858, by Sir EDMUND
<lb/>
HEAD, in which he spoke of the necessity <lb/>
of enquiring into the matter, and laying it <lb/>
before the country. Most certainly no better <lb/>
means of submitting it to the people could <lb/>
have been adopted. Subsequently the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was mooted again and again in the <lb/>
House of Assembly up to the time when, <lb/>
governments succeeding each other like <lb/>
flashes of lighting, it became necessary to <lb/>
have recourse to a coalition, in order to put <lb/>
an end to the anarchy which prevailed in <lb/>
the political affairs of the country. The <lb/>
coalition in question was based on the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of Confederation. The members of <lb/>
that Government, by a happy and unusual <lb/>
concurrence of circumstances, had an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of meeting at the Charlottetown Con<lb break="no"/>ference to discuss the question, and enter <lb/>
slightly upon the subject of a general Con<lb break="no"/>federation. They again met at Quebec, <lb/>
        
            <pb n="183" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-14_Page_0183.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">183</fw>
         
 together with all the delegates from the <lb/>
Lower Provinces, and the result of their <lb/>
labors is the plan which is now laid before <lb/>
us. But there is more to be said, for before <lb/>
the present Ministry had entered upon the <lb/>
consideration of the plan, with their col<lb break="no"/>leagues of the Gulf provinces, His Excellency <lb/>
had alluded to it in his Speech, and had said <lb/>
that it was absolutely necessary that a con<lb break="no"/>clusion on the subject should be come to. <lb/>
And besides, the leading papers of this pro<lb break="no"/>vince and of the Lower Provinces, have <lb/>
long been engaged in the discussion of the <lb/>
question. The details have been examined <lb/>
in all their hearings to satiety. In view of <lb/>
all these facts, I would ask how it can be <lb/>
said that the people do not know what the <lb/>
question is? No; this is merely a pretext <lb/>
which is made use of to overthrow the plan. <lb/>
But another fact which goes to prove that <lb/>
the people have not been taken by surprise <lb/>
in this matter is, that within the last ten <lb/>
months, there have been twelve elections of <lb/>
legislative councillors, and it cannot be <lb/>
said
that when those elections took place, <lb/>
the question of Confederation was not before <lb/>
the public. This would be to state a false<lb break="no"/>hood in the full glare of noonday. The hon. <lb/>
member for Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. OLIVIER), <lb/>
yesterday said that a Montreal paper had <lb/>
stated that he had declared himself opposed <lb/>
to Confederation, and he hastened to con<lb break="no"/>tradict the assertion. But I must say that <lb/>
when he appeared before his constituents <lb/>
and talked of retrograde steps -when he said <lb/>
that, for his part, he should consider it a <lb/>
step back in civilization, if he voted against <lb/>
the election of members of this House, I <lb/>
consider that it was idle of him to say that <lb/>
he had not declared himself opposed to Con<lb break="no"/>federation. <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—The details. <lb/>
<persName ref="pers:BELL2">HON. SIR N. F. BELLEAU</persName>—Details <lb/>
and principle. I say then that at the elec<lb break="no"/>tions which have taken place, the members <lb/>
elected, unless they did not choose
to do <lb/>
their duty, must have spoken of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation, and above all, of the manner in <lb/>
which the Legislative Council would be <lb/>
treated in that Confederation. And if these <lb/>
details were entered into, the people are <lb/>
acquainted with the subject in question. <lb/>
And not only have there been elections, but <lb/>
there have been public meetings in large <lb/>
numbers throughout the whole country,<lb break="no"/>that is to say, wherever the opponents of <lb/>
Confederation could get them up without <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
danger to themselves ; and at all these
meet<lb break="no"/>ings they did not require to be forced to <lb/>
speak of Confederation, and that in the <lb/>
most unfavorable terms possible. It is true <lb/>
that matters were not represented on those <lb/>
occasions in their true light. but the people <lb/>
at any rate knew what subject was under <lb/>
discussion. The honorable member for <lb/>
Wellington (Hon. Mr. SANBORN)
laid great <lb/>
stress on the danger which might be incur<lb break="no"/>red by the Protestant minority in the local <lb/>
legislation of Lower Canada. He tears that <lb/>
they may not be sufficiently protected by the <lb/>
Catholic majority in respect of their reli<lb break="no"/>gion, their schools and possibly their pro<lb break="no"/>perty. I am astonished to hear such lan<lb break="no"/>guage from the lips of a man who, like <lb/>
myself, represents a division more than <lb/>
one-half of the population of which is <lb/>
French Canadian and Catholic, for that fact <lb/>
in itself is a proof of the liberality of our <lb/>
fellow-countrymen. I heard that remark <lb/>
with pain ; but I can tell him that the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority of Lower Canada have <lb/>
nothing to fear from the Catholic majority <lb/>
of that province: their religion is guaranteed <lb/>
by treaty, and their schools and the rights <lb/>
which may be connected with them, are to <lb/>
be settled by legislation to take place here<lb break="no"/>after, and when that legislation is laid before <lb/>
the Houses, those members who so greatly <lb/>
tremble now for the rights of the Protes<lb break="no"/>tant minority will have an opportunity of <lb/>
protecting that minority; they may then <lb/>
urge their reasons, and insist that the Pro<lb break="no"/>testants shall not be placed in a position of <lb/>
the slightest danger. But even granting <lb/>
that the Protestants were wronged by the Lo<lb break="no"/>cal Legislature of Lower Canada, could they <lb/>
not avail themselves of the protection of the <lb/>
Federal Legislature? And would not the <lb/>
Federal Government exercise strict surveil<lb break="no"/>lance over the action of the local legislatures <lb/>
in these matters? Why should it be sought <lb/>
to give existence to imaginary fears in Lower <lb/>
Canada? I say imaginary, because the <lb/>
liberality of the inhabitants of Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da—a liberality of which they gave proof <lb/>
long, long ago, by enacting the emancipa<lb break="no"/>tion of the Jews before any other nation in <lb/>
the world had dreamed of such a measure<lb break="no"/>is well known. No; far from wishing to <lb/>
oppress other nationalities, all that the <lb/>
French Canadians ask is to live at peace <lb/>
 with all the world; they are
quite willing <lb/>
 that they should enjoy their
rights, provided <lb/>
 that all live peaceably
together. (Hear.) <lb/></p>

            <fw type="num">184</fw>
      
 <p>
 I cannot refrain from saying a word as to
<lb/>
the Protestants of Lower Canada, and as to <lb/>
the liberality evinced towards them by the <lb/>
French and Catholic population. It is <lb/>
feared that we may combine together in <lb/>
order to treat them unjustly. I may be <lb/>
wrong in referring to the fact, but it is true <lb/>
that the French Canadians have always lived <lb/>
on more cordial terms with the English <lb/>
Protestants than with the Irish, who are <lb/>
nevertheless of the same religion, and of the <lb/>
same belief as themselves. If this good feel<lb break="no"/>ing has always existed, what is there to fear? <lb/>
The hon. member for Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
OLIVIER) has said, that the plan of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was not necessary, and in that he <lb/>
agreed with the hon. member for Grand<lb break="no"/>ville (Hon. Mr. LETELLIER). He has stated <lb/>
that it would have been possible to regulate <lb/>
the difficulties which we have witnessed, <lb/>
without having recourse to Confederation, <lb/>
from the fact that many of these difficulties <lb/>
arose from the hatred existing between cer<lb break="no"/>tain individuals. Now, for my part, I do <lb/>
not believe that our political men were <lb/>
actuated by motives of mutual hatred. When <lb/>
I witnessed the struggles which occurred in <lb/>
the House of Assembly, the votes of want <lb/>
of confidence which were proposed, I always <lb/>
felt that those who proposed them gave good <lb/>
reasons for so doing. But I was not aware <lb/>
of the existence of hatred or personal <lb/>
jealousy between the parties, and that upon <lb/>
the removal of such feelings, the difficulties <lb/>
might be easily overcome. But the
state<lb break="no"/>ment is made simply for want of any sound <lb/>
arguments against Confederation. The same <lb/>
hon. member also stated, that the minorities <lb/>
in Upper and Lower Canada wished to <lb/>
know the fate reserved for them, before <lb/>
voting for Confederation. If he had reflect<lb break="no"/>ed a little, he would have learned that the <lb/>
fate of the minorities will be defined by the <lb/>
law, that their religion is guaranteed by <lb/>
treaties, and that they will be protected by the <lb/>
vigilance of the Federal Government, which <lb/>
will never permit the minority of one
por<lb break="no"/>tion of the Confederation to be oppressed <lb/>
by the majority. The hon. member also <lb/>
contends that the local governments ought <lb/>
to have larger powers than those proposed <lb/>
to be conferred upon them, and that the <lb/>
Federal Government ought to have fewer <lb/>
powers. To hear him, one cannot help <lb/>
thinking that the experience of history is <lb/>
entirely lost on certain individuals. He <lb/>
must have been aware, however, that it is in  <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
        
reference to the rights of particular
states, <lb/>
that civil war now exists in the United <lb/>
States; nevertheless, he would implant in <lb/>
this country the same germ of discord. He <lb/>
would have more power below and less <lb/>
authority above. For my part I say the <lb/>
very contrary, if we wish to have a strong <lb/>
Government capable of enforcing respect for <lb/>
its authority when it shall be necessary to <lb/>
enforce it. The hon. member also stated <lb/>
that he has no confidence in the exercise of <lb/>
the powers of the Federal Government, <lb/>
because it would be surrounded by a clique. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—I did not say that <lb/>
would be the case, but that, theoretically, it <lb/>
might occur, and that if it were surrounded <lb/>
by a clique, the rights of Lower Canada <lb/>
would be in danger. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELL2">HON. SIR. N. F. BELLEAU</persName>—That <lb/>
makes no difference ; for he stated that he <lb/>
feared the Government would be surrounded <lb/>
by a clique. But is it not the national <lb/>
representation that will surround the Federal <lb/>
Government? Is that a clique? To say <lb/>
that our Government is a clique, is to vilify<lb/>
the institutions of the country. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be responsible to the Legislature. <lb/>
Let us never lose sight of the fact, that our <lb/>
national representatives will always see that <lb/>
Lower Canada shall have in the Federal <lb/>
Government one, or perhaps two, representa<lb break="no"/>tives—the number is not of importance. <lb/>
What is of importance is, that such one, or <lb/>
such two members, should represent in her <lb/>
Executive Council the national representa<lb break="no"/>tion, which will be composed of 65 members, <lb/>
in the Federal Legislature. And this, for<lb break="no"/>sooth, is called a clique ! I insist somewhat <lb/>
at length upon this point, because the opera<lb break="no"/>tion of the principle of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the Federal Legislature is lost sight <lb/>
of. I beg to call the attention of Lower <lb/>
Canada members to this. Suppose it were <lb/>
proposed to adopt a law in the Federal Legis<lb break="no"/>lature calculated to injure Lower Canada, <lb/>
our 65 representatives in the House of <lb/>
Commons discuss the law, and decide that <lb/>
they must oppose it ; they at once commu<lb break="no"/>nicate with the members of the Government <lb/>
representing Lower Canada, and inform them <lb/>
that they cannot accept the measure, and <lb/>
that if it be passed, they will coalesce with <lb/>
the minority, which always exists under <lb/>
responsible government, and that they will <lb/>
overthrow the Ministry. Such is the weight <lb/>
of our influence in the Federal Government;  <lb/>
and if this were not lost sight of, there <lb/>
        
            <pb n="185" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-14_Page_0185.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">185</fw> 
      
 would be no grounds for fear. The influ<lb break="no"/>ence of Lower Canada will enable her to <lb/>
make and unmake governments at pleasure, <lb/>
when her interests shall be at stake or <lb/>
threatened.
And if the importance of this <lb/>
responsibility of the Federal Government <lb/>
were well understood, there would be no <lb/>
anxiety about our institutions. The hon. <lb/>
member also stated that he did not want to <lb/>
make a backward step in relation to the <lb/>
election of the members of the Legislative <lb/>
Council. In reply to that, I would state <lb/>
that the elective principle, as applied to the <lb/>
Legislative Council, becomes unnecessary in <lb/>
view of the numerical strength of Lower <lb/>
Canada in the Federal Parliament, for the <lb/>
House of Commons is the body that will <lb/>
make and unmake ministers. Why have <lb/>
the elective principle for the Legislative <lb/>
Council, since we shall have it for the House <lb/>
of Commons, since we shall have a responsi<lb break="no"/>ble Government and a Federal Government, <lb/>
composed of members elected by the people? <lb/>
The hon. member has stated that he desired <lb/>
to advance with the intellect of the people, <lb/>
and not to take a backward step. These <lb/>
are great words—the intellect of the people! <lb/>
progress! But for my part, I do not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate to assert that the people will gladly <lb/>
sacrifice the election of the members of the <lb/>
Legislative Council, in view of the control <lb/>
of all the matters I mentioned before. <lb/>
The hon. member has said that the elective <lb/>
principle would have been the safe-guard of <lb/>
Lower Canada. I can understand this to be <lb/>
the case in a House which is able to make <lb/>
and unmake administrations, but in a House <lb/>
which is indissoluble, I cannot discover its <lb/>
importance. The safety of Lower Canada <lb/>
depends, not on the elective principle, but <lb/>
on the responsibility of the members of the <lb/>
 Executive to the House of Commons.
I may <lb/>
be permitted to say one word on the subject <lb/>
of the elective right, as it is the grand pan<lb break="no"/>acea for all the ills incident to humanity. <lb/>
We must not shut our eyes against evidence. <lb/>
Have we, since the union of several counties <lb/>
to form electoral divisions, seen persons of <lb/>
independent fortune and character, who do <lb/>
not seek to make a gainful pursuit of politics, <lb/>
offer themselves for election to the
Legislative <lb/>
 Council ? I acknowledge that the
elections <lb/>
to seats in the Legislative Council which <lb/>
have taken place so far have had excellent <lb/>
results : the members sent hither by their <lb/>
constituencies have added new lustre to the <lb/>
body; but has it not now become almost <lb/>
           
            <cb/> 
           
 impossible to get an independent man to <lb/>
stand? The contested elections in the large <lb/>
divisions have disgusted many who would do <lb/>
honor to the country, but who will not risk <lb/>
their fortune in an election ; and if we see <lb/>
such a result already, what is it likely to be <lb/>
hereafter? We shall see political intriguers <lb/>
making their own of the electoral divisions <lb/>
as a living—living by politics and for politics <lb/>
only. We shall see what has been seen in <lb/>
other countries—people embracing political <lb/>
life as a shield against their creditors, shel<lb break="no"/>tering themselves under its aegis against <lb/>
the law. Such men will fill this House, <lb/>
to the exclusion of honor and honesty. I <lb/>
say again, those who now compose this <lb/>
House are honorable men, who are a <lb/>
credit to their country—in time, their <lb/>
seats will be filled by political intriguers. <lb/>
Another, and a final objection to Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation has been made, namely, that having <lb/>
it, we shall not have increased the means of <lb/>
defence, nor the resources of the country. <lb/>
If those who talk thus had taken time to <lb/>
consider the matter more carefully, they <lb/>
would not hold this opinion. It is evident <lb/>
that with the means of communication already <lb/>
provided, and the Intercolonial Railway, if <lb/>
a section of Upper Canada should be invaded <lb/>
by the enemy, the combined forces of the <lb/>
Confederation might be transported to the <lb/>
point threatened in a very short time, and <lb/>
we would be in a position to show the enemy <lb/>
that united we are strong. We should be <lb/>
wilfully blind not to see this. It has also <lb/>
been alleged that in order to increase our <lb/>
means of defence, we should build the North <lb/>
Shore Railway, and that the Government <lb/>
who do not this are inefficient and renegades <lb/>
to their country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—I never made use <lb/>
of that expression. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELL2">HON. SIR N. F. BELLEAU</persName>—True, you <lb/>
did not make use of the expression, but what <lb/>
you said amounted to that in meaning. <lb/>
According to the hon. member, the North <lb/>
Shore Railway would be the
salvation of the <lb/>
country. I believe the hon. member resides <lb/>
somewhere in the north, on the line of that <lb/>
road. (Hear, and laughter.) I believe that <lb/>
his motto is, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Salus mea suprema lex est</hi>.-<lb/>(All for myself, nothing for others.) The <lb/>
North Shore Railway has had, and may again <lb/>
have, its advantages; and as a channel of <lb/>
communication I should be glad to see it <lb/>
built, but at present the building of it would <lb/>
cost too dear. When the military defences <lb/>
          
            <pb n="186" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-14_Page_0186.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">186</fw>
        
 projected by the present Administration
for <lb/>
the protection of the South Side Railway <lb/>
are completed, the north side road will not <lb/>
be required. The hon. member has also <lb/>
said that he is desirous of giving the inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of the country time to reflect on and <lb/>
study the scheme of Confederation, and that <lb/>
he does not see why we should wish to urge <lb/>
on the passing of the measure so strenuously. <lb/>
I have already observed that a plan was <lb/>
submitted to the Mother Country some years <lb/>
ago, but that a change of ministers then had <lb/>
rendered the scheme abortive. The same <lb/>
thing may happen again ; and if we consider <lb/>
the age of the Premier of England, and the <lb/>
uncertain position in which his Cabinet <lb/>
would stand if he should die, it will be plain <lb/>
that we have no time to lose. This is a <lb/>
very sufficient reason for urging on the <lb/>
measure in the minds of those who hold that <lb/>
it is destined to save the country. One more <lb/>
remark and I have done. The hon. member <lb/>
(Hon. Mr. OLIVIER) has adjured us not <lb/>
to wound the susceptible feelings of our <lb/>
neighbors,—not to give umbrage to their <lb/>
sensitiveness,—by entering into a Confed<lb break="no"/>ration which might give them a pretext <lb/>
for carrying out the Monroe doctrine. <lb/>
This is, I think, the most paltry reason <lb/>
that could be alleged in discussing the <lb/>
most important question of legislation <lb/>
which has ever arisen on this conti<lb break="no"/>nent, so far as the fate of Canada is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. I think that the measure is in <lb/>
every respect suitable and advantageous to <lb/>
Canada. Any attempt to obstruct it by <lb/>
such considerations, is a proof of pusillani<lb break="no"/>mity, and I almost feel ashamed to hear the <lb/>
expression of them from the lips of a French <lb/>
Canadian. (Cheers.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LETE1">HON. MR. LETELLIER DE ST. JUST</persName> <lb/>
—Honorable Gentlemen, after the speech <lb/>
which we have just heard, I hope a few <lb/>
words will be allowed to me, for I have <lb/>
been, I must say, perfectly astonished to <lb/>
hear such statements fall from the lips of <lb/>
the hon. member who has just resumed his <lb/>
seat; and if my object was to reply to him, <lb/>
I might satisfy myself with saying :-<lb/>
            </p>
           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">ORLANDO, in his frenzy, I saw, <lb/>

           Expend all his strength and toil, <lb/>
From the hold of their mother earth to draw, <lb/>
Trees that clave not to the soil. <lb/></quote>

<p>It is most certainly my right, I consider, <lb/>
when I see an honorable member rise in his <lb/>
place, and say that we, the councillors elect<lb break="no"/>ed by the people, are nobody because our <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
        
pouches are not so well lined as those <lb/>
of certain honorable members, to express <lb/>
my astonishment at the use of such lan<lb break="no"/>guage; for we should be permitted to hold <lb/>
the opinion, that the value of the man is not <lb/>
to be measured by the amount of money <lb/>
which he may happen to possess. There is <lb/>
such a thing as a nobility of education and <lb/>
of intellect, as well as a moneyed aristocracy, <lb/>
and for my part, I consider that the former is <lb/>
quite equal to the latter. In all countries <lb/>
in the world education has produced a feel<lb break="no"/>ing of devotion to the country, while riches <lb/>
alone have often produced but sordid avarice. <lb/>
The hon. member pretends that if the elec<lb break="no"/>tive principle continues to be applied to the <lb/>
Legislative Council, the result will very soon <lb/>
be that
all those
adventurers who seek to <lb/>
live in political life and by political life, will <lb/>
drive from our midst all men of merit, and <lb/>
will then control the affairs of the country. <lb/>
For my part, I by no means stand in dread <lb/>
of such a result, for I know that there is too <lb/>
much good sense among the peeplc to make <lb/>
it possible that they will ever consent to <lb/>
serve as a stepping-stone to political adven<lb break="no"/>turers in pursuit of the advancement of their <lb/>
own personal prospects and fortune in public <lb/>
life. I am well aware that some political ad<lb break="no"/>venturers do occasionally succeed in imposing <lb/>
upon the people by means of fine promises <lb/>
and a hypocritical exterior ; but the political <lb/>
life of such individuals has never been of <lb/>
long duration, and the results of the election <lb/>
of legislative councillors by the people <lb/>
remain to prove the complete absence of <lb/>
foundation for the fears expressed by the <lb/>
honorable member. I think, moreover, that <lb/>
the results which have hitherto obtained <lb/>
from the application of the elective principle <lb/>
to this House, and from the election of the <lb/>
members who now sit in it, are satisfactory <lb/>
and do no dishonor to this honorable House. <lb/>
At any rate I never yet heard such a thing <lb/>
asserted. The hon. member maintains that <lb/>
it is not necessary that the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil should be elective, because that body is <lb/>
intended, or has for its mission, to act as a <lb/>
counterpoise between the Executive and the <lb/>
Lower House. But that state of affairs <lb/>
exists at the present day,—and when all <lb/>
acknowledge it,—when none complain of the <lb/>
present system—we are told that this privilege <lb/>
is to be taken away from the people in order <lb/>
that it may be restored to the Crown ! Now, <lb/>
I say that such a proceeding is a step in a <lb/>
backward direction. and a retrogression from <lb/>

the advancement of the age. Is it because
<lb/>
certain members of the Council have never <lb/>
been successful in their efforts to be elected <lb/>
for any county whatever, that they wish to <lb/>
deprive the people of the right of electing <lb/>
their representatives? But is it supposed <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> that by giving the Crown the right of ap<lb break="no"/>pointing legislative councillors, the services <lb/>
of more able, more upright, and more honor<lb break="no"/>able men will be secured, than if the people <lb/>
were allowed to elect them? When the <lb/>
Legislative Council was made elective, those <lb/>
who prepared the law were of the same opinion <lb/>
as the honorable member (Hon. Sir N. F. <lb/>
BELLEAU) that a rich man must of necessity <lb/>
be a man of greater talent than one less <lb/>
blessed with this world's goods, and, in order <lb/>
that the people might not err in their selec<lb break="no"/>tion, they enacted that every member elected <lb/>
to the Legislative Council should possess at <lb/>
least one thousand pounds in real property ; <lb/>
but now, in the scheme of Confederation, <lb/>
that amount is reduced by one-half, and it <lb/>
is thereby admitted that the possession of <lb/>
riches is not an indispensable condition to <lb/>
the possession of talent. The honorable <lb/>
member endeavored to justify the haste <lb/>
with which it is sought to push the <lb/>
scheme of Confederation through, by declar<lb break="no"/>ing that Lord PALMERSTON is a very aged <lb/>
man, and that his Ministry is quavering in <lb/>
the balance. So, because the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of England is old, we are to be compelled <lb/>
to swallow the pill without even being allowed <lb/>
time to enquire whether it is suited to our <lb/>
case or not. It must be acknowledged that <lb/>
this is a very poor argument. As to the fear <lb/>
of seeing the scheme of Confederation thrown <lb/>
out in England, in case of any change taking <lb/>
place in the constitution of the Imperial <lb/>
Government, I look upon it as entirely chi<lb break="no"/>merical—for if Confederation is acceptable <lb/>
in England and to English interests now, it <lb/>
will be just as acceptable to them eight or ten <lb/>
months hence as it is at present. If the plan <lb/>
is a useful one, in an English point of view, <lb/>
it will be carried out, let what Government <lb/>
may be in power. Then let the people have <lb/>
time to consider of it. The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber has stated that there have been twelve <lb/>
elections to the Legislative Council since the <lb/>
question of Confederation has been mooted ; <lb/>
but those elections did not take place at a <lb/>
period subsequent to the preparation of the <lb/>
scheme of Confederation, and consequently <lb/>
the people were not and could not be <lb/>
acquainted with the details. The result of <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
       
the twelve elections in question was
neither <lb/>
favorable nor the reverse to the plan of Con<lb break="no"/>federation, for that plan was not then known. <lb/>
It is said because the plan was distributed <lb/>
throughout the country, that therefore it <lb/>
must be known. But how could it be so, <lb/>
especially in its details, when we every day <lb/>
see the Government greatly embarrassed at <lb/>
giving explanations, or refusing to give them, <lb/>
on certain points ?—when, for instance, we <lb/>
see a minister in one House state that the <lb/>
seigniorial indemnity will be paid by Lower <lb/>
Canada alone, whilst it is declared in another <lb/>
House that that debt will be divided between <lb/>
the two provinces ?—when we see ministers <lb/>
asking for time to reply to each of the ques<lb break="no"/>tions put to them respecting this scheme? <lb/>
How can the people be aquainted with the <lb/>
local constitutions and the legislatures, when <lb/>
the ministers themselves would appear to <lb/>
know nothing about them? How can the <lb/>
people know in what matter this five million <lb/>
dollars balance of debt, to be laid upon Can<lb break="no"/>ada, will be divided, since those who pre<lb break="no"/>pared the scheme themselves do not know? <lb/>
And there is a mass of other important <lb/>
details which ought to be known in order to <lb/>
be able to pronounce upon the merits of the <lb/>
measure, such as the proposed law in relation <lb/>
to education, measures of defence, the Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
colonial Railway, &amp;c. We are told, indeed, <lb/>
for instance, that the Protestants of Lower <lb/>
Canada and the Catholics of Upper Canada <lb/>
will be protected, in so far as relates to their <lb/>
school system, but we have no guarantee of <lb/>
it ; and if the scheme of Confederation is <lb/>
adopted before these questions are settled, <lb/>
who can tell us that the Government will <lb/>
have as complaisant a majority to settle those <lb/>
questions as to vote Confederation? There <lb/>
is another part of the scheme which is of the <lb/>
highest importance, and respecting which we <lb/>
are entitled to explanations before voting for <lb/>
it, and that is, the measures to be taken for <lb/>
the defence of the country. It is important <lb/>
that we should know what is to be the nature <lb/>
of the defence which it is proposed to organ<lb break="no"/>ize and what debt we are to incur for the <lb/>
purpose. Why not let us have the why and <lb/>
the wherefore of the whole business in order <lb/>
that we may come to a sound decision as to <lb/>
the measure. These are details which we <lb/>
ought to have. <lb/>

—It is stated that the federal union pro<lb break="no"/><pb n="188" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-14_Page_0188.jpg"/><fw type="num">188</fw>vides a means of forming a great people,
and <lb/>
of raising us to a position in which we may <lb/>
take a place among the nations of the globe. <lb/>
But if into that people, by the Constitution <lb/>
itself, the seeds of discord are introduced, <lb/>
will any one believe that it would not be <lb/>
better to live apart, as at the present time, <lb/>
than to live together with disunion in our <lb/>
midst? It was also stated that on entering <lb/>
into the Confederation we should have to <lb/>
reduce our import duties in order that our <lb/>
tariff might agree with that of the Lower <lb/>
Provinces. But, as a sequence of that <lb/>
statement, we must enquire upon what the <lb/>
effect of that reduction of duties will fall. <lb/>
For my part, I am of opinion that the deficit <lb/>
which that reduction of our revenue will <lb/>
produce will have to be filled up by the <lb/>
agriculture and industry of Canada. By <lb/>
setting this Confederation going, in order to <lb/>
overcome secondary difficulties, we shall be <lb/>
working out the interests of the English <lb/>
dealers by reducing the import duties one- <lb break="yes"/>
half. And who will provide the balance <lb/>
which we shall have to find in order to meet <lb/>
our expenditure? The agriculturist and <lb/>
the artisan of this country, who will be made <lb/>
to meet that balance by direct taxation. <lb/>
The Lower Provinces are not agricultural <lb/>
countries, and we are told that we shall <lb/>
barter our flour for the produce of their <lb/>
mines and their forests. But I am of opin<lb break="no"/>ion that it is not by enacting political mea<lb break="no"/>sures that the course of trade will be <lb/>
changed. Let England abandon Canada at <lb/>
once, and even with Confederation, our pro<lb break="no"/>ducts will always go to England, because it <lb/>
is our most advantageous market, and will <lb/>
always continue to be so. So also will it be <lb/>
with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; that <lb/>
is to say, the products of their mines will <lb/>
continue to seek the United States markets, <lb/>
because those provinces now have commer<lb break="no"/>cial relations with the United States. Those <lb/>
Provinces will follow the general laws of <lb/>
commercial transactions in going to the <lb/>
United States, exactly as we go to Europe <lb/>
to obtain there the goods which we require, <lb/>
and to dispose of our products in return. <lb/>
But to return to the question of the tariff ; <lb/>
I say that we must needs come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that the deficit created by the lower<lb break="no"/>ing of the tariff will fall on the agriculture <lb/>
and industry of the country, and that an <lb/>
inferior position is ascribed to them in <lb/>
the Confederation. If the import duties <lb/>
are reduced from ten to eleven per cent. <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
    
 our manufactures will be denuded of all<lb/>
their profit, and we shall prevent capitalists <lb/>
from establishing themselves in Canada. <lb/>
This will be an immediate consequence of <lb/>
Confederation. I have heard it said that <lb/>
the Protestants of Lower Canada ought to <lb/>
be satisfied with their prospects for the <lb/>
future, because we have always acted with <lb/>
liberality towards them. But that is no <lb/>
guarantee for them, for we would not con<lb break="no"/>tent ourselves with a mere promise to act <lb/>
liberally, if we considered that our interest or <lb/>
our institutions were threatened by a ma<lb break="no"/>jority differing in race and religion from <lb/>
ourselves ; and in any case that is not the <lb/>
way to ensure the peace of the country. If <lb/>
we establish this principle, we should say to <lb/>
the Catholics of Upper Canada that they <lb/>
ought to be satisfied with the lot which we <lb/>
provide for them. When we make a Consti<lb break="no"/>tution, we must in the first place settle the <lb/>
political and religious questions which divide <lb/>
the populations for whom the Constitution is <lb/>
devised ; because it is a well known fact, that <lb/>
it is religious differences which have caused <lb/>
the greatest troubles and the greatest diffi<lb break="no"/>culties which have agitated the people in <lb/>
days gone by. We must learn to prevent <lb/>
them for the future. When we observe a man <lb/>
like the hon. member (Hon. Sir N. F. BEL<lb break="no"/>LEAU) acknowledge that we do not agree <lb/>
with the Irish, despite the identity of our <lb/>
religious belief, it may easily be foreseen <lb/>
that difficulties will arise with populations <lb/>
differing from us in origin and belief. We <lb/>
are told to vote Confederation first, and that <lb/>
the details will be arranged at a subsequent <lb/>
period ; that a measure will then be brought <lb/>
down to regulate the sectional or sectarian <lb/>
difficulties. I am quite willing to admit <lb/>
that such a measure will be presented ; but, <lb/>
should not the majority choose to adopt it, <lb/>
we should then be compelled to remain with <lb/>
the seeds of trouble and dissension, which <lb/>
the House will not have succeeded in eradi<lb break="no"/>cating, implanted among us. It is also <lb/>
asked what kind of Local Government we <lb/>
shall have; but the Government will make <lb/>
 no statement respecting it
until Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is voted. What kind of a Constitution, <lb/>
and what Governor we shall have ? What <lb/>
Governor ? Perhaps that is where the great <lb/>
secret lies, for I believe that for some time <lb/>
past the idea or the hope of being governor <lb/>
has filled the head of more than one politi<lb break="no"/>cal man. What is to be the amount of the <lb/>
Governor's salary? These are so many <lb/>

            <fw type="num">189</fw>
      
questions in respect of which we are
in com<lb break="no"/>plete ignorance, and in relation to which the <lb/>
Government will say nothing whatever. <lb/>
And, with respect to the constitution of the <lb/>
local governments, are we, in case the Upper <lb/>
Canada majority choose to impose their ideas <lb/>
upon us, are we, I say, to submit to them ? <lb/>
Such a proceeding would not be fair either to <lb/>
us or to the country. The hon. member (Hon. <lb/>
Sir N. F. BELLEAU) tells us that we were not <lb/>
sincere in asking for an appeal to the people, <lb/>
because we knew that dissolution would not <lb/>
reach us. Such expressions do not surprise <lb/>
me, proceeding as they do from a man who <lb/>
never had the honor to be the elected repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the people, and who holds his <lb/>
seat by the favor of the Crown, but I fail to <lb/>
discover by what right he judges us in such <lb/>
a manner. In conclusion, I shall move the <lb/>
following amendment :-<lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">That all the words after "That" in the
