     in harmony with the views of the people, I

     maintain that we ought not to pass this

     order to ascertain in the meantime what the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName> said—Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, with the consent of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     opposite (Hon. Mr. DICKSON) who is en<lb break="no"/>titled to the floor, in consequence of having 
     <lb/>
     moved the adjournment of the debate, I 
     <lb/>
     rise for the purpose of proposing the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which for some length of time has been 
     <lb/>
     before the House, on the notice-paper. It is 
     <lb/>
     one which, I think, should commend itself 
     <lb/>
     to the good sense and impartial iudgment 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this Honorable House; 
     <lb/>
     and I shall be surprised if it shall meet any 
     <lb/>
     degree of opposition from the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men representing the Government in this 
     <lb/>
     branch of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The resolution is as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That upon a matter of such great importance 
     <lb/>
     as the purposed Confederation of this and certain 
     <lb/>
     other British colonies, this House is unwilling to 
     <lb/>
     assume the responsibility of assenting to a mea<lb break="no"/>sure involving so many important considerations, 
     <lb/>
     without further manifestation of the public will 
     <lb/>
     than has yet been declared. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     It is not aimed at either the destruction 
     <lb/>
     or the defeat of the resolutions before the 
     <lb/>
     House. It simply asks for delay until such 
     <lb/>
     time as the people of the country can more 
     <lb/>
     fully express their views on the matter than 
     <lb/>
     they have hitherto had an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     doing Hon. gentlemen, I stated, when I 
     <lb/>
     first addressed this Chamber in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the proposed address, that I was not opposed 
     <lb/>
   to the Confederation of the British Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in itself, but that I was opposed to 
     <lb/>
     many of the details embraced in the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions upon which this House is asked to 
     <lb/>
     found an Address to Her Majesty the 
     <lb/>
     Queen. The hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. ROSS) 
     <lb/>
     who followed me upon that occasion, stated 
     <lb/>
     among other things, that I had attempted 
     <lb/>
     to decry the Lower Provinces, and that I 
     <lb/>
     had attempted also to decry the credit of 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
      

     
    Canada. I appeal to hon. members present, 
     <lb/>who were good enough to listen to me on that 
     <lb/>occasion, to point out a single word which I 
     <lb/>said, reflecting upon the credit of the people 
     <lb/>of the eastern provinces. Instead of having 
     <lb/>said anything to their discredit, I thought 
     <lb/>I had paid them a very high compliment. 
     <lb/>So far from reflecting upon the character of 
     <lb/>the public men of those provinces, I alluded 
     <lb/>to but one of them by name, the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>TILLEY, and I paid him the compliment, 
     <lb/>which he fully merits, of stating that he 
     <lb/>must be ranked among the leading and most 
     <lb/>prominent of British American statesmen. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) As to my decrying the credit 
     <lb/>of Canada—if, to tell the truth—if, to speak 
     <lb/>the honest convictions of one's mind—if, to 
     <lb/>state to the world what the Public Accounts 
     <lb/>of our country tell us—if this be to decry 
     <lb/>the credit of our country—then I am guilty 
     <lb/>of the charge. But the hon. gentleman went 
     <lb/>on and told us, that my speech was so illo<lb break="no"/>gical that it was unworthy of notice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—I did not say that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said what amounted to that. And yet 
     <lb/>
     to my astonishment be found it necessary to 
     <lb/>
     reply to me in a speech four columns in 
     <lb/>
     length—a speech, however, in which he 
     <lb/>
     failed to controvert a single position which 
     <lb/>
     I had the honor to take on that occasion. 
     <lb/>
     Then I was charged with having attacked 
     <lb/>
     statements of fact made by our public men. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—Hear! hear ! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>-The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man from Toronto says " Hear, hear." But 
     <lb/>
     I ask, is it not the duty of hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, standing on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House, to correct misstatements which have 
     <lb/>
     been sent to the country? Was I doing 
     <lb/>
     anything more than my duty, when, in 
     <lb/>
     my humble way, I endeavored to correct 
     <lb/>
     what, if not misstatements, were at least 
     <lb/>
     evidently incorrect statements? We have 
     <lb/>
     had too much of that kind of thing in this 
     <lb/>
     country. And since my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Hon. Mr. ROSS) has chosen to 
     <lb/>
     remind me of it, I must say that I think it 
     <lb/>
     is much to be regretted that certain state<lb break="no"/>ments have been made in this country, and 
     <lb/>
     sent from this country, which, instead of 
     <lb/>
     helping to build up our credit, have done 
     <lb/>
     much to injure it. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     I could not allude to anything more forcibly 
     <lb/>
     in point, than the flaming prospectus sent to 
     <lb/>
     the world under the auspices of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Toronto, in which he promised 
     <lb/>
    the confiding capitalists of England a 
     <lb/>

dividend of 11 1/2 per cent. on the stock they <lb/>
mi ht subscribe to the Grand Trunk Railway.
<lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. Mr. ROSS</persName>—Was it not 11 1/4 ? <lb/>
(Laughter.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—No ; he was not so <lb/>
modest as to put it at 11 1/4.
(Laughter.) It <lb/>
was 11 1/2 per cent. I was
charged with <lb/>
attacking the statements of the Hon. Mr. <lb/>
TILLEY. I stated, when last addressing the <lb/>
House, that Hon. Mr. TILLEY informed a <lb/>
public meeting—I think in St. John, New <lb/>
Brunswick—that the tariff of Canada was in <lb/>
fact an 11 per cent. tariff, and my hon. friend <lb/>
from Toronto said that Hon. Mr. TILLEY was <lb/>
correct in making that statement. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—What I said was that the <lb/>
average duty on the whole imports of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, including the free goods, was 11 per cent. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Then I must say <lb/>
that that is a very novel way of arriving at <lb/>
the tariff of a country—to take all the duti<lb break="no"/>able goods, to add to them all the free goods, <lb/>
and then to average the duty on the whole. <lb/>
It may be a very convenient, but it is not a <lb/>
correct or honest mode in my opinion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—It is precisely what <lb/>
Hon. Mr. TILLEY did; and I did it in the <lb/>
same way. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—My hon. friend <lb/>
told us that our present able and talented <lb/>
Finance Minister had stated the tariff of <lb/>
our country to be an 11 per cent tariff. I <lb/>
asked my hon. friend when the Finance <lb/>
Minister stated that ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—I said that, taking <lb/>
the statements Hon. Mr. GALT had fur<lb break="no"/>nished with reference to the tariff of customs <lb/>
duties, and the amount of imports of dutiable <lb/>
and free goods, and finding the average of <lb/>
the whole to be 11 per cent., Hon. Mr. TILLEY <lb/>
had made a statement based on Hon. Mr. <lb/>
GALT'S own figures. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I find the report <lb/>
makes my hon. friend say , that " The Hon. <lb/>
Mr. TILLEY had quoted the figures of our <lb/>
own Minister of Finance." He was wrong <lb/>
in that statement, because Hon. Mr. TILLEY, <lb/>
on the occasion I referred to, had quoted the <lb/>
figures furnished by the Comptroller of New <lb/>
Brunswick. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—The Comptroller of <lb/>
New Brunswick could not furnish the figures <lb/>
of the trade of Canada. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Surely my hon. <lb/>
friend will remember, that, to give oflicial force <lb/>
to the statement of Hon. Mr. TILLEY, he said <lb/>
that, after the Comptroller of the province <lb/>
had reviewed our tariff, he came to the con<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
          
clusion that it was but an 11 per cent.
tariff. <lb/>
I quote from the report :— <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> Hon. Mr. TILLEY quoted the figures of our <lb/>
own Minister of Finance, and the hon. member <lb/>
represented him as not speaking the truth, but <lb/>
as, in effect, attempting to deceive those whom <lb/>
he addressed. Hon. Mr. CURRIE—I beg to know <lb/>
when the Finance Minister of Canada stated that <lb/>
the average duties collected in Canada were 11 <lb/>
per cent.  <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> He (Honorable
Mr. Ross) desired to be <lb/>
no longer interrupted ; I ceased to interrupt <lb/>
him, and he did not give me an
answer <lb/>
to the question. But, if the honorable <lb/>
member from Toronto will turn to the cele<lb break="no"/>brated speech of the Minister of Finance <lb/>
made only the other day at Sherbrooke, he <lb/>
will find that Hon. Mr. GALT
puts the Canada <lb/>
tariff at 20 per cent. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—But he did not in<lb break="no"/>clude the free goods ; that is all. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>— No, he did not <lb/>
include the free goods. But I say that if <lb/>
he had taken the value of dutiable goods, as <lb/>
we find it given in the Trade Returns of <lb/>
1863 — the last complete returns for a year <lb/>
that we have—instead of arriving at the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that we had a tariff of only 20 per <lb/>
cent., he would have found that the actual <lb/>
duty on the dutiable goods imported in 1863 <lb/>
was 22 1/2 per cent. (Hear, hear.)
Then my <lb/>
hon. friend from Toronto came to the assis<lb break="no"/>tance of Mr. LYNCH of Halifax. And, not <lb/>
stopping there, he undertook the defence of <lb/>
the present President of the Council (Hon. <lb/>
Mr. BROWN) and the Provincial Secretary <lb/>
(Hon. Mr. MCDOUGALL.) I confess I was a <lb/>
little amused, and somewhat surprised to <lb/>
find my hon. friend from Toronto becoming <lb/>
the apologist and champion of those hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, who, I believe, are perfectly
<lb/>
competent on all occasions to take care of <lb/>
themselves — even without the assistance of <lb/>
my hon. friend. (Hear, hear.) He next <lb/>
alluded to the propriety and necessity— <lb/>
when the people of Canada were on the point <lb/>
of forming a partnership with the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces — of our knowing what the assets of <lb/>
those provinces were—what stock they were <lb/>
bringing into the common concern. I had <lb/>
shewed that we had a great many valuable <lb/>
public works —some of them of a profitable <lb/>
character. My hon. friend told us that the <lb/>
Lower Provinces too were engaging in profit<lb break="no"/>able works. He told us that New Brunswick <lb/>
had spent eight millions of dollars on rail<lb break="no"/>ways, and Nova Scotia six
millions—and <lb/>
that from those railways those provinces <lb/>
       

            <pb n="271" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0271.jpg"/>

 were getting a net revenue of $140,000,
or <lb/>
$70,000 a year each, which would
go into <lb/>
the revenue of the General Governement.
<lb/>
Well, hon. gentlemen, when such statements <lb/>
are made on the floor of this House, they of <lb/>
course go abroad, and those who make them <lb/>
ought to be well satisfied that they are based <lb/>
on reliable facts. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—So they were. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Well, I was very <lb/>
much struck by the hon. gentlemen's
state<lb break="no"/>ment. I was surprised to find it stated, in . <lb/>
the first place, that those provinces had <lb/>
already spent so much on railways ; and, in <lb/>
the next place, that those railways in the <lb/>
eastern provinces were so much more pro<lb break="no"/>fitable and paid so much better than the <lb/>
railways in Canada. Now, I find, on looking <lb/>
at the Public Accounts of those provinces <lb/>
—the very latest available— that the New <lb/>
Brunswick railways cost $4,275,000, and <lb/>
that the Nova Scotia railways cost $4,696,<lb break="no"/>288——that the New Brunswick railways in <lb/>
1862 paid $21,711 net, and the
Nova Scotia <lb/>
railways, $40,739—making
together, instead <lb/>
of $140,000 for the two
provinces, as stated <lb/>
by my hon. friend from Toronto, the small <lb/>
sum of $62,450.  And this too,
hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men will bear in mind, was from new rail<lb break="no"/>ways, or railways comparatively new — and <lb/>
they will find, if they take the trouble to <lb/>
examine the accounts, that the cost of the <lb/>
repairs of those railroads, as of every other <lb/>
railroad after it has become somewhat worn, <lb/>
is increasing year by year. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—The House will recol<lb break="no"/>lect that I took the figures which were <lb/>
prompted to me while speaking. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName> — That is the <lb/>
mistake which, I fear, has been committed <lb/>
during the whole of this discussion. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Our public men have been too <lb/>
reckless in making statements—statements <lb/>
in the east, as to the prosperity of Canada ; <lb/>
and statements in the west, as to the wealth, <lb/>
property and resources of those eastern
<lb/>
provinces. Now, hon. gentlemen, let us <lb/>
look at our public works, which my hon. friend <lb/>
in a measure tried to belittle and decry. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—I did not belittle <lb/>
them ; I said that indirectly they were of <lb/>
of great value to the country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Yes ; and directly <lb/>
too. I find, by the Public Accounts of the <lb/>
province, that in 1863 the net revenue at <lb/>
our public works—all of which are going <lb/>
to the Confederate Government—yielded to <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
          
 this province a net revenue of $308,187— <lb/>
and that our public works cost this pro<lb break="no"/>vince, taking the amount set down in the <lb/>
statements of affairs of the province, $25,<lb break="no"/>931,168. So much for the stock—so far as <lb/>
the public works at all events are con<lb break="no"/>cerned—that this province is prepared to <lb/>
put into the partnership with the other <lb/>
provinces.  (Hear, hear.)  I shall refer no <lb/>
further to the remarks made by my hon. <lb/>
friend from Toronto in answer to the few <lb/>
words I addressed to the House the other <lb/>
day, beyond expressing my regret that my <lb/>
hon. friend should not merely have been <lb/>
dissatisfied with the statements I made, but <lb/>
that he should have thought fit to take <lb/>
exception to the style and the manner in <lb/>
which my remarks were submitted to the <lb/>
Honorable House. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—I said, the temper <lb/>
and tone. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—From the atten<lb break="no"/>tion you were kind enough to give me, hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, on that occasion, and from the <lb/>
way in which my remarks were received <lb/>
both by my political opponents and my <lb/>
political friends, I had hoped that I had not <lb/>
exceeded the bounds of propriety—that, <lb/>
neither in my temper nor in my tone had I <lb/>
violated the rules of this House. If I did <lb/>
so I regret it, and I may be allowed to <lb/>
express the hope that when my native land <lb/>
has paid one-fourth as much for my poli<lb break="no"/>tical education as it has paid for that of my <lb/>
hon. friend from Toronto—if my manners <lb/>
still fail to be those of a CHESTERFIELD, or <lb/>
my eloquence that of a PITT—I shall at all <lb/>
events be able to treat my fellow members <lb/>
with courtesy and propriety. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
But, leaving these little matters to take care <lb/>
of themselves, I shall now allude to the <lb/>
strong pressure which seems, from some <lb/>
source or other, to be urging the represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the people of Canada, and the <lb/>
people themselves, to adopt this important <lb/>
scheme without that time for deliberate <lb/>
consideration which a matter of that kind <lb/>
is entitled to. I am satisfied that that <lb/>
pressure does not come from the people <lb/>
themselves. I am satisfied it does not come <lb/>
either from this or from the other branch <lb/>
of the Legislature. I entertain the fear, <lb/>
which has been expressed before, that it <lb/>
has been a pressure from without, which <lb/>
has been urging us to take this step too <lb/>
rapidly, I fear, for our country's good. It <lb/>
may be that the statesmen of
Great Britain, <lb/>
         

            <pb n="272" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0272.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">272</fw> 
         
 and that a great portion of the people of
<lb/>
Great Britain are very anxious for
this <lb/>
measure, and that the press of that country <lb/>
generally approves of it. But, when they <lb/>
rightly understand it—when parties holding <lb/>
our provincial securities know that Con<lb break="no"/>federation means more debt, more taxation, <lb/>
and a worse public credit—we will have <lb/>
another cry coming from across the Atlantic. <lb/>
And when British manufacturers know that <lb/>
Confederation means a higher tariff on <lb/>
British goods, we shall have different views <lb/>
from them also, crossing the Atlantic. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.)  Hon. gentlemen, when I left my <lb/>
constituency, I had little idea that this <lb/>
measure was going to be pressed upon the <lb/>
country in the manner in which I see the <lb/>
Government of the day are attempting to <lb/>
press it. I think we should pause before <lb/>
adopting these resolutions. I think we want <lb/>
some more information before we adopt <lb/>
them. Before we vote away our local con<lb break="no"/>stitutions—before we vote away in fact our <lb/>
whole Constitution—we should know some<lb break="no"/>thing of what we are going to get in place <lb/>
of what we are giving away.  Did any hon. <lb/>
gentleman suppose, before he left his home, <lb/>
that we would not have the whole scheme <lb/>
of Confederation brought down to us, and be <lb/>
asked to pass a judgment on it, or to con<lb break="no"/>sider it at all events as a whole scheme? I <lb/>
think we ought to be cautious in taking <lb/>
half a measure until we know what is the <lb/>
whole of it.  (Hear, hear.)  Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men will remember the caution with which <lb/>
the Parliament of England proceeded, in <lb/>
1839, when dealing with the rights of the <lb/>
people of Canada. At that time there was <lb/>
an urgent necessity for a new Constitution <lb/>
for the people of Canada, and a great neces<lb break="no"/>sity for it, particularly in the eastern pro<lb break="no"/>vince. When the Government of the day <lb/>
brought down their resolutions—in some<lb break="no"/>thing like the same shape as those now <lb/>
before the House—resolutions embodying <lb/>
the principle of a Legislative Union—the <lb/>
leader of the opposition, Lord STANLEY, <lb/>
claimed that the whole measure should be <lb/>
brought down ; and the Government of the <lb/>
day was actually compelled, by the force of <lb/>
public opinion in and out of Parliament, to <lb/>
withdraw the resolutions, and to bring down <lb/>
their entire measure.  (Hear,
hear.) And <lb/>
are we to be less careful of our own consti<lb break="no"/>tutional rights —are we to guard more <lb/>
loosely the interests of ourselves and those <lb/>
who are to come after us—than the people <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
           
legislating for us three or four thousand
miles <lb/>
away? Besides, we are asked by those reso<lb break="no"/>lutions to pledge our province—to what ?<lb/>
To build the Intercolonial Railway,
without <lb/>
knowing, as I stated the other day, where <lb/>
it is to run, or what it is to cost. Why do <lb/>
we not have the report of the able engineer <lb/>
sent to survey and report upon that work ? <lb/>
Why is it delayed ? Why is it attempted to <lb/>
hurry this measure through the Legislature,<lb/>
while
we are in the dark with reference to<lb/>
that great undertaking? It may be that it
<lb/>
is kept back designedly, and for the purpose <lb/>
of furthering this very measure, not here, <lb/>
but in other arts of British America. <lb/>
            </p>









            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—My hon. friend <lb/>
is going too far. The report has not yet been <lb/>
made, and, that being the case, it is some<lb break="no"/>what extraordinary to charge the Government <lb/>
with keeping it back. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Certainly ; I think <lb/>
the case is bad enough, when the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment are charged merely with what they <lb/>
have done.  And I have no desire to make <lb/>
an incorrect statement.  But I will put it in <lb/>
this way : I think we have good reason to be <lb/>
surprised, that the Government should come <lb/>
down with their scheme, and submit it to <lb/>
the House, before they even
themselves know <lb/>
what the work is to cost—(hear, hear)——and <lb/>
ask this House and the country to pledge <lb/>
themselves to the construction of a work of <lb/>
which they do not even know the cost them<lb break="no"/>selves. (Hear, hear.) But, if the report has <lb/>
not been prepared, we have been told in the <lb/>
public prints that the survey is either <lb/>
finished, or very nearly finished. The report, <lb/>
therefore, can soon be furnished ; and, why <lb/>
should there be so much hurry and anxiety <lb/>
to pass these resolutions before we get it ? <lb/>
Then, again, why do the Government not <lb/>
bring down those School Bills which have <lb/>
been promised? Why are the people, or why <lb/>
is Parliament, to have no
opportunity of pass<lb break="no"/>ing judgment upon those measures—the <lb/>
School Bill for Upper Canada, and the School <lb/>
Bill for Lower Canada—before this Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation scheme is adopted ? I cannot see the <lb/>
propriety of keeping back these matters; and <lb/>
I do not think the members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment can show any reason whatever why <lb/>
they should not be settled at once. Then, <lb/>
hon. gentlemen, we should know something <lb/>
about the division of the public debt. If <lb/>
hon. gentlemen will take up the Public <lb/>
Accounts placed in their hands during the<lb/>
present session, they will find a
statement of <lb/>
      

            <pb n="273" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0273.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">273</fw>
          
 the liabilities of this province,
certifying the <lb/>
amount to be no less than $77,203,282.
Now <lb/>
it is well known that Canada is only allowed <lb/>
to take into the Confederation the debt of <lb/>
$62,500,000. We have a right to
ask how <lb/>
the other $15,000,000 are to be paid ? By <lb/>
whom are they to be assumed ? What portion <lb/>
is Upper Canada to assume? What portion <lb/>
is Lower Canada to assume? (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
Then, hon. gentlemen, if we adopt these <lb/>
resolutions, and a bill based on them is <lb/>
brought into the Imperial Parliament and <lb/>
carried—look at the power which is given <lb/>
to the Confederate Parliament. They have <lb/>
the power to impose local taxation upon each <lb/>
of the separate provinces   I would like to <lb/>
know how that power is to be exercised; I <lb/>
would like to know whether it is to be a capi<lb break="no"/>tation tax, or an acreage tax upon the lands <lb/>
of the province, or whether it is to be a <lb/>
tax upon the general property of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince. I am sure there is no hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man present who would not like information <lb/>
on these points, before voting for this <lb/>
scheme. (Hear, hear.) Then, hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, there is another very important ques<lb break="no"/>tion—the question of the defence of these <lb/>
provinces—which within a few months has <lb/>
taken a shape which it never took before in <lb/>
the history of this country. I shall trespass <lb/>
on the attention of the House for a few <lb/>
moments, while I read an extract from a <lb/>
very able report on that question, which <lb/>
ranks, and in time. to come too will rank, <lb/>
deservedly high as a State paper.  It is a <lb/>
memorandum of the Executive Council, <lb/>
dated October, 1862, at the time the <lb/>
MACDONALD-SICOTTE Administration held <lb/>
ofice. And, whatever the errors of that <lb/>
Government might have been, however they <lb/>
may have been found fault with in other <lb/>
matters, I believe the people generally
were <lb/>
of opinion that the stand which the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment took on that question, was one which <lb/>
entitled them to the respect and confidence of <lb/>
the community at large. The Government <lb/>
say in this memorandum :— <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> That they are not unwilling to try to the
<lb/>
utmost to comply with the suggestions of the <lb/>
Imperial Government is evidence by the manner <lb/>
in which the projected Intercolonial Railway has <lb/>
been entertained. Their conduct in this matter <lb/>
should relieve them from every imputation. At <lb/>
the same time, they insist that they are and must <lb/>
be allowed to be the best judges of the pressure <lb/>
which the provincial credit can
sustain. They <lb/>
are prepared, subject to certain conditions, to <lb/>
encumber this credit with liabilities arising out of <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
       
the Intercolonial Railway, but they are
not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to enter upon a lavish expenditure to build <lb/>
up a military system distasteful to the Canadian <lb/>
people, disproportionate to Canadian resources, <lb/>
and not called for by any circumstance of which <lb/>
they at present have cognizance. <lb/>

            <p> That is, the arming and bringing into the

            <p> His Grace, while promising liberal
assist<lb break="no"/>ance contends that any available supply of <lb/>
regular troops would be unequal to the defenœ <lb/>
of the province—and that the main dependence <lb/>
of such a country for defence must be upon its <lb/>
own people. Your Excellency's advisers would <lb/>
not be faithful to their own convictions or to the <lb/>
trust reposed in them, if they withheld an expres<lb break="no"/>sion of their belief that without very large assis<lb break="no"/>tance any efforts or sacrifices of which the people <lb/>
of the province are capable, would not enable <lb/>
them successfully and for any lengthened period <lb/>
to repel invasion from the neighboring republic. <lb/>
They have relied for protection in some degree <lb/>
upon the fact, that under no conceivable circum<lb break="no"/>stances will they provoke war with the United <lb/>
States, and if therefore Canada should become <lb/>
the theatre of war resulting from Imperial policy, <lb/>
while it would cheerfully put forth its strength in <lb/>
the defence of its soil, it would nevertheless be <lb/>
obliged to rely for its protection mainly upon <lb/>
Imperial resources ; and in such an event it is <lb/>
their opinion that they would be justified in ex<lb break="no"/>pecting to be assisted in the work of defence with <lb/>
the whole strength of the empire.  It is not ne<lb break="no"/>cessary at this stage of their history, to put for<lb break="no"/>ward assurances of the readiness of the
Canadian <lb/>
people to assume whatever responsibilities belong <lb/>
to them as subjects of Her Majesty. Their devo<lb break="no"/>tion has been exhibited too often
to be open to <lb/>
doubt or depreciation. They have made sacri<lb break="no"/>fices that should relieve them from suspicion, and <lb/>
which Her Majesty's Government should remem<lb break="no"/>ber as a pledge of their fidelity.  No portion of <lb/>
the empire is exposed to sufferings and sacrifices <lb/>
equal to those which would inevitably fall upon <lb/>
this province in the event of war with the United <lb/>
States. No probable combination of regular <lb/>
troops and militia would preserve our soil from <lb/>
invading armies ; and no fortune which the most <lb/>
sanguine dare hope for would prevent our most <lb/>
flourishing districts from being the battle field of <lb/>
the war. Our trade would be brought to a stand<lb break="no"/>still, our industry would be paralyzed, our richest <lb/>
farming lands devastated, our towns and villages <lb/>
destroyed ; homes, happy in peace, would be <lb/>
rendered miserable by war, and all as the result <lb/>
of events for the production of which Canada <lb/>
would be in no wise accountable. <lb/>

            <p> And, honorable gentlemen, that is not
only <lb/>
the language in times past of
leading poli<lb break="no"/>ticians in Canada. Hon. gentlemen may call <lb/>

rial Government. One hon. gentlemen, to <lb/>
whom I have particular reference (Hon. <lb/>
JOSEPH HOWE) declared it was unreasonable <lb/>
to expect that we should defend ourselves <lb/>
against a foreign power, when we had no <lb/>
voice either in the declaring of war or the <lb/>
making of peace— that while we were quite <lb/>
ready, as in times past, to expose our persons <lb/>
and property to meet the invader at the <lb/>
threshold of our country, we were unwilling <lb/>
to take upon ourselves, as colonists, a duty <lb/>
which belonged to the parent state. But <lb/>
does this correspond with the views that are <lb/>
now adopted by the Ministry of the day ? I <lb/>
hold in my hand an extract from a speech <lb/>
delivered by one of the most prominent mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Government at a recent banquet <lb/>
in the city of Toronto. And what did that <lb/>
hon. gentleman say ? Speaking of the Con<lb break="no"/>ference at Quebec, he stated that " the <lb/>
delegates unanimously resolved that the <lb/>
United Provinces of British North America <lb/>
shall be placed at the earliest moment in a <lb/>
thorough state of defence." Hon. gentlemen, <lb/>
I was not aware that the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had ever cast off the burden of the <lb/>
defence of this province. But we are told <lb/>
by an hon. gentleman, high in the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive, that this Conference, self-appointed as <lb/>
it was, by a resolution that we do not see <lb/>
laid upon the table, promised to place the <lb/>
province in a thorough state of defence. Hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, what does that mean ? It means <lb/>
an expendeture here of four or five millions <lb/>
of dollars annually, or else the statement <lb/>
exceeded the truth. Again the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man stated :—" The Conference at Quebec <lb/>
did not separate before entering into a pledge <lb/>
to put the military and naval defences of <lb/>
the united provinces in the most com<lb break="no"/>plete and satisfactory position."  Before <lb/>
we discuss this scheme further—before <lb/>
we are called on to give a vote upon <lb/>
it——I say we ought to know something more <lb/>
with reference to this important matter. <lb/>
(Hear, hear). Hon. gentlemen may perhaps <lb/>
argue that there is no necessity for this <lb/>
question going to the people ——
no necessity <lb/>
for further time being allowed to the people <lb/>
of Upper Canada or of Canada generally to <lb/>
consider this matter. Why, hon. gentlemen, <lb/>
has it not been stated by every hon. member <lb/>
who has taken the floor to address the House <lb/>
on this question, that it is the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant question ever submitted to this or any <lb/>
other British Colonial Legislature? And yet <lb/>
many of those hon. members are unwilling <lb/>
   

            <cb/>

          
that the people of this country should
have <lb/>
any further time to consider this important <lb/>
matter—although, by the laws of our land, <lb/>
no municipality has a right to enact or pass <lb/>
a by-law creating a little petty debt, not to be <lb/>
paid off within a year, without submitting it <lb/>
first to the vote of the people. (Hear)  Hon. <lb/>
gentlemen assign as a reason why the matter <lb/>
should not be submitted to the people—that <lb/>
we have had a number of elections to this <lb/>
House since it was known that the scheme <lb/>
of Confederation was under the consideration <lb/>
of the Government, and that these elections <lb/>
went favorably to the scheme. I would ask, <lb/>
hon. gentlemen, how many elections have <lb/>
we had in Upper Canada since the scheme <lb/>
was printed and laid before the people ? I <lb/>
would like to see the hon. gentleman stand <lb/>
up, who has been elected to come here to <lb/>
vote upon this scheme since it was submitted <lb/>
to the people.  It is true we have had one <lb/>
election in Upper Canada since
that time— <lb/>
my hon. friend near me (Hon. Mr.
SIMPSON) <lb/>
alluded to it yesterday—the election in South <lb/>
Ontario, a constituency until recently repre<lb break="no"/>sented by one of the hon. gentlemen who <lb/>
entered the Ministry which
brings this <lb/>
scheme before us—our present esteemed <lb/>
Vice-Chanceller of Upper Canada, Hon. Mr.
<lb/>
MOWAT. What did the candidates say at <lb/>
that election ? Both of them, as stated by <lb/>
my honorable friend, in asking the suf<lb break="no"/>frages of the people, had to promise that, if <lb/>
elected to Parliament, they would vote <lb/>
for a submission of this scheme to the <lb/>
people.  (Hear, hear.) And that is the <lb/>
last election we have had in Upper Canada. <lb/>
It is true that many honorable gentlemen <lb/>
now present, in their addresses to their <lb/>
several constituencies, when seeking election <lb/>
last fall, said they were in favor of a union <lb/>
of the British North American Provinces. <lb/>
But, hon. gentlemen, there is not a man in <lb/>
this chamber, within the sound of my voice, <lb/>
who would not say the same. I am myself <lb/>
as much in favor of Confederation to-day as <lb/>
ever I was in my life ; and I will challenge <lb/>
any one to say that at any time, on any public <lb/>
occasion, I ever said aught against the scheme <lb/>
of the Confederation of the British North <lb/>
American Provinces.  (Hear,
hear.)  But, <lb/>
honorable gentlemen, when I look at this <lb/>
scheme, imperfect as I conceive it to be, <lb/>
it receives my opposition, not because it is a <lb/>
scheme for the Confederation of British <lb/>
North America, but because it is a scheme <lb/>
containing within itself the germs of its
<lb/>
          

            <pb n="275" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0275.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">275</fw>
           
 destruction. The resolution before the <lb/>
House is not, as I said before, aimed at <lb/>
the destruction of the scheme ; and I hope, <lb/>
before the debate closes, the Government <lb/>
will see the propriety and the advisability of <lb/>
granting the reasonable delay therein asked <lb/>
for. Suppose the Government concedes even <lb/>
the short delay of one month, it can do no <lb/>
possible harm to the measure. If
the mea<lb break="no"/>sure be good—if it be so desirable as the <lb/>
governments of the respective provinces tell <lb/>
us it is—the simple permitting it to stand <lb/>
over for a month will certainly not destroy <lb/>
it. If, on the other hand, it be bad—if it <lb/>
contain within itself the elements of decay— <lb/>
it is better to know it now than hereafter, <lb/>
when the resolutions will have been embodied <lb/>
in a Statute over which we have no control. <lb/>
To shew my own feeling in the matter, all <lb/>
I have to say is this : give a reasonable <lb/>
delay—allow the section of the country I <lb/>
have the honor to represent to speak on the <lb/>
subject, and if it be found to be the will of <lb/>
my constituents that the measure in its <lb/>
present shape be adopted, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men may be assured that I shall give them <lb/>
no further opposition ; and that instead of <lb/>
doing everything in my power to impede the <lb/>
progress of these resolutions, I
will do nothing <lb/>
to impede their progress through the House. <lb/>
" But," say hon. gentlemen, " delay means <lb/>
defeat." If it be a good measure—if it <lb/>
commend itself to the approval of the people, <lb/>
supported as it is by the most able and <lb/>
brilliant men in Parliament—the scheme is <lb/>
in no danger. And, hon. gentlemen, sup<lb break="no"/>posing a month's delay is granted, we will <lb/>
even then be further advanced with the <lb/>
measure than the people of the eastern pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. The writs for the elections in New <lb/>
Brunswick are returnable, if I mistake not, <lb/>
on the 25th March. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—On the 9th <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Then it will be at <lb/>
least the 21st or 22nd of March before the <lb/>

together. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName> — I misunder<lb break="no"/>stood the statement made by my hon. friend. <lb/>
What I meant to say was that the Legislature <lb/>
of New Brunswick, is expected to
assemble <lb/>
on the 8th or 9th of March. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Then they are going <lb/>
to hurry up matters there, I am sorry to <lb/>

of which have not had the same opportunity, <lb/>
            

            <cb/>
         
 at all events, of considering the question
as <lb/>
the people of New Brunswick. The
people <lb/>
of New Brunswick seem to be fully alive to <lb/>
the importance of this momentous question, <lb/>
and I hope that when their verdict is given <lb/>
it will be a well-considered verdict ; but this <lb/>
we do know, that it will not be given until <lb/>
after a free and fair opportunity has been <lb/>
afforded them of discussing the question on <lb/>
its merits in all its bearings. My hon. friend <lb/>
from the Western Division (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
MCCREA) really surprised me the other day <lb/>
when he declared that an elective Legislative <lb/>
Council was neither asked for nor desired by <lb/>
the people. My recollection is that the <lb/>
Council under the nominative system was a <lb/>
standing grievance in Lower Canada
as well <lb/>
as in Upper Canada. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. MCCREA</persName>—That was before <lb/>
the union. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—The demand arose <lb/>
that the Council should be elective. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. MCCREA</persName>— Not after the <lb/>
union. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—My hon. friend is, <lb/>
I can assure him, mistaken in stating that <lb/>
there were no petitions in favor of an elective <lb/>
Legislative Council at the time of the change. <lb/>
If my hon. friend will consult the Journals <lb/>
of Parliament, he will find there petitions for <lb/>
the change ; he will find also that from the <lb/>
town of Cobourg a petition was received in <lb/>
favor of representation by population in <lb/>
this as well as in the other branch
of the <lb/>
Legislature. But my hon. friend, in his igno<lb break="no"/>rance of the facts of the case—although he <lb/>
certainly handled the subject with a good<lb/>
deal of ability, though not with the ability <lb/>
he usually puts forth when he has a good<lb/>
cause to plead—(a laugh)—made a state<lb break="no"/>ment which he could scarcely
have considered <lb/>
before bringing it under the notice of the <lb/>
House. He said that a House appointed by <lb/>
the Crown would be more responsible to the <lb/>
people than the present House.  That, hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, is certainly a new
doctrine to <lb/>
me. If such would be the case, why, I ask, <lb/>
do you not apply the same system to the <lb/>
other branch of the Legislature?  In such <lb/>
an event I feel assured that the Government <lb/>
of the day would have a much more comfort<lb break="no"/>able and pleasant life of it than even the <lb/>
present Government, strong and talented as <lb/>
they undoubtedly are. (Laughter.) But, <lb/>
says my hon. friend. once more, the people <lb/>
of Canada are in favor of the scheme, in <lb/>
regard to which they have had ample time <lb/>
        

            <pb n="276" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0276.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">276</fw>
         
for holding meetings and adopting
petitions. <lb/>
But, I would ask what did most of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers even of this House know of the scheme <lb/>
when they first came to Quebec? Did we <lb/>
know as much about it then as we know <lb/>
now? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—Yes. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—My hon. friend <lb/>
from Toronto says, " Yes." <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANON1">AN HON. MEMBER</persName>— No. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Another hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber replies, " no." I may say for myself that I <lb/>
have learned something even from the speech <lb/>
of my hon. friend from Toronto that I did <lb/>
not know before. The people of the country <lb/>
have been waiting, expecting this matter <lb/>
would be discussed in Parliament, and that <lb/>
the whole scheme would be presented so as <lb/>
to enable its being judged of as a whole. <lb/>
Unfortunately, however, it is only a part of <lb/>
the scheme which we have at this moment <lb/>
before the Council. I did not have the plea<lb break="no"/>sure of hearing the whole of the remarks of <lb/>
my hon. friend from Montreal (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
FERRIER), but I was greatly interested in <lb/>
listening to the portion I did hear. I refer <lb/>
to what he said respecting the ministerial <lb/>
crisis in June last. I thought that
the cele<lb break="no"/>brated memorandum, which, by the bye, <lb/>
has since been in great part repudiated by <lb/>
the Government of the day, contained all <lb/>
the Ministerial explanations. But that scene, <lb/>
so forcibly described by the hon. gentleman, <lb/>
where the President of the Council met the <lb/>
Attorney General East— <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—I did not say I <lb/>
saw it. I only heard of it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—When the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. CARTIER embraced the Hon.
Mr. <lb/>
BROWN. (Laughter.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—I simply said it <lb/>
was so reported on the streets. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—And the Hon. Mr. <lb/>
BROWN promised eternal allegiance to the <lb/>
Hon. Mr. CARTIER. (Laughter.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—I was simply <lb/>
giving the <hi rendition="simple:italic">on-dit</hi> of the day. I said I
knew <lb/>
nothing whatever of it further than what I <lb/>
had heard on the streets. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I must have mis<lb break="no"/>understood my hon. friend. I thought he was. <lb/>
a witness of the affecting scene. (Laughter.) <lb/>
But my hon. friend did tell the House <lb/>
somethiug which was new to me, and which <lb/>
must have sounded as new to the country, <lb/>
when he said that the Grand Trunk Railway <lb/>
cost the people of Canada very little. The <lb/>
  

            <cb/>  
         
 hon. gentleman seemed to think that I was
<lb/>
very much opposed to the Grand Trunk. <lb/>
But never in my life have I spoken a <lb/>
single word against the Grand Trunk as a <lb/>
railway. I believe there is no hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who can possibly appreciate more <lb/>
highly the commercial advantages to this <lb/>
country of that work than I do. At the <lb/>
same time, I have taken occasion, and may <lb/>
do so again if the necessity requires it, to <lb/>
speak of some of the transactions connected <lb/>
with that undertaking. Let this work or <lb/>
any other public work come under the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of this Chamber, and it will receive at <lb/>
my hands in the future, as in the past, that <lb/>
degree of consideration to which as a public <lb/>
work it is entitled. I hope the day is not <lb/>
far distant when the Grand Trunk will <lb/>
become what it ought to be, a strictly and <lb/>
entirely commercial work, and when the <lb/>
people of all classes and parties will look <lb/>
upon it with favor. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—It is strictly a <lb/>
commercial work now. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—My hon. friend <lb/>
stated that it had cost the country a mere <lb/>
trifle. But unluckily the Public Accounts <lb/>
do not tell the same story, and they do not <lb/>
exactly confirm the views of my hon. friend <lb/>
in relation to this work. If he looks at the <lb/>
assets of the province—the valuables of the <lb/>
province—he will find there is a charge <lb/>
against the Grand Trunk of $15,142,000 <lb/>
for debentures.  And besides there is this <lb/>
little $100,000 which has been used in re<lb break="no"/>deeming the city of Montreal bonds. There <lb/>
is something more besides about subsidiary <lb/>
lines. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FERR1">HON. MR. FERRIER</persName>—I spoke of the <lb/>
first capital investment. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—My hon. friend <lb/>
from the Erie Division (Hon. Mr. CHRISTIE) <lb/>
admitted in opening his case that this scheme <lb/>
was very much marred by its details. Ad<lb break="no"/>mitting this—which is just the whole argu<lb break="no"/>ment—that the details so greatly
mar the <lb/>
scheme, it is much to be feared
that the <lb/>
measure will not work so peacefully, use<lb break="no"/>fully, or harmoniously as its originators <lb/>
expected, and I believe sincerely hoped it <lb/>
would do ; because I do these hon. gentlemen <lb/>
the credit of believing that in devising a <lb/>
scheme which should be for the future as <lb/>
well as the present welfare of the country , <lb/>
they were animated by a desire to do the very <lb/>
best they could under the circumstances. <lb/>
Their great error, in my opinion, lay in <lb/>
            

            <pb n="277" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0277.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">277</fw>
        
their yielding too much on the part of <lb/>
Canada to gratify the eastern provinces, so <lb/>
as to enable them to bring about this scheme <lb/>
at the present moment.  If the scheme is <lb/>
so marred in its details as to destroy the <lb/>
whole measure, why not reject
it? Then <lb/>
my hon. friend alluded to the state of the <lb/>
country, just before the present
Government <lb/>
was formed, in terms which I hardly think <lb/>
he was justified in using. He claimed that <lb/>
the country was in a state of anarchy and <lb/>
confusion. Now, hon. gentlemen, I must <lb/>
say that for my part I saw none of that <lb/>
anarchy, and I must say very little of <lb/>
that confusion. I assert that there may <lb/>
be witnessed in other lands what was <lb/>
witnessed in this. We saw weak govern<lb break="no"/>ments striving month after month to keep <lb/>
   
themselves in power, and we saw these <lb/>
governments daily and hourly attacked <lb/>
by a strong and wary opposition. But, hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, I have yet to learn that the <lb/>
giving of 17 additional members to Upper <lb/>
Canada and 47 members to the eastern pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will ensure us against the same state <lb/>
of thin in the future. It was very well put <lb/>
by the hon. member for Wellington (Hon. <lb/>
Mr. SANBORN) when he said, if there was <lb/>
more patriotism on the part of our public <lb/>
men, and less desire to sacrifice the country <lb/>
for the good of party, we would not have had <lb/>
that state of confusion to which my hon. <lb/>
friend from the Erie Division has alluded. <lb/>
Then my hon. friend who represents the <lb/>
Erie Division, in order to fortify the position <lb/>
he took in supporting the scheme, took up <lb/>
the resolutions adopted by the Toronto Re<lb break="no"/>form Convention in 1859. He stated that I <lb/>
was a delegate present at that convention ; <lb/>
but I can only say that, although elected a <lb/>
delegate, I took no part in the proceedings, <lb/>
and know nothing more of them than I <lb/>
learned from the public prints. The hon. <lb/>
gentleman, however, conveniently read only <lb/>
a part of the resolutions. But it must be ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that these resolutions were the iden<lb break="no"/>tical basis upon which the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was organized. This Government <lb/>
was organized for the express purpose of <lb/>
carrying out the arrangements embodied in <lb/>
the resolutions of that body. And, hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, a committee was appointed by <lb/>
the Toronto Convention, and that committee <lb/>
prepared a draft address to the public. That <lb/>
was submitted to the executive committee, <lb/>
and considered on the 15th of February, 1860, <lb/>
and was revised and sent to the country as <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        
 the address of the convention, of which
the <lb/>
hon. member for Erie was a member, and <lb/>
over which he also presided as one of <lb/>
the vice-chairmen. And what did they <lb/>
say ? That convention never intended that <lb/>
Parliament should change the Constitution or <lb/>
give us a new Constitution without consulting <lb/>
the people and allowing the public an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of passing its judgment
upon the pro<lb break="no"/>posed new Constitution. And how did this <lb/>
convention propose to secure the people the <lb/>
right of passing judgment upon so impor<lb break="no"/>tant a scheme as the adoption of a new <lb/>
Constitution ? Here it is, in large type—and <lb/>
I have no doubt my hon. friend has
often <lb/>
read it in going through his large, wealthy, <lb/>
and prosperous division. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—It was not pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the convention. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I wish to put my <lb/>
hon. friend right. The meeting was held <lb/>
on the 23rd September, 1859, and was <lb/>
presided over by the late Hon. ADAM FER<lb break="no"/>GUSSON ; and my hon. friend, the
member <lb/>
for Erie Division, and Mr. D. A. MACDON<lb break="no"/>ALD were vice-presidents. A special com<lb break="no"/>mittee was appointed at that meeting to <lb/>
draft an address to the people of Upper <lb/>
Canada on the political affairs of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince in support of the resolutions then <lb/>
adopted.  A draft of the address was sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the executive committee. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—I was not a <lb/>
member of that committee. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName> —The public meeting <lb/>
was held on the 15th February, 1860. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—And when was <lb/>
the address published ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—It was published <lb/>
in this shape in February, 1860. Well, one <lb/>
of the provisions contained in that address <lb/>
was this :—" Secure these rights by a writ<lb break="no"/>ten Constitution, ratified by the people, and <lb/>
incapable of alteration except by their for<lb break="no"/>mal sanction."  Hon. gentlemen, I fear the <lb/>
hon. member for Erie Division will hardly be <lb/>
able to justify the course he feels called upon <lb/>
to take on this occasion by anything contained <lb/>
in the address or the resolutions of the Toronto <lb/>
convention. The hon. gentleman would never <lb/>
have thought of preparing such a scheme as <lb/>
this to be submitted to the members of such <lb/>
a convention. But think you that had such a <lb/>
scheme been presented they would not have <lb/>
demanded that it should be left to the <lb/>
people?  Think you, hon. gentlemen, that <lb/>
that scheme we have met the approval <lb/>
          

            <pb n="278" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0278.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">278</fw>
    
 of that body in its present shape? I am <lb/>
sure that my hon. friend, warm as he now is <lb/>
in support of the scheme, could hardly have <lb/>
accepted such an issue. I am sure that <lb/>
even the present Government, backed as <lb/>
they are by a large majority in both branches <lb/>
of the Legislature, and possessing as they <lb/>
do a large amount of the talent,—I may <lb/>
say a majority of the talent—of Parliament, <lb/>
dare not bring such resolutions down as <lb/>
a Government measure and ask the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature to support them in carrying it through. <lb/>
Then my hon. friend thought that the scheme <lb/>
had gone through the length and breadth of <lb/>
the land. Hon. gentlemen, it is quite true <lb/>
that the resolutions have gone through the <lb/>
length and breadth of the land ; but where <lb/>
has there been that discussion in Canada <lb/>
to which resolutions of so much importance <lb/>
are entitled — except in Lower Canada, <lb/>
where I am told that fifteen counties have <lb/>
repudiated the resolutions when they were <lb/>
submitted to public meetings? And
in Upper <lb/>
Canada, where is the single instance of <lb/>
discussion of the facts having taken place <lb/>
except in the city of Toronto, where there <lb/>
was little or no discussion, and where it was <lb/>
promised that that city, like Quebec, should <lb/>
be made the seat of one of the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments? I understood my hon. friend from <lb/>
Erie Division to take issue on the fact that <lb/>
the delegates to the Conference were not <lb/>
self-elected, and I heard my hon. friend <lb/>
from Montreal deny it also. But if you take <lb/>
up a copy of the resolutions and the des<lb break="no"/>patches accompanying them. you will find <lb/>
that they were in every sense of the word <lb/>
self-elected.  And if they were not self- <lb break="yes"/>
elected, who deputed them to come and do <lb/>
what they have done ? Did the basis on <lb/>
which the Government was formed authorize <lb/>
them to enter into this compact ? The basis <lb/>
on which the Government was formed speaks <lb/>
for itself.  The measure they promised <lb/>
the people of Upper Canada was simply a <lb/>
measure to settle the existing difficulties<lb/>
between Upper and Lower Canada. They <lb/>
were to form Upper and Lower Canada into <lb/>
a Federation upon such a basis as would here<lb break="no"/>after allow the other provinces, if agreeable, <lb/>
and if they could agree as to terms, to also <lb/>
enter the Federation.  These are the bases <lb/>
on which the present Government was form<lb break="no"/>ed, and these are the bases on which the <lb/>
members of that Government went to the <lb/>
country and asked for the support of their <lb/>
constituents.  And to bear me out in this <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
   
 assertion, I have only to read the
language <lb/>
of His Excellency the Governor General as <lb/>
I find it embodied in His Excellency's Speech <lb/>
at the close of the last session
of Parliament. <lb/>
You will find it in the latter part of the <lb/>
Speech.  His Excellency says :—" The time <lb/>
has arrived when the constitutional question, <lb/>
which has for many years agitated this prov<lb break="no"/>ince, is ripe for settlement."  What prov<lb break="no"/>ince is alluded to in this paragraph ?  Most <lb/>
certainly the province of Canada.  It is <lb/>
my intention," proceeds His Excellency, <lb/>
" during the approaching recess, to endeavor <lb/>
to devise a plan for this
purpose, which will <lb/>
be laid before Parliament at its next meet<lb break="no"/>ing." Hon. gentlemen, where is that plan ? <lb/>
Where is the measure so promised in the <lb/>
Speech from the Throne. " In releasing you <lb/>
from further attendance," His Excellency <lb/>goes on to say, "I would
impress upon you <lb/>
the importance of using the influence which <lb/>
the confidence of your fellow subjects con<lb break="no"/>fers upon you to secure for any scheme which <lb/>
may be prepared with this object a calm and <lb/>
impartial consideration both in Parliament <lb/>
and throughout the country." Now, what <lb/>
does this mean?  If it means anything, <lb/>
it means this, that the Government pro<lb break="no"/>mised to bring down a measure to this <lb/>
Legislature to enable us to Confederate Upper <lb/>
and Lower Canada. "Well," hon. gentlemen <lb/>
say, " they have brought down a larger <lb/>
scheme." Yes, but who asked them to bring <lb/>
down that scheme ? It is said that it makes <lb/>
no difference which scheme was
laid before <lb/>
the House ; but I contend that it makes all <lb/>
the difference, for if these resolutions had <lb/>
reference simply to Upper and Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da, they would be susceptible of amend<lb break="no"/>ment by this House. In such a case, <lb/>
hon. gentlemen would not have come <lb/>
down as we now see them shaking their <lb/>
resolutions in the face of the members <lb/>
of the Legislature, and saying, " Here is a <lb/>
treaty which you must accept in its entirety <lb/>
or not at all." They would not be warning <lb/>
us at our peril to alter a word or erase a line <lb/>
on pain of being branded as disunionists, or <lb/>
perhaps something worse than that.  Had <lb/>
they brought down the resolutions they were <lb/>
pledged to bring down, we would be sitting <lb/>
here calmly and dispassionately, aided by <lb/>
the Government of the day, framing a <lb/>
measure which would be in very deed for <lb/>
the benefit of the two provinces. But why <lb/>
do the Government seek to shelter them<lb break="no"/>selves so completely behind these resolu<lb break="no"/>
            

            <pb n="279" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0279.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">279</fw>
          
tines—resolutions which, as they stand, <lb/>
are incapable of justification — resolutions <lb/>
which shew concession after concession to <lb/>
have been made to the eastern provinces, <lb/>
but not one of which (I challenge them to <lb/>
the proof) was made by the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to the people of Canada ? Then look <lb/>
at the representation at the Conference. <lb/>
Both parties, I believe, from all the provinces <lb/>
were represented, except as regards one sec<lb break="no"/>tion of Canada.  There was no one repre<lb break="no"/>senting in the Conference the Liberal party <lb/>
in Lower Canada.  (Hear, hear.) While <lb/>
in the eastern provinces the Government <lb/>
of the day were magnanimous enough to ask <lb/>
the cooperation and consideration of the <lb/>
leaders of the Opposition in those provinces, <lb/>
the hon. gentlemen in Canada
ignored <lb/>
entirely the existence of the Liberal party <lb/>
in Lower Canada.  (Hear, hear.) My hon. <lb/>
friend from the Erie Division
tells us that <lb/>
he is strongly opposed to the details of the <lb/>
scheme. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CHRI1">HON. MR. CHRISTIE</persName>—I did not say <lb/>
so. I stated in reference to the elective <lb/>
principle that I was opposed to its abro<lb break="no"/>gation. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man feels towards the elective principle as <lb/>
strongly as I do, he will oppose its abro<lb break="no"/>gation to the last. I have reason to feel <lb/>
strongly in regard to that principle, being, like <lb/>
himself, indebted for it to a seat in the Le<lb break="no"/>gislature ; and I will resist the
measure very <lb/>
long before I vote against a principle giving <lb/>
the people power to send me here as their <lb/>
representative. The hon. gentleman also
told <lb/>
us that the whole country is in favor of <lb/>
Federation. I have no doubt the whole coun<lb break="no"/>try is in favor of Federation in
itself, but there <lb/>
are many people throughout Canada who are <lb/>
opposed to the present scheme on account of <lb/>
its details. Then the hon. gentleman declared <lb/>
that the country understood the scheme. <lb/>
Now, what better illustration can we have of <lb/>
the falsity of this position than what was <lb/>
witnessed on the floor of this House last <lb/>
night ? We then heard one of the most intel<lb break="no"/>ligent and one of the most able members of the <lb/>
mercantile community in Upper Canada, my <lb/>
hon. friend from Ottawa Division (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
SKEAD) tell us it was only within
the last <lb/>
twenty-four hours that he had understood the <lb/>
scheme as now submitted to the House. And <lb/>
yet we are gravely told that the whole country <lb/>
understands it ! Do the people of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince generally know anything in reference <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         
 to the cost of working the scheme ? Hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, it has been stated in various parts <lb/>
of the country, by leading public men of. the <lb/>
country, that the local subsidies proposed <lb/>
in the scheme will be more than
sufficient <lb/>
to carry on the local governments
of the <lb/>
several provinces. But, hon. gentlemen, we <lb/>
must judge of the future by the experience <lb/>
afforded by the past. If you will look at the <lb/>
Public Accounts of Upper and Lower Canada <lb/>
—take for instance Upper Canada
in 1838,— <lb/>
you will find that the
expenditure on 450,000 <lb/>
of a population was $885,000 for
one year. <lb/>
But hon. gentlemen may assert that at that <lb/>
time Upper Canada had to bear the <lb/>
burdens of the militia and pay the cost of <lb/>
collecting the customs, and some other small <lb/>
charges which it is now proposed to throw <lb/>
on the Federal Government. But what were <lb/>
the charges of the militia for that year ? The <lb/>
insignificant sum of £649. 19s. 11 1/2d.  Then <lb/>
there was received from fees and commissions <lb/>
£317 15s., thus making the total cost of the <lb/>
militia to Upper Canada no more than <lb/>
£332. 4s. 11 1/2d. Then as
to customs. Why, <lb/>
honorable gentlemen, the whole cost of <lb/>
collecting the customs revenue in Upper <lb/>
Canada, during the year 1838, amounted <lb/>
to £2,792. 14s. 2d.—just about one half <lb/>
the cost, hardly one half the cost — of <lb/>
collecting the present duties at the port <lb/>
of Toronto. Then if you come down to <lb/>
Lower Canada you will find that at the time <lb/>
of the union you had a population of 650,000 <lb/>
souls, and that the expense of governing the <lb/>
people was $573,348. And I venture
to <lb/>
say that no people in the world were ever <lb/>
more cheaply governed than were the people <lb/>
of Lower Canada before the union. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) But if you can govern them after the
<lb/>
union just as cheaply per head as before, what <lb/>
do you find ? You will require $980,000 to <lb/>
carry on the government of the country, <lb/>
independent of paying the interest upon the <lb/>
large portion of debt saddled upon you. In <lb/>
Upper Canada, we have been told that we <lb/>
really shall not know what to do with the <lb/>
large amount of money about to be lavished <lb/>
on the Local Legislature. (Laughter.)
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">HON. MR. MCCREA</persName>—Who said that—— <lb/>
that we would have more money than we <lb/>
know what to do with ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—You must have <lb/>
read it in the speeches made in the other <lb/>
House, and particularly in the speeches of <lb/>
the Hon. Mr. Brown. Well, if we can <lb/>
govern the people of Upper Canada as cheap<lb break="no"/>

ly after the union as before, it will cost
<lb/>
$2,170,000 or $1,054,000 more
than the <lb/>
amount of the local subsidy. I am sure no <lb/>
hon. gentleman will believe that we are going <lb/>
to be more saving of the public money in <lb/>
the future than we were in those early days <lb/>
of our history. Hon. gentlemen, it is said <lb/>
that the people of the country have had those <lb/>
resolutions before them, that they perfectly <lb/>
understand them, and that they are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to a dispassionate judgment in <lb/>
the matter. It ill becomes the members of <lb/>
the Government to make such a statement. <lb/>
Why, what has been witnessed on the floor <lb/>
of this House ? A simple question was put <lb/>
to the Hon. Commissioner of Crown Lands <lb/>
as to the manner in which the members of <lb/>
the Legislative Councils of the various pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were to be appointed. The Hon. <lb/>
Commissioner informed us that the appoint<lb break="no"/>ments were to be made by the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments, and he was confirmed in that view by <lb/>
the hon. and gallant Premier, who had the <lb/>
dignity conferred upon him of presiding over <lb/>
the Conference of delegates held in this <lb/>
city. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—I do not think <lb/>
that my hon. colleague said anything on the <lb/>
subject. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—I understood him <lb/>
to confirm the statement of the Hon. Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Crown Lands. But at all <lb/>
events, he heard the statement and did not <lb/>
object to it. But what did you find? After <lb/>
the absurdity of that position was pointed <lb/>
out, my hon. friend, the Commissioner of <lb/>
Crown Lands, asks a day to give an answer <lb/>
to the question, and he comes down next <lb/>
day and gives a totally different
reply. A <lb/>
few days later, the question of the export <lb/>
duty on the minerals of Nova
Scotia came <lb/>
under consideration, and I understood the <lb/>
Hon. Commissioner of Crown Lands as <lb/>
saying that in his opinion only the coal and <lb/>
minerals exported to foreign countries would <lb/>
be liable to duty. But according to the <lb/>
explanations given by the hon. gentleman <lb/>
afterwards, I understand that the export <lb/>
duty will apply to all coal and minerals <lb/>
exported from Nova Scotia. My hon. friend <lb/>
went on to explain the meaning of this <lb/>
export duty. And what is his explanation ? <lb/>
He tells us that it is nothing more than a <lb/>
royalty. The export duty is imposed simply <lb/>
upon the coal which leave the country. In <lb/>
Nova Scotia they now impose a royalty, and <lb/>
that royalty they intend to change for an <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         
 export duty, and the difference in their <lb/>
favor will he this—that on the coal they <lb/>
consume themselves there will be
no duty, <lb/>
but on the coal they send to Canada there <lb/>
will be this barrier of an export duty. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—My hon. friend will <lb/>
see this, that had all the Crown lands in the <lb/>
different colonies been placed in the hands <lb/>
of the General Government, the General
<lb/>
Government would have received all the <lb/>
proceeds therefrom. But those have been <lb/>
given to the local governments, and as in <lb/>
Upper Canada we will have timber dues, so <lb/>
in Nova Scotia they are entitled to a revenue <lb/>
from their coal. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Any one not ac<lb break="no"/>quanted with the subject would naturally <lb/>fancy from the language of my hon. friend
<lb/>
that under Federation we are to have some<lb break="no"/>thing which we did not possess before. But <lb/>
the Crown lands are the property of Upper
<lb/>
and Lower Canada now, and we are entitled <lb/>
to the revenue from them. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">HON. MR. ROSS</persName>—And so is Nova Scotia <lb/>
entitled to a revenue from their coal. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName> —But you give them <lb/>
a privilege not accorded to the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of imposing export duties. Hon. <lb/>
gentlemen, I would now desire to allude to <lb/>
another matter which I think the people do <lb/>
not thoroughly understand, and that is the 
<lb/>
apportionment of the public debt. I stated
<lb/>
before and I again assert that revenue is the <lb/>
only true basis on which the people should <lb/>
go into Confederation as regards
their debt ; <lb/>
and I think my hon. friend from the <lb/>
Saugeen Division (Hon. Mr. MACPHERSON)<lb/>
saw the matter in the same light. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACP1">HON. MR. MACPHERSON</persName>—Not in this<lb/>
case, because we have not the revenue to <lb/>
base it upon. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—Why have we not <lb/>
the revenue to base it upon ? Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, the Trade Returns of Nova Scotia, <lb/>
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
are in the Library below, and twenty-four <lb/>
hours' work of a competent accountant would <lb/>
shew what each province would contribute <lb/>
to the general revenue from her trade under <lb/>
our present tariff. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—But does not <lb/>
the hon. gentleman see that when the tariffs 
<lb/>
are assimilated, they will not bring in the <lb/>
future what the have brought in the past? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—This
I can see, that <lb/>
you are giving to the Lower Provinces pri<lb break="no"/>vileges which we do not enjoy  Hon. gen<lb break="no"/>

    <fw type="num">281</fw>


     tlemen speak of the imports from the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces. But take the import of 
     <lb/>
     coal from Nova Scotia, and we find that in 
     <lb/>
     1863, its whole value amounted to $67,000. 
     <lb/>
     Then they refer to the fish trade. But why 
     <lb/>
     need we go there for fish, when in our own 
     <lb/>
     waters we can have for the catching as fine 
     <lb/>
     fish as the world produces ? But Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion will give us no privileges over the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries which we do not at present enjoy. 
     <lb/>
     Canadian fishermen can as well go, and have 
     <lb/>
     as much the right to go, and fish in the 
     <lb/>
     waters below before as after Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     We will continue to go there if we desire it, 
     <lb/>
     not because we are members of the Confede<lb break="no"/>racy, but because we are British subjects. 
     <lb/>
     But I was going to speak of the trade of 
     <lb/>
     these countries. We derive new little or no 
     <lb/>
     duty from the trade of the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     at the same time much of the revenues of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces is derived from exports 
     <lb/>
     from those provinces to each other, all of 
     <lb/>
     which will be lost to the General Government, 
     <lb/>
     as the Confederation will only be entitled to 
     <lb/>
     collect duties on goods imported from foreign 
     <lb/>
     countries. We are told, too, that our tariff is 
     <lb/>
     to be greatly reduced under Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     I am sorry to hear that statement, because 
     <lb/>
     it is impossible that it can be correct, and 
     <lb/>
     there is too much reason to fear that it was 
     <lb/>
     done with a view of influencing legislation 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere, by holding out the hope in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and in the other provinces, that 
     <lb/>
     if they joined us, the tariff would be less 
     <lb/>
     burdensome than it is at present. But if 
     <lb/>
     the tariff is reduced, the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     may rest assured that they will have 
     <lb/>
     $4,000,000 or $5,000,000 to raise in some 
     <lb/>
     other way ; so that if you take it off the 
     <lb/>
     tariff, you must put it on the land. I wish 
     <lb/>
     now, however, to speak of the unfair appor<lb break="no"/>tionment of the debt. I have always taken 
     <lb/>
     the ground that revenue is the true gauge 
     <lb/>
     by which you can measure a nation's abi<lb break="no"/>lity to pay debt. Well, taking the tables of 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Minister, we find that New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, with a revenue of $1,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     goes into the Confederation with a debt of 
     <lb/>
     $7,000,000, while Canada, with arevenue of 
     <lb/>
     $11,500,000, is only entitled to go into the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation with a debt of $62,500,000. 
     <lb/>
     Is this fair ?—is it right ?—is it honest ? 
     <lb/>
     Take the revenue as the basis of ability 
     <lb/>
     to pay—and it is the only true basis—and 
     <lb/>
     instead of Canada going into the Con<lb break="no"/>federation with a debt only $62,500,000, 
     <lb/>
     she would be entitled to go in with a debt 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
    

     of $80,000,000, or more than her present 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness. Then it is said that the 
     <lb/>
     people understand the whole scheme, and 
     <lb/>
     that they are perfectly satisfied with it. If 
     <lb/>
     that were so we should have petitions coming 
     <lb/>
     down. But I have yet to learn that, when 
     <lb/>
     the people, especially of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     understand the scheme and how it is going 
     <lb/>
     to work, they will be at all satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     it. Take the little Island of Prince Edward, 
     <lb/>
     with its population of 80,857 souls, or a less 
     <lb/>
     population than a single constituency repre<lb break="no"/>sented in the other branch of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and we find it getting $153,728, 
     <lb/>
     while it is relieved of a debt of $240,633. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName> — And what 
     <lb/>
     does it contribute ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. MR. CURRIE</persName>—It simply contri<lb break="no"/>butes custom and excise duties by the

     But, hon. gentlemen, pray do not run away 
     <lb/>
     with the idea that all this comes to the Con<lb break="no"/>federate Government. All that comes to the

     duties from excise and customs on goods im<lb break="no"/>ported from foreign countries.

     Upper Canada ? Well, let us proceed now to. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and what do we find ? That 
     <lb/>
     with a population of 122,600 souls—less 
     <lb/>
     than the population of Huron, Bruce and 
     <lb/>
     Grey—less, in fact, than the constituency 
     <lb/>
     represented by my hon. friend, the member 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     well 80 cents per head for all time to come. 
     <lb/>
     Then she gets also, what I am sure the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner of Crown Lands can hardly 
     <lb/>
     justify, that is a bonus of $165,000 for 
     <lb/>
     all time to come; and this, if capilatized, 
     <lb/>
     amounts to 83,000,000—and all this that 
     <lb/>
     she may come into the Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     And why does she receive so large a sum? 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend tells us that she gets it in 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the valuable Crown lands 
     <lb/>
     and minerals which she surrenders to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government. But we have yet to 
     <lb/>
     learn as a matter of fact that a ton of coal 
     <lb/>
     has ever been raised in the island. And 
     <lb/>
     what other minerals have they? We know of 
     <lb/>
     none. Their Crown lands, too, are of no value, 
     <lb/>
     as is proved by their not having yielded 
     <lb/>
     anything at all for many years past. Then 
     <lb/>
    why should we give them $3,000,000, or 
     <lb/>$165,000 per year for worthless lands? I 
     <lb/>will not say, however, that they are altogether 
     <lb/>worthless ; but I know this, that for years 
     <lb/>past a statute has been in force, giving the 
     <lb/>ands free of charge to anybody who will 
     <lb/>go and settle on them for five years. And 
     <lb/>these are the valuable lands for which we 
     <lb/>are to pay an equivalent of 3,000,000. But 
     <lb/>my hon. friend the Commissioner of Crown 
     <lb/>Lands, perhaps, when he addresses the House, 
     <lb/>will tell us these Crown lands and minerals, 
     <lb/>whatever their value to Newfoundland, are 
     <lb/>worth 83,000,000 to the Confederation, and 
     <lb/>will argue as that they give up these lands and 
     <lb/>minerals, and have no local source of reve<lb break="no"/>nue, it is necessary they should receive this 
     <lb/>subsidy in return. But why have they no 
     <lb/>local source of revenue ? Why not adopt the 
     <lb/>same means to raise revenue in New found<lb break="no"/>land that we adopt here ? Why should we 
     <lb/>he called upon to contribute from the public 
     <lb/>chest $165,000 for a purpose that we in 
     <lb/>Canada tax ourselves for ? Hon. gentlemen, 
     <lb/>I stated that the country was taken by sur<lb break="no"/>prise in regard to the manner in whic this 
     <lb/>measure was brought down to the House; 
     <lb/>and I think I have good reason for making 
     <lb/>that statement. Before we came here we had 
     <lb/>very little explanation of the financial part 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
           

     of the scheme; and that is a most important 
     <lb/>
     part. I am not one of those who, while fa<lb break="no"/>vorable to Confederation as a principle, would 
     <lb/>
     put a few hundred thousand dollars in the 
     <lb/>
     scale against it. But my grounds against the 
     <lb/>
     scheme are these— that if it is commenced 
     <lb/>
     upon a basis which is unjust to one portion 
     <lb/>
     of the community, it will be based upon a 
     <lb/>
     false foundation, and the tenement thus 
     <lb/>
     preposed to be erected will not withstand 
     <lb/>
     the breath of public opinion. We had 
     <lb/>
     reason to suppose that when we came here 
     <lb/>
     the measure promised at the close of the 
     <lb/>
     last session would be submitted ; but instead 
     <lb/>
     of that we have a very difi'erent measure 
     <lb/>
     altogether. But supposing this Address 
     <lb/>
     passes—supposing these resolutions are 
     <lb/>
     carried, and the other colonies do not 
     <lb/>
     concur in the same Address as ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     what is to be the consequence? As I 
     <lb/>
     understand it, the consent of all the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces must be had, and if they do no't 
     <lb/>
     concur, the scheme falls to the ground. 
     <lb/>
     What we ought to have had in Canada was 
     <lb/>
     the promised measure to put an end to the 
     <lb/>
     sectional difficulties between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. But, instead of that, we are 
     <lb/>
     placed in consequence of the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference in this position—a scheme is brought 
     <lb/>
     down which is declared to be in the nature 
     <lb/>
     of a treaty, and we are told that we are to 
     <lb/>
     have no voice in its alteration. No matter 
     <lb/>
     what the details may be—our discussion of 
     <lb/>
     them is to be a mere farce. Even the 
     <lb/>
     reasonable delay I am now asking for will, 
     <lb/>
     I fear, be opposed by the Government of 
     <lb/>
     the day. Hon. gentlemen, in order to shew 
     <lb/>
     the necessity which exists for the measure 
     <lb/>
     being equitable and just to all classes of the 
     <lb/>
     people and all sections of the country about 
     <lb/>
     to be affected by it, I will read the remarks 
     <lb/>
     'of a distinguished statesman—one of the 
     <lb/>
     ablest men, perhaps, that Canada can claim. 
     <lb/>
     This is his language :—

     No measure could possibly meet the approval

     it the germs of injustice to any, and if, in the

     These were the views of the Minister of

     months ago, and it is because I feel that

     that it is not proper for this branch of the

     I feel confident he will do so. Now, hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, what have we here before us? 
     <lb/>
     We have a scheme which is calculated to do 
     <lb/>
     manifest and untold injustice to that section 
     <lb/>
     of the province which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has the honor to represent. We have a 
     <lb/>
     scheme pledging us to construct the Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway without our knowing whe<lb break="no"/>ther it is to cost fifteen, twenty or thirty 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars. The only estimate is that 
     <lb/>
     alluded to by the hon. member from Toronto, 
     <lb/>
     who stated that Mr. Brydges was prepared 
     <lb/>
     to build it for seventeen and a half millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars.

     respecting the privileges of this House. It

     is our duty as honest legislators to protect 
     <lb/>
     the country from the baneful effects of hasty 
     <lb/>
     and ill-considered legislation. Well, is not 
     <lb/>
     this hasty legislation that is now proposed 
     <lb/>
     to be transacted by the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     day ?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACP1">HON. Mr. MACPHERSON</persName>.—I do not 
     <lb/>
     regard it so, and I tell you why. My con<lb break="no"/>stituents have considered the question and 
     <lb/>
     are fully satisfied that the proposed legisla<lb break="no"/>tion should take place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. Mr. CURRIE</persName>—It has been said by 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen that the whole scheme con<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
           
sists of concessions. I would ask what con<lb break="no"/>cessions have been made to Canada? What 
     <lb/>
     concession has been made to the views of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Upper Canada ? The people will 
     <lb/>
     understand why it is that everything was 
     <lb/>
     conceded on the part of Canada, and compara<lb break="no"/>tively nothing on the part of the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, when they know that the little colony 
     <lb/>
     of Prince Edward Island, with its eighty 
     <lb/>
     thousand people, has as much to say in the 
     <lb/>
     Conference as Upper Canada with its million 
     <lb/>
     and a half, and as Lower Canada with its 
     <lb/>
     million and a quarter of people. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) When we conceded to them that 
     <lb/>
     point, the series of concessions on that part 
     <lb/>
     of Canada began. Then we conceded to them 
     <lb/>
     the right of depriving us of an elective 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council. (Hear, hear.) Who 
     <lb/>
     challenges this statement? I defy any hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen to say that it was not at the dic<lb break="no"/>tation of the eastern provinces, that the 
     <lb/>
     character of the Legislative Council was 
     <lb/>
     changed. In order to settle this point, it is 
     <lb/>
     only necessary to refer hon. gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     what the Hon. Minister of Finance stated in 
     <lb/>
     his celebrated Sherbrooke speech with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to it. That was concession number 
     <lb/>
     two. Then look at the proposed Constitution. 
     <lb/>
     The Lower Provinces had only a population 
     <lb/>
     of 700,000 people. One would think 
     <lb/>
     they would be satisfied with the same repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the Legislative Council that 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada with double the number of 
     <lb/>
     people should have, and that Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     with nearly double the pepulation should 
     <lb/>
     be given. But instead of being satisfied 
     <lb/>
     with 24, they must have 28 members. There 
     <lb/>
     are three distinct and most important con<lb break="no"/>cessions on the part of Canada to the people 
     <lb/>
     of the eastern provinces. And then we go 
     <lb/>
     into the Federation with a debt of only 
     <lb/>
     862,500,000, instead of with 882,500,000 
     <lb/>
     as we were entitled to. Then we are to 
     <lb/>
     saddle ourselves with a burden of 815,000,<lb break="no"/>000, and give them a bonus for coming in, 
     <lb/>
     in the shape of an annual payment for local 
     <lb/>
     purposes, which we defray in Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     by direct taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCR2">Hon. Mr. McCREA</persName>—That is because 
     <lb/>
     they are to help to pay our debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. Mr. CURRIE</persName>—My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from the Western Division says, they have 
     <lb/>
     to help to pay our debt; true they have to 
     <lb/>
     help to pay the debts of the Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     but that is no reason why they should receive 
     <lb/>
     money from us to pay their local expenses. 
     <lb/>
     Then look at the absurdity of giving each 
     <lb/>

     province so much per head on its population 
     <lb/>
     for the expenses of the local governments. 
     <lb/>
     Every one knows that the pepulation of the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces will not increase nearly so 
     <lb/>
     fast as that of this province.   We will ther<lb break="no"/>fore

       have to pay a greater proportion of this 
     <lb/>
     amount through the increase of our popula<lb break="no"/>tion than we can receive under the proposed 
     <lb/>
     arrangement. This is concession number 
     <lb/>
     four. The next concession is to New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. We are to ive New Brunswick a 
     <lb/>
     bonus of 8630,000 in addition to building 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway through along sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the country—leading the people to 
     <lb/>
     believe that the road is to pass through 
     <lb/>
     nearly every town in the province. Then 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia gets the right to impose an 
     <lb/>
     export duty on its coal and other minerals 
     <lb/>
     coming into Upper Canada, or going else<lb break="no"/>where. Then Newfoundland, as I have said 
     <lb/>
     before, is to have upward of three million 
     <lb/>
       dollars, if you capitalize the annual gift, as 
     <lb/>
     an inducement to come in and join us. Then, 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, my hon. friend from Port 
     <lb/>
     Hope spoke of the common schools of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     of about one million and a quarter of dollars 
     <lb/>
     that is to be abolished by a stroke of the 
     <lb/>
     pen—that is another concession, I suppose, 
     <lb/>
     made to the people of the eastern provin<lb break="no"/>ces. What do we get for all these conces<lb break="no"/>sions ? Do we get anything that we are not 
     <lb/>
     entitled to as a matter of right. We get 17 
     <lb/>
     additional members of the Lower House 
     <lb/>
     for Upper Canada—but that is nothing 
     <lb/>
     more than we are entitled to—at the 
     <lb/>
     same time that we get 47 added from the 
     <lb/>
     east. We are told that the reason for 
     <lb/>
     having so large anumber of members is to 
     <lb/>
     avoid narrow majorities. If everything 
     <lb/>
     works well, therefore, under the new consti<lb break="no"/>tution, we are told we will always have a 
     <lb/>
     strong Government, somewhat similar to 
     <lb/>
     that with which we are now blessed. Hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen say, that this question is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     understood by the people of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     that they are satisfied with the arrangement ; 
     <lb/>
     then what danger, I would ask, can there 
     <lb/>
     he in allowing the people a few months to 
     <lb/>
     consider the matter still more fully? In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, it is far better to take the thing up 
     <lb/>
     deliberately and proceed cautiously with it, 
     <lb/>
     than to attempt to force a measure upon 
     <lb/>
     the people, so hurriedly, that they will feel 
     <lb/>
     hereafter, if they do not now, that you are 
     <lb/>
     doing them a very great injustice. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is most extraordinary, the grounds 
     <lb/>
     on which these resolutions are supported 
     <lb/>
     by different classes of people. Some hon. 
     <lb/>
            

            <cb/>
          

     gentlemen support them on the ground that 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation is to build up an independant 
     <lb/>
     nationality in this part of the 
     <lb/>
     world. Others, on the ground that it is 
     <lb/>
     going to cement us more closely as colonies. 
     <lb/>
     And a third party uphold the resolutions on 
     <lb/>
     the ground that the injustice of the thing 
     <lb/>
     will disgust the people and float our country   
     <lb/>
     over to the American Republic. I feel my<lb break="no"/>self that unless the people have due time to 
     <lb/>
     consider the matter, and are not driven into 
     <lb/>
     it against their will, these resolutions will
     <lb/>
     amount to nothing more than so many 
     <lb/>
     withes to tie the provinces together until we 
     <lb/>
     all drift like a raft into the American Con<lb break="no"/>federation. (Hear, hear, and laughter.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DICK2">Hon. Mr. DICKSON</persName> — Honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men,—Every honorable member of this House 
     <lb/>
     must be aware of the difficulties which an 
     <lb/>
     individual member has to encounter in rising to 
     <lb/>
     address the House at this late period of the 
     <lb/>
     debate, when the subject, after a fortnight's 
     <lb/>
     discuœion, is almost exhausted. I have, how<lb break="no"/>ever, refrained from offering any observations 
     <lb/>
     at an earlier stage, in consequence of a desire 
     <lb/>
     to confine my remarks more particularly to the 
     <lb/>
     principle embodied in the amendment of my 
     <lb/>
     honerable and learned friend from the Niagara 
     <lb/>
     Division. I shall now briefly refer to the   
     <lb/>
     introductory remarks of the honorable and 
     <lb/>
     galant Knight at the head of the present; Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, when he submitted the matter for the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of this honorable House. That 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman told us that the unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory state of things which had existed in 
     <lb/>
     the politics of this country for the twenty-five 
     <lb/>
     months prior to the TACHE- MACDONALD Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, rendered it use that some 
     <lb/>
     great political exertion should  be made to 
     <lb/>
     remedy those difieulties. Well, gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     what were those diflieulties ? Why, it was 
     <lb/>
     that five different administrations had been 
     <lb/>
     formed, and five different administrations had 
     <lb/>
     been unable to ca on the administration of 
     <lb/>
     public affairs, an had either resigned or 
     <lb/>
     me so Week, in consequence of their small 
     <lb/>
     majority in the popular branch, that they 
     <lb/>
     could not conduct the Government in a satis<lb break="no"/>factory manner. The TACHE-MAODONALD 
     <lb/>
     Government had arrived at the same state 
     <lb/>
     as the five preceding administrations, and 
     <lb/>
     finding themselves in this political dilemma, 
     <lb/>
     were again about appealing to the country, 
     <lb/>
     when a " still, small voice " was heard in the 
     <lb/>
     distance; and what was' that " still, small 
     <lb/>
     voice," and where did it come from? It was 
     <lb/>
     the voice of a great man, and came from an 
     <lb/>
     individual who solicited an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="285" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0285.jpg"/>
       <fw type="num">285</fw>

     pouring oil on the troubled political waters. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Permission was granted, the 
     <lb/>
     oil poured on ; the effect-was miraculous— 
     <lb/>
     the commotion ceased, and, a calm succeeded— 
     <lb/>
     a circumstance which caused no surprise when 
     <lb/>
     it was discovered, as it speedily was, that the 
     <lb/>
     magical oil came fresh from the wells of Both<lb break="no"/>well. (Great laughter.) The Government, 
     <lb/>
    as the honorable and gallant Knight told us, 
     <lb/>received a communication from the "real chief" 
     <lb/>of the Opposition. And there is no doubt but 
     <lb/>that he was the real chief of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>and by his apostasy—this individual from 
     <lb/>whom the still, small voice came—is the real 
     <lb/>chief of the Goverment party. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>Well, he was desirous of making overtures, 
     <lb/>and he did, as amatterof fact, make over<lb break="no"/>tures, with the view, as the honorable and 
     <lb/>gallant. Knight has told us, of sinking all 
     <lb/>previous differences. We are told he went 
     <lb/>into the Government for the purpose of 
     <lb/>settling this one question of a new political 
     <lb/>existence, and we are therefore justified in 
     <lb/>inferring that he is either going out of the 
     <lb/>Government again at an early day , or else is 
     <lb/>going up to a higher position. Well, gentle<lb break="no"/>men, what dificulties have been settled? 
     <lb/>None as yet, but the scheme now before 
     <lb/>the House was to be a panacea for alll dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties and dissensions that have afflicted the 
     <lb/>country for the past five and twenty years. 
     <lb/>From whom does this panacea emanate? Why, 
     <lb/>from the very individual who has been more 
     <lb/>instrumental than any other man in creating 
     <lb/>these dificulties. (Hear, hear.) The honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman at one time stated that he was 
     <lb/>a governmental impossibility, but it does not 
     <lb/>appear that he has beeu so in reality. After 
     <lb/>the oil was thrown on the troubled waters, 
     <lb/>then came the period for making some little 
     <lb/>delicate arrangements between the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the gentleman possessing the still 
     <lb/>small voice. Well, what were the little ar<lb break="no"/>rangements? Why, the honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>insisted on being an outsider. He would not 
     <lb/>go, into the Government under any circum<lb break="no"/>stances whatever. (Hear, hear.) No, so, he 
     <lb/>would not. (Laughter) Well, the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Government said : " But we must 
     <lb/>have you among us; we are too well aware of 
     <lb/>the power you can bring us, to consent to your 
     <lb/>remaining on the outside." Well now, it is 
     <lb/>astonishing the sacrifices public men will 
     <lb/>sometimes consent to make. (Laughter) It 
     <lb/>is really surprising , gentlemen, what sacrifices 
     <lb/>they do feel called upon to make for the good 
     <lb/>of their country. (Laughter) And here we 
     <lb/>have a very notable example of it. We have 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
   

     an instance of how much can be sacrificed at 
     <lb/>
     the shrine of patriotism for the salvation of 
     <lb/>
     one's country. (Laughter. Towards the last 
     <lb/>
     of the delicate arrangements before alluded to, 
     <lb/>
     he thought he would go in—this still, small 
     <lb/>
     voice gentleman. (Laughter) Well, this 
     <lb/>
     being determined upon, he thought it would 
     <lb/>
     be necessary to go in upon some principle, but 
     <lb/>
     that was a most difficult operation. What 
     <lb/>
     principle could be found applicable to the 
     <lb/>
     case ? (Laughter) Some inventive genius 
     <lb/>
     suggested that he might go in on the homœo<lb break="no"/>pathic principle. Well, he finally went in on 
     <lb/>
     that principle, and took with him an infini<lb break="no"/>tessimally small dose of Grits. (Renewed 
     <lb/>
     laughter.) And the result of his going in 
     <lb/>
     on that principle is that we have now a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment composed of three Clear Grits and 
     <lb/>
     nine Conservatives. The honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man, to whom I have alluded, went to the 
     <lb/>
     country and got returned to his seat in the 
     <lb/>
     House and Government. My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Toronto says he got returned by acclam<lb break="no"/>ation. Well, when we look at the individual 
     <lb/>
     and consider that he has been for years the 
     <lb/>
     leading spirit and guiding genius of a large 
     <lb/>
     political party, made up of a majority of the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of Upper Canada, and look at 
     <lb/>
     the acknowledged intellect of the man, and 
     <lb/>
     take into account the influence of the pen 
     <lb/>
     which he has the opportunity of wielding so 
     <lb/>
     powerfully—when we take all these things 
     <lb/>
     into consideration, it is not at all surprising 
     <lb/>
     that he. should be returned by acclamation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) He came back from the coun<lb break="no"/>try and has since taken part in the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment; and here I wish to make a few 
     <lb/>
     observations with reference to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as it stands to-day. You must re<lb break="no"/>collect, honorable gentlemen, that we are en<lb break="no"/>joying, or at least have enjoyed, a system of 
     <lb/>
     government in this country which has a great 
     <lb/>
     many admirers, and which some honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen admire a great deal more than the 
     <lb/>
     quality of the people. The system is known 
     <lb/>
     by the name of Responsible Government. If 
     <lb/>
     I understand the subject properly, that system 
     <lb/>
     of government is defined in this way—that 
     <lb/>
     the Government of the country must be car<lb break="no"/>ried on according to the well-understood wishes 
     <lb/>
     of the people, as expressed through their re<lb break="no"/>presontatives on the floor of the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly. (Hear, hear.) Well now, I take 
     <lb/>
     exception to the formation of the present 
     <lb/>
     Government, on the ground that it was not 
     <lb/>
     established on that principle, because they are 
     <lb/>
     not a government emanating from the people. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot hold them in the same respect that I 
     <lb/>

     did before the three Conservative members 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada, who retired in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the three Grit members, left it. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment then all belonged to one political 
     <lb/>
     party, were all consistent members of that 
     <lb/>
     party, and taken together, were equal in talent 
     <lb/>
     to any Administration that has ever had charge 
     <lb/>
     of the affairs of this or any other province. 
     <lb/>
     All holding the same views on leading politi<lb break="no"/>cal uestions, even those who opposed them 
     <lb/>
     coul not but feel a very large degree of res<lb break="no"/>pect for them as sincere, honest, consistent 
     <lb/>
     Conservatives, and as I believe, entertaining 
     <lb/>
     sound political principles. But the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of the three other members altered the 
     <lb/>
     whole face of the Government. And the first 
     <lb/>
     thing this unholy alliance does is to go to work 
     <lb/>
     at the suggestion of the chief with the still, 
     <lb/>
     small voice to upset our Constitution. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) When a great constitutional question 
     <lb/>
     comes before this House, designed as it is to 
     <lb/>
     sweep an entire constitution from our Statute 
     <lb/>
     Book, and replace it with another, I think you 
     <lb/>
     will agree with me, honorable gentlemen, that 
     <lb/>
     this is one of the most important measures 
     <lb/>
     that could come from any government on the 
     <lb/>
     face of the earth. (Hear, hear.) Well, I 
     <lb/>
     would ask those people who are so anxious to 
     <lb/>
     see responsible government carried out in 
     <lb/>
     this country in its integrity, is this a govern<lb break="no"/>ment that you can recognize as representing 
     <lb/>
     the well-understood wishes of the people ?  A 
     <lb/>
     government claiming to be a responsible 
     <lb/>
     government ought to have for its basis re<lb break="no"/>turns made from the polls, and ought not to 
     <lb/>
     have its origin through the instrumentality 
     <lb/>
     of ministerial convenience. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     would like to ask if, at the last general elec<lb break="no"/>tion, this subject was mooted to the people in 
     <lb/>
     any section of the province ?—whether it was 
     <lb/>
     a subject to which the slightest reference was 
     <lb/>
     ever made by the votes of the people when they 
     <lb/>
     returned their representatives? I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that it could have been, because it is 
     <lb/>
     a measure that has emanated from the particu<lb break="no"/>lar individual to whom I have referred, since 
     <lb/>
     the TACHÉ -MACDONALD Government got into 
     <lb/>
     that unfortunate political dilemma. The 
     <lb/>
     people were not aware at the last general 
     <lb/>
     election that any such measure as this was to 
     <lb/>
     come before the Legislature. Honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, I would not stand up here and 
     <lb/>
     speak in this manner if the subject brought 
     <lb/>
     under our consideration was any ordinary 
     <lb/>
     measure which could be passed this session 
     <lb/>
     and re ed at the next, if found unsatisfac<lb break="no"/>tory. But these resolutions, if adopted by all 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures, will become embodied in an 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     Imperial Act and the people of Canada will 
     <lb/>
     find some difficulty in having any changes made 
     <lb/>
     in respect to them. The power that creates 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, by passing the act for that 
     <lb/>
     purpose, will be the only power by which any 
     <lb/>
     change can be effected in that act. There<lb break="no"/>fore, after passing these resolutions, it will be 
     <lb/>
     out of our power to alter them in the least 
     <lb/>
     degree. This, honorable gentlcmen, is one of 
     <lb/>
     the reasons why I have refrained from ad<lb break="no"/>dressing the House until the resolution which 
     <lb/>
     has just been proposed by my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from the Niagara Division should be brought 
     <lb/>
     forward. I would take this Opportunity 
     <lb/>
     saying that I do not think the observation 
     <lb/>
     made by an honorable gentleman, to the efiect 
     <lb/>
     that it would be in bad taste for this House 
     <lb/>
     to suggest a dissolution of the other branch of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature, should have any influence in 
     <lb/>
     disposing of the amendment now before us. 
     <lb/>
     Why, honorable gentlemen, there is nothing 
     <lb/>
     of the kind in the amendment. We argue 
     <lb/>
     for delay, and we are perfectly willing you 
     <lb/>
     should delay the measure until after the next 
     <lb/>
     general election. But, if the Government 
     <lb/>
     think that delay will be so dangerous to the 
     <lb/>
     measure, there is a constitution remedy open 
     <lb/>
     to them, which, of course, it would not he 
     <lb/>
     proper for me to refer to in a more pointed 
     <lb/>
     manner. I do not argue for a week or a 
     <lb/>
     month's delay. I think there ought to be a 
     <lb/>
     much longer time allowed. I think the ques<lb break="no"/>tion ought to be submittted to the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country for their approval. I do not 
     <lb/>
     want the thing to be gone about in a peddling 
     <lb/>
     kind of style, one honorable gentleman running 
     <lb/>
     here and another there, and endeavoring in 
     <lb/>
     that way to learn the views of his constituents. 
     <lb/>
     If we cannot have the usual constitutional 
     <lb/>
     mode of arriving at the true views, opinions, 
     <lb/>
     and impressions of the people in relation to 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, I do not want any delay at all. 
     <lb/>
     I do not want the opinion of the people taken, 
     <lb/>
     unless it can be done in such a manner as will 
     <lb/>
     give us something upon which we can depend. 
     <lb/>
     If an honorable gentleman consults the electors 
     <lb/>
     in one portion of his constituency and they are 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the scheme, while those of another 
     <lb/>
     section of the same constituenc are in favor 
     <lb/>
     of it, he is no better off' than when he began. 
     <lb/>
     Nor do I believe in taking a vote of the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies, " yea or nay, ' on the measure, 
     <lb/>
     in the manner in which the people have to 
     <lb/>
     vote with reference to stopping the supply of 
     <lb/>
     intoxicating drink under the Temperance Act. 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter) I go for the whole British con<lb break="no"/>stitutional mode, or nothing. I have no idea 
     <lb/>
     of wishing to see honorable gentlemen going 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="287" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0287.jpg"/>

     round among 'their constituents, knocking at 
     <lb/>
     every  door, and asking: Do you go Confed<lb break="no"/>eration?" (Laughter.) I would as soon see 
     <lb/>
     them going around peddling wooden clocks. 
     <lb/>(Renewed laughter.) I say, honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen,  that the whole scheme has emanated 
     <lb/>
     from the fertile and imaginative brain of one 
     <lb/>
     individual. That individual suggested the 
     <lb/>
     scheme to the Government; the government 
     <lb/>
     took that individual in amongst them; he 
     <lb/>
     proposed this arbitrary mode of carrying the 
     <lb/>
     scheme through with the assistance of a 
     <lb/>
     united following—and it is going to be done. 
     <lb/>
     The whole thing, I say again, proceeds from 
     <lb/>
     that individual, who has sown to the storm 
     <lb/>
     and reaped the whirlwind long enough, and 
     <lb/>
     does not intend to reap it any longer if he 
     <lb/>
     can help it. But my Opinion is that he is, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, unwittingly sowing a greater storm 
     <lb/>
     than ever, and that a whirlwmd will ensue of 
     <lb/>
     a most fearful character. It is just possible, 
     <lb/>
     however, that it will be found the most ad<lb break="no"/>vantageous measure for the country that has 
     <lb/>
     ever been introduced to the Legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     if so, the honorable member for South Ox<lb break="no"/>ford is entitled to the whole credit of sug<lb break="no"/>gesting it and taking the initiatory steps, with<lb break="no"/>out which it could never have been brought 
     <lb/>
     about; while on the other hand, if it should 
     <lb/>
     prove the most disastrous to the country 
     <lb/>
     that has ever been mooted, as I fear will be 
     <lb/>
     the case, unless submitted to the people m 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional way, that honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman will be entitled to, and wi11 receive, 
     <lb/>
     the most bitter condemnation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, I now come to the position which the 
     <lb/>
     measure now occupies before the House, and 
     <lb/>
     the relation in which I stand to this House 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with it. When the proposrtion 
     <lb/>
     was made to change the character of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of this House, I did everything in 
     <lb/>
     my power to prevent its becoming law; but 
     <lb/>
     all my eflorts, with those of a number of hon<lb break="no"/>orable colleagues, were of no avail. And those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who, on that occasion, agreed with 
     <lb/>
     me that it was a most unwise step to alter the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution in that respect, when they and I 
     <lb/>
     found we could do no more, we filed a protest

     Well, honorable gentlemen, the change took 
     <lb/>
     place in spite of all we could do. I condemned 
     <lb/>
     the proposed change on that occasion from 
     <lb/>
     my own personal views respecting it, for I 
     <lb/>
     had no constituency, as some honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen now have, to consult, and I now 
     <lb/>
     take exception in the same manner to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme before the House. I do not take 
     <lb/>
     such strong exception to the details of the 
     <lb/>
     measure as some honorable gentlemen do, be<lb break="no"/>cause when I reflect upon the number of indi<lb break="no"/>viduals that took part in the Conference, and 
     <lb/>
     the ability possessed by those individuals, I 
     <lb/>
     would not, as a matter of course, have the 
     <lb/>
    temerity to rise in my place and proceed to 
     <lb/>point out an error here and another error 
     <lb/>there, even if they seemed to me to be errors, 
     <lb/>as some of them do seem, unless I felt satis<lb break="no"/>fied not only that I possessed sounder judg<lb break="no"/>ment than they, but also that I was better 
     <lb/>acquainted with all the circumstances having 
     <lb/>a direct as well as indirect bearing upon the 
     <lb/>question. But, honorable gentlemen, let me 
     <lb/>ask who is going to be chiefly affected by 
     <lb/>those changes? Why, the people of Canada. 
     <lb/>And therefore it is that I ask, and all I ask 
     <lb/>is what appears to me to be only what is 
     <lb/>reasonable, as applied to the every day trans<lb break="no"/>actions of life, and that is, that those who are 
     <lb/>going to be affected should have some voice, 
     <lb/>at least, in these proceedings. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>This appears to me to be a sound mode of 
     <lb/>viewing the question ; and claiming to myself 
     <lb/>the right of exercising my own personal judg<lb break="no"/>ment, with the limited means of doing so 
     <lb/>which the Almighty has thought proper to 
     <lb/>place me in possession of, I feel it my duty to 
     <lb/>stand up in this House and record my views 
     <lb/>and my vote in such a manner as that, while 
     <lb/>I live, I may look back with some degree of 
     <lb/>satisfaction upon the view that I took and 
     <lb/>advocated upon the floor of this House.— 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I do not think some honorable 
     <lb/>gentlemen who have stood up and argued 
     <lb/>

     against continuing the elective principle in 
     <lb/>
     this House, can have done so with as much 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction to themselves as if they had not, 
     <lb/>
     on a previous occasion, pursued a diflerent 
     <lb/>
     course. I well recollect that when I found it 
     <lb/>
     was the determination to introduce the elect<lb break="no"/>ive principle in relation to the membership of 
     <lb/>
     this House, I said—Gentlemen, if the princi<lb break="no"/>ple is good in one case, it is good in another; 
     <lb/>
     let us make the Speaker elective. No, no, 
     <lb/>
     they said, that will not do ; that is republi<lb break="no"/>canism. They would not have the Speaker 
     <lb/>
     made elective. You know there was a little 
     <lb/>
     patronage at disposal by keeping the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of the Speaker in the Government. At 
     <lb/>
     that time I could make no progress in getting 
     <lb/>
     the House to go for making the Speaker elect<lb break="no"/>ive. Since then, however, they made the 
     <lb/>
     Speaker elective, and therefore the House 
     <lb/>
     must admit that I was right on that occasion. 
     <lb/>
     I opposed the House being made elective, but 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen made it elective, and 
     <lb/>
     now they are going to reinvest the appoint<lb break="no"/>ments in the Crown. So it is clear that when 
     <lb/>
     the first change was made I was also right on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     When the proposal was made to grant three 
     <lb/>
     millions of money to the Grand Trunk, I saw 
     <lb/>
     it was being done for political support, and I 
     <lb/>
     therefore opposed it. I also opposed the 
     <lb/>
     grants to the Arthabaska, and Port Hope and 
     <lb/>
     Peterborough railways, because I considered 
     <lb/>
     them only convenient methods of acquiring 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary support on the pretence of get<lb break="no"/>ting money for the Grand Trunk proper. 
     <lb/>
     Those roads were termed " feeders" for the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk, but I called them Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     "suckers." (Laughter.) I take to myself 
     <lb/>
     some little credit for having taken this view 
     <lb/>
     of those questions. I am willing to admit 
     <lb/>
     that the Grand Trunk is a very great benefit 
     <lb/>
     to the province in a material point of view, 
     <lb/>
     but I do believe that we paid very dearly for 
     <lb/>
     the whistle. (Laughter.) Having paid so 
     <lb/>
     dearly for that road, running, as it does, 
     <lb/>
     through the very finest portion of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, I am disposed to be very cautious about 
     <lb/>
     entering upon the construction of this Inter<lb break="no"/>colonial Railway. (Hear, hear.) I have often 
     <lb/>
     availed myself of a leaf out of the book of my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend (Hon. Mr. Ross) and I like 
     <lb/>
     to stick pretty close by him, because if I get 
     <lb/>
     off the track he has the happy faculty of put<lb break="no"/>ting me on again. Now, I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     him whether or not, in the remarks he made 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon, he stated that there had been 
     <lb/>
     no demand on the part of the people for an 
     <lb/>
     elective Legislative Council since the union.

     after observing, as I have done, how well the

     elective principle has worked in its application 
     <lb/>
     to this House. But I cannot understand how 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen could have entertained 
     <lb/>
     the view that great disaster would be the 
     <lb/>
     result of refusing to grant the elective princi<lb break="no"/>ple, and then inside of ten years, when their 
     <lb/>
     ideas had been put into practical effect, and 
     <lb/>
     had worked so admirably, they could again

     rise in this House and advocate a return to 
     <lb/>
     the system which then was so bad, and which 
     <lb/>
     the people were so determined to have altered.

     I desire to say that I am anxious to have the 
     <lb/>
     further consideration of the scheme in this 
     <lb/>
     House postponed for other reasons than those 
     <lb/>
     which I have gim expression to. My honor<lb break="no"/>able friend the gallant Knight, in his remarks 
     <lb/>
     last evening, made allusion to the burning of 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament buildings. I agree with him 
     <lb/>
     that that was a thing sincerely to be regretted. 
     <lb/>
     But he stated that, if the conservatives in the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council had had the prudence and 
     <lb/>
     good sense to exercise the amount of wisdom 
     <lb/>
     that they might have exercised, they would 
     <lb/>
     have put off the Rebellion Losses Bill another 
     <lb/>
     year, which course of proceeding would, in all 
     <lb/>
     probability, have prevented the deplorable 
     <lb/>
     occurrence to which he referred. Now, hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, I stand here to ask you to 
     <lb/>
     take the advice the honorable and gallant 
     <lb/>
     Knight has given, and apply it to the present 
     <lb/>
     scheme. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) You 
     <lb/>
     do not know what disastrous consequences 
     <lb/>
     may ensue, if this huge scheme is carried out 
     <lb/>
     without an appeal to the people in a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional manner. I do sincerely hope you will 
     <lb/>
     allow that powerful argument for delay ad<lb break="no"/>duced by the honorable and gallant Knight to 
     <lb/>
     bear upon this question. (Hear, hear.) This 
     <lb/>
     is a revolution, gentlemen, not a mere payment 
     <lb/>
     of a few thousand pounds, that is proposed. 
     <lb/>
     A revolution may be carried out by the exer<lb break="no"/>cise of political power, as well as by physical 
     <lb/>
     force. If the Government of the country is 
     <lb/>
     subverted, it makes no difference how it is 
     <lb/>
     done. It is a revolution all the same, no mat<lb break="no"/>ter how it is brought about. The effect is the 
     <lb/>
     same upon the country. The proposal is to 
     <lb/>
     sweep our present Constitution away, and sup<lb break="no"/>ply its place with another, which may be better 
     <lb/>
     or a great deal worse. As I see by the clock 
     <lb/>
     I have only five minutes left before six, and 
     <lb/>
     do not desire to speak at any greater length, I 
     <lb/>
     will have to draw my remarks to a close. 
     <lb/>
     (Cries of "go on," "go on.") Well, as honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen seem to desire it, I will make 
     <lb/>
     a few further remarks after dinner. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>A message was here received from the As<lb break="no"/>sembly, after which the House took a recess 
     <lb/>until 8 P.M. That hour having arrived, and 
     <lb/>the House having re-assembled— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DICK2">HON. MR. DICKSON</persName> said—The great 
     <lb/>
     reason for delay I conceive to be that it is 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the adaption of the resolutions of 
     <lb/>
     the Government to wipe out the present Con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the country without consulting the 
     <lb/>
     people affected thereby. I have not yet heard 
     <lb/>
     one single observation from the Government, 
     <lb/>
     or from any honorable member of this House, 
     <lb/>
     tending to show that there is any necessity for 
     <lb/>
   <cb/>

     the unseemly haste with which the matter is 
     <lb/>
     being pressed. I think it ought to be laid 
     <lb/>
     over until after the next general election; and 
     <lb/>
     I beg honorable gentlemen to observe that I 
     <lb/>
     make no suggestion respecting a dissolution of 
     <lb/>
     the other branch of the Legislature. But if 
     <lb/>
     there is really any necessity for haste, then 
     <lb/>
     there is a constitutional mode of hastening an 
     <lb/>
     appeal open to the Government. My honor<lb break="no"/>able friend opposite argued that the prero<lb break="no"/>gative of the Crown was taken away, in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the appointment of members of this 
     <lb/>
     House, without an appeal to the people, and 
     <lb/>
     that therefore no harm could result from 
     <lb/>
     taking away the boon then given them without 
     <lb/>
     any demand on their part or any appeal to 
     <lb/>
     them. Gentlemen, we were then experimen<lb break="no"/>talists, and the experiment succeeded well. 
     <lb/>
     Then why not stick to it ? We improved on 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution on that occasion. And you 
     <lb/>
     may give the people privileges they do not ask, 
     <lb/>
     very safely. But what is now proposed to be 
     <lb/>
     done? It is proposed to take that power from 
     <lb/>
     them without consulting them, and I hold that 
     <lb/>
     such a thing ought not to be done. Having 
     <lb/>
     raised them to the highest state of political 
     <lb/>
     exaltation, without their even asking for it, 
     <lb/>
     it is now proposed to reduce them, almost 
     <lb/>
     without notice, to the lowest possible position 
     <lb/>
     of political degradation. It is the main prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of the Government under which we live, 
     <lb/>
     that the people, through their representatives, 
     <lb/>
     shall be consulted as to the composition of 
     <lb/>
     their Government. As for a mutual under<lb break="no"/>standing between the electors and the elected, 
     <lb/>
     in relation to this scheme, there is none what<lb break="no"/>ever, and I have thus urged delay because I 
     <lb/>
     do not think there is any need of hurry. 
     <lb/>
     There is a constitutional mode of ascertaining 
     <lb/>
     the views of the people, and it ought to be 
     <lb/>
     made use of. But honorable gentlemen say, 
     <lb/>
     " Oh, don't throw out any hint about bringing 
     <lb/>
     on a general election before the proper period; 
     <lb/>
     we have had elections enough during the 
     <lb/>
     past five years." Why, honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     what is proposed to be done by the passing of 
     <lb/>
     these resolutions? Will their adoption not 
     <lb/>
     bring on a new election inside of eighteen 
     <lb/>
     months? There is another observation I 
     <lb/>
     desire to make with reference to honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen endeavoring to obtain the views of 
     <lb/>
     their constituents by knocking at their doors, 
     <lb/>
     and asking whether they favor the first. reso<lb break="no"/>lution and the second, and so on, through the 
     <lb/>
     entire list. I do not think that even by such 
     <lb/>
     a proceeding you could arrive at a thorough 
     <lb/>
     understanding of the views of your constitu<lb break="no"/>ents. The common way of doing it is for a 
     <lb/>

     member to call his constituents together in a 
     <lb/>
    large room in some hotel or other building, 
     <lb/>and lay the whole subject before them, express<lb break="no"/>ing his opinion on the various clauses as he 
     <lb/>proceeds. In so doing he is more than apt to 
     <lb/>imbue their minds with the same view that he 
     <lb/>himself holds. I have only heard one member 
     <lb/>allude to having received the resolutions, and 
     <lb/>he merely opened and sealed them up again in 
     <lb/> consequence of their being marked " Private," 
     <lb/>  without endeavouring to ascertain the views of 
     <lb/>his constituents. I do hope that some course 
     <lb/>of procedure can be devised by which the spirit 
     <lb/>- of the amendment proposed by my honorable 
     <lb/>friend from the Niagara Division may be 
     <lb/>' carried into effect. The amendment simply 
     <lb/>states—

     That upon a matter of such great importance

     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName> said—I would 
     <lb/>
     like, honorable gentlemen, to continue the 
     <lb/>
     debate in that excellent and happy spirit in 
     <lb/>
     which my honorable friend who has just sat 
     <lb/>
     down has addressed the House. I envy my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend very much for the possession 
     <lb/>
    of that happy faculty of amusing and instruct<lb break="no"/>ing the House in combination. I am some<lb break="no"/>what grieved to feel obliged to call the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of honorable members to that which is, 
     <lb/>perhaps, more of a business character and less 
     <lb/>interesting than the remarks which fell from 
     <lb/>my honorable friend. I must say that I very 
     <lb/>much regret that my honorable friend should 
     <lb/>have thought that on this particular amendment 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     being proposed, it was his duty to come to 
     <lb/>
     its support, because it is evident to my own 
     <lb/>
     mind, and must also be so to every honorable 
     <lb/>
     member present, that my honorable friend, 
     <lb/>
     while giving his support to the amendment, 
     <lb/>
     entertains very different views from those 
     <lb/>
     which were enunciated by the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Niagara, who moved it. My honor<lb break="no"/>able friend says, " If there is to be delay, let it 
     <lb/>
     be a substantial delay; let it be such a delay 
     <lb/>
     as will ensure a dissolution of parliament; 
     <lb/>
     such a delay as will enable the people to speak 
     <lb/>
     in that manner, and in that manner only, that 
     <lb/>
     is known to the British Constitution." I can 
     <lb/>
     respect that sentiment. There is something 
     <lb/>
     real in an argument based on that foundation. 
     <lb/>
     I do him the justice to believe that he takes 
     <lb/>
     that view with a sincere desire that the delay 
     <lb/>
     should not militate against the scheme, but 
     <lb/>
     that it should be adopted by the people when 
     <lb/>
     referred to them. But, honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     contrast that view with the idea suggested by 
     <lb/>
     the honorable gentleman who moved this re<lb break="no"/>solution. What view does he take? Not 
     <lb/>
     that there should be such a delay as would 
     <lb/>
     enable the people to express themselves in the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which Great Britain and all her 
     <lb/>
     colonies speak, but in that sort of way which, 
     <lb/>
     as my honorable friend (Hon. Mr. DICKSON) 
     <lb/>
     has graphically described, is more nearly 
     <lb/>
     allied to the peddling of clocks than to any<lb break="no"/>thing connected with British constitutional 
     <lb/>
     procedure. What does the honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man say ? He says, give us twenty days or 
     <lb/>
     a month. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">HON. Mr. CURRIE</persName>—I said that was the 
     <lb/>
     least time I would ask. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>—What could be 
     <lb/>
     done with twenty days or a month's delay ? 
     <lb/>
     Is it possible for the people to speak in any 
     <lb/>
     constitutional way in twenty days or a month? 
     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman knows very well that 
     <lb/>
     it is not possible, and that under no system of 
     <lb/>
     government could such a plan, as his mind has 
     <lb/>
     suggested, by any possibility be sanctioned by 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature. Would the people of New 
     <lb/>
     York state, or any of the States of the Union, 
     <lb/>
     sanction a proceeding of that kind ? On the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, they would adopt the course at once 
     <lb/>
     of having the scheme submitted to a direct 
     <lb/>
     vote of the people. If you adopt the British 
     <lb/>
     constitutional way, then there will have to be 
     <lb/>
     a dissolution of Parliament; but, if you adopt 
     <lb/>
     the American system, the people will be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to vote " yea or nay " on the scheme as 
     <lb/>
     it stands. Let it be expressed in one way or 
     <lb/>
     the other, fairly and constitutionally, in ac<lb break="no"/>cordance with our system of government

     My honorable friend does not contemplate 
     <lb/>
     that. He contemplates a postponement of 
     <lb/>
     the subject, in some way or other, for twenty 
     <lb/>
     days or a month, and I am sorry that my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend, who spoke last, should have 
     <lb/>
     felt himelf called upon to adopt a scheme so 
     <lb/>
     entirely contrary to what I know are his views 
     <lb/>
     as to what is correct and proper, according to 
     <lb/>
     those constitutional and British views which 
     <lb/>
     he entertains. I am sorry that he should 
     <lb/>
     have been led to adopt a scheme which is evi<lb break="no"/>dently not advocated by him from the same 
     <lb/>
     motives as those which actuate my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from Niagara. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DICK2">HON. Mr. DICKSON</persName>—I approve of the 
     <lb/>
     resolution as it stands, and I entertain the 
     <lb/>
     views that I have expressed. I have always 
     <lb/>
     held that a general election was the proper con<lb break="no"/>stitutional mode of learning the people's views, 
     <lb/>
     and I distinctly stated that I did not care to 
     <lb/>
     have a short delay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CURR2">Hon. Mr. CURRIE</persName>—All I suggested was 
     <lb/>
     that the Government might at least give twenty 
     <lb/>
     days or a month, if they would grant no more. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, I desire to get what my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend Mr. DICKSON has asked. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>—Then I do hope 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend will withdraw his sup<lb break="no"/>port to the amendment, when he sees that he 
     <lb/>
     does not concur with the mover of it, who 
     <lb/>
     evidently contemplates some other course 
     <lb/>
     than is known to the British Constitution for 
     <lb/>
     ascertaining the views of the people—for in<lb break="no"/>stance, by members going from door to door, 
     <lb/>
     or by holding meetings in convenient places 
     <lb/>
     and making themselves agreeable to their con<lb break="no"/>stituents by indulging in hospitalities, &amp;e. I 
     <lb/>
     am quite confident that is not the idea which 
     <lb/>
     my honorable friend opposite entertains; nor, 
     <lb/>
     I am satisfied, is it the view which any hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman of this House can entertain 
     <lb/>
     who is desirous of promoting Confederation 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces—that these resolutions, im<lb break="no"/>portant as they are, and necessary as it is that 
     <lb/>
     we should arrive at some conclusion in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to them, should be laid aside until my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend from Niagara goes about 
     <lb/>
     from door to door throughout his large and 
     <lb/>
     intelligent constituency, knocking at each and 
     <lb/>
    asking the views of the electors on each sep<lb break="no"/>arate, resolution. My honorable friend is 
     <lb/>charged with the duty of representing his con<lb break="no"/>stituency on the floor of this House, and it is 
     <lb/>to be supposed that he is well capable of re<lb break="no"/>presenting them in point of intellect and 
     <lb/>good judgment, when he is called upon 
     <lb/>to say whether or not he believes the scheme, 
     <lb/>as a whole, to be a desirable one for the 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
         

     country. (Hear, hear.) But hs seems 
     <lb/>
     to ignore all that. He does not seem willing 
     <lb/>
     to pronounce his judgment upon this scheme. 
     <lb/>
     He will not say that it is so objectionable that 
     <lb/>
     he will vote against it on the merits of the 
     <lb/>
     case. If he is unable to come to a decision, 
     <lb/>
     he ought to resign his position, and give place 
     <lb/>
     to some one who can come to a decision. But 
     <lb/>
     look at the position of a man who says in ef<lb break="no"/>fect, " I have no opinion of my own; if the 
     <lb/>
     people whom I represent are favorable to 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, I have not a word to say ; I will 
     <lb/>
     vote for it to please them, though I disapprove 
     <lb/>
     of it." Gentlemen, let him give his consti<lb break="no"/>tuency the benefit of his best judgment, and 
     <lb/>
     consider whether, reflecting upon the fact that 
     <lb/>
     there are five different provmces to be con<lb break="no"/>sulted, and constituencies upon constituencies 
     <lb/>
     to be canvassed, that which he desires can be 
     <lb/>
     ascertained in any better way than by this 
     <lb/>
     House, considering itself a fair representation 
     <lb/>
     of the sentiment of Canada, coming to an im<lb break="no"/>mediate decision. He says his constituents 
     <lb/>
     have not charged him with the duty of alter<lb break="no"/>ing the Constitution. Well, but he is charged 
     <lb/>
     with the duty of exercising his best judgment 
     <lb/>
     upon every subject brought before this 
     <lb/>
     House. We are not here for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     altering the Constitution. We have not the 
     <lb/>
     power to alter the Constitution if we desired 
     <lb/>
     to do so, but we have the sacred duty incum<lb break="no"/>bent upon us of expressing our views in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to such alterations as may be considered 
     <lb/>
     advantageous to the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Do these resolutions alter the Constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the country? Not at all. They merely state 
     <lb/>
     that such alterations are desirable. The Con<lb break="no"/>stitution itself can onl be changed by the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial authorities. We are not exceeding 
     <lb/>
     what our French Canadian friends called the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">mandat</hi> with which we are charged. We. 
     <lb/>
     have no power to alter the Constitution, but 
     <lb/>
     we have the power of expressing our views in 
     <lb/>
     an address to Her Majesty, which it is pro<lb break="no"/>posed to adopt in all the legislatures, stating 
     <lb/>
     that such and such changes would, in our 
     <lb/>
     opinion, prove advantageous to the country. 
     <lb/>
     We are exercising exactly the duties which 
     <lb/>
     are incumbent upon us. We are giving to 
     <lb/>
     our constituents the benefit of our experience 
     <lb/>
     and honest convictions upon the topics which 
     <lb/>
     are committed to our charge, and which events 
     <lb/>
     force upon our attention. Has not the House, 
     <lb/>
     on previous occasions, adopted resolutions, the 
     <lb/>
     effect of which has been to bring about 
     <lb/>
     changes of the Constitution ? And has it 
     <lb/>
     ever before been argued that this House had 
     <lb/>
     no right to debate such resolutions? Nothing 
     <lb/>

     of the kind. The first alteration asked for, 
     <lb/>
     was for the purpose of allowing the use of the 
     <lb/>
     French language in the House of Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     Honorable gentlemen might have said then 
     <lb/>
     that they had not the power to ask for such a 
     <lb/>
     change, but such an idea was never mooted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">AN HON. MEMBER</persName>—It was carried 
     <lb/>
     unanimously. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR. CAMPBELL</persName>—I had not the 
     <lb/>
     honor of having a seat in this House at the 
     <lb/>
     time, but I am happy to hear that it was 
     <lb/>
     unanimously carried. Next, a change was 
     <lb/>
     asked for in the composition of this House. 
     <lb/>
     This House was at one time nominative, and 
     <lb/>
     was, in 1856, made elective. Was that not a 
     <lb/>
     change of the Constitution ? Nobody, how<lb break="no"/>ever, urged at that time the idea that this 
     <lb/>
     House had no power to pass such a resolution. 
     <lb/>
     We stand exactly in the same position now, 
     <lb/>
     and it seems to me a most futile and illogical 
     <lb/>
     argumentto say that we have not the power 
     <lb/>
     to do what it is proposed to do in passing 
     <lb/>
     those resolutions, that is, to pray the Queen 
     <lb/>
     so to change the Constitution of this province 
     <lb/>
     that we may unite in one Government with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces of British North America. 
     <lb/>
     I am quite satisfied that, when honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen reflect upon it, they will see that they 
     <lb/>
     are not in any way exceeding the powers 
     <lb/>
     committed to them by their constituencies. 
     <lb/>
     My honorable friend from Niagara suggests 
     <lb/>
     this amendment in a spirit that is compara<lb break="no"/>tively poor to that in which it is supported 
     <lb/>
     by my honorable friend opposite. He says 
     <lb/>
     he is in favor of the union, but is opposed to 
     <lb/>
     some of the details. It is painful to me that 
     <lb/>
     any honorable gentleman who professes a desire 
     <lb/>
     to advance the union, should yet shelter him<lb break="no"/>self, in opposing it, under an objection to some 
     <lb/>
     of the details. Does my honorable friend se<lb break="no"/>riously propose to submit to the country all 
     <lb/>
     those various details ? Can he imagine that 
     <lb/>
     he could get an intelligent expression from 
     <lb/>
     any part of the country on those details? 
     <lb/>
     All he could get would be a general opinion 
     <lb/>
     in favor of Confederation, and we are all sa<lb break="no"/>tisfied that he would have that. I believe 
     <lb/>
     there are but two or three honorable mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this House who are really opposed to 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. Take ten thousand people 
     <lb/>
     from the country, and you will find nine 
     <lb/>
     thousand of every ten in favor of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation.

     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Several HON. MEMBERS</persName>—No, no.

     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     people, but I am in as good a position to speak

     for Upper Canada as any other honorable

     <lb/>
     that the people of Upper Canada are almost

     unanimously in favor of Confederation. I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that, if the question wergaput before 
     <lb/>
     the people by means of a general election, 
     <lb/>
     there would be an unanimous vote in Upper 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>—My honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from Niagara says " Hear, hear." My 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend cavils at every statement 
     <lb/>
     which is made, attempts to throw doubt and 
     <lb/>
     distrust upon the figures which have been 
     <lb/>
     produced in advocacy of the measure, and has 
     <lb/>
     not restrained himself from using every method 
     <lb/>
     of opposition which his imagination could in<lb break="no"/>vent cr his ability turn to account. I must 
     <lb/>
     say that I can hardly believe an honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to be in favor of the scheme, who 
     <lb/>
     takes every opportunity to attack it, and, when 
     <lb/>
     accused of hostility , shelters himself under ob<lb break="no"/>jections to the details. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>
     shows to me that his feelings are not sincere, 
     <lb/>
     but that he desires to upset the very founda<lb break="no"/>tions on which Confederation rests, not perhaps 
     <lb/>
     because he is opposed to Confederation in the 
     <lb/>
     abstract, or a Confederation such as he would 
     <lb/>
     like to see established, but because he desires 
     <lb/>
     to thwart and defeat the efforts of those who 
     <lb/>
     have been honestly and industriously engaged 
     <lb/>
     in bringing about the scheme which is now 
     <lb/>
     before this House. I say, honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     if the people could express their opinions as 
     <lb/>
     we may express ours to-night, they would all 
     <lb/>
     concur in the first resolution. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Well, ge ntlemen, it being granted that we are 
     <lb/>
     all in favor of union, how are the details to be 
     <lb/>
     settled? Is it possible that the nearly four 
     <lb/>
     millions of people who compose the provinces 
     <lb/>
     to be affected by the union, should meet 
     <lb/>
     together <hi rendition="simple:italic">en masse</hi> and settle those details? It 
     <lb/>
     is not possible, and those who argue that the 
     <lb/>
     scheme should originate with the people, 
     <lb/>
     know very well that it is not possible. Well, 
     <lb/>
     then, could the parliaments of all these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces assemble together and agree upon a 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation? Look at the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties that we have to encounter on every 
     <lb/>
     point of the details in carrying the scheme 
     <lb/>
     through this House, and judge for yourselves 
     <lb/>
     whether the parliaments of all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     could meet ther, and originate and decide 
     <lb/>
     upon the details of Confederation. There is 
     <lb/>
     no other practicable way than that delegates 
     <lb/>
     should meet together as they have done, and 
     <lb/>
     frame resolutions on the subject, upon which 
     <lb/>
    

            <pb n="293" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0293.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">293</fw>


     the act constituting the union could be found<lb break="no"/>ed. Honorable gentlemen have asked who 
     <lb/>
     authorised those delegates to meet together for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of framing those resolutions. 
     <lb/>
     Honorable gentlemen know very well that the 
     <lb/>
     presœt Government of Canada was formed for 
     <lb/>
     the very purpose of considering and submitting 
     <lb/>
     a scheme of this kind. My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Niagara again takes shelter under the 
     <lb/>
     statement that what the Government proposed 
     <lb/>
     to do was to bring down a scheme for the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of Canada alone, and that the bring<lb break="no"/>ing of all the provinces into the Confederation 
     <lb/>
     was only a secondary idea. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman knows very well that that statement 
     <lb/>
     of the case is a mere pretence. Everybody 
     <lb/>
     knew that the Government would endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     overcome the dificulties which presented them<lb break="no"/>selves in working the government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     either by one project or by the other. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman has quoted from the 
     <lb/>
     Speech from the Throne delivered at the close 
     <lb/>
    of last session, in which an allusion was made 
     <lb/>to the formation of a Federal union between 
     <lb/>the two sections of this province, and not to 
     <lb/>a Federal union of all the provinces. Why 
     <lb/>does he not refer to and quote from the Speech 
     <lb/>from the Throne at the opening of this session ? 
     <lb/>My honorable friend will find there, and I 
     <lb/>suppose he will place the expression on even 
     <lb/>terms with the other, the following :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     At the close of the last session of Parliament 
     <lb/>
     I informed you that it was my intention, in con<lb break="no"/>junction with my ministers, to prepare and submit 
     <lb/>
     to you a measure for the solution of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional problem, the discussion of which has for 
     <lb/>
     some years agitated this province. A careful 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the general position of British 
     <lb/>
     North America induced the conviction that the 
     <lb/>
     cicumstances of the times afforded the opportu<lb break="no"/>nity, not merely for the settlement of a question 
     <lb/>
     of provincial politics, but also for the simultaneous 
     <lb/>
     creation of a new nationality. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, my honorable friend says in effect 
     <lb/>
     that we were not right, when the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     presented itself of endeavcring to carry out 
     <lb/>
     the idea, in seizing upon it, and endeavoring 
     <lb/>
     to combine these provinces in one nationality, 
     <lb/>
     under the common flag of Great Britain, and 
     <lb/>
     under the rule of a Viceroy of the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown. Every honorable gentleman feels in 
     <lb/>
     his heart that we were not only right and 
     <lb/>
     patriotic in thus assembling, but that we were 
     <lb/>
     doing that which was promised to the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of this province at the close of last 
     <lb/>
     session of Parliament. Honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     I am surprised' and grieved that my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend from Niagara, whom I know to be a 
     <lb/>
     patriotic and loyal subject of Her Majesty, 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
      

     does not feel it his duty to unite with us in 
     <lb/>
     bringin about that which is so dear to all of 
     <lb/>
     us—a closer connection with the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try, and a better means of perpetuating British 
     <lb/>
     institutions on this continent. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     My honorable friend says the whole scheme is 
     <lb/>
     characterized by concessions to the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. Why, honorable gentlemen, place 
     <lb/>
     him in any portion of the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     and let him listen to the opposition that is 
     <lb/>
     made there to the scheme, and he will find 
     <lb/>
     that the whole cry of those who, like him, do 
     <lb/>
     not reflect on the necessity of yielding some<lb break="no"/>thing for the common good, is, that everything 
     <lb/>
     has been conceded to Canada. It is said, " We 
     <lb/>
     are going to be united with a province which 
     <lb/>
     is infinitely beyond us in point of population 
     <lb/>
     and wealth, and whose public men are able to 
     <lb/>
     command, by their ability, a much larger 
     <lb/>
     influence than our public men." They profess 
     <lb/>
     to believe that they are coming under the 
     <lb/>
     shadow of Canada, and that everything which 
     <lb/>
     the desire for themselves wil be trampled 
     <lb/>
     under foot. My honorable friend, forgetting 
     <lb/>
     those duties which he owes to the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and forgetting the duty which he owes as a 
     <lb/>
     patriotic citizen to his country, contents him<lb break="no"/>self with finding fault with the details of a 
     <lb/>
     scheme which he believes will be for the benefit 
     <lb/>
     of the country, and picks holes in every part 
     <lb/>
     of these details which he does not happen fully 
     <lb/>
     to understand. He not only complains that 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada have not been consulted, 
     <lb/>
     but that in every respect the interests of Can<lb break="no"/>ada have been bartered away. Does he forget 
     <lb/>
     that the members of the Government all love 
     <lb/>
     their country, and have interests as great and 
     <lb/>
     as dear to them as the rest of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada? Is it likely that my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     at the head of the Government, the honorable 
     <lb/>
     and gallant Knight, would give up everything 
     <lb/>
    that is dear to his race and to the people of 
     <lb/>this province? Is it likely that any of us 
     <lb/>would ruthlessly throw away any advantage 
     <lb/>which we could reasonably retain ? On the 
     <lb/>contrary, if my honorable friend could be 
     <lb/>brought to look upon the measure with that 
     <lb/>liberality which ought to characterize a public 
     <lb/>man, he would concede that, although we had 
     <lb/>to give away some things, we did that which 
     <lb/>was best for the interests of our country. Let 
     <lb/>him find himself surrounded, as we were by 
     <lb/>diverse interests—peculiarities here, prejudices 
     <lb/>there, and strong interests in the other direc<lb break="no"/>tion, and let him produce, if he can, a scheme 
     <lb/>which, on the whole, is more advantageous to 
     <lb/>the people of this province, or which promises 
     <lb/>better for the country at large than that which 
     <lb/>

     is now on the table of this House. Let him 
     <lb/>
     do this, and then I will forgive him for the 
     <lb/>
     illiberality which he exhibits towards those who 
     <lb/>
     have honestly endeavored, to the best of their 
     <lb/>
     united ability, to arrange the scheme which is 
     <lb/>
     now under your consideration. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I could forgive my honorable friend altogether, 
     <lb/>
     if, like my honorable friend opposite, he took 
     <lb/>
     the ground that the scheme ought to be delayed 
     <lb/>
     until after a general election. But, instead of 
     <lb/>
     that, he leaves no stone untumed to prejudice 
     <lb/>
     this House against the measure. It seems to 
     <lb/>
     me-that if he could prejudice the House suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently against it to insure its defeat, as a 
     <lb/>
     whole, he would leave no stone unturned to 
     <lb/>
     accomplish it. So far from showing that he 
     <lb/>
     is in favor of the scheme, I cannot for one 
     <lb/>
     moment imagine how any one can believe him 
     <lb/>
     to be a sincere friend of Confederation under 
     <lb/>
     any circumstances. It is all very well to say, 
     <lb/>
     " I am in favor of the scheme, but opposed to 
     <lb/>
     some of the details." Was not every one of 
     <lb/>
     those details tested and tried in all its bearings, 
     <lb/>
     so far as such a thing was possible, by gentle<lb break="no"/>men as intelligent and well informed upon the 
     <lb/>
     subjects embraced as any honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     in this House ? Every honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     now listening to me knows very well that it 
     <lb/>
     was not possible to adopt a scheme that could 
     <lb/>
     not be found fault with. No matter what 
     <lb/>
     scheme was put upon the table of this House, 
     <lb/>
     even if my honorable friend had been able to 
     <lb/>
     submit a scheme infinitely superior to this, 
     <lb/>
     does anybody believe that certain honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen in this House would have supported 
     <lb/>
     it? The resolutions may be objectionable 
     <lb/>
     here and objectionable there, but it is for 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen to consider all the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances out of which they have grown, 
     <lb/>
     and consider whether, under those circum<lb break="no"/>stances, they ought not to be adopted as a whole 
     <lb/>
     by the House. Honorable gentlemen say, 
     <lb/>
     where is the advantage to be gained by Canada 
     <lb/>
     from Confederation ? Well now, can any 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen in his senses believe 
     <lb/>
     that the removal of the obstacles to inter<lb break="no"/>course between the provinces, the doing away 
     <lb/>
     with the customs duties, and the developing 
     <lb/>
     the trade of the St. Lawrence, is no advantage 
     <lb/>
     to Canada ? Can it be said that to open up 
     <lb/>
     commerce with three millions of people along 
     <lb/>
     the St. Lawrence and the lakes will be of no 
     <lb/>
     advantage to the people of the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ? Can any Briton, advocating as he does 
     <lb/>
     the continuation of our connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, say—" I would rather be 
     <lb/>
     alone, be an Upper Canadian and be left to 
     <lb/>
     myself, and that my fellow colonists be left to 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     take care of themselves." Then honor<lb break="no"/>able friend asks: " Where is the additional 
     <lb/>
     military strength ?" Does my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     pretend to deny that there is no additional 
     <lb/>
     strength in union over isolation ? Does any 
     <lb/>
     man pretend to say that eight hundred or a 
     <lb/>
     thousand men belonging to a regiment are 
     <lb/>
     just as strong in units as when they are com<lb break="no"/>bined in a regiment and directed by the in<lb break="no"/>tellect of one man ? And just so the forces 
     <lb/>
     of all these provinces are comparatively weak 
     <lb/>
     in their present isolated state. If we could 
     <lb/>
     say to the United States that we had the con<lb break="no"/>trol of four millions of people to guard our 
     <lb/>
     frontier and repel attack, would not that form 
     <lb/>
     a strong barrier of defence ? Would that he 
     <lb/>
     no weapon in the hands of a government de<lb break="no"/>sirous to avert an appeal to force of arms ? 
     <lb/>
     It is the strength of a large number of people 
     <lb/>
     wielded by one mind, affording a power vastly 
     <lb/>
     superior to that which Canada alone. could 
     <lb/>
     bring into the field, and giving the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, when negotiating, an opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     point to what might possibly result from that 
     <lb/>
     power being called into active service. How 
     <lb/>
     can men be so lost to all that is true and use<lb break="no"/>ful and patriotic as to oppose a union of the 
     <lb/>
     powers of defence, and to oppose a scheme 
     <lb/>
     which is alone likely to afford the means of 
     <lb/>
     maintaining, for any long period of years, that 
     <lb/>
     connection with Great Britain which we all 
     <lb/>
     regard as so valuable ? My honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Niagara took occasion, in the course of 
     <lb/>
     his remarks, to throw doubt upon one or two 
     <lb/>
     of my statements, and particularly in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the value of the mineral deposits of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I stated that I could satisfy the 
     <lb/>
     House that there were mineral deposits in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland of a valuable character. I 
     <lb/>
     will not detain the House by reading it at 
     <lb/>
     length, but I hold in my hand a copy of a 
     <lb/>
     report that was made on that colony in 1840, 
     <lb/>
     stating that these deposits consisted of galena, 
     <lb/>
     gypsum, marble, gold, iron, copper, etc. 
     <lb/>
     There are most important lead mines in oper<lb break="no"/>ation, and Professor Shephard states that 
     <lb/>
     he saw 3,500 pounds of pure galena thrown 
     <lb/>
     from a vein at a single blast. He goes on in 
     <lb/>
     this report to describe the very convenient 
     <lb/>
     position of the mines, showing that they 
     <lb/>
     be approached very closely by vessels drawing 
     <lb/>
     twelve or fifteen feet of water. This report 
     <lb/>
     plainly shows that my honorable friend was 
     <lb/>
     mistaken in supposing that there were no 
     <lb/>
     valuable minerals in Newfoundland. But sup<lb break="no"/>pose, for the sake of argument, that there were 
     <lb/>
     no minerals there; suppose we were simply giv<lb break="no"/>ing the Province of Newfoundland $150,000 a 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="295" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0295.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">295</fw>

     year for the purpose of getting that island into 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation, would it not be better to 
     <lb/>
     have the Confederation complete than to refuse 
     <lb/>
     agree to that condition ? One would suppose, 
     <lb/>
     from the manner in which some honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen treat the question, that the various 
     <lb/>
     sums to be annually paid to the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were to be paid by Canada alone; but 
     <lb/>
     it is nothing of the kind,-they are to be paid 
     <lb/>
     by the whole Confederation, the population 
     <lb/>
     receiving the benefit contributing as much per 
     <lb/>
     head to the amount as that of the Province 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. What does my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     suppose the Province of Newfoundland gives 
     <lb/>
     up to the Confederation in return for the 
     <lb/>
     $150,000 ? It transfers to us the whole right 
     <lb/>
     of property in its unsold lands, and the whole 
     <lb/>
     of its general revenue. In 1862, it had a 
     <lb/>
     gross revenue of $480,000, only $5,000 of 
     <lb/>
     which was from local sources, and it is calcu<lb break="no"/>lated that the colony will bring a revenue of 
     <lb/>
     $430,000 per annum to the Confederate 
     <lb/>
     purse, while the total amount it will receive 
     <lb/>
     will be $369,200 per annum out of which to 
     <lb/>
     defray its local expenses . Is there an thing 
     <lb/>
     so marvellously outrageous in that? In ad<lb break="no"/>dition to the fact that Newfoundland will pay 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation $430,000, and receive 
     <lb/>
     $369,000, we have a complete yielding to the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government of all her territorial 
     <lb/>
     sources of revenue. And it is with all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Each of them will contribute to the 
     <lb/>
     general revenue, or to the Confederate purse, 
     <lb/>
     more than they will receive from it, so that 
     <lb/>
     the revenue of the whole country will show a 
     <lb/>
     surplus. The honorable gentleman from Nia<lb break="no"/>gara evidently contemplates much more by 
     <lb/>
     his amendment than my honorable friend op<lb break="no"/>posite, who has so ably supported it, contem<lb break="no"/>plates. My honorable friend who supported 
     <lb/>
     the amendment contemplates a delay until 
     <lb/>
     there shall be an expression of the people 
     <lb/>
     taken through a dissolution of Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     Well now, how can a dissolution of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment be brought about in a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     manner? Suppose this scheme to receive the 
     <lb/>
     so of an immense majority of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     House, as it plainly does, and also of a la 
     <lb/>
     majority in this House, how, I would ask, 
     <lb/>
     under our system of government, can a disso<lb break="no"/>lution be brought about? A dissolution is 
     <lb/>
     unknown to the British Constitution, as car<lb break="no"/>ried out in this province, except when a 
     <lb/>
     measure, originated by the Government, does 
     <lb/>
     not receive the support of Parliament. Re<lb break="no"/>ceiving the support of more than two-thirds 
     <lb/>
    of the representatives of the people, as the 
     <lb/>present Government does, how is it possible 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
         

     that Parliament could be dissolved to suit the 
     <lb/>
     views of a small minority ? That is ask<lb break="no"/>ing quite too much, even if it were pos<lb break="no"/>sible to grant it. (Hear, hear.) What, there<lb break="no"/>fore, do honorable gentlemen ask, when they 
     <lb/>
     ask that the scheme be submitted to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple ? They ask us as a Government to leave 
     <lb/>
     that which we consider the safe, sound, British 
     <lb/>
     constitutional mode of procedure, and resort 
     <lb/>
     to the American system of obtaining assent 
     <lb/>
     to constitutional alterations, by taking the 
     <lb/>
     votes, yea and nay, of the individual members 
     <lb/>
     of the whole community. What sort of a 
     <lb/>
     conclusion could he arrived at by that mode 
     <lb/>
     of procedure? Is it possible that any hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of this House desires that the people 
     <lb/>
     should have the opportunity of saying yea or 
     <lb/>
     nay to each clause of these resolutions ? I 
     <lb/>
     am satisfied that that is not what my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend from Niagara desires, because he 
     <lb/>
     only asks for a delay of a month; and my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend opposite does not desire it, 
     <lb/>
     because he knows the British Constitution and 
     <lb/>
     loves it too well to contemplate such a course 
     <lb/>
     for a moment. What conclusion, then, can we 
     <lb/>
     arrive at, but that those who oppose the 
     <lb/>
     passage of the scheme through this case, by 
     <lb/>
     moving and supporting amendments to it, are 
     <lb/>
     desirous of defeating it, and make those 
     <lb/>
     amendments for that purpose ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I am satisfied, from the best information I can 
     <lb/>
     obtain, that the passage of the amendment 
     <lb/>
     would have a very great tendency towards de<lb break="no"/>feating the measure. It has to be agreed to 
     <lb/>
     in both branches of all the other legislatures, 
     <lb/>
    and then in the Imperial Parliament. All the 
     <lb/>other legislatures are now waiting upon the 
     <lb/>action of this House. They are waiting to 
     <lb/>know whether honorable gentlemen of the 
     <lb/>Legislative Council of Canada concur in the 
     <lb/>scheme—whether you are satisfied to put on 
     <lb/>one side small objections to minor matters of 
     <lb/>detail—to put to one side your individual 
     <lb/>opinions on this point and on that point, and 
     <lb/>give it your support as a whole. Every person 
     <lb/>who reflects upon the subject must be satisfied 
     <lb/>that that would have to be done under any 
     <lb/>circumstances. Do you desire to have a union 
     <lb/>of all the British American Provinces, or do 
     <lb/>you desire to remain as you are ? That is the 
     <lb/>issue. For myself, I feel that our connection 
     <lb/>with the Mother Country cannot be maintained 
     <lb/>for any great length of time without such a 
     <lb/>union. What have we found in the utterances 
     <lb/>of the public men of England from year to 
     <lb/>year ? Have we not found them asserting, 
     <lb/>with more and more vehemence every year, 
     <lb/>that we were not doing our duty on this side 
     <lb/>

     of the water in relation to our defences? If 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain should get into a war with the 
     <lb/>
     United States from circumstances over which 
     <lb/>
     we had no control, still our destinies were 
     <lb/>
     linked in with those of the great empire of 
     <lb/>
     which we form a part, and it is our duty, 
     <lb/>
     under all circumstances, to do something more 
     <lb/>
     than we have yet done, to prepare for events 
     <lb/>
     that may happen from one cause or another. 
     <lb/>
     But suppose that during the past summer 
     <lb/>
     armed forces from the United States had en<lb break="no"/>tered Canada in pursuit of raiders escaping 
     <lb/>
     into this province from the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     border, as they might have done had not Gen. 
     <lb/>
     DIX'S order been withdrawn; and had we 
     <lb/>
     found that our integrity as a member of the 
     <lb/>
     great Empire was not respected, and Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain had coincided with the views of our 
     <lb/>
     Government and declared war against the 
     <lb/>
     United States, because that country had exer<lb break="no"/>cised liberties in one of her provinces to which 
     <lb/>
     no foreign power was entitled, where then 
     <lb/>
     would have been the cause of the war ? It 
     <lb/>
     would have lain in the assertion of the right 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this province to maintain the 
     <lb/>
     position of an integral portion of the British 
     <lb/>
     Empire. Well, supposing the cause of a war 
     <lb/>
     with that nation to have been elsewhere, still 
     <lb/>
     we must partake with the Empire in upholding 
     <lb/>
     its integrity , and must stand or fall with that 
     <lb/>
     Empire. Shall we say that we will contribute 
     <lb/>
     nothing towards our defence except to keep 
     <lb/>
     up the volunteers, and depend entirely upon 
     <lb/>
     what the Mother Country, for prudential 
     <lb/>
     reasons, may do for us? Is that a feeling 
     <lb/>
     that any honorable member of this House 
     <lb/>
     ought to be actuated by in relation to 
     <lb/>
     this or any other question ? I am sure no 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman would be willing to sit 
     <lb/>
     down and fold his arms under the protection 
     <lb/>
     which the money and arms of Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     give us; and I am sure my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     from Niagara himself would not unite in such 
     <lb/>
     a view plainly expressed. Still, my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend thinks these resolutions ought not to 
     <lb/>
     pass this House, but ought to be postponed 
     <lb/>
     indefinitely, leaving the colonies in the divided 
     <lb/>
     condition in which they now are. I believe, 
     <lb/>
     on the contrary, that the interests and destiny 
     <lb/>
     of this country are bound up in the union now 
     <lb/>
     contemplated taking place. Suppose, as 
     <lb/>
     many believe, the end of that unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     fraticidal strife in the United States is at 
     <lb/>
     hand, and a reconciliation takes place at any 
     <lb/>
     reasonable time between the Northern and 
     <lb/>
     Southern States, I am quite sure the main<lb break="no"/>tenance of the integrity of these provinces 
     <lb/>will depend upon this union having con<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
          
summated. If the scheme is postponed now, 
     <lb/>
     it is postponed indefinitely. For years past 
     <lb/>
     the effort has been making to get the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces to assent to a union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and, if the question is now postponed, 
     <lb/>
     there is no knowing whether we shall ever 
     <lb/>
     be able to get their assent to it again or not. 
     <lb/>
     Action in the parliaments of Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island, is 
     <lb/>
     now hanging upon the proceedings in this 
     <lb/>
     House. If you pass an amendment, it will 
     <lb/>
     indicate to them that the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     are not warmly in favor of the scheme. Hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, are you ready to take the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of declaring that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada are opposed to Confederation ? There 
     <lb/>
     is no knowing when circumstances will allow 
     <lb/>
     of its being brought to this forward stage 
     <lb/>
     again. Those of you who know what dificul<lb break="no"/>ties and objections were met with—the selfish 
     <lb/>
     interests of the various sections of this and of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, which we had to over<lb break="no"/>come—must feel that a very great advance 
     <lb/>
     was made when the measure was brought to 
     <lb/>
     the present forward stage. When again will 
     <lb/>
     it be likely to happen that the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the various provinces will be brought 
     <lb/>
     together to consider the question ? When 
     <lb/>
     will it again happen that the governments of 
     <lb/>
     the several provinces concerned will be able 
     <lb/>
     to lay upon the table of their respective legis<lb break="no"/>latures a scheme so complete in all its details 
     <lb/>
     as this is ? It is impossible to say when that 
     <lb/>
     happy coincidence of circumstances will again 
     <lb/>
     occur. Then my honorable friend from Nia<lb break="no"/>gara says, " You have not given us the scheme 
     <lb/>
     in detail. You have not given the whole of it. 
     <lb/>
     The House has not before it the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Constitution under which Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada are hereafter to meet. You have not 
     <lb/>
     told us what are to be the rights and the 
     <lb/>
     powers of the local legislatures." Well, hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, all I can say is, that it would 
     <lb/>
     be impossible, and not only impossible, it would 
     <lb/>
     be useless for the Government to have brought 
     <lb/>
     down this scheme at the same time that they 
     <lb/>
     submitted the scheme now before the House. 
     <lb/>
     Until this scheme passes, until it shall be 
     <lb/>
     adopted in the other provinces, until we know 
     <lb/>
     whether or not we are to form portions of a 
     <lb/>
     Confederate Government, there is no occasion 
     <lb/>
     for introducing the scheme relating to the 
     <lb/>
     local 1egislatures. But, honorable gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     is it likely or can it be possible or such a 
     <lb/>
     scheme to be adopted without the sanction of 
     <lb/>
     both branches of the Legislature? The plan, 
     <lb/>
     whatever it may be, for the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada, is it a matter 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="297" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0297.jpg"/>

     which the ministers of the Crown can carry 
     <lb/>
     in their pockets and put in force without the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of Parliament ? No, it is a measure 
     <lb/>
     which must hereafter be laid on the table of 
     <lb/>
     this House, which must bc debated, and upon 
     <lb/>
     which we shall all have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     pronouncing an opinion before it comes in 
     <lb/>
     force. At the proper time, a full opportunity 
     <lb/>
     will be afforded to those who dissent from the 
     <lb/>
     views of the Government, in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     constitutions of these provinces, of expressing 
     <lb/>
     their opinions, and of seeking to give effect to 
     <lb/>
     them. The same may be said in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the objections taken to the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way. It is asserted that the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Railway is something that we ought never to 
     <lb/>
     have agreed to. But honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     will acknowledge, as a general proposition, 
     <lb/>
     that union is impossible without the railway, 
     <lb/>
     and such as believe that union is important 
     <lb/>
     and necessary, must be content to take the 
     <lb/>
     railway as a condition which is indispensable. 
     <lb/>
     But, honorable gentlemen, the Government 
     <lb/>
     cannot of itself build the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way. There is no power either in this Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment or the Governments of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces to build it. We must come down 
     <lb/>
     to Parliament for the sanction—not to this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, but to the Confederate Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and the Confederate Parliament will 
     <lb/>
     have an opportunity of saying upon what 
     <lb/>
     terms we shall build the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way. The fullest opportunity will be afforded 
     <lb/>
     for discussion before either the Intercolofiial 
     <lb/>
     Railway is built, or the constitutions are 
     <lb/>
     adopted for Upper and Lower Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     former will be submitted to the Confederate 
     <lb/>
     Parliament; the latter, should the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions now before the House pass, to the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Parliament of Canada; for that must 
     <lb/>
     necessarily be a matter for the disposal of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature of Canada. I am not one of those 
     <lb/>
     who would, as suggested, desire to take shelter 
     <lb/>
     behind the resolutions before the House for 
     <lb/>
     any unworthy purpose; but this I will say, 
     <lb/>
     that the amendment now before the House 
     <lb/>
     ought not to receive its sanction. I am quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that no honorable member of this 
     <lb/>
     House, who is really and truly an advocate of 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, and who believes that Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation of all the provinces is important and 
     <lb/>
     desirable, will be found voting for this amend<lb break="no"/>ment, which would place a barrier in the way 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, such as, perhaps , we could 
     <lb/>
     not overcome. Fancy the number of years 
     <lb/>
     during which this matter has been contem<lb break="no"/>plated. As my honorable friend who sits near 
     <lb/>
     me pointed out, it is a measure which has 


            <cb/>
  

     
    long been agitated. He shewed you that for 
     <lb/>years and years it has engaged the attention of 
     <lb/>almost every person who took any kind of in<lb break="no"/>terest in the public affairs of this country. I 
     <lb/>have only one thing to add to my honorable 
     <lb/>friend's elaborate statement on this point, and 
     <lb/>that is, to quote an extract from the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions proposed in this House many years ago 
     <lb/>by an honorable friend of mine, whom I am 
     <lb/>glad, and whom every one of his fellow mem<lb break="no"/>bers is glad to find still occupying his accus<lb break="no"/>tomed place in this House—I refer to my 
     <lb/>honorable friend Hon. Mr. MATHESON. In 
     <lb/>1855, my honorable friend proposed a series 
     <lb/>of resolutions in this House against the elec<lb break="no"/>tive principle, the last of which is in language 
     <lb/>prophetic of the result which now we are test<lb break="no"/>ing by actual experience. The resolution is 
     <lb/>in these words :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     8. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Resolved</hi>,—That as the subject of s union 
     <lb/>
     of the whole of the British North American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces has for years occupied the public atten<lb break="no"/>tion, it would manifestly be unwise to complicate 
     <lb/>
     future arrangements by a change in the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of one of those provinces, which has not 
     <lb/>
     been sought for, and which this House believes, 
     <lb/>
     would not be acceptable to the others. It is, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, the Opinion of this Council, that any 
     <lb/>
     proceedings on the subject at the present junctnre 
     <lb/>
     would be premature, unwise, and inexpedient. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     My honorable friend at that time looked for<lb break="no"/>ward to that which we now see about to take 
     <lb/>
     place—a union of these provinces—and he 
     <lb/>
     anticipated also that the elective, system, if 
     <lb/>
     introduced into this branch of the Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     would be fraught with difficulty. It has been 
     <lb/>
     fraught with difficulty, and it is a difficulty 
     <lb/>
     which we must surmount—a barrier which 
     <lb/>
     we must strive to overcome. The personal 
     <lb/>
     objections which my honorable friend from 
     <lb/>
     Niagara division has started, are the poorest 
     <lb/>
     kind of objections. It is not what my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend near me, or my honorable friend 
     <lb/>
     opposite, possibly thought or said at some re<lb break="no"/>mote period, that we have now to consider. 
     <lb/>
     We are all more or less exposed to this sort 
     <lb/>
     of attack; but fortunately the time during 
     <lb/>
     which I have had the honor of being in pub<lb break="no"/>lic life has been so short, and the position I 
     <lb/>
     have since occupied has been so obscure, that 
     <lb/>
     I am not so much exposed as many others to 
     <lb/>
     these accusations; but I am well aware that 
     <lb/>
     this is owing to my comparative insignificance. 
     <lb/>
     I must say that for my part I am disposed to 
     <lb/>
     put aside all these things. I am disposed to 
     <lb/>
     put aside all reference to what an honorable 
     <lb/>
     member may have done under other circum<lb break="no"/>stances and in other times, and I would mere<lb break="no"/>

     ly ask myself this: " Is this Confederation 
     <lb/>
     desirable? Do I wish for it as a lover of 
     <lb/>
     monarchical institutions? Do I desire it as 
     <lb/>
     a subject of the British Empire ? Do I wish 
     <lb/>
     for the perpetuation of the connection between 
     <lb/>
     this country and Great Britain ?" If I do 
     <lb/>
     I shall waive my objections on this point and 
     <lb/>
     the other, in my desire for the success of the 
     <lb/>
     principle. This Confederation has been sought 
     <lb/>
     after for years, but never until now has it ap<lb break="no"/>proached so near a consummation—never was 
     <lb/>
     it a possibility as it is now a possibility. 
     <lb/>
     After years of anxiety, after years of diffi<lb break="no"/>culty, after troubles here and divisions there, 
     <lb/>
     the scheme is found possible, and I will not 
     <lb/>
     put it away from me because I object to this 
     <lb/>
     point or to that. If this harness of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the country is to be put on, we 
     <lb/>
     cannot but expect that it will chafe here and 
     <lb/>
     chafe there ; but time will give relief and 
     <lb/>
     provide the remedy, as it has done in other 
     <lb/>
     circumstances before. It was so in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the union of 1840. The Lower Canadians had 
     <lb/>
     a grievance in the French language being ex<lb break="no"/>cluded from the Provincial Parliament. That 
     <lb/>
     chafed, as was to be expected, and provoked 
     <lb/>
     remonstrance. And what was the result ? 
     <lb/>
     The injustice complained of was done away 
     <lb/>
     with, and both languages were thereafter per<lb break="no"/>mitted to be used. Then it was the desire 
     <lb/>
     of the people that the elective system should 
     <lb/>
     be introduced into this House. I believe my<lb break="no"/>self that it was a mistake, but a change was 
     <lb/>
     desired, and a change was brought about. 
     <lb/>
     And so it will be in this case. If change is 
     <lb/>
     seriously desired, it will be had. It would be 
     <lb/>
     unwise and unstatesmanlike, in my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     to declare that because we cannot have our 
     <lb/>
     way on this point or on that point—that be<lb break="no"/>cause the scheme in all its features is not ex<lb break="no"/>actly what we would like it to be—we will 
     <lb/>
     not have it at all. Where, honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men, is the union efi'ected between any two 
     <lb/>
     countries, or any two individuals even, which 
     <lb/>
     has lasted for any length of time without 
     <lb/>
     mutual forbearance and mutual concessions ? 
     <lb/>
     Let those honorable gentlemen who have had 
     <lb/>
     the good fortune of forming unions, and who 
     <lb/>
     can therefore speak from experience, say 
     <lb/>
     whether any union can be formed either 
     <lb/>
     happy or lasting without forbearance on both 
     <lb/>
     sides. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) You must 
     <lb/>
     give up all thoughts of union unless you are 
     <lb/>
     willing to give and take, and cease persisting for 
     <lb/>
     everything you think best. Nobody ever did 
     <lb/>
     effect a union upon such terms, and nobody ever 
     <lb/>
     will. You must forbear here and give way 
     <lb/>
     there. I trust and believe that in the present 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
   

     instance this will be the opinion of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of this country. I trust and believe 
     <lb/>
     we are satisfied that Federation is desirable 
     <lb/>
     in itself, and that, without insisting on this 
     <lb/>
     point or on that point, we will be looking con<lb break="no"/>fidently forward to the future, when we shall 
     <lb/>
     witness, in this country, a population of four 
     <lb/>
     millions, with a valuable commerce, and, in 
     <lb/>
     point of naval power and supremacy, ranking 
     <lb/>
     fourth in the world. (Applause.) Particu<lb break="no"/>larly am I surprised that any honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman from Lower Canada should oppose 
     <lb/>
     himself to this union, for by union the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Lower Canada will regain possession of 
     <lb/>
     those countries which were once belonging to 
     <lb/>
     their race, and in which their language con<lb break="no"/>tinues to be spoken. I believe that for them, 
     <lb/>
     as well as for us, there is a future in store of 
     <lb/>
     great promise, to which we can all look for<lb break="no"/>ward with the most confident expectations. 
     <lb/>
     And shall we set aside all these promising 
     <lb/>
     prospects because we cannot obtain this little 
     <lb/>
     point or that little point ? I hope honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who favor the scheme see as I see 
     <lb/>
     that there is imminent danger in postponing 
     <lb/>
     the measure, and I ask them not to pass this 
     <lb/>
     amendment, which is brought forward in the 
     <lb/>
     poorest of all spirits, which is based on the 
     <lb/>
     assumption that honorable gentlemen are not 
     <lb/>
     ready to give the country the benefit of their 
     <lb/>
     minds and their judgments, but which asks 
     <lb/>
     us to wait and go knocking about from door 
     <lb/>
     to door, asking what is thought about the 
     <lb/>
     scheme upon which we are now called to le<lb break="no"/>gislate. Federation is the future safety and 
     <lb/>
     salvation of the country. Let us then waive 
     <lb/>
     our small objections and vote for Federation.

     <persName ref="pers:SEYM1">HON. Mr. SEYMOUR</persName>-The Hon. Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Crown Lands is right in sup<lb break="no"/>posing that I am opposed to Federation I 
     <lb/>
     am opposed to it, and particularly on the 
     <lb/>
     basis agreed upon at the Quebec Convention. 
     <lb/>
     I do not say that I would be opposed to a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union on fair and equal terms; 
     <lb/>
     but I am decidedly opposed to Federation 
     <lb/>
     on the terms now before the House. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend has said that in all unions there 
     <lb/>
     must be forbearance; but in this Federation 
     <lb/>
     scheme it appears to me the forbearance has 
     <lb/>
     been all on one side. The forbearance has 
     <lb/>
     not been mutual. When parties enter into 
     <lb/>
     a partnership, there ought to be forbearance 
     <lb/>
     on the part of each, and mutual concessions. 
     <lb/>
     But in this case the concessions as well as 
     <lb/>
     the forbearance have been all on the side of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. My hon. friend, with all his elo<lb break="no"/>quence and ability, has not answered a single 
     <lb/>

     objection raised by my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Niagara (Hon. Mr. Currie). He has found 
     <lb/>
     it convenient to pass them all over for the 
     <lb/>
     simple reason that he found them unanswer<lb break="no"/>able. My hon. friend says :—" Was not the 
     <lb/>
     French language restored to Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and was not this echange in the Constitution?" 
     <lb/>
     Hon. gentlemen, it was certainly restored, 
     <lb/>
     and by the Conservative administration of that 
     <lb/>
     day, and, as my hon. friend opposite (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. BOULTON) has said, unanimously. There 
     <lb/>
     was no opposition, for it was considered a 
     <lb/>
     right to which our French Canadian fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     subjects were fully entitled. But is the 
     <lb/>
     restoration of the French language to be 
     <lb/>
     compared with the resolutions now proposed 
     <lb/>
     — with the great constitutional change 
     <lb/>
     which is intended to affect, not only our<lb break="no"/>selves, but our children and our children's 
     <lb/>
     children for all time to come? Is a change 
     <lb/>
     like this to be compared with the restoration 
     <lb/>
     of the French language?   Certainly not. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me to be the most extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     comparison I ever heard of. Then my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend has referred to the change in 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     But was not that question over and over 
     <lb/>
     again before the people ? Did not the people 
     <lb/>
     at the hustings frequently pronounce an 
     <lb/>
     opinion upon that change ? Undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     they did, and it being understood that the 
     <lb/>
     people were in favor of it, the change was 
     <lb/>
     brought about. My hon. friend says that in 
     <lb/>
     the Conference they were surrounded with 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. No doubt they were. And why? 
     <lb/>
     Because they allowed for Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island and Newfoundland as many delegates 
     <lb/>
     as they did for Canada. No doubt they were 
     <lb/>
     surrounded with difficulties. No doubt they 
     <lb/>
     were overwhelmed by the demands of these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen. The hon. gentleman says that 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is necessary to strengthen the 
     <lb/>
     defences of the country. In what way? Can 
     <lb/>
     any hon. gentleman tell me in what way? 
     <lb/>
     I have not heard one word to prove, to my 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction, how the defences of the country 
     <lb/>
     are to be strengthened by Federation, unless 
     <lb/>
     indeed it be by placing the whole of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces under one head. Why, hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, did I not shew here the other day 
     <lb/>
     what was the feeling of the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the defences of the country? 
     <lb/>
     At a time when our Parliament were propos<lb break="no"/>ing to pass an act which would entail the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of millions on the defences of 
     <lb/>
     the country, what was being done in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Provinces? Why the Financial Secre<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
     

     tary of one of the provinces came down with 
     <lb/>
     a proposed grant of $20,000, and he was 
     <lb/>
     obliged to apologize to the House that the 
     <lb/>
     sum was so large ! And the present Premier 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia—the province second in impor<lb break="no"/>tance in British North America — proposed 
     <lb/>
     to strike off $12,000, and leave the appro<lb break="no"/>priation at $8,000. This was proposed by a 
     <lb/>
     province next in importance to our own, and 
     <lb/>
     at the time of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trent</hi> affair, when there was 
     <lb/>
     an appearance of danger much greater than at 
     <lb/>
     present. And what did New Brunswick do ? 
     <lb/>
     Appropriate $15,000. The people that did 
     <lb/>
     all this are the people to whom we are to 
     <lb/>
     ally ourselves that we may be strengthened 
     <lb/>
     in our efforts for the defence of the country! 
     <lb/>
     Do hon. gentlemen believe that an alliance 
     <lb/>
     with provinces whose leading men hold such 
     <lb/>
     views as these would add to our strength ? 
     <lb/>
     Certainly not. My hon. friend the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Crown Lands has also said that 
     <lb/>
     95 out of every 100 of the people of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada are in favor of Federation. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend is mistaken. I once had the honor of 
     <lb/>
     representing a portion of his constituents, 
     <lb/>
     and I would inform my hon. friend that I 
     <lb/>
     know as much of the feeling, not simply of 
     <lb/>
     the people of Upper Canada, speaking of 
     <lb/>
     them generally, but of his constituents, as 
     <lb/>
     he does; and this I would say that were my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend to go before his constituents and 
     <lb/>
     tell them that, in order to get Federation, 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada is to pay two-thirds of the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the Intercolonial Railway, and two- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thirds of the cost of maintenance of the road 
     <lb/>
     for all time to come, and that the roads of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces are to be made Govern<lb break="no"/>ment roads, and to be kept up in future at 
     <lb/>
     the expense of the Federal Government, and 
     <lb/>
     that Upper Canada will have two-thirds of the 
     <lb/>
     burden to hear, I will venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend would fi d himself wrong in 
     <lb/>
     his estimate of being able to satisfy 95 out of 
     <lb/>
     every 100 of his constituents.

     <lb/>
     its being thrust upon him. But my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     could not for a moment go before his con<lb break="no"/>stituents—and he represents a constituency 
     <lb/>
     which for intelligence is second to none in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada—and tell them that they are 
     <lb/>
     to contribute to the revenue of the Confede<lb break="no"/>ration in proportion to their import duties— 
     <lb/>
     that they are to contribute according to 
     <lb/>
     their wealth—and that they are only to 
     <lb/>
     receive back in proportion to their popula<lb break="no"/>tion—that largely as they contribute, the 
     <lb/>
     return will only be the same as to the fisher<lb break="no"/>men and lumberers who form the floating 
     <lb/>
     population of the Lower Provinces, and carry 
     <lb/>
     so large a majority as he has named with 
     <lb/>
     him. A doctrine such as this is any thing but 
     <lb/>
     conservative. I would submit to any thing 
     <lb/>
     rather than vote for such a scheme. Were 
     <lb/>
     I to support it in its present shape I should 
     <lb/>
     consider myself as betraying the interests of

     my country. Hon. gentleman 'are of course

     entitled to their own opinions in this matter; 
     <lb/>
     but these are mine, and I shall continue to 
     <lb/>
     maintain and uphold them. I assert that the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of my hon. friend for delay is a 
     <lb/>
     just and reasonable one, and I cannot see 
     <lb/>
    how it can possibly be objected to in a 
     <lb/>matter of this importance, where the dearest 
     <lb/>interests of the whole country are at stake, 
     <lb/>and where we are legislating not for ourselves 
     <lb/>alone but for future generations. Such 
     <lb/>being the importance of the measure, I 
     <lb/>cannot conceive how hon. gentlemen can 
     <lb/>vote against so reasonable a proposition.

     have been an extraordinary proceeding had 
     <lb/>
     they brought down at this juncture the 
     <lb/>
     proposed constitutions for Upper and Lower

     of opinion arise as to the constitutions

     impolitic for the Government to throw the

     the action of the Lower Provinces. We 
     <lb/>

     into effect, and we would be placing the 
     <lb/>
     country in a state of turmoil and confusion 
     <lb/>
     in discussing measures which would be 
     <lb/>
     altogether unnecessary. We ought, it seems 
     <lb/>
     to me, first to carry out this arrangement as 
     <lb/>
     far as it is possible to carry it, and if we 
     <lb/>
     can secure the assent to it of the two larger 
     <lb/>
     provinces below. there will be a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     certainty of the scheme being effected. And 
     <lb/>
     then, and not till then will the proper time 
     <lb/>
     arrive for the discussion of the proposed

     <lb/>

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     I believe that I have truth and justice on my 
     <lb/>
     side, and have confidence that in its own 
     <lb/>
     inherent power, the truth will ultimately

     are some in which I differ, in none more so

     than that which regards all who support the

            <p>

     sincerity of those who advocated a measure 
     <lb/>
     and sheltered themselves behind details.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VIDA1">Hon. Mr. VIDAL</persName>—It was more point<lb break="no"/>edly put than that. It was said that the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the motion were such as clearly 
     <lb/>
     showed that it was made simply for the 
     <lb/>
     object of defeating the measure.

            </p>

            <p>

     that it is so. But that is very different from 
     <lb/>
     what you charged me with saying. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VIDA1">Hon. Mr. VIDAL</persName>—The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     made the remark that we were not altering 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution, but that the question before 
     <lb/>
     us was one simply for an address to the 
     <lb/>
     Crown. Now, strictly speaking, and taking 
     <lb/>
     the words of the motion in their mere literal 
     <lb/>
     sense, this statement is correct; but I ask 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen if it is fair or candid to en<lb break="no"/>deavor to lead the House to believe that this 
     <lb/>
     motion, which is undoubtedly for an address, 
     <lb/>
     is not in effect for a change in the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion ? Are we not plainly told that no Im<lb break="no"/>perial legislation will take place on this 
     <lb/>
     subject, unless such an Address as this receives 
     <lb/>
     the assent of the Canadian Legislature? I 
     <lb/>
     hold. therefore, that the motion before us, 
     <lb/>
     though it be for an Address to Her Majesty, 
     <lb/>
     is in effect a measure, which has for its object 
     <lb/>
     a change of the Constitution. Such being the 
     <lb/>
     case, the subject is one which demands our 
     <lb/>
     most careful consideration, and for which we 
     <lb/>
     ought to be allowed all the time requisite to 
     <lb/>
     the fullest and freest discussion. The changes 
     <lb/>
     which have been referred to, and with which 
     <lb/>
     it has been sought to compare this change, 
     <lb/>
     cannot with propriety be regarded as similar. 
     <lb/>
     I contend, in the language of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Hon. Mr. SEYMOUR) who has 
     <lb/>
     just preceded me, that this is in fact a revolu<lb break="no"/>tion : the word is not too strong. So far from 
     <lb/>
     its being as has been stated, a simple change, 
     <lb/>
     like the mere introducing or reintroducing 
     <lb/>
     the use of the French Ianguage into the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, or even the more important ste 
     <lb/>
     of altering the constitution of this House, it 
     <lb/>
     is an entire alteration of our political condi<lb break="no"/>tion and relations, and affects most deeply 
     <lb/>
     the whole country in all its varied interests. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever may be the correctness or in<lb break="no"/>correctness of the opinion of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     as to hon. members covering their hostility 
     <lb/>
     to the scheme of Confederation by objecting 
     <lb/>
     only to its details, it will not apply to me; I 
     <lb/>
     shall take no shelter under details. My 
     <lb/>
     course in voting for the amendment of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Niagara is based on broad 
     <lb/>
     and constitutional grounds. I differ from 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman in regard to some of

     these details, and on the whole, I am not 
     <lb/>
     sure if my views do not more nearly coincide 
     <lb/>
     with those of my hon. friend the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Crown Lands. 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>—I am very glad 
     <lb/>to hear my hon. friend say so. I would 
     <lb/>'like him also to state if he goes with the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Niagara in desiring the 
     <lb/>delay of a month or delay for a longer period. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:VIDA1">HON. MR. VIDAL</persName>—That question will 
     <lb/>be fully answered when I come to touch 
     <lb/>upon that point. But I may state, that 
     <lb/>instead of offering a factious opposition by 
     <lb/>the course I intend taking, it is my loyalty 
     <lb/>to our Sovereign and country which induces 
     <lb/>me to support the amendment now before 
     <lb/>the House, not with the object of defeating 
     <lb/>this measure, but for securing its adoption 
     <lb/>on a broader and more permanent basis. 
     <lb/>How singular are the different views which 
     <lb/>are taken of our position and powers accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the manner in which we may vote 
     <lb/>upon this question ! In one breath we are 
     <lb/>told that we are the representatives of the 
     <lb/>people, and we have a perfect right to vote 
     <lb/>upon it as we may see fit; and in a few minutes 
     <lb/>afterwards, we are informed that if we do not 
     <lb/>vote upon it in a certain manner, we do not 
     <lb/>represent the people. I cannot possibly 
     <lb/>reconcile the two statements. It is also said 
     <lb/>—and it is the only argument I have heard 
     <lb/>on the point—if indeed it can be called an 
     <lb/>argument at all—that if the present oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of securing the union of the provinces 
     <lb/>is allowed to pass unimproved, it will be a 
     <lb/>long time before we may look for another. 
     <lb/>I admit that the opportunity is one which 
     <lb/>has been long desired, and one which it will 
     <lb/>be wise policy to improve ; and it will be my 
     <lb/>humble endeavor to seek to do so to the best 
     <lb/>advantage. But if the measure is in reality 
     <lb/>fraught with the benefits which have been 
     <lb/>claimed for it, I cannot see how it will be 
     <lb/>jeopardized by a little delay; because the 
     <lb/>more its benefits are looked into, the better, 
     <lb/>it is reasonable to suppose, the people will 
     <lb/>be satisfied with them. I cannot see how 
     <lb/>the measure will be endangered by giving 
     <lb/>both the people and their representatives a 
     <lb/>little longer time to become acquainted with 
     <lb/>its principles and its details. Since the 
     <lb/>commencement of the debate in this House, 
     <lb/>much light has been thrown on the scheme, 
     <lb/>and we have had the advantage of the 
     <lb/>explanations in the other Chamber, and I 
     <lb/>am sure that the minds of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>must now be much better informed on parti<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     cular points of the scheme than they were 
     <lb/>
     before we came here. For my own part, 
     <lb/>
     after having had my mind frequently direct<lb break="no"/>ed to it, and after having listened attentively 
     <lb/>
     to the arguments of all the speakers, I am 
     <lb/>
     more and more impressed with the magni<lb break="no"/>tude and importance of the various interests 
     <lb/>
     on which our action is invited in thi mat<lb break="no"/>ter, and I think we should proceed cautiously 
     <lb/>
     and slowly in taking the step before us—a 
     <lb/>
     change so great as that contemplated by the 
     <lb/>
     framers of these resolutions—a change 
     <lb/>
     amounting to nothing less than, as I before 
     <lb/>
     observed, a revolution in the whole system of 
     <lb/>
     governing the country. This is a step which, 
     <lb/>
     in order to be permanently successful, must 
     <lb/>
     rest on the principles of truth and justice, 
     <lb/>
     and these principles must be intelligently 
     <lb/>
     apprehended by the people to be governed. 
     <lb/>
     Notwithstanding all that has been advanced 
     <lb/>
     in this chamber—all the assertions which 
     <lb/>
     have been made—in reference to the inform<lb break="no"/>ation said to be possessed by the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country relative to this measure, I must 
     <lb/>
     say that I do not coincide in that opinion. 
     <lb/>
     I believe that the people of the country, as 
     <lb/>
     a whole, are not acquainted with the details. 
     <lb/>
     What new light has there been thrown 
     <lb/>
     on the resolutions since we assembled here ? 
     <lb/>
     Have we not had our attention directed to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that even some who assisted in 
     <lb/>
     framing the resolutions, did not themselves 
     <lb/>
     know precisely what some of them meant? 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, is it not the fact that the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the country has not to any great ex<lb break="no"/>tent been called to any arguments against the 
     <lb/>
     scheme? Now, in order to a right apprecia<lb break="no"/>tion of the value aud importance of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed Confederation, it is right that the 
     <lb/>
     people should know and understand both 
     <lb/>
     sides of the question. They should not be 
     <lb/>
     carried away with the pleasing prospect held 
     <lb/>
     out to them of the advantages to be derived 
     <lb/>
     from forming part of a great Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     without being told at the same time of the 
     <lb/>
     cost at which these advantages are to he 
     <lb/>
     purchased. And this is all the more necessary 
     <lb/>
     because the movement did not originate with 
     <lb/>
     the people. All great constitutional changes 
     <lb/>
     ought to and usually do originate with 
     <lb/>
     the people. But this is an anomaly. Here 
     <lb/>
     we have a proposed Constitution framed by 
     <lb/>
     a self-elected body—I do not use the term 
     <lb/>
     reproachfully, because I hold that these hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen did perfectly right in so meeting 
     <lb/>
    together—this, I say, is a Constitution which 
     <lb/>was not framed by a body appointed for the 
     <lb/>

     purpose; and it is sent down to us as a per<lb break="no"/>fect document, which must be regarded as 
     <lb/>
     resembling a treaty which we have no power 
     <lb/>
     to alter even in the smallest detail. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP2">HON. MR CAMPBELL</persName>—My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     cavils at the question of authority. But he 
     <lb/>
     must know that the Parliament of this country 
     <lb/>
     had sanctioned the formation of a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with the avowed intention of bringing 
     <lb/>
     about Federation; and therefore there was 
     <lb/>
     authority for what was done from the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country. But my hon. friend is a mon<lb break="no"/>archist, and recognizes other sources of au<lb break="no"/>thority than those vested in the people. 
     <lb/>
     There is the authority of the Crown ; and on 
     <lb/>
     this point I would beg to refer him to the 
     <lb/>
     despatch which was received on this subject 
     <lb/>
     from the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 
     <lb/>
     It says : " With the sanction of the Crown, 
     <lb/>
     and upon the invitation of the Governor- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     General, men of every province, chosen by 
     <lb/>
     the respective Lieutenant-Governors, without 
     <lb/>
     distinction of party, assembled to consider 
     <lb/>
     questions of the utmost interest to every sub<lb break="no"/>ject of the Queen, of whatever race or faith, 
     <lb/>
     resident in those provinces, and have arrived 
     <lb/>
     at a conclusion destined to exercise a most 
     <lb/>
     important influence upon the future welfare 
     <lb/>
     of the whole community." So here was the 
     <lb/>
     sanction of the Crown so far as the action of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces was concerned; whilst 
     <lb/>
     our own Parliament directly sanctioned the 
     <lb/>
     formation of a Government having this object 
     <lb/>
     in view. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VIDA1">Hon. MR. VIDAL</persName>—I have stated clearly 
     <lb/>
     and emphatically that I was satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     the formation of the Conference and what it 
     <lb/>
     did, so why my hon. friend the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Crown Lands should have thought 
     <lb/>
     it necessary to make the explanations he has 
     <lb/>
     just now done, I really do not know. I 
     <lb/>
     admitted—I never in the least disputed— 
     <lb/>
     that the Conference was properly, legally, 
     <lb/>
     and formally constituted. I gave the mem<lb break="no"/>bers composing it all praise for the intelli<lb break="no"/>gence and fidelity to the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     country with which they carried on their 
     <lb/>
     laborious negotiations. But I must still re<lb break="no"/>iterate my former statement, that on account 
     <lb/>of this movement not having emanated from 
     <lb/>the people—and the fact of there being no 
     <lb/>petitions before either branch of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature asking for it establishes this—we 
     <lb/>ought before i.s adoption to have some ex<lb break="no"/>pression of the views of the people, and con<lb break="no"/>sequently that the motion in amendment 
     <lb/>made by my hon. friend the member from 
     <lb/>Niagara is one which I ought to support. I 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
           

     believe, after this debate has been concluded 
     <lb/>
     in both Chambers, and the full report of it 
     <lb/>
     which is being prepared has gone forth to 
     <lb/>
     the country, the people will be in a position 
     <lb/>
     to form a correct judgment on the merits of 
     <lb/>
     the case. They will then have before them 
     <lb/>
     perhaps all that could be said on one side or 
     <lb/>
     the other, and if they cannot then form a 
     <lb/>
     reliable judgment, it will be their own fault. 
     <lb/>
     There is no reason why this House should 
     <lb/>
     be at the very great expense—some $2,000) 
     <lb/>
     I believe—of printing so large a number of 
     <lb/>
     the debates as is being done, if the people 
     <lb/>
     are not to be consulted ; for unless they are 
     <lb/>
     to be asked for a decision—if the scheme is 
     <lb/>
     to be carried into effect without consulting 
     <lb/>
     them—where is the necessity for placing be<lb break="no"/>fore them speeches and arguments which 
     <lb/>
     which will only have the effect of disturbing 
     <lb/>
     their minds? In addition to saying that 
     <lb/>
     the plan has not emanated from the people, I 
     <lb/>
     contend that it has not even emanated from 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the people. Had these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions been framed by our own Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, brought down like other Government 
     <lb/>
     measures into our Legislature, and there dis<lb break="no"/>cussed, voted upon, and adopted by the ma<lb break="no"/>jority, I should not think it necessary that 
     <lb/>
     there should be any reference to the people, 
     <lb/>
     though perhaps I might still think such refer<lb break="no"/>ence desirable. But the fact is that the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people have not been con<lb break="no"/>sulted in the matter ; there has been no way 
     <lb/>
     left open whereby they can effect the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of any objectionable feature in 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions, or influence the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Legislature on the proposed union. I pre<lb break="no"/>sume honorable gentlemen will concur with 
     <lb/>
     me that if, after all that has been stated, 
     <lb/>
     the country should not desire the change— 
     <lb/>
     if the people at large should think they are 
     <lb/>
     really paying too much and making too con<lb break="no"/>siderable a sacrifice to secure the anticipated 
     <lb/>
     benefits of this measure—it ought not to be 
     <lb/>
     passed. (Hear.) Where, I would ask, is the 
     <lb/>
     danger to be apprehended in submitting the 
     <lb/>
     measure to the country? Danger is to be 
     <lb/>
     apprehended from forcing upon the people a 
     <lb/>
     measure of which they may not approve. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear.) But nothing can be endangered by 
     <lb/>
     submitted this project to the people, if, as has 
     <lb/>
     been so strongly asserted and as I believe, 
     <lb/>
     the majority are in favor of it. If I thought 
     <lb/>
     an immediate reference to the people would 
     <lb/>
     jeopardise the scheme, perhaps I might 
     <lb/>
     hesitate in urging it, as I now do—(hear, 
     <lb/>
    and laughter)—but I believe its object is 
     <lb/>really one desired by the country generally, 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="304" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0304.jpg"/>
         <fw type="num">304</fw>


     and there would be no risk in submitting it. 
     <lb/>
     Where is then the danger of delay ?—and 
     <lb/>
     delay is all we ask for. What struck me 
     <lb/>
     very much in the eloquent and able address 
     <lb/>
     of the Honorable Commissioner of Crown 
     <lb/>
     Lands was, that he never touched upon the 
     <lb/>
     real question of the amendment. It is true 
     <lb/>
     he said delays were dangerous, delay would 
     <lb/>
     lose the measure, but not a shadow of argu<lb break="no"/>ment did he advance in proof of this view. 
     <lb/>
     I think delay is safety, in that it will enable 
     <lb/>
     the country and the Legislature to look into 
     <lb/>
     the scheme, to weigh all its advantages and 
     <lb/>
     disadvantages, if it has any, and so more 
     <lb/>
     certainly secure the passing of it if good, and 
     <lb/>
     the rejection of it if the reverse. Of course, 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen, divers views may exist as 
     <lb/>
     to the way in which the opinion of the people 
     <lb/>
     on this question is to be obtained. I am 
     <lb/>
     not to be deterred from expressing my views 
     <lb/>
     by the taunt of republicanism ; a sneer 
     <lb/>
     never disturbs me when I have good ground 
     <lb/>
     for what I do or say. I have had to bear 
     <lb/>
     with many a sneer on account of my adhesion 
     <lb/>
     to the temperance cause, but they never 
     <lb/>
     moved me from my course. My belief is 
     <lb/>
     that the views of the people may be ascer<lb break="no"/>tained without any such delay as will endan<lb break="no"/>ger the scheme. It is to be presumed that 
     <lb/>
     the debate will not extend beyond a week or 
     <lb/>
     two, in both Houses. A very short time 
     <lb/>
     after it is concluded, and the pamphlets 
     <lb/>
     containing the speeches printed, a direct 
     <lb/>
     vote of the people might be taken with pro<lb break="no"/>priety and safety. The proposition to sub<lb break="no"/>mit the plan to the vote of the people seems 
     <lb/>
     at the first glance not to be British—our 
     <lb/>
     prejudices rise against it. We are, however, 
     <lb/>
     not to be guided by prejudices, but by 
     <lb/>
     reason and reflection; and if we can find 
     <lb/>
     the best means of clearly and satisfactorily 
     <lb/>
     ascertaining what the people wish, that 
     <lb/>
     means ought to be adopted, call it by what 
     <lb/>
     name you may. I think that to put the 
     <lb/>
     matter to a direct vote in this way is the 
     <lb/>
     best plan. The people should be told : 
     <lb/>
     " Here is the measure; will you take it or 
     <lb/>
     will you not ?" We should not ask them 
     <lb/>
     to discuss amendments; we could not bring 
     <lb/>
     the people of all the provinces together for 
     <lb/>
     such a purpose, and if we allowed amend<lb break="no"/>ments to be discussed, we should have 
     <lb/>
     inextricable confusion. The plain question 
     <lb/>
     should be proposed: Do you wish for this 
     <lb/>
     Confederation or not—yes or no ? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS7">Hon. MR. ROSS</persName>—No power to alter its 
     <lb/>details?<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VIDA1">HON. Mr. VIDAL</persName>—No. That is the 
     <lb/>
     way the question is proposed to this House, 
     <lb/>
     and if it be wrong to submit it thus to the 
     <lb/>
     people, it is also wrong to submit it in such 
     <lb/>
     a manner to the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     An additional motive tor suggesting this 
     <lb/>
     mode of proceeding is, that I should be 
     <lb/>
     extremely unwilling to subject myself to 
     <lb/>
     the censorious remarks of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in the other Chamber who might reasonably 
     <lb/>
     say, if we propose to have a dissolution and 
     <lb/>
     a new election on the subject, 'It is all 
     <lb/>
     very well, but you keep your seats, while 
     <lb/>
     you send us home." I do not indeed see 
     <lb/>
     why we might not with great propriety wait 
     <lb/>
     until the next general election, when, after 
     <lb/>
     two years of reflection and discussion, the 
     <lb/>
     peeple would be still better able to give an 
     <lb/>
     intelligent vote. I can see no objection to 
     <lb/>
     the wish of the people being thus ascertained 
     <lb/>
     in this <hi rendition="simple:italic">par excellence</hi> constitutional way; 
     <lb/>
     but as ministers tell us we cannot wait, then 
     <lb/>
     I say, let us rather have a direct vote of the 
     <lb/>
     people on the scheme than precipitate 
     <lb/>
     a general election. I should prefer a 
     <lb/>
     direct vote to a general election, because 
     <lb/>
     during an election other influences are 
     <lb/>
     at work besides purely political ones. In 
     <lb/>
     many places the personal popularity of a 
     <lb/>
     candidate outweighs the political leaning of 
     <lb/>
     the electors; in others, a well-filled purse 
     <lb/>
     carries the day, or some local question pre<lb break="no"/>judices a constituency and influences the 
     <lb/>
     minds of the voters. But upon a scheme 
     <lb/>
     such as this, if submitted directly to the 
     <lb/>
     country, none of these considerations would 
     <lb/>
     have any effect, and the electors would be 
     <lb/>
     guided by patriotism alone. So that while 
     <lb/>
     constitutionally the House represents the 
     <lb/>
     will of the people, and no fault could be 
     <lb/>
     found if the House, after a new election, 
     <lb/>
     were to pass upon the matter, still the object 
     <lb/>
     desired, vis., to know the desire of the 
     <lb/>
     people, would be more expeditiously and less 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     of no use to call this method " Yankee " 
     <lb/>
     or " Republican." It is well known that 
     <lb/>
     it prevailed as far back as the days of ancient

     truthful expression of their wish. We could 
     <lb/>
     obtain the views of the whole country in a 
     <lb/>
     short time—perhaps not within one month, 
     <lb/>
     but still in time enough to enable the mea<lb break="no"/>sure to be adopted within the current year. 
     <lb/>
     The Legislature of New Brunswick is not to 
     <lb/>
     meet for some time yet; the question therefore 
     <lb/>
     cannot be soon settled there; and if it were, 
     <lb/>
     it has still to go home to England, there to 
     <lb/>
     be embodied in an Imperial enactment before 
     <lb/>
     being acted upon. The Imperial Parliament 
     <lb/>
     has assembled and will probably continue in 
     <lb/>
     session, as it generally does, some five or six 
     <lb/>
     months. Surely then there will be time to 
     <lb/>
     take the vote here. I should like to have 
     <lb/>
     some reason adduced to convince me that 
     <lb/>
     there is danger in delay. I have heard an 
     <lb/>
     indistinct allusion to such dan er as being 
     <lb/>
     great in case war should suddenly come upon 
     <lb/>
     us. New, hon. gentlemen, I hold this to be 
     <lb/>
     an objection which has no weight whatever. 
     <lb/>
     How long will it be, if we adept the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, be are this scheme can be got into ope<lb break="no"/>ration ? I presume it will be twelve months, 
     <lb/>
     and if we can wait a twelve month, can we 
     <lb/>
     not wait two years without risk ? For, what 
     <lb/>
     immediate strength is the measure to bring 
     <lb/>
     to us ? The mere uniting together of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces will not give us one additional 
     <lb/>
     soldier; it will give us no more money ; 
     <lb/>
     neither will it lessen the extent of frontier to be 
     <lb/>
     defended, nor give us any increase of military 
     <lb/>
     power. As for its placing all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     under the direction of one mind—the only 
     <lb/>
     argument which I have heard applying to 
     <lb/>
     this part of the question—if we were in a 
     <lb/>
     state of war to-day, the forces of the whole 
     <lb/>
     would be under the direction of one mind. 
     <lb/>
     Do we think for one moment, that if a hostile 
     <lb/>
     force set foot on the shores of Canada, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick or Nova Scotia, the heart of the 
     <lb/>
     Empire would not thrill with indignation, and 
     <lb/>
     the whole force of the Empire not be brought 
     <lb/>
     to bear against the foe who thus insulted and 
     <lb/>
     defied the British Crown, just as readily in 
     <lb/>
     our isolated as it would be in our united con<lb break="no"/>dition? I think the danger from war is one 
     <lb/>
     on which no argument against submitting 
     <lb/>
     this measure to the people can possibly be 
     <lb/>
     based. (Hear, hear.) An hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has stated that the defences of the country 
     <lb/>
     must remain at a stand-still until Confede<lb break="no"/>ration is accomplished. I do not know the 
     <lb/>
     source from which that opinion came, or 
     <lb/>
     whether it was spoken by authority. If it 
     <lb/>
     was, it is certainly a startling announce<lb break="no"/>ment.

     said by the Hon. the Commissioner of Crown 
     <lb/>
     Lands, in reply to the member from Niagara, 
     <lb/>
     that the country has not been taken by sur<lb break="no"/>prise by these resolutions. In this I differ 
     <lb/>
     from him. lt is quite true that as far as the 
     <lb/>
     question of union is concerned, it is not new- 
     <lb/>
     the thought of union has long occupied 
     <lb/>
     many minds—but I do contend, that with 
     <lb/>
     reference to many points comprised in the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, the country has been taken by sur<lb break="no"/>prise. No thought, no knowled whatever 
     <lb/>
     of the character of many of the changes 
     <lb/>
     proposed to be introduced ever entered the

     minds of the people at large.

     that gentlemen from all the provinces, of

     different political parties, cou d meet to<lb break="no"/>gether in such an amicable way, and make

     such mutual concessions as to enable this

     is a great mistake. It is just because I 
     <lb/>
     appreciate its advantages, and wish to see 
     <lb/>
     them secured without any chance of danger 
     <lb/>
     resulting from the scheme having been too 
     <lb/>
     hastily adopted, that I speak as I do. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is said the people were not appeal<lb break="no"/>ed to when the unions between England and 
     <lb/>
     Scotland, and Great Britain and Ireland, were 
     <lb/>
     brought about. That is quite true, but it is 
     <lb/>
     equally true that these unions were brought 
     <lb/>
     about by the Parliaments of those countries 
     <lb/>
     —the representatives of the people. The 
     <lb/>
     measures were arranged with them, and the 
     <lb/>
     people were represented as to those unions 
     <lb/>
     by their Parliaments.

     <lb/>
     shall venture to touch on another point, not 
     <lb/>
     directly connected with the amendment be<lb break="no"/>fore us, on which I said a few words when I 
     <lb/>
     last addressed the House on this subject. 
     <lb/>
     We have heard much about the proposed 
     <lb/>
     new constitution of the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     We have been told it was political necessity 
     <lb/>
     that first forced the elective system on minds 
     <lb/>
     that were by no means enamoured of it, and 
     <lb/>
     this, I think, has been fully established. 
     <lb/>
     Now, it would ill become me, as an elected 
     <lb/>
     member, to dwell on any merits or excel<lb break="no"/>lencies the elective system may have possessed 
     <lb/>
     as applied to this branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture—it is a subject we can none of us touch 
     <lb/>
     upon with the same freedom which we might 
     <lb/>
     if we were not ourselves elected--but I may 
     <lb/>
     call the attention of the House to this, that 
     <lb/>
     none of the evils that were dreaded, as likely 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
          

     to flow from the elective system, have yet 
     <lb/>
     shown themselves, and I do not think it at 
     <lb/>
     all reasonable, much less necessary, that they 
     <lb/>
     should be anticipated in time to come. My 
     <lb/>
     own views were in perfect accord with those 
     <lb/>
     of hon. gentlemen who protested against the 
     <lb/>
     system when it was first introduced. I did 
     <lb/>
     not then consider it an improvement, and 
     <lb/>
     my views have not changed since; I have, 
     <lb/>
     consequently, no personal predilections for 
     <lb/>
     an Elective Council, but far prefer a Chamber 
     <lb/>
     nominated by the Crown. But I am not here 
     <lb/>
     to carry out only my personal views or pre<lb break="no"/>dilections, but to guard the rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges of my constituents; and I would remind 
     <lb/>
     hon. members that it is one thing to concede a 
     <lb/>
     privilege, but a very different thing to take it 
     <lb/>
     away. (Hear.) A privilege may be con<lb break="no"/>ceded unasked, but it is a dangerous thing 
     <lb/>
     to take it away unasked or unassented to. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear. hear ) I cannot find either that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government made any endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     maintain the elective principle ; I cannot see 
     <lb/>
     that the nomination system was forced on 
     <lb/>
     them by the wishes of the Lower Provinces. 
     <lb/>
     It may have been the desire of some of the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces to maintain their nomi<lb break="no"/>nation system, but the change in ours was 
     <lb/>
     one which obviously met the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     members of this Government, and no effort 
     <lb/>
     appears to have been made by them to pre<lb break="no"/>serve to the people of this country the privi<lb break="no"/>lege they now enjoy of electing members of 
     <lb/>
     this House. (Hear.) I think, also, that 
     <lb/>
     there are objectionable features in certain 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the scheme for which the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government are responsible. I 
     <lb/>
     speak not as an opponent, but as one of their 
     <lb/>
     truest and best friends—one who is desirous 
     <lb/>
     to keep them from doing a wrong. It is not 
     <lb/>
     as an opponent to them or to Confederation 
     <lb/>
     that I support the amendment of the hon. 
     <lb/>

     in hopes of securing the votes of any members

     <lb/>
     they could not otherwise have been sure of; 
     <lb/>
     still that part of the scheme has an awkward

     looks something very like it. I, however, 
     <lb/>
     do not see it in that light. I do not think

     there has been anything worse than a desire

     to me only fair that those who hold appoint<lb break="no"/>ments from the Crown for life are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     retain their seats, to go first into the new 
     <lb/>
     House, and the rejection will then be of the 
     <lb/>
     elected members. It will involve nearly half 
     <lb/>
     of these, and it is quite obvious that it places 
     <lb/>
     all honorable members ot this Chamber in a 
     <lb/>
    sery anomalous position to be called upon to 
     <lb/>sets on such a question as this. I may 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     remark that it would have been much the 
     <lb/>
     wiser plan, and certainly much more conge<lb break="no"/>nial to the feelings of the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House, had the Government thought fit to 
     <lb/>
     have passed these resolutions in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Assembly first, and then, if those who 
     <lb/>
     are more especially representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     people had chosen to pass this clause, we 
     <lb/>
     should have felt less hesitation. As it is, I 
     <lb/>
     feel it to be my duty to the constituency I 
     <lb/>
     represent to lift my voice against it. I have 
     <lb/>
     no right, without their consent, to vote away 
     <lb/>
     from them a right they may cherish, a fran<lb break="no"/>chise they may value, even though I should 
     <lb/>
     thereby vote myself in for life. which would 
     <lb/>
     be a betrayal of my trust. Even my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Saugcen—so recently sent here 
     <lb/>
     as the representative of that division—must 
     <lb/>
     admit that a great many of his constituents 
     <lb/>
     would vote " nay," if they thought the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation was to be purchased 
     <lb/>
     at the sacrifice of their representative. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, and a laugh.)

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACP1">HON. MR. MACPHERSON</persName>—I believe a 
     <lb/>
     large majority of them would vote " yea." 
     <lb/>
     (Laughter) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VIDA1">HON. MR. VIDAL</persName>—There is a difference 
     <lb/>
     of opinion between my honorable friend and 
     <lb/>
     myself on this point. (Hear, hear.) Hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen, I have said I am favorable 
     <lb/>
     to the scheme of union—I say it sincerely 
     <lb/>
     and honestly—and notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Commissioner of Crown Lands 
     <lb/>
     may say "It cannot be so ; by supporting the 
     <lb/>
     amendment you are destroying the scheme," 
     <lb/>
     I cannot see it so. My course, I think, is 
     <lb/>
     that which is most conducive to the success 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme. I consider myself one of its 
     <lb/>
     best and most faithful friends in seeking to 
     <lb/>
     have it more firmly based upon the approval 
     <lb/>
     of the people, at the cost of a trifling delay. 
     <lb/>
     A great deal has been said, as an introduction 
     <lb/>
     to this measure, that was unworthy of it. 
     <lb/>
     We have had long accounts of political and 
     <lb/>
     party difficulties, which have been spoken of 
     <lb/>
     as appertaining to it. These were too small 
     <lb/>
     matters to have led to this great constitu<lb break="no"/>tional change. It was clearly seen by the 
     <lb/>
     peeple, as well as by Her Majesty's represen<lb break="no"/>tative, that these difiiculties were not based 
     <lb/>
     upon what they were said to be by some of 
     <lb/>
     our politicians. What does His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     say in a memorandum to the Executive 
     <lb/>
     Council, communicated to this House on the 
     <lb/>
     30th of June last?—" During this period, 
     <lb/>
     (of the late successive governments since the 
     <lb/>
     election of 1861,) no question involving any 
     <lb/>

     great principle or calculated to prevent poli<lb break="no"/>ticians, on public grounds, from acting in 
     <lb/>
     concert, has been raised in Parliament. The 
     <lb/>
     time had arrived when an appeal might, with 
     <lb/>
     propriety, be made to the patriotism of gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on both sides of the House to throw 
     <lb/>
     aside" —what? Their party measures? their 
     <lb/>
     political interests? No—" their personal dif<lb break="no"/>ferences! and to unite in one endeavor to 
     <lb/>
     advance the great interests of the country." 
     <lb/>
     A little further on he again mentions "the 
     <lb/>
     absence of public grounds 'for antagonism 
     <lb/>
     between them," and intimates plainly that 
     <lb/>
     " such a state of things was very prejudicial 
     <lb/>
     to the best interests of the province." As 
     <lb/>
     I have already stated, the people were 
     <lb/>
     rapidly coming to the same conclusion, and 
     <lb/>
     this evil would soon have been removed by 
     <lb/>
     their action at the elections, without resort<lb break="no"/>ing to any change in the Constitution.— 
     <lb/>
     Such were His Excellency's views, commu<lb break="no"/>nicated to his Council in a memorandum, 
     <lb/>
     and I rejoiced to hear them enunciated by 
     <lb/>
     him. They are views which, it held also 
     <lb/>
     by the people, would have led to a thorough 
     <lb/>
     cure for the evils under which we labored, 
     <lb/>
     even without resorting to Confederation, for 
     <lb/>
     the people themselves were beginning to 
     <lb/>
     see that their political leaders were too much 
     <lb/>
     under the influence of bitter personal feel<lb break="no"/>ings; prominence was no longer given to the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional dificulty of unequal represent<lb break="no"/>ation; it was dropped both by its friends 
     <lb/>
     and its opponents. Yet representation by 
     <lb/>
     population was a question of such political 
     <lb/>
     importance, that its satisfactory solution 
     <lb/>
     would justify the bringing about such a 
     <lb/>
     change as this. That was a sufficient motive 
     <lb/>
     to induce statesmen to join together and seek 
     <lb/>
     some way of escape from it. I think the 
     <lb/>
     scheme now submitted is perhaps the best 
     <lb/>
     that could have been found attainable, and I 
     <lb/>
     give its framers all credit for it. I am satis<lb break="no"/>fied with nine-tenths or perhaps more than 
     <lb/>
     nine-tenths of the whole, and I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to take the other tenth, if really necessary, 
     <lb/>
     for the sake of the rest. I think the very 
     <lb/>
     name, and the prestige of our larger union 
     <lb/>
     will have a desirable influence upon our future 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. It will infuse into us that feeling 
     <lb/>
     of national pride—those patriotic sentiments 
     <lb/>
     connected with our country, which it is worth 
     <lb/>
     much to possess. (Hear.) I think, also, that 
     <lb/>
     our credit in money matters will be improved 
     <lb/>
     by the union, and it is worth some sacrifice to 
     <lb/>
     accomplish such results. I believe, further, 
     <lb/>
     that when this scheme is completed it will 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     have the effect of attracting emigration, and 
     <lb/>
     thus adding largely to our population. As 
     <lb/>
    we are, in our presented isolated condition, 
     <lb/>we either fail to attract emigrants or do 
     <lb/>not manage to retain them ; but if we were 
     <lb/>known as one great country, we should find 
     <lb/>homes for many of those able-bodied, enter<lb break="no"/>prising and industrious men who constitute the 
     <lb/>great strength and wealth of a State. It would 
     <lb/>also, undoubtedly, promote our commerce and 
     <lb/>develope our trade and resources. It is well 
     <lb/>to weigh all these considerations; they may 
     <lb/>not promise advantages so great as some of 
     <lb/>the sanguine advocates of the measure pre<lb break="no"/>dict, but they are well entitled to fair and 
     <lb/>honest consideration. (Hear.) As to Con<lb break="no"/>federation cheapening our government, that 
     <lb/>idea, I think, is a fallacy; and here is one of 
     <lb/>the causes which may lead to future dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction, if the eyes of the people are not 
     <lb/>opened to it until too late. The proper and 
     <lb/>the true way to act is to let the fact be 
     <lb/>known, that so far from Confederation being 
     <lb/>likely to lessen the expenses of government, 
     <lb/>it will be directly the reverse, and that to 
     <lb/>these must be added the cost of those 
     <lb/>defences which are to be constructed—of 
     <lb/>this Intercolouial road which is to be a 
     <lb/>necessary part of the scheme—of these 
     <lb/>other works on the canals, &amp;c., we hear so 
     <lb/>much about. Confederation will, doubtless, 
     <lb/>be expensive; then why not say so—why not 
     <lb/>say to the peeple, " Here are "great advan<lb break="no"/>tages, but they will inevitably cost a large 
     <lb/>sum." I for one am willing to take these 
     <lb/>advantages at that cost. I have not analyzed 
     <lb/>the numerous figures set before us by my 
     <lb/>hon. friend from Niagara, for profusion and 
     <lb/>confusion in matters of figures in a speech 
     <lb/>are very much the same to me. I will not 
     <lb/>pretend to follow him. But I have such 
     <lb/>confidence in the financial ability of those 
     <lb/>who watched over our interests, that I am 
     <lb/>unwilling to receive, except with great cau<lb break="no"/>tion, those objections brought in figures 
     <lb/>against the measure. One honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>man remarked that the hand of an over<lb break="no"/>ruling Providence might be observed as 
     <lb/>bringing about this scheme and reconciling 
     <lb/>so many conflicting influences. That is 
     <lb/>very true. I delight to recognize an over<lb break="no"/>ruling Providence influencing the lives of 
     <lb/>individuals and nations. I rejoice that 
     <lb/>the blessing of an over-ruling Providence 
     <lb/>on the deliberations of this House is daily 
     <lb/>asked, and I have faith to believe it will 
     <lb/>be granted to us. But I should have

     the same comfortable feeling if the question 
     <lb/>
     were referred to the people; so that as an 
     <lb/>
     t in favor of our making an imme<lb break="no"/>diate decision does not amount to much, and 
     <lb/>
     it certainly does not impose on us the duty 
     <lb/>
     of hastily taking the whole scheme as it is. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I have endeavoured, hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, to show that I am guided by an 
     <lb/>
     honest, earnest desire to advance the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the count by the course I now propose 
     <lb/>
     to take in reference to this amendment, and 
     <lb/>
     I have endeavored to disabuse the minds of 
     <lb/>
     those who think that in supporting it I am 
     <lb/>
     acting in hostility to a scheme which I 
     <lb/>
     believe will be advantageous to the country, 
     <lb/>
     but the advantages of which I think cannot 
     <lb/>
     be secured without referring it to the people. 
     <lb/>
     I presume it is altogether likely—perhaps I 
     <lb/>
     may consider it a certainty—that this is to 
     <lb/>
     be the last time I shall appear as a represen<lb break="no"/>tative in the Council of my country. I am 
     <lb/>
     anxious, short as my parliamentary career 
     <lb/>
     has been and is probably destined to be, that 
     <lb/>
     it should he unsullied by anything that can 
     <lb/>
     even have the appearance of selfishness. I 
     <lb/>
     am, therefore, unwilling to record a vote 
     <lb/>
     which might either have the effect of making 
     <lb/>
     me a member for life, or of helping to take 
     <lb/>
     away the privilege which my constituents at 
     <lb/>
     present enjoy, of having a representative in 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BURE2">HON. Mr. BUREAU</persName>—It is not my in<lb break="no"/>tention to take art in the debate on the 
     <lb/>amendment which is now engaging the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of this Honorable House; but I really 
     <lb/>do not feel justified in passing over in silence 
     <lb/>the declaration which has just been made by 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Toronto Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>Ross) That gentleman said, with perfect 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">naiveté</hi>, that if the Ministry submitted a bill 
     <lb/>respecting the organization of the local 
     <lb/>governments, the course would be a bad one ; 
     <lb/>for, said he, diflicnlties would probably arise 
     <lb/>in relation to the matter, whic might result 
     <lb/>in the resignation of several members of the 
     <lb/>present Cabinet. In those few words the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Toronto has furnished the 
     <lb/>best argument in favor of the delay for which 
     <lb/>we ask ; but such was not his intention. In 
     <lb/>a similar sense, some other hon. members 
     <lb/>have, in my opinion, exhibited a degree of 
     <lb/>force and logic which is truly remarkable. 
     <lb/>But can it be possible to make a request 
     <lb/>more essentially legitimate in its character 
     <lb/>than that of the hon. member for Niagara? 
     <lb/>For my part, I do not think so. And indeed, 
     <lb/>what can be more reasonable than the wish 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     to know, and to be in a position to form a 
     <lb/>
     sound, complete and satisfactory opinion, both 
     <lb/>
     for ourselves and for our constituents, res<lb break="no"/>pecting the scheme which is proposed to us? 
     <lb/>as not this House a right to require the 
     <lb/>present Government, within a reasonable 
     <lb/>period, to lay before it, not only in a general 
     <lb/>way, but also and more especially in detail, 
     <lb/>the various aspects of the Constitution which 
     <lb/>it is wished to have voted with such strange 
     <lb/>and imprudent precipitation ? Let us re<lb break="no"/>member that sometimes no diflicnlty what<lb break="no"/>ever is raised to devoting an entire session 
     <lb/>to the consideration of a measure of second<lb break="no"/>ary importance. Last year no attempt was 
     <lb/>made to pass a new Militia Bill at railroad 
     <lb/>speed, as it is now proposed to do with the 
     <lb/>measure for Confederation ; on the contrary, 
     <lb/>all the time necessary to complete it and to 
     <lb/>examine it in all its aspects was devoted to 
     <lb/>its consideration. And yet, how immense 
     <lb/>the difference between these two measures, 
     <lb/>in regard to their importance and the solemn 
     <lb/>consequences which might result from them ! 
     <lb/>And further, it cannot be denied, the plan 
     <lb/>which it is sought to make us adopt is as yet 
     <lb/>but imperfectly known to the Canadian Le<lb break="no"/>gislature, and the people hardly know its 
     <lb/>outlines, not having yet had time to examine 
     <lb/>into it, so closely have our ministers invested 
     <lb/>it with mystery and secrecy. I consider that 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Tomato showed rather 
     <lb/>too much zeal in the cause of his friends 
     <lb/>when he proceeded to make that declaration, 
     <lb/>which was heard by the House with well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>marked surprise. I am prepared to acknow<lb break="no"/>ledge that in so doing he has done us a very 
     <lb/>great service. I have no doubt whatever, 
     <lb/>in fact. that as we have been told by the 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman, the disclosing of the organ<lb break="no"/>ization of the local governments during this 
     <lb/>phase of the discussion would, for the Admi<lb break="no"/>nistration of the day, be an act of imprudencc, 
     <lb/>and one which, it is highly probable, would 
     <lb/>subject it to serious difficulties. I am also 
     <lb/>of opinion that one of the difficulties, of by 
     <lb/>no means the least importance, which is feared 
     <lb/>is that respecting the distribution or division 
     <lb/>of the part of the public debt which will have  
     <lb/>to be borne by the different provinces. Indeed 
     <lb/>it may, with very great reason, he asked 
     <lb/>whether it will be possible to come to an un<lb break="no"/>derstanding on this point. With a degree 
     <lb/>of courage worthy of a better cause, the 
     <lb/>Ministry now comes to us and says : " First 
     <lb/>vote the Address, and afterwards we will lay 
     <lb/>before you the scheme for the organisation 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="310" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0310.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">310</fw>
 

     of the local governments." But let us note 
     <lb/>
     the contradiction in this on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     Government, and how illogical its conduct is. 
     <lb/>
     Let us for a moment suppose that this meas<lb break="no"/>ure gives rise to dificulties in the Cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     during the discussion on the details of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, of suficient importance to entail the 
     <lb/>
     resignation of the Administration. What 
     <lb/>
     happens? The Address having been voted 
     <lb/>
     by our Legislature, is sent to England, and 
     <lb/>
     whilst the Imperial Government is engaged 
     <lb/>
     in ratifying it and incorporating it in a bill, 
     <lb/>
     which is to become our Constitution, the 
     <lb/>
     present Ministry succumbs under the details 
     <lb/>
     of the scheme respecting the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. A new ministry succeeds them, an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the people probably takes place in 
     <lb/>
     the interval, and when the new Constitution 
     <lb/>
     comes to us from Great Britain, we have a 
     <lb/>
     Government and a Legislature ready to reject 
     <lb/>
     it before its promulgation. In view of such a 
     <lb/>
     prospect as this, ought we to be in a hurry to 
     <lb/>
     accede to the request of the Government and 
     <lb/>
     refuse the legitimate delay asked for by the 
     <lb/>
     motion now before this Honorable House? I 
     <lb/>
     have, then, considered that I ought not to 
     <lb/>
     pass over in silence the declaration of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Toronto, for I am of opinion 
     <lb/>
     that it is of a nature to convince us that pre<lb break="no"/>cipitation in so highly solemn a matter is 
     <lb/>
     most dangerous. The Constitution of a 
     <lb/>
     country should not be changed from base to 
     <lb/>
     summit until those who are appointed to 
     <lb/>
     watch over the public interests, and the very 
     <lb/>
     Constitution in question, have had time to see 
     <lb/>
     and to ascertain, in a positive manner, that 
     <lb/>
     such a change is necessary and called for by 
     <lb/>
     the people. (Hear, hear.)

     silence on the occasion of my first address 
     <lb/>
     ou the plan of Confederation now submitted 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
           

     for our consideration. I must refer here, 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen, to a wonderful incident 
     <lb/>
     of this afternoon's sitting. A declaration, 
     <lb/>
     novel in every respect to each one of us, fell 
     <lb/>
     from the lips of the Honorable the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Crown Lands, who has only had this one 
     <lb/>
     sole reason to offer us in explanation of, and 
     <lb/>
     excuse for, the precipitate haste with which 
     <lb/>
     his Government is endeavoring to obtain the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the new Constitution :—" We are 
     <lb/>
     anxious to obtain the vote of this House, to 
     <lb/>
     transmit it to New Brunswick and to the other 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces which are to enter into 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation." This, then, is the real 
     <lb/>
     reason of this incomprehensible and indecent 
     <lb/>
     haste, for I cannot believe that the reason 
     <lb/>
     given by the hon. member who sits immedi<lb break="no"/>ately opposite to me (Sir N. F. BELLEAU), in 
     <lb/>
     explanation of this haste, can be a serious one. 
     <lb/>
     It is diflicult, indeed, not to consideras some<lb break="no"/>what absurd the reason alleged by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Sir N. F. BELLEAU:—"The Ministry are 
     <lb/>
     anxious that this scheme should be adopted 
     <lb/>
     forthwith, because Lord PALMERSTON is 
     <lb/>
     already an old man, and might die at any 
     <lb/>
     moment." I would rather accept the reason 
     <lb/>
     given by the Hon. Minister of Crown Lands 
     <lb/>
     than that of my honorable friend, because 
     <lb/>
     I cannot believe hc was authorized to give 
     <lb/>
     it. Thus this House and the country now 
     <lb/>
     know the secret of this precipitate haste on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the Government, and I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt they will bear it in mind. But I will 
     <lb/>
     venture to enquire of the Honorable the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Crown Lands, who has given us 
     <lb/>
     this very absurd reason, whether he hopes 
     <lb/>
     to deceive the people of the Lower Provinces 
     <lb/>
     by the vote which he desires to precipitate. 
     <lb/>
     I will ask him whether it is to be desired 
     <lb/>
     that this House should forthwith give a vote 
     <lb/>
     on this question, a vote which will undoubt<lb break="no"/>edly have the effect of leading them into 
     <lb/>
     error as regards the feelings and opinions of 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     project of Confederation. Well, honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, I do not for one moment hesitate 
     <lb/>
     to declare to this House, that the fact alone 
     <lb/>
     of the anxiety of the Government to obtain 
     <lb/>
     forthwith a vote of this House on this im<lb break="no"/>portant measure, is that which ought most 
     <lb/>
     of all to put us on our guard, and ought to 
     <lb/>
     cause us to determine not to give it lightly, 
     <lb/>
     and in a manner unworthy of prudent and 
     <lb/>
     wise legislators. Indeed, honerable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, our vote will have a significance 
     <lb/>
     which it will be vain to seek to diminish. 
     <lb/>

     We constitute the highest branch of the
<lb/>Parliament of this country, and when the
<lb/>Lower Provinces hear that we have voted for
<lb/>this measure in the shape in which it has been
<lb/>laid before us, they will naturally and with
<lb/>reason believe that our vote has been given
<lb/>with a thorough knowledge of the matter, and
<lb/>that we fully indicate the popular feeling on
<lb/>this important question. They will never
<lb/>for a moment imagine that we have set at
<lb/>naught and ignored the opinions of those
<lb/>whom we represent in this House ; they will
<lb/>never believe that the country has been so little
<lb/>consulted in the matters as it in fact has been.
<lb/>I assert, therefore, honorable gentlemen, that
<lb/>the vote which it is sought to make us give
<lb/>to-day is calculated to deceive the people of
<lb/>the Lower Provinces, both as to the views
<lb/>of this Honorable House and as to the
<lb/>opinions of the vast majority of the people of
<lb/>this province, and that we cannot give it with
<lb/>satisfaction either to ourselves or to those
<lb/>whom we represent. I have already taken
<lb/>occasion to state before today, that the
<lb/>scheme of Confederation had not been sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us complete. I am prepared to
<lb/>prove this statement; I maintain that only
<lb/>one part of the scheme has been laid before
<lb/>us, and under these circumstances, I would
<lb/>ask this Honorable House, if it is prudent to
<lb/>accept and sanction that with which we are but
<lb/>imperfectly acquainted? When I accepted
<lb/>my constituents their nomination to
<lb/>the Legislative Council, I did so with the
<lb/>firm determination never to accept blindly
<lb/>the various measures which might be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted for my approval in this House. This
<lb/>resolution I have adhered to hitherto, and I
<lb/>hope thatI shall never forget it in the course
<lb/>of my public career. A few minutes ago I
<lb/>remarked, honorable gentlemen, that the
<lb/>plan of Confederation had not been sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us complete; I now propose to
<lb/>prove this assertion. By art. 6 of the 43rd res<lb break="no"/>olution, we perceive that the local legislatures
<lb/>will have the power of making laws in relation
<lb/>to education, saving, however, the rights and
<lb/>privileges enjoyed by the Catholic and Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minorities in relation to their separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools at the time of the union; so
<lb/>that by this resolution we are to affirm that
<lb/>the minorities shall be bound by the school
<lb/>laws which will be in force at the moment
<lb/>when Confederation will take effect. On
<lb/>the other hand, we are told that a measure
<lb/>will be brought down for the better protec<lb break="no"/>tion of the rights of the Protestant minority
<lb/>

<cb/>
in Lower Canada, whilst at the same time 
     <lb/>we are not informed whether the same ad<lb break="no"/>vantages will be accorded to the Catholic 
     <lb/>minority in Upper Canada. Thus these 
     <lb/>school laws form a portion of the scheme 
     <lb/>upon which we are called to vote, and if 
     <lb/>unfortunately, after we have adopted these 
     <lb/>resolutions we are unable to obtain jus<lb break="no"/>tice for the Upper Canadian minority, 
     <lb/>shall we not be guilty of having voted for the 
     <lb/>scheme without having known all about it? 
     <lb/>We ought then to be on our guard. If, as 
     <lb/>it is pretended, the measure will not endanger 
     <lb/>the rights of the Catholic minority in Upper 
     <lb/>Canada, why are we refused the details and 
     <lb/>the information which we ask to have 
     <lb/>afforded to us before pronouncing on the 
     <lb/>merits of the plan? I maintain that any one 
     <lb/>who desires that justice should be extended 
     <lb/>to the minorities in question, would not 
     <lb/>know how to vote as we are called upon to 
     <lb/>do. In the absence of the information which 
     <lb/>we are entitled to demand from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as to the nature of the guarantees to be 
     <lb/>offered by the new Constitution to the 
     <lb/>minorities of the two provinces of Canada, 
     <lb/>I do not for one instant hesitate to declare 
     <lb/>that this Honorable House is justified, and 
     <lb/>indeed fulfils a sacred duty in demanding the 
     <lb/>delay sought for by the motion of the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Niagara. If it should so happen 
     <lb/>that the people are called upon to pronounce 
     <lb/>on the merits of the measure, it becomes of 
     <lb/>the utmost necessity that we, their representa<lb break="no"/>tives, should be able to explain and point 
     <lb/>out to them the details of the scheme. We 
     <lb/>have then every reason to insist that this 
     <lb/>information should be supplied to us. The 
     <lb/>Premier will now permit me to put to him a 
     <lb/>question. May it not happen, after the adop<lb break="no"/>tion of these resolutions, that the Protestant 
     <lb/>majority of Upper Canada may ally itself 
     <lb/>with the Protestant minority of Lower 
     <lb/>Canada in the present Parliament, and de<lb break="no"/>prive the Catholic majority of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>of the rights which they are entitled to 
     <lb/>enjoy in relation to the education of their 
     <lb/>children ? Should such an event occur, I 
     <lb/>would ask the hon. Premier what means 
     <lb/>the aggrieved minority might be able to 
     <lb/>adopt in order to obtain justice? 
     <lb/>

     form of Confederation; but what I can never 
     <lb/>
     consent to is to vote for a Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     which I know neither the exact nature nor 
     <lb/>
     the details. The article which I have already 
     <lb/>
     quoted is one of those to which I desired 
     <lb/>
     more particularly to draw attention. I will 
     <lb/>
     now quote the 67th resolution. I find by 
     <lb/>
     this resolution " that the General Government 
     <lb/>
     will fulfil all engagements entered into, pre<lb break="no"/>vious to the union, with the Imperial Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, for the defence of the country." 
     <lb/>
     Now, strange to say, the authors of this docu<lb break="no"/>ment do not even take the trouble to state by 
     <lb/>
     whom such engagements must be made. No, 
     <lb/>
     they simply assert the obligation in the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the resolution I have just quoted. Sup<lb break="no"/>pose our Government had entered into an 
     <lb/>
     engagement to the extent of fifty millions 
     <lb/>
     of dollars, shall we—can we—affirm that the 
     <lb/>
     engagement was a necessary one, by voting 
     <lb/>
     for the measure without knowing the nature 
     <lb/>
     of the engagement? Coming now to the 
     <lb/>
     68th resolution, I find: " The General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment will cause to be completed, without 
     <lb/>
     delay, the Intercolonial Railway, from 
     <lb/>
     Rivière du Loup, through New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     to Truro, in Nova Scotia." Now, hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, I maintain that this is another 
     <lb/>
     portion of the plan with which we are not 
     <lb/>
     acquainted. We do not know what is to be 
     <lb/>
     the cost of this railway thus described in 
     <lb/>
     the resolution I have just read. Here, 
     <lb/>
     again, we are kept in the most complete 
     <lb/>
     ignorance by the present Government. An 
     <lb/>
     honorable member of this House has declared, 
     <lb/>
     that though the Intercolonial Railway were 
     <lb/>
     to cost fifty millions of dollars, we should not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate to support a measure for carrying it 
     <lb/>
     out ; for, even at that price—that exorbi<lb break="no"/>tant price—it would be for the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the country. Well, I ask you, would this 
     <lb/>
     House be acting in accordance with that 
     <lb/>
     spirit of wisdom and prudence which ought 
     <lb/>
     to characterize it, by voting blindly for such 
     <lb/>
     an enormous expenditure as that? I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe it, and for my part, I do not hesitate 
     <lb/>
     an instant to say that I would refuse. I am 
     <lb/>
     well aware, it is true, that the construction 
     <lb/>
     of this gigantic railway cannot cost so large 
     <lb/>
     a sum ; but it is generally admitted, both in 
     <lb/>
     this House and out of it, that the work 
     <lb/>
     cannot be done for less than twenty millions. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, does it not often happen that 
     <lb/>
     public works estimated to cost, say one 
     <lb/>
     million of dollars, are found to have cost, 
     <lb/>
     when finished, double and more than double 
     <lb/>
     that amount? This may happen with the 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
        

     Intercolonial Railway, which, it is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     clear, will cost more than is supposed; 
     <lb/>
     and I repeat it, this House ought to hesitate 
     <lb/>
     before sanctioning such an enormous expen<lb break="no"/>diture out of a public treasury already 
     <lb/>
     heavily charged, and which will scarcely be 
     <lb/>
     in a more flourishing position when the 
     <lb/>
     various British provinces of this continent 
     <lb/>
     are united under the Confederation. I am 
     <lb/>
     justified, then, in demanding that the details 
     <lb/>
     of the plan should be made known to us 
     <lb/>
     before we are called upon to sanction it. I 
     <lb/>
     have already stated that I do not pretend to 
     <lb/>
     be opposed to Federation of the provinces in 
     <lb/>
     every possible shape—that I might support 
     <lb/>
     a Confederation not of too onerous a charac<lb break="no"/>ter for this country—but it is obviously 
     <lb/>
     quite impossible for me to support a project 
     <lb/>
     of this kind, with which I am unacquainted, 
     <lb/>
     in its details and as a whole. It appears to 
     <lb/>
     me that the Ministry cannot complain if, 
     <lb/>
     under these circumstances, we vote against a 
     <lb/>
     project which we desired to know fully in 
     <lb/>
     order to form our opinions concerning it, 
     <lb/>
     and to ascertain that of the peeple we repre<lb break="no"/>sent. I do not think it can be pretended 
     <lb/>
     that this House is not entitled to make so just 
     <lb/>
     and reasonable a request. As I have shown, 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, if we accept the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     presented to us, we endanger the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the minorities in both sections of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince; we expose ourselves to the payment 
     <lb/>
     of enormous sums for the construction of 
     <lb/>
     a railway which may prove to be utterly 
     <lb/>
     useless for the defence of the country. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that, before undertaking 
     <lb/>
     such onerous charges, we ought to re<lb break="no"/>flect deeply and to weigh well all pos<lb break="no"/>sible chances of such serious eventualities. 
     <lb/>
     I am quite aware that certain hon. members 
     <lb/>
     of this House will never yield to the reasons 
     <lb/>
     I have advanced, nor shall I undertake to 
     <lb/>
     bring them round to my views, for I feel 
     <lb/>
     that all my efforts must be useless. The 
     <lb/>
     fact that we refuse to accept the measure 
     <lb/>
     proposed to us before we are acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     it, certainly does not imply, as it is stated 
     <lb/>
     and supposed, that we are opposed to every 
     <lb/>
     idea of Confederation. Another provision 
     <lb/>
     of the project which we cannot approve is 
     <lb/>
     that by which the constitution of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council is based on the nominative 
     <lb/>
     principle, instead of the elective principle 
     <lb/>
     which now prevails, as regards that branch 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislature, under our own Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I have already had occasion to ex<lb break="no"/>press my opinion as to the constitutional 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="313" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LC_1865-02-17_Page_0313.jpg"/>
        <fw type="num">313</fw>


     changes undergone by our own Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council, so that I need not recur to that sub<lb break="no"/>ject. The Hon. Commissioner of Crown 
     <lb/>
     Lands has asserted that we are justified in 
     <lb/>
     voting on the proposed reversal of the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution without an appeal to the people. 
     <lb/>
     I beg to differ from that opinion. I know 
     <lb/>
     the nature of a trust, whether civil or 
     <lb/>
     political; they both entail very much the 
     <lb/>
     same duties. Well, what is the charge en<lb break="no"/>trusted to us by our constituents? That of 
     <lb/>
     working out the present Constitution to the 
     <lb/>
     best of our understanding and of our judg<lb break="no"/>ment. Such is the power entrusted to us; 
     <lb/>
     but never have our electors authorized us, 
     <lb/>
     as it is now proposed to do, to destroy the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution itself and to enter into a political 
     <lb/>
     alliance with the other British provinces of 
     <lb/>
     this continent. An instance of a similar 
     <lb/>
     constitutional subversion, without the 
     <lb/>
     authorization of the people, is not to be 
     <lb/>
     found in the pages of history. It has been 
     <lb/>
     stated in this House that the project of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was known to a portion of the 
     <lb/>
     people, and that there was nothing to pre<lb break="no"/>vent its adoption being pressed. Here again, 
     <lb/>
     I beg to differ with the hon. members who 
     <lb/>
     express that opinion. I think that even 
     <lb/>
     though the project were, as stated, known 
     <lb/>
     by a portion of the people, that would not 
     <lb/>
     be a reason for precipitating its adoption, 
     <lb/>
     for the plan interests the whole country 
     <lb/>
     generally, and it is not sufficient that it 
     <lb/>
     should be acceptable to a certain portion of 
     <lb/>
     the inhabitants, but to the great mass of the 
     <lb/>
     people. Moreover, if the public meetings 
     <lb/>
     already held in Lower Canada serve to in<lb break="no"/>dicate the popular opinion relative to this 
     <lb/>
     question, in this section of the country 
     <lb/>
     at all events, it may fearlessly be said 
     <lb/>
     that the project has been condemned 
     <lb/>
     in fifteen counties. Will any one ven<lb break="no"/>ture to pretend that Lower Canada is to 
     <lb/>
     be of no account in the Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and that Upper Canada alone has a 
     <lb/>
     right to make its voice heard ; that only its 
     <lb/>
     approval or disapproval of the scheme can 
     <lb/>
     entail the adoption or rejection of that 
     <lb/>
     scheme? Most assuredly, I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     that any one would ever venture to enunciate 
     <lb/>
     such a pretension. I know of but one single 
     <lb/>
     county in Lower Canada which authorized 
     <lb/>
     its representative to vote on the scheme in 
     <lb/>
     question as he should think fit. I therefore 
     <lb/>
     consider that I am justified in saying, that 
     <lb/>
     the reason which induces the Government to 
     <lb/>
     cause this measure to be adopted without 
     <lb/>
     submitting all its details, is that it fears to 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     have those details known by the people, who 
     <lb/>
     no doubt would have no course left save to 
     <lb/>
     reject them. After having displayed Con<lb break="no"/>federation clothed in the most brilliant colors, 
     <lb/>
     the Administration fears to allow the people 
     <lb/>
     to examine it in its true light, and as it is 
     <lb/>
     intended to thrust it upon them. I have 
     <lb/>
     already stated that throughout the whole of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, but one county has been 
     <lb/>
     found which granted to its representative the 
     <lb/>
     privilege of voting on this question according 
     <lb/>
     to his own judgment. In all the remaining 
     <lb/>
    counties in which the people have been called 
     <lb/>together to pronounce upon it, the scheme of 
     <lb/>Confederation has been formally condemned. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GUEV1">HON. MR. GUEVREMONT</persName>—Several 
     <lb/>
     counties pronounced themselves in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme; among others, the county of 
     <lb/>
     Vaudreuil. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—I am not aware 
     <lb/>
     that the county of Vaudreuil voted in favor 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation. The honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu had also mentioned the county 
     <lb/>
     of Richelieu as one of those which had not 
     <lb/>
     rejected the scheme of Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GUEV1">HON. MR. GUEVREMONT</persName>—The meet<lb break="no"/>ing in question did not condemn Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. It merely declared itself in favor of 
     <lb/>
     certain resolutions which were submitted to 
     <lb/>
     it, which demanded that the people should 
     <lb/>
     be consulted as to the proposed constitutional 
     <lb/>
     changes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—It is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     true that the county of Richelieu never 
     <lb/>
     condemned the details of the measure, and 
     <lb/>
     for a very simple reason: the Government 
     <lb/>
     had never, allowed them to be known, and 
     <lb/>
     still persists at this present time in keeping 
     <lb/>
     the country in ignorance of them. But the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman admits that the county 
     <lb/>
     of Richelieu directed its representative to 
     <lb/>
     demand an appeal to the people. To say 
     <lb/>
     that Lower Canada is favorable to the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, is to make an assertion to 
     <lb/>
     which the public meetings which have been 
     <lb/>
     held within the last month or two give the 
     <lb/>
     lie in the most formal manner. I know what 
     <lb/>
     to think of the expression of public opinion 
     <lb/>
     in the district of Montreal; as to the district 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, perhaps the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who represent the several divisions com<lb break="no"/>prised in it will be good enough to tell 
     <lb/>
     me whether or not there have been any 
     <lb/>
     meetings in favor of Confederation ? Until 
     <lb/>
     I am shewn that the project has been ap<lb break="no"/>proved there, I shall venture to believe that 
     <lb/>
     in the district of Quebec, as in the district 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal, public opinion has not approved 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">314</fw>
      

     of the proposed Confederation. I do not 
     <lb/>
     wish to assert that the country at large is 
     <lb/>
     averse to any idea of Confederation, but I 
     <lb/>
     maintain that it cannot be in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     scheme with the details of which it is un<lb break="no"/>acquainted, and of the entirety of which it 
     <lb/>
     is ignorant. The most effectual means of 
     <lb/>
     providing for the defence of a country is to 
     <lb/>
     make the people attached to the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     of the country ; to attempt to force a con<lb break="no"/>stitution upon them is, in plain language, 
     <lb/>
     to impel them towards anarchy. Ah! we 
     <lb/>
     are already surrounded by dangers enough 
     <lb/>
     to abstain from aggravating our position. 
     <lb/>
     Let us conduct ourselves so that the people 
     <lb/>
     may be attached to their constitution, and 
     <lb/>
     then we may rest assured that they will be 
     <lb/>
     ready to defend it when it is threatened. 
     <lb/>
     Undoubtedly, it is not by acting as we are 
     <lb/>
     now doing that we shall attain that result. 
     <lb/>
     The reason assigned by the Honorable Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Crown Lands for urging on this 
     <lb/>
     measure does not appear to me to he suffi<lb break="no"/>cient. We are not here to please the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces or to legislate in their inter<lb break="no"/>ests, but we are here to preserve the rights 
     <lb/>
     of our fellow-citizens. We did not come 
     <lb/>
     here with a predetermined resolution to 
     <lb/>
     throw impediments in the way of any plan 
     <lb/>
     of union. We are all interested in the pros<lb break="no"/>perity and greatness of our country. The 
     <lb/>
     last time I had the honor to address this 
     <lb/>
     Honorable House, I stated that with respect 
     <lb/>
     to the questions which possessed the highest 
     <lb/>
     interest for Lower Canada, the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Confederation would be a legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     that is to say, that we should be at the 
     <lb/>
     mercy of Upper Canada and the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. I expressed that opinion in good 
     <lb/>
     faith, and if I was incorrect in my conjec<lb break="no"/>tures, I hope that the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Government will be good enough to enlighten 
     <lb/>
     me on the subject, and point out my error. 
     <lb/>
     Such was not done at the time, for I cannot 
     <lb/>
     accept as a satisfactory reply the few expla<lb break="no"/>nations given on the subject by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member who sits opposite to me. I say that 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government will have power to 
     <lb/>
     declare that religious corporations, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, shall not be allowed to hold real 
     <lb/>
     estate of more than a certain value—more 
     <lb/>
     than is required for the immediate necessities 
     <lb/>
     of their establishments. It will also have 
     <lb/>
     power to enact that there shall be no con<lb break="no"/>nection between Church and State. I say 
     <lb/>
     that the powers of the Federal Government 
     <lb/>
     will be so great that Lower Canada will he a 
     <lb/>
     cypher in the affairs which most concern her.

     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—If the honorable

     <lb/>
     when I ask questions in sober earnest con<lb break="no"/>cerning the affairs of the country, when I 
     <lb/>
     ask for information on so important a matter, 
     <lb/>
     I can get no answer but an ironical one. I 
     <lb/>
     ask for information, because I confess, for 
     <lb/>
     my part, that I may be mistaken in my 
     <lb/>
     opinions on this matter. My opinions are 
     <lb/>
     not infallible any more than those of the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Quebec Conference—any 
     <lb/>
     more than those of the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members of the Ministr ; audit is for that 
     <lb/>
     very reason that I see information which 
     <lb/>
     may serve to enlighten me and enable me to 
     <lb/>
     form a correct judgment on the question. 
     <lb/>
     Have those who devised this scheme the 
     <lb/>
     presumption to think that they are not liable 
     <lb/>
     to mistake? When I ask for the details of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme in the name of my constituents, 
     <lb/>
     I am answered ironically. But I know what 
     <lb/>
     such answers are worth. I know that some 
     <lb/>
     persons have recourse to irony when they 
     <lb/>
     have no serious answer to make, when they 
     <lb/>
     have no solid reasons to give. I know what 
     <lb/>
     discussion is; and, if I have not often mixed 
     <lb/>
     in the debates of this Honorable House, I 
     <lb/>
     have argued at the bar, and I am perfectly 
     <lb/>
     aware that those who have no vali reasons 
     <lb/>
     to oppose to the pleas of their adversaries, 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to shift their ground and blink the 
     <lb/>
     issue, by calling attention to some minor 
     <lb/>
     point and calling in the aid of irony. If I 
     <lb/>
     am denied the explanations which I claim in 
     <lb/>
     this lace, how can I answer the questions 
     <lb/>
     which my constituents have a right to ask 
     <lb/>
     me ? But I must now address myself to the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the appointment of members 
     <lb/>
     by <hi rendition="simple:italic">mandamus</hi> which is to be introduced into 
     <lb/>
     the new Constitution of the Federal Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council. When I heard the honorable 
     <lb/>
     and gallant Knight tell the history of the 
     <lb/>
     last moments of the Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     sitting under that authority, I took it as the 
     <lb/>
     strongest sentence of condemnation of the 
     <lb/>
     present scheme. He told us, in effect, that 
     <lb/>
     those members who had been appointed for life 
     <lb/>
     were honorable men, who by their position 
     <lb/>

     and their integrity were rightly entitled to 
     <lb/>
    carry their heads erect; whereas, when they 
     <lb/>passed along the streets, it was with heads 
     <lb/>drooping. Why is this? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     HON SIR E. P. TACHÉ- I did not say 
     <lb/>
     that they hung their heads as they walked the 
     <lb/>
     streets. I said they were honorable men 
     <lb/>
     who had a right to carry their heads high 
     <lb/>
     wherever they went, but that they were 
     <lb/>
     averse to coming here to sit in the Council 
     <lb/>
     on account of the prejudices of public opinion 
     <lb/>
     which had been misguided. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—The unanimous 
     <lb/>
     opinion of a country is not so misguided, 
     <lb/>
     and the opinion of the country was unani<lb break="no"/>mous in condemning the system of nomina<lb break="no"/>tion to the Council by the Crown. In order 
     <lb/>
     to produce as great unanimity of public 
     <lb/>
    opinion as prevailed in regard to that system, 
     <lb/>cause which leads to it must be slow and 
     <lb/>deep-seated—the grounds of dissatisfaction 
     <lb/>must be real. Both Lower and Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada must, have suffered long under that 
     <lb/>system, to condemn it as they both did ; and 
     <lb/>I regret deeply to hear from the honorable 
     <lb/>and gallant Knight that he is willing to 
     <lb/>return to it. It may be that as men advance 
     <lb/>in years they may change their views and 
     <lb/>opinions; but it seems to me that they ought 
     <lb/>not to change them in so short a space of 
     <lb/>time as the honorable and gallant Knight 
     <lb/>has changed his in regard to the Constitution 
     <lb/>of the Legislative Council. It is not so 
     <lb/>very long since the document which has 
     <lb/>been read this evening was signed. I say, 
     <lb/>then, that the history told us by the honora<lb break="no"/>ble and gallant Knight is the condemnation 
     <lb/>of the system now sought to he introduced. 
     <lb/>After what the honorable and gallant Knight 
     <lb/>has said about the councillors appointed by 
     <lb/>the Crown, with what grace can the new 
     <lb/>councillors come here to take their seats? 
     <lb/>Will not the prejudice against them be 
     <lb/>at than ever? inasmuch as it will be 
     <lb/>said that those who have voted for the 
     <lb/>scheme now before us have done it to keep 
     <lb/>their seats as long as they live; What 
     <lb/>respect can the people feel for such a House? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—We know that 
     <lb/>you will not barter the rights of the people

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—Nor for a dish of

            <cb/>
            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TACH1">HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ</persName>—It is you who 
     <lb/>
     say that the seats for life are a bait for coun<lb break="no"/>cillors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. MR. OLIVIER</persName>—I see the meaning 
     <lb/>
     of the honorable and gallant Knight, and 
     <lb/>
     when I am told ironically that I would not 
     <lb/>
     barter the rights of the people for a mess of 
     <lb/>
     pottage, I have a right to say that I would 
     <lb/>
     not sell them even for a dish of gold ; for so 
     <lb/>
     far, thank God! no government have ever 
     <lb/>
     reckoned me among those who ask their 
     <lb/>
     favors. I live by my labor, and want nothing 
     <lb/>
     from the Government. I took notice of an 
     <lb/>
     expression made use of by the honorable 
     <lb/>
     and gallant Knight in speaking of the last 
     <lb/>
     moments of the legislative Council appointed 
     <lb/>
     by the Crown. He told us that to restore 
     <lb/>
     the credit of the Legislative Council it had 
     <lb/>
     been found necessary to make it elective ; 
     <lb/>
     but this was not the sole inducement for the 
     <lb/>
     change; there was another motive quite as 
     <lb/>
     reasonable for making the Council elective, 
     <lb/>
     and this motive was that in causing the 
     <lb/>
     Councillors to be elected, they would be 
     <lb/>
     taken from among all parties in the country, 
     <lb/>
     and would, therefore, represent the public 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the different parties in it. There 
     <lb/>
     was a time, under the old order of things, 
     <lb/>
     when the opinions of two or three men 
     <lb/>
     residing in the cities ot Quebec and Mont<lb break="no"/>real formed the public opinion of all Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. This had a bad effect, for the 
     <lb/>
     public opinions of the different parties in 
     <lb/>
     the country ought to be represented in this 
     <lb/>
     House as well as in the other. It was for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of attaining this end that the 
     <lb/>
     country was broken up into divisions, that 
     <lb/>
     it was required that the councillors elected 
     <lb/>
     should be residents in the divisions, or 
     <lb/>
     should be the owners of real estate within 
     <lb/>
     their limits of the value of £2,000; but 
     <lb/>
     under the system of Crown nominations to 
     <lb/>
     seats in this House, the choice might fall, 
     <lb/>
     as it formerly did, on persons residing in the 
     <lb/>
     large cities; it would not be difficult for 
     <lb/>
     them to acquire £1,000 worth of real estate 
     <lb/>
     in the divisions, and the country would not 
     <lb/>
     be equally represented in this House. An<lb break="no"/>other reason why the elective system is 
     <lb/>
     preferable to that of nominations by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown is that on every fresh election the 
     <lb/>
     newly elected member represents the opinions 
     <lb/>
     of the people then prevailing, whereas coun<lb break="no"/>cillors appointed for life may sometimes 
     <lb/>
     represent public opinion as it existed twenty 
     <lb/>

     years before. The progress of the country 
     <lb/>
     requires that from time to time men should 
     <lb/>
     enter this House as representatives of the

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV3">HON. Mr. OLIVIER</persName>—I shall now en<lb break="no"/>deavor to answer an objection made by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lands 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL) to the motion of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Niagara (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     CURRIE). He would make it appear that 
     <lb/>
     the motion is inconsistent with the position 
     <lb/>
     taken by the honorable member who seconded 
     <lb/>
     the motion, because he declared himself as 
     <lb/>
     favorable to Confederation. For my part, I 
     <lb/>
     can see no inconsistency in the proceeding 
     <lb/>
     of the honorable member, who merely asks 
     <lb/>
     that time be allowed that the people may 
     <lb/>
     give their opinions on the question. He 
     <lb/>
     does not care in what manner it is allowed. 
     <lb/>
     If the Government do allow time for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose, it will rest with them to say whether 
     <lb/>
     the question shall be submitted to the peeple 
     <lb/>
     by means of a general election, or some 
     <lb/>
     other way. The amendment of the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Niagara does not suggest 
     <lb/>
     any particular way of submitting the ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the country. He only asks that 
     <lb/>
     it be so submitted, leaving to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to choose the most convenient method 
     <lb/>
     of doing it. And this is exactly the position 
     <lb/>
     which I have myself taken. I have told 
     <lb/>
     honorable members who seemed to believe 
     <lb/>
     me altogether opposed to Confederation, that 
     <lb/>
     it is not the case, that I only want time to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain whether the eople are in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme or not. Only if the project is 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the people, it is desirable that 
     <lb/>
     it be presented to them in all its details, 
     <lb/>
     and not in the skeleton shape in which it 
     <lb/>
     is now laid before us. I have no intention 
     <lb/>
     to weary the attention of the House, but I 
     <lb/>
     thought it right to express my views and 
     <lb/>
     say why I intend to vote in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     motion of the honorable member for Ni<lb break="no"/>agara. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The amendment moved by the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Cnam was then put to the vote, and lost 
     <lb/>
     on the following division :—

     MONDAY, February 20, 1865. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     HON. MR. AIKINS said — Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men, when I last had the honor of address<lb break="no"/>ing the House, it will be remembered by 
     <lb/>
     those hon. gentlemen who were present that I 
     <lb/>
     spoke very strongly in relation to the changes 
     <lb/>
     contemplated by these resolutions in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to this Chamber. Since then, although 
     <lb/>
     I have listened very attentively to the 
     <lb/>
     speeches of honorable gentlemen, I have 
     <lb/>
     heard no good reason to convince me that the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle as re ds this honorable 
     <lb/>
     House should be abolished. It has been 
     <lb/>
     asserted by those who are strong advocates 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, that if any amendment 
     <lb/>
     is passed affecting the general principles of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions, it will be considered a defeat ; 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme will have to be considered 
     <lb/>
     again, and that negotiations with the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces wil have to be resumed 
     <lb/>
     in order to meet the altered view of the case. 
     <lb/>
     Had the amendment of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Wellington (Hon. Mr. SANBOBN) been car<lb break="no"/>ried, this might have been the case ; but as 
     <lb/>
     the motion which I amabout to move applies 
     <lb/>
     only to the Canadas, that would not be so. 
     <lb/>
     It will be remembered that that amendment 
     <lb/>
     afirmed not only the elective principle for all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, but that the life members who 
     <lb/>
     are now sitting in this House should continue 
     <lb/>
     to hold their seats. It went further and 
     <lb/>
     declared that a number to correspond with 
     <lb/>
     the life members should be admitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Chamber from the Maritime Provinces. In 
     <lb/>
     referring to the vote which was taken on this 
     <lb/>
     amendment, I find that in the 4l votes cast 
     <lb/>
     against it, 11 of the life members of the 
     <lb/>
     House voted against, while only three voted 
     <lb/>
     for it ; thus they, by a large majority vote, 
     <lb/>
     negatived the principles therein affirmed. I 
     <lb/>
     refer to this particularly, for this reason, that 
     <lb/>
     the ground may be taken by the lilc mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this Chamber that my amendment is 
     <lb/>
     specially directed against, and if carried, 
     <lb/>
     would be applicable to these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>
            </p>-->
