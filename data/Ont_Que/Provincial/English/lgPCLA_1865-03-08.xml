    <!--        <p>               
     the gentlemen on the Treasury benches, is 
     <lb/>
     most monstrous. (Hear, hear.) I cannot 
     <lb/>
     say that under other circumstances, such an 
     <lb/>
     appeal as has just been made from the decision 
     <lb/>
     of the Chair would have been taken, but in 
     <lb/>
     this instance there was no other course left 
     <lb/>
     to the minority to show that they had de<lb break="no"/>manded most important information in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the scheme under discussion. Whe<lb break="no"/>ther it be until a direct appeal can be had to 
     <lb/>
     the people by a general election, or by petitions, 
     <lb/>
     I say the gravity of the question calls for de<lb break="no"/>lay. Never has such extraordinary action 
     <lb/>
     been taken by any government, whether weak 
     <lb/>
     or strong, as has been taken by honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR. M. C. CAMERON—The Government 
     <lb/>
     having endeavored to checkmate the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to their scheme in the tyrannical way in 
     <lb/>
     which they have done, I think it is only fair 
     <lb/>
     to defeat their object and to stalemate them, 
     <lb/>
     because in point of fact it will amount to that 
     <lb/>
     if we succeed in this motion. I think honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen will admit that in this great 
     <lb/>
     and momentous change which is going to take 
     <lb/>
     place, the people who sent us here are as 
     <lb/>
    deeply interested as we are. They sent us 
     <lb/>here to make laws under the Constitution as 
     <lb/>established, not to overturn the Constitution ; 
     <lb/>and before such a violent change of Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion is made as will, undoubtedly, plunge us 
     <lb/>into most serious expenses, there ought to be 
     <lb/>given them an opportunity of saying whether 
     <lb/>or not they concur in the change proposed. 
     <lb/>It is for this reason I second the resolution in 
     <lb/>amendment, and I hope we shall have for it 
     <lb/>the support of those honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>who, though supporters of the Government, 
     <lb/>have expressed such marked dissent from the 
     <lb/>policy of shutting off amendments by mov<lb break="no"/>ing the previous question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     HON. ATTY. GEN. CARTIER said—With 
     <lb/>
     reference to this motion, I have to raise the 
     <lb/>
     same point of order that I brought against 
     <lb/>
     the other one. I beg to say at the out<lb break="no"/>set that the statement that there is to 
     <lb/>
     be no other opportunity of bringing for<lb break="no"/>ward a motion in favor of submitting the 
     <lb/>
     scheme to the people, is all clap-trap. The 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Peel has given a 
     <lb/>
     notice of a motion on that subject, as a sub<lb break="no"/>stantial proposition on which every hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman will have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     recording his vote in a regular way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     [The honorable gentleman then went on to 
     <lb/>
     discuss the point of order, giving several 
     <lb/>
     reasons for considering it irregular. The dis<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>cussion of the points raised was also taken 
     <lb/>
     part in by Hon. Messrs. GALT, HOLTON, 
     <lb/>
     DORION, J. S. MACDONALD, and Mr. MORRIS] 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     THE SPEAKER ruled the motion out 
     <lb/>
     of order. He said that the practice in such 
     <lb/>
     cases appeared to be for the Speaker to 
     <lb/>
     eliminate from such motions all that was 
     <lb/>
     irregular, and if the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     who prepared the motion consented to that, 
     <lb/>
     to put it to the House as it then stood. If 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member would not consent, why 
     <lb/>
     the motion fell to the ground. If the honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Hochelaga would consent, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, to his eliminating from the motion 
     <lb/>
     all but that which referred to the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment, he (the Speaker) would put it to the 
     <lb/>
     House. If not, he would be obliged to rule 
     <lb/>
     it out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. DORION having declined to 
     <lb/>
     allow his motion to be interfered with, it was 
     <lb/>
     accordingly ruled out of order, the amend<lb break="no"/>ment of the Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     CARTIER was agreed to, and the debate was 
     <lb/>
     adjourned until three o'clock the next day.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAM2">MR. CHAMBERS</persName> said—The position of 
     <lb/>
     the speaker who comes towards the last in a 
     <lb/>
     debate is, if disadvantageous in some respects, 
     <lb/>
     at least advantageous in others. If from 
     <lb/>
     the ability of gentlemen who have preceded 
     <lb/>
     him, and from their logical and argument<lb break="no"/>ative powers, most that could have been said 
     <lb/>
     has been said—if, from the ample store of 
     <lb/>
     knowledge they possess, numerous ideas 
     <lb/>
     have been advanced, and logical conclusions 
     <lb/>
     drawn therefrom, there is at least this advan<lb break="no"/>tage to their successors in the debate, that 
     <lb/>
     they have the benefit of those conclusions, 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of those ideas and of that 
     <lb/>
     knowledge. And although a subsequent 
     <lb/>
     speaker may be unable to advance new 
     <lb/>
     theories, or even adduce new arguments, he 
     <lb/>
     can at least compare the opinions and the 
     <lb/>
     views of those who have preceded him. I may 
     <lb/>
     state in the outset that 1 had hoped, at the 
     <lb/>
     commencement of this debate, to have heard 
     <lb/>
     it announced that this Legislature would be 
     <lb/>
     allowed the privilege of amending such of 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions submitted as they might, upon 
     <lb/>
     earnest and careful examination, have deemed 
     <lb/>
     necessary. I had hoped, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
     <lb/>
     some latitude would be allowed to this Legis<lb break="no"/>lature in suggesting improvements and 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="771" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0771.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">771</fw>
            
     
     amendments to the resolutions, which do 
     <lb/>
     appear to me to have been resolved upon 
     <lb/>
     with some degree of haste for matters fraught 
     <lb/>
     with such vital interest and importance to 
     <lb/>
     these provinces. If indeed, sir, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who so recently held their deli<lb break="no"/>berations in this city had been composed of 
     <lb/>
     men perfect in intellect, and possessing 
     <lb/>
     intelligence unalloyed by the baser ingredient 
     <lb/>
     of ordinary humanity—liability to err, then 
     <lb/>
     it would. I say, have seemed more consistent 
     <lb/>
     to ask this or any other legislature to adopt 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution which they had framed for us 
     <lb/>
     and for posterity without amendments, to 
     <lb/>
     ask us to receive, as we would or as we do, 
     <lb/>
     the articles of our religious faith—to ask us 
     <lb/>
     to have faith, and to believe that these del<lb break="no"/>egates had embodied in these resolutions all 
     <lb/>
     the requisites and necessaries for a perfect 
     <lb/>
     Constitution. I had hoped, sir, we should 
     <lb/>
     be able to apply ourselves to the calm, delib<lb break="no"/>erate, impartial consideration of these impor<lb break="no"/>tant resolutions, and, being divested of all 
     <lb/>
     party spirit, endeavor to arrive at such con<lb break="no"/>clusions as would be advantageous to all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. But, sir, notwithstanding all 
     <lb/>
     this; however much it may have been 
     <lb/>
     desired, and whatever alterations we may 
     <lb/>
     have wished for ; whatever further benefits 
     <lb/>
     and advantages Upper Canada may have 
     <lb/>
     desired to secure in this great national co-<lb break="yes"/>
     partnership ; and although I should myself 
     <lb/>
     have preferred alterations in some of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, as well as in some of the details, 
     <lb/>
     yet I am not, after having listened patiently 
     <lb/>
     and anxiously to the able arguments in favor 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation, as well as against it—I am 
     <lb/>
     not, I repeat, prepared to state that I will 
     <lb/>
     take upon myself to say that Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     as a scheme, should be rejected—that I will 
     <lb/>
     state that I shall vote against the creation of 
     <lb/>
     a new nationality. (Hear, hear.) I will 
     <lb/>
     state some reasons why I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     do so. In the first place, when I look abroad 
     <lb/>
     and see the neighboring American Republic 
     <lb/>
     engaged in one of the moat terrible and 
     <lb/>
     disastrous wars that has ever racked this 
     <lb/>
     continent ; when I read in almost every 
     <lb/>
     journal issuing from the press of that country 
     <lb/>
     anathemas against the British Empire ; when 
     <lb/>
     I see that press teeming with threats against 
     <lb/>
     this country ; when I know that that nation 
     <lb/>
     has by sea a navy prepared to cope with the 
     <lb/>
     strong powers of the old world, and a force 
     <lb/>
     on land, in point of numbers at least, aston<lb break="no"/>ishing the generals of the most advanced 
     <lb/>
     of warlike nations—when, I say, I see that 
     <lb/>
     nation in a warlike, and not only in a war<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
            like, but in a threatening attitude towards 
     <lb/>
     us, I am led to consider, as paramount to 
     <lb/>
     every other consideration, what ought to be 
     <lb/>
     done for the safety of this country. To 
     <lb/>
     preserve its territory from invasion, to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the lives and property of its subjects, 
     <lb/>
     is, I conceive, the first important duty to<lb break="no"/>wards which the attention of every govern 
     <lb/>
     ment should be directed. (Hear.) Then, 
     <lb/>
     sir, upon the well-understood maxim that 
     <lb/>
     union is strength, I am inclined to believe 
     <lb/>
     that the union of the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Provinces would give strength to us all. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I confess I fail to see a 
     <lb/>
     source of weakness in this union, as is very 
     <lb/>
     ingeniously argued by some hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposed to this scheme <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi>. It does 
     <lb/>
     appear to me that the very political and 
     <lb/>
     national status given to these provinces by 
     <lb/>
     a union, would become immediately a source 
     <lb/>
     of strength ; that the very new name to be 
     <lb/>
     given to the new nationality would be an 
     <lb/>
     immense fortification of defence in itself. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) When, sir, I consider the 
     <lb/>
     interest evinced by the people of England, 
     <lb/>
     the people of France, and, I may say, of all 
     <lb/>
     Europe, the very apprehension that seems 
     <lb/>
     to exist with regard to this Confederation of 
     <lb/>
     the British North American Provinces, it 
     <lb/>
     appears to me that the very announcement 
     <lb/>
     of the creation of this new nationality has 
     <lb/>
     given us already a position and a strength 
     <lb/>
     which in the palmiest days of the old <hi rendition="simple:italic">régime</hi> 
     <lb/>
     we might never have hoped for. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) When I remember, sir, that great 
     <lb/>
     Constitutions in the old world have been 
     <lb/>
     founded in the blood of contending nations ; 
     <lb/>
     that in the Mother Country the heirs 
     <lb/>
     of contending houses, at times through 
     <lb/>
     various centuries, struggled for supremacy ; 
     <lb/>
     and that authority, power and good govern<lb break="no"/>ment have been established only after being 
     <lb/>
     wrenched from opposing factions by the 
     <lb/>
     sword—when I remember, sir, that history 
     <lb/>
     records the revolution which terminated the 
     <lb/>
     long struggle between the sovereigns in 
     <lb/>
     England and their parliaments—how, from 
     <lb/>
     union, order and freedom, established only 
     <lb/>
     by the sword, sprung a prosperity hitherto 
     <lb/>
     unknown in the annals of human affairs ; 
     <lb/>
     when I trace their history from the days of 
     <lb/>
     feudalism down to the present, I am led to 
     <lb/>
     believe that if we have the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     securing greatness, prosperity, and an estab<lb break="no"/>lished and well-regulated freedom, compar<lb break="no"/>ing favorably with all that is enjoyed by the 
     <lb/>Mother Country, and without the cost of a 
     <lb/>single drop of blood, and, if the financial 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="772" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0772.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">772</fw>
            
     statements are correct, with little loss, if 
     <lb/>
     any, of treasure, we would not act wisely in 
     <lb/>
     letting pass the opportunity. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I think on the first proposition, that our 
     <lb/>
     defensive position would be strengthened 
     <lb/>
     by this union. First, because were we to 
     <lb/>
     remain as we at present stand, separate 
     <lb/>
     provinces, there would be greater temptation 
     <lb/>
     to the adjoining republic to acquire posses<lb break="no"/>sion of our territory, believing, as they 
     <lb/>
     undoubtedly would, that this could be done 
     <lb/>
     with advantage and little cost to themselves ; 
     <lb/>
     whereas the magnitude of our national 
     <lb/>
     position, under the Confederation, would be 
     <lb/>
     the means, I am satisfied, of deterring them 
     <lb/>
     from such an enterprise. And I am satisfied, 
     <lb/>
     too, that the people of England would be 
     <lb/>
     more alive to our interests, more willing to 
     <lb/>
     spend their lives and their treasure in assist<lb break="no"/>ing in our defence, composing a strong, 
     <lb/>
     united, new nationality on this continent, than 
     <lb/>
     they would if we were to remain isolated 
     <lb/>
     colonial dependencies. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     believe the very intimation of this Confed<lb break="no"/>eration has awakened the world to the great<lb break="no"/>ness, the vastness of the resources of this 
     <lb/>
     country. (Hear, hear.) That these views 
     <lb/>
     are shared in by eminent statesmen in Eu<lb break="no"/>rope is also a significant fact. Lord HOUGH<lb break="no"/>TON, on seconding the Address on the late 
     <lb/>
     Speech from the Throne, very emphatically 
     <lb/>
     declared, in regard to that portion in which 
     <lb/>
     allusion is made to Confederation, " that he 
     <lb/>
     was glad of this movement, because he con<lb break="no"/>fessed that he believed the future of the 
     <lb/>
     world rested not in isolated municipalities, 
     <lb/>
     but in great empires." And the Earl of 
     <lb/>
     DERBY, too, in his remarks on that occasion, 
     <lb/>
     also said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Under the circumstances, I view with the ut<lb break="no"/>most satisfaction that most important step to 
     <lb/>
     which Her Majesty's Speech refers—the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration of the Canadian Provinces. I hope to 
     <lb/>
     see in that Confederation of the Canadian Prov<lb break="no"/>inces a determination to constitute themselves a 
     <lb/>
     power strong enough, with the aid of this country 
     <lb/>
     (which I am sure will never be withheld from 
     <lb/>
     them), to defend themselves against all aggres<lb break="no"/>sion.

            <p>
     (Hear, hear.) Now, I ask, what would have 
     <lb/>
     been the consequences if the political com<lb break="no"/>bination that has taken place, for purposes 
     <lb/>
     well understood and declared, had not been 
     <lb/>
     made? We have seen the political party 
     <lb/>
     strifes that agitated this country ; we have 
     <lb/>
     seen the bitterness with which opposing 
     <lb/>
     parties contended for office ; we have seen 
     <lb/>
     the business of the country neglected, and 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     its legislation brought to a stand-still, while 
     <lb/>
     parties assailed each other in our legislative 
     <lb/>
     halls on some personal, individual ground 
     <lb/>
     of malice ; we have seen Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     refusing to Upper Canada her fair represent<lb break="no"/>ation in Parliament ; we have seen sec<lb break="no"/>tional and religious difficulties and dissen<lb break="no"/>sions growing more and more complicated, 
     <lb/>
     and portending strongly a dissolution of 
     <lb/>
     the union, because we of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     could not have much longer submitted to 
     <lb/>
     waive our fair and equitable right to be 
     <lb/>
     represented according to our population 
     <lb/>
     upon the floor of this House. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Looking, then, at the matter from this point 
     <lb/>
     of view, I deem the circumstances opportune 
     <lb/>
     that have opened a way for a solution of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties that surrounded us, and at the 
     <lb/>
     same time afford a wider and more extended 
     <lb/>
     and ample scope to the people for their 
     <lb/>
     defence, for their commercial, manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing and mining interests, and for their social 
     <lb/>
     intercourse. Believing, then, that in respect 
     <lb/>
     to the solution of the political differences so 
     <lb/>
     recently existing, the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces is exceedingly desirable ; believ<lb break="no"/>ing that in order to maintain an honorable 
     <lb/>
     existence, the union has become expedient, 
     <lb/>
     as affording a means of defence against 
     <lb/>
     aggression, I have, I think, at least two 
     <lb/>
     exceedingly strong grounds upon which I 
     <lb/>
     may favor the scheme in a general point of 
     <lb/>
     view. (Hear, hear.) Admitting that Con<lb break="no"/>federation on general principles is a propo<lb break="no"/>sition that admits of being strongly enter<lb break="no"/>tained ; that I feel convinced in my own 
     <lb/>
     mind that something requires to be done ; 
     <lb/>
     that necessity demands strong and vigorous 
     <lb/>
     action on the part of the Government to 
     <lb/>relieve us from the difficulties into which 
     <lb/>political differences have thrown us, to 
     <lb/>guard and defend us against difficulties not 
     <lb/>only political at home, but warlike abroad— 
     <lb/>I am, nevertheless, not one of those who are 
     <lb/>willing to accept, without investigation and 
     <lb/>careful enquiry, a Constitution cut and manu<lb break="no"/>factured without the measure of the people 
     <lb/>it is proposed to fit having been taken. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I desire that the garment of 
     <lb/>the Constitution should be made to fit the 
     <lb/>people and at their request. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>If I had any apprehension that this scheme 
     <lb/>was distasteful—was not acquiesced in-was 
     <lb/>not endorsed by the people, I should be the 
     <lb/>last man in this House to endorse these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions ; and I should like every information 
     <lb/>afforded to this House that can be possibly 
     <lb/>given. I will not, however, pretend to dic<lb break="no"/>

     tate to the Government of the day what 
     <lb/>
     amount of information they shall furnish 
     <lb/>
     and lay before us. I shall not charge 
     <lb/>
     them with dereliction of duty in not giving 
     <lb/>
     more information. I do not pretend to say 
     <lb/>
     that they should at this stage give further 
     <lb/>
     intimation of the line of policy proposed to 
     <lb/>
     be pursued and adopted by them with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the local governments. They, in their 
     <lb/>
     wisdom, no doubt, have laid down a course 
     <lb/>
     they deem judicious and advisable to pursue, 
     <lb/>
     and which may be so. But at the same 
     <lb/>
     time I reserve to myself the right to be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied or dissatisfied with the reasons 
     <lb/>
     given, and with the information laid before 
     <lb/>
     us, and I conceive no blame can be attached 
     <lb/>
     to the man from Upper Canada who is anxi<lb break="no"/>ous to know, before he votes for Con<lb break="no"/>federation, what the results will be to that 
     <lb/>
     section of the country. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Gentlemen will, I hope, take it in no wrong 
     <lb/>
     spirit when I say that upon others than 
     <lb/>
     themselves—upon the young men of this 
     <lb/>
     House and this country—will fall the con<lb break="no"/>sequences of this scheme, if carried into 
     <lb/>
     effect, whether beneficial or disastrous ; and 
     <lb/>
    upon us who now cast our votes in its favor 
     <lb/>will fall the responsibility, if, after its adop<lb break="no"/>tion, the working of its machinery shall 
     <lb/>prove disastrous and injurious to Upper 
     <lb/>Canada. I maintain that the merit for the 
     <lb/>time being of framing a new nationality will 
     <lb/>attach to the few who have conceived and 
     <lb/>accomplished it ; and they will no doubt be 
     <lb/>removed to places of honor, trust and emolu<lb break="no"/>ment beyond the reach of the people, while 
     <lb/>we shall be left to see that the cog-wheels and 
     <lb/>straps and appurtenances of this gigantic 
     <lb/>invention are made to adhere to their respec<lb break="no"/>tive and destined positions. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>And woe to us if a wheel becomes displaced, 
     <lb/>or a single accident happens in its future 
     <lb/>working. Is it then, sir, improper to desire 
     <lb/>to see the fullest programme before we enter 
     <lb/>upon the play ? Though fovorable to Con<lb break="no"/>federation, we might be unwilling to swallow 
     <lb/>some of its indigestible ingredients, if any 
     <lb/>such it should, upon examination, be found 
     <lb/>to contain. (Hear, hear.) Now, upon exami<lb break="no"/>nation of these resolutions, I find the first one 
     <lb/>contain I think nothing but that which would 
     <lb/>be acceptable and be gladly received by 
     <lb/>every truly loyal British subject—a Federal 
     <lb/>union under the Crown of Great Britain. 
     <lb/>No one has attempted to address this House 
     <lb/>but has given the fullest expression of his 
     <lb/>desire to see the connection with the Mother  
     <lb/>
           
    
            <cb/>
           
     Country maintained and preserved—to see 
     <lb/>
     the great arm of the British Empire, which 
     <lb/>
     we all so much esteem, respect, and admire, 
     <lb/>
     strengthened. (Hear, hear.) It has been 
     <lb/>
     argued here that the British connection will 
     <lb/>
     be endangered by this scheme, that growing 
     <lb/>
     in strength, we shall by and by become inde<lb break="no"/>pendent, throw off our allegiance, become 
     <lb/>
     coveted, and finally swallowed up by the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring republic. I believe the interest 
     <lb/>
     now exhibited in England in our welfare, in 
     <lb/>
     our prosperity, in the formation of our new 
     <lb/>
     nationality—the affection shown for us in 
     <lb/>
     the hearts of many English statesmen, ex<lb break="no"/>hibited in their declarations of their belief 
     <lb/>
     in our loyalty, is sincere. (Hear.) I cannot 
     <lb/>
     believe that as we grow great, prosperous, and 
     <lb/>
     valuable, their interest in us will grow less 
     <lb/>
     or be in the slightest degree diminished. 
     <lb/>
     The contrary is the reasonable deduction. 
     <lb/>
    If that nation has been in times past so 
     <lb/>solicitous with regard to us ; if when poor, 
     <lb/>small, and unknown comparatively, she has 
     <lb/>sent her best blood and her richest treasures 
     <lb/>for our defence and support, it is unjust to 
     <lb/>her now and unreasonable to assume that she 
     <lb/>will ever, unless at our own request, aband<lb break="no"/>on, neglect or forget us. (Hear, hear.) The 
     <lb/>recollections of our childhood and of the 
     <lb/>anxious care extended toward us will be 
     <lb/>ever fresh, I trust, in the mind and 
     <lb/>heart and memory of our Island Parent, 
     <lb/>and when maturity overtakes us, I am 
     <lb/>sure she will not forget the child she 
     <lb/>has so loved. I trust not. I see no 
     <lb/>occasion for apprehension on this account 
     <lb/>in this direction. (Hear, hear.) I see, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, embodied in this second resolu<lb break="no"/>tion—if we are to have a union of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—the only method which I think 
     <lb/>could be at all satisfactory to the various 
     <lb/>sections It is alleged by some that a legis<lb break="no"/>lative union would be desirable. For my 
     <lb/>own part, I see many difficulties that would 
     <lb/>inevitably arise out of a legislative union, 
     <lb/>which it appears to me would be insurmount<lb break="no"/>able. I do not believe that a general 
     <lb/>government would be as capable, even if it 
     <lb/>were as willing—which I doubt if it would 
     <lb/>be—to deal with the local affairs of the differ<lb break="no"/>ent sections as the local governments would 
     <lb/>be. I .believe a general government, 
     <lb/>charged with matters of common interest to 
     <lb/>the whole country, and local governments 
     <lb/>for the provinces, as proposed by this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, is best adapted to secure efficiency. 
     <lb/>harmony and permanency in the working of

            <fw type="num">774</fw>
            
     this union. The second resolution. too, 
     <lb/>
     opens up a mighty page on our historic 
     <lb/>
    future. It points a significant finger to 
     <lb/>the day when millions of inhabitants shall 
     <lb/>people the verdant valley of the Saskatchewan, 
     <lb/>when railways and telegraphs shall thread 
     <lb/>the almost boundless territory of the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>West, where the war-hoop of the savage alone 
     <lb/>is heard. It points to the vast commercial 
     <lb/>enterprises yet to be engaged in upon the 
     <lb/>Pacific shores, to the rich gold fields of 
     <lb/>Columbia and the fertile shores of Vancou<lb break="no"/>ver. (Hear, hear.) We rise, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>in this resolution, from the simplicity of 
     <lb/>small colonial dependencies to a vastness in 
     <lb/>extent of territory to which the little islands 
     <lb/>that compose the mighty Empire to which 
     <lb/>we belong are insignificant. We may look 
     <lb/>forward, even with hope and pride, without, 
     <lb/>I think, too great a stretch of imagination, 
     <lb/>to some distant day, when in the rocking of 
     <lb/>European thrones, perhaps, we shall be able 
     <lb/>to send out our fleets and our armies, gather<lb break="no"/>ed from the Atlantic to the Pacific, to afford 
     <lb/>aid and assistance to that very Empire to 
     <lb/>which we now, in our weakness, appeal for 
     <lb/>support and strength and aid. (Applause.) 
     <lb/>Who will say that the conception of this 
     <lb/>scheme has not a grandeur about it com<lb break="no"/>mending itself to the minds of those who 
     <lb/>rise superior to the cries of party strife— 
     <lb/>commending itself to the favorable consider<lb break="no"/>ation of these who desire to move onward 
     <lb/>with gigantic strides to greatness, to wealth, 
     <lb/>to a more perfect civilization—to break out 
     <lb/>from the narrow grooves of prejudice. and 
     <lb/>selfishness,and bigotry, and desire to take to 
     <lb/>the broad gauge of an enlightened and 
     <lb/>expansive policy? (Hear, hear.) Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions three, fear and five I may pass over: 
     <lb/>They all have for their tendency the planting 
     <lb/>of the roots of the Constitution of this new 
     <lb/>nationality in the firm soil of the British 
     <lb/>model ; of coupling to the firm car of British 
     <lb/>freedom this new nationality, the wisdom, 
     <lb/>and expediency and policy of which course is 
     <lb/>not attempted to be denied by a single voice 
     <lb/>in this House. I pass to the consideration of 
     <lb/> the eleventh resolution, which has been the 
     <lb/>subject of much discussion among the 
     <lb/>people outside of this House, and has been 
     <lb/>referred to as one very strong ground for 
     <lb/>the rejection of the scheme. Those of the 
     <lb/>old Reform party who contended—and I 
     <lb/>am sure conscientiously contended—for the 
     <lb/>elective principle in the Upper House, ever 
     <lb/>jealous as they have a right to be of those 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     rights and privileges, for which they have 
     <lb/>
     long and ardently contended, see in this 
     <lb/>
     resolution a retrograde rather than a pro<lb break="no"/>gressive principle—a backward rather than 
     <lb/>
     a forward movement—instead of a salutary 
     <lb/>
     reform, a return to the old-fogyism of the 
     <lb/>
     past, it I may be allowed the expression. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Well, sir, I in some mea<lb break="no"/>sure agree with those who entertain these 
     <lb/>
     opinions. I would, for my own part, very 
     <lb/>
     much prefer to see the elective principle 
     <lb/>
     retained in the Legislative Council, and I 
     <lb/>
     very much desire, if this scheme is to be 
     <lb/>
     adopted at all, that in pursuance of the 
     <lb/>
     intimation given in the despatch of the 3rd 
     <lb/>
     December, 1864, from the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, acknowledging the despatch of this 
     <lb/>
     Government of the 7th of November, 
     <lb/>
     1864, the provinces should enter again 
     <lb/>
     upon the consideration of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion respecting the appointment by the 
     <lb/>
     Crown of the members of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council. As this suggestion is one that 
     <lb/>
     comes not from either of the provinces— 
     <lb/>
     arises from no sectional nor provincial preju<lb break="no"/>dices—none of the provinces can well refuse 
     <lb/>
     to entertain it if they are really actuated by 
     <lb/>
     a desire to arrived at a form of Constitutional 
     <lb/>
     Government based upon principles just to 
     <lb/>
     the several provinces, as is declared to be 
     <lb/>
     their desire in the very first of these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions. (Hear.) I will not, sir, enter into 
     <lb/>
     further details upon this subject ; I will not 
     <lb/>
     discuss the advantages of an lntercolonial 
     <lb/>
     road, or its disadvantages ; but I will simply 
     <lb/>
     say, that in the hour of emergency, when our 
     <lb/>
     position is such that we cannot, we must not 
     <lb/>
     stand still—when we are hurried along by 
     <lb/>
     the resistless power of circumstances—when 
     <lb/>
     dangers threaten, on the one hand, and 
     <lb/>
     bright prospects of greatness lie in imme<lb break="no"/>diate unity of action on the other, we should 
     <lb/>
     not descend to the penurious position of 
     <lb/>
     being unwilling to spend a dollar to accom<lb break="no"/>plish a great and mighty project that will live 
     <lb/>
     in the memory of all future ages—of found<lb break="no"/>ing a nationality that will, it may be, exist, 
     <lb/>
     as the learned historian quoted by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Quebec has said : " When some 
     <lb/>
     traveller from New Zealand shall stand upon 
     <lb/>
     a broken arch of London Bridge to sketch 
     <lb/>
     the ruins of St. Pauls." (Hear.) I would 
     <lb/>
     not, sir, on the other hand, be willing to 
     <lb/>
     adopt a scheme which would, in a finan<lb break="no"/>cial point of view, endanger the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of Upper Canada ; but I am 
     <lb/>
     assured by the facts and figures intro<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="775" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0775.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">775</fw>
            
     duced by my honorable friends from 
     <lb/>
     South Oxford and from Sherbrooke, who, 
     <lb/>
     I am sure, do not wish to be taken in 
     <lb/>
     in respect to this scheme any more than I 
     <lb/>
     do, or than any other man from Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada—I am assured, I say, by them, that 
     <lb/>
     our financial position will be benefited by 
     <lb/>
     the Confederation. I have compared those 
     <lb/>
     facts and those figures, and I must confess 
     <lb/>
     I have confidence in their conclusions. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I have heard it urged, sir, 
     <lb/>
     that because some counties in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick have rejected the men who have 
     <lb/>
     adopted Confederation as a policy, we ought 
     <lb/>
     therefore to abandon the scheme. Well, 
     <lb/>
     sir, we are either bound in good faith to 
     <lb/>
     carry out the engagement entered into at 
     <lb/>
     Quebec or not, and I say with my friend the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Attorney General West, we are 
     <lb/>
     bound in all conscience and honor, and in 
     <lb/>
     every principle of law or equity, to adhere 
     <lb/>
     to the agreement entered into. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The <hi rendition="simple:italic">tu quoque</hi> argument is not a 
     <lb/>
     good defence to such a breach of good 
     <lb/>
     faith. What a sorry figure should we 
     <lb/>
     cut, sir, before the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     with this argument in our mouths :— 
     <lb/>
     "The Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and Prince Edward Island broke 
     <lb/>
     faith, violated their pledges, were untrue 
     <lb/>
     to their engagements, and we followed 
     <lb/>
     their example." I think, sir, such a position 
     <lb/>
     would be pitiable, and would tend to lower 
     <lb/>
     as in the eyes of the Imperial Government. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I maintain that the principle 
     <lb/>
     enunciated by my friend the Honorable 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General West is correct ; we 
     <lb/>
     must adopt these resolutions, and we must 
     <lb/>
     take them before the Imperial Government, 
     <lb/>
     in order to maintain the respect of that 
     <lb/>
     Government, in order to maintain the respect 
     <lb/>
     of the Empire, in order to maintain even our 
     <lb/>
     own self-respect. (Hear, hear.) When that 
     <lb/>
     is accomplished, our duty will be ended. If 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces will not adhere to 
     <lb/>
     the arrangement, we shall have done our 
     <lb/>
     duty, and shall have secured the good-will 
     <lb/>
     and respect of the Mother Country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Before taking my seat, I will say, 
     <lb/>
     sir, with regard to the putting of the 
     <lb/>
     previous question, I am sorry that has been 
     <lb/>
     done. I am one who is desirous of giving 
     <lb/>
    to every man, of every party, of every 
     <lb/>shade of political opinion, the most extensive

     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     when I moved the adjournment last night, 
     <lb/>
     it was not my intention to offer to-day a 
     <lb/>
     general review of the scheme which is under 
     <lb/>
     discussion ; for I am of opinion that it has 
     <lb/>
     been sufficiently discussed to enable the 
     <lb/>
     country to judge of its merits and of its 
     <lb/>
     disadvantages. My intention was rather to 
     <lb/>
     confine myself to certain points in the plan 
     <lb/>
     which, in my opinion, have not been held 
     <lb/>
     up in a sufficiently salient point of view, and 
     <lb/>
     to make a few remarks on what has been 
     <lb/>
     said, both in this House and in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council, in relation to the protection of 
     <lb/>
     the institutions of Lower Canada. In the 
     <lb/>
     Upper House the Hon. the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Sir ETIENNE PASCAL TACHÉ), in his 
     <lb/>
     speech of the 3rd February last, said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     If we obtain a Federal union, it will be 
     <lb/>
     equivalent to a disunion of the provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     thereby Lower Canada will preserve her autonomy, 
     <lb/>
     together with all the institutions which are so 
     <lb/>
     dear to her, and over which she may exercise all 
     <lb/>
     the surveillance which is necessary to preserve 
     <lb/>
     them from danger.

     And the Hon. Solicitor General (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     LANGEVIN), after having explained, in his 
     <lb/>
     way, the resolutions respecting marriage and 
     <lb/>
     divorce, expressed himself as follows, in his 
     <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     This is an important point, and the French-

     Canadian members ought to congratulate them<lb break="no"/>selves on observing that their fellow-countrymen 
     <lb/>
     did not fail in the performance of their duty in 
     <lb/>
     relation to a question of such importance. It is 
     <lb/>
     needless to say that on many other points some 
     <lb/>
     of them will not admit that we performed our 
     <lb/>
     duty well ; but on the point in question, there 
     <lb/>
     can be no difference of opinion, for we have all 
     <lb/>
     a common rule, and, I repeat, they should be 
     <lb/>

     It then behoves this honorable House, Mr.

     <lb/>
     which are submitted to us. In order that  
     <lb/>
     this end may be fully attained, it is neces<lb break="no"/>sary to define the peculiar features of our 
     <lb/>
     position as a people. I can say, with the

     utmost sincerity, that for my part I have

     and their laws ; for we have the same attach<lb break="no"/>ment that they have to the British Empire, 
     <lb/>
     and I am convinced that no hon. member of 
     <lb/>
     this House will express a contrary opinion. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) This being admitted, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I beg to call the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House to the twenty-ninth resolution. It 
     <lb/>
     reads as follows :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The General Parliament shall have power to

     make laws for the peace, welfare and good gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Federated Provinces (saving the

     Sovereignty of England), and especially laws 
     <lb/>

     Then, after a long enumeration of subjects 
     <lb/>
     on which the General Government is to have 
     <lb/>
     power to legislate, we come to the 31st para<lb break="no"/>graph, which relates to marriage and divorce. 
     <lb/>Ou the 2nd July, 1864, the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>(Hon. Sir ETIENNE PASCAL TACHÉ), in the 
     <lb/>course of an eloquent speech delivered on the 
     <lb/>second reading of the Benning Divorce Bill, 
     <lb/>spoke as follows in the Legislative Council :—

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     I oppose the second reading of the bill, and I 
     <lb/>
     do so on the principle that divorce is antichristian 
     <lb/>
     and antinational. [And after having cited various 
     <lb/>
    passages from the Bible, he continued :] Divorce 
     <lb/>is immoral in its consequences, and, worse still, it 
     <lb/>destroys society by destroying the family. [And 
     <lb/>again :] I should be sorry to wound the feelings 
     <lb/>of any one, but we have to protect society in gen<lb break="no"/>eral, and we have certain duties to discharge. 
     <lb/>For my part, I should be acting against my con<lb break="no"/>science, my religion and my country, if I did not 
     <lb/>oppose the bill. Death alone can dissolve mar<lb break="no"/>riage—that is the teaching of the Apostles, and it 
     <lb/>is also the doctrine of all the Fathers and Councils.

     On the 9th July of the same year, the Hon-

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     If I oppose the bill now before the House, it is

     not because I do not believe that the person

     petitioning for it has just grounds of complaint, 
     <lb/>
     but because we are asked to do that which is dia<lb break="no"/>metrically opposed to my principles in this matter ; 
     <lb/>
     and because, moreover, I consider that the House 
     <lb/>
     has not the right to dissolve the marriage con<lb break="no"/>tracted between the parties interested, and to 
     <lb/>
     permit them to marry again.

            <p>This opinion of the Hon. Solicitor General 
     <lb/>for Lower Canada was supported by the 
     <lb/>whole of the French-Canadian and Catholic 
     <lb/>members, who declared, on that occasion, by 
     <lb/>voting even against the first reading of the

     of divorce ; and their opinion was concurred 
     <lb/>

     The Divorce Bill was, we regret to say, read a

     of this antisocial measure being defeated. The

     If any one says that the Church is in error when,

     The question of divorce recurs periodically to

     Now, Mr. SPEAKER, as I said a moment 
     <lb/>
     ago, these were the opinions of all French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians, and, with reference to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, I cannot imagine anything to justify 
     <lb/>
     the change of opinion which has manifested 
     <lb/>
     itself amongst a certain number of French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian members and our Catholic ministers 
     <lb/>
     If it be true that a Catholic cannot adopt the 
     <lb/>
     principle of divorce, and if we are in con<lb break="no"/>science bound to oppose it in our capacity as 
     <lb/>
     legislators, by voting against every measure 
     <lb/>
     tending to sanction it, I ask how we can vote 
     <lb/>
     for a resolution purporting to vest in the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Legislature the power of legislating on 
     <lb/>
     the subject? The hon. member for Montmo<lb break="no"/>rency, in the course of his speech in this 
     <lb/>
     House the day before yesterday, told us that 
     <lb/>
     if it had not been recorded in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="777" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0777.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">777</fw>
            
     that the Federal Parliament would have the 
     <lb/>
     right of legislating on divorce, that power 
     <lb/>
     would have been exercised not only by the 
     <lb/>
     latter,but by the local legislatures also. The 
     <lb/>
     43rd resolution, article 15, tells us that 
     <lb/>
     property and civil rights, excepting those 
     <lb/>
     portions thereof assigned to the General 
     <lb/>
     Parliament, are to be left to the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments. It is evident, therefore, that if it 
     <lb/>
     had not been stated in the resolutions that 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government was to have the 
     <lb/>
     right of legislating on marriage and divorce, 
     <lb/>
     that power would have remained vested in 
     <lb/>
     the local legislatures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—And if that re<lb break="no"/>solution had not been inserted in the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, what would have been the effect? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—The insertion of 
     <lb/>
     that clause places us precisely in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion we should have occupied under a legis<lb break="no"/>lative union. By one section of that clause, 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Legislature is vested with the 
     <lb/>
     power of legislating, not only on the question 
     <lb/>
     of marriage and divorce, but also on the 
     <lb/>
     civil rights of the French-Canadians. It 
     <lb/>
     can, whenever it chooses, attack our civil 
     <lb/>
     laws. The hon. member for Montmorency 
     <lb/>
     admits that the 43rd clause, and paragraph 
     <lb/>
     15, assure the protection of our civil rights, 
     <lb/>
     and says that if that portion of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions had not been inserted, the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures would alone have had the right to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the matter. Mr. SPEAKER, a single 
     <lb/>
     glance at our civil code is sufficient to con<lb break="no"/>vince any one of this. Under article 74 of 
     <lb/>
     title 5, I find the following :—" Marriage is 
     <lb/>
     dissolved solely by the natural death of one 
     <lb/>
     of the parties ; so long as they both live, it 
     <lb/>
     is indissoluble." If it be true that our 
     <lb/>
     French civil law declares that marriage can<lb break="no"/>not be dissolved by any means whatsoever, nor 
     <lb/>
     by any authority ; if the right of legislating 
     <lb/>
     on marriage and divorce had not been left 
     <lb/>
     to the General Legislature, no person could 
     <lb/>
     have obtained a divorce and leave to marry 
     <lb/>
     again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—What 
     <lb/>
     happens at the present moment? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—What happens? It 
     <lb/>
     is true that the Legislature furnishes us 
     <lb/>
     with precedents, but every time that a 
     <lb/>
     divorce has been asked from the Legislature, 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic members have voted against it. 
     <lb/>
     As the resolutions stand, the Federal Legis<lb break="no"/>lature may grant bills of divorce, thanks to 
     <lb/>
     the insertion of this clause in the scheme. 
     <lb/>
     We are told that this has been done in 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     order to remove a danger which already 
     <lb/>
     existed in the local legislatures ; but a great 
     <lb/>
     error has been committed ; for, under the new 
     <lb/>
     system, any one can make application to the 
     <lb/>
     General Legislature and obtain a bill of divorce. 
     <lb/>
     And if that right had not been given to the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Legislature, it would have been im<lb break="no"/>possible to obtain a divorce in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     inasmuch as the majority in the Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature will be French-Canadian and Catholic, 
     <lb/>
     and marriage and divorce would be under the 
     <lb/>
     control of that legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     The Honorable Solicitor General LANGEVIN 
     <lb/>
     said in his speech—and I fancied that he had 
     <lb/>
     much difficulty in explaining the article rela<lb break="no"/>tive to divorce, that the Catholic members of  
     <lb/>
     the Conference were not opposed to that arti<lb break="no"/>cle, and that, though they were opposed to 
     <lb/>the principle of divorce, he admitted that 
     <lb/>there were cases in which Catholics were al<lb break="no"/>lowed to separate. I cannot help saying, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, that this was a very poor argument 
     <lb/>for granting to the General Government the 
     <lb/>power of legislating in the matter of divorce. 
     <lb/>The same resolution says that the Federal 
     <lb/>Government is to have the right of legislating  
     <lb/>on marriage, and the Honorable Solicitor 
     <lb/>General, in his speech, explains that article 
     <lb/>as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>The word "marriage" has been placed in the 
     <lb/>draft of the proposed Constitution to invest the 
     <lb/>Federal Legislature with the right of declaring 
     <lb/>what marriages shall be held an deemed to be 
     <lb/>valid throughout the whole extent of the Confed<lb break="no"/>eracy, without, however, interfering in any par<lb break="no"/>ticular with the doctrines or rites of the religious 
     <lb/>creeds to which the parties may belong. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I must acknowledge that the statement is 
     <lb/>
     very skilfully made, and to persons who ac<lb break="no"/>cept it without close examination, I admit that 
     <lb/>
     it is calculated to convey the idea that the 
     <lb/>
     Government hold that the Federal Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture cannot decree that a civil marriage is 
     <lb/>
     obligatory, and that a marriage must be cele<lb break="no"/>brated under the Catholic or the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     Church in order to be valid. But any one 
     <lb/>
     who closely examines that portion of the clause 
     <lb/>
     will easily see that it cannot possibly be in<lb break="no"/>terpreted in any such sense, and that the 
     <lb/>
     existence of that clause in the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     will enable the Federal Government to enact 
     <lb/>
     that civil marriage alone shall be valid, so that 
     <lb/>
     children the issue of marriages contracted in 
     <lb/>
     the Church and not ratified by a civil magis<lb break="no"/>trate, will be illegitimate. I maintain that the 
     <lb/>
     clause is susceptible of no other intrepretation, 
     <lb/>
     and I defy the Honorable Solicitor General for 
     <lb/>

     Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN) to in<lb break="no"/>terpret it correctly in any other sense. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) He has really given us a magnificent 
     <lb/>
     explanation of the clause, but it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that as the House is called upon to deal with 
     <lb/>
     written resolutions, we must interpret them as 
     <lb/>
     they are laid before us; the ones cannot 
     <lb/>
     scrutinise the hidden intentions of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in the matter. If the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     have an other meaning than that expressed 
     <lb/>
     on the face of them, the House is entitled to 
     <lb/>
     call upon the Government to explain and cor<lb break="no"/>rect them. The motion now before the House 
     <lb/>
     is as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     That an humble Address be presented to Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty, praying that She may be graciously 
     <lb/>
     pleased to cause a measure to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament, for uniting the Colonies of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and Prince Edward Island in one 
     <lb/>
     government, with provisions based on certain re<lb break="no"/>solutions which were adopted at a Conference of 
     <lb/>
     Delegates from the said Colonies, held at the 
     <lb/>
     city of Quebec, on the 10th October, 1864. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I assert, then, that if we vote this Address, we 
     <lb/>
     cannot complain if the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
      should declare that the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>
     shall have the right to legislate on all mat<lb break="no"/>ters relating to marriage and divorce.

     <lb/>
     will be drawn up here and submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—If I am not mis<lb break="no"/>taken as to the meaning of the motion, the 
     <lb/>
     Address asks Her Majesty to cause a meas<lb break="no"/>ure to be submitted to the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment for the purpose of uniting the Colonies 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island in 
     <lb/>
     one government, with provisions based on 
     <lb/>
     certain resolutions which were adopted at a 
     <lb/>
     Conference of delegates from the said colon<lb break="no"/>ies. Now, if the Imperial Government is to 
     <lb/>
     adopt the measure, they can do as was done 
     <lb/>
     in 1856, with reference to the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council, and we cannot complain if they 
     <lb/>
     should amend it in a sense distasteful to us, 
     <lb/>
     since our resolutions declare that the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government shall have the right to legislate 
     <lb/>
     on property and civil rights, except such 
     <lb/>
    portions thereof as shall be vested in the 
     <lb/>Federal Government—and amongst the sub<lb break="no"/>jects left to the latter are marriage and 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     divorce. (Hear, hear.) I know the answer  
     <lb/>
     that will be made to me on this point. It 
     <lb/>
     will be said that it is through party spirit 
     <lb/>
    I am standing   up to defend religion, and that 
     <lb/>I desire to ead this Honorable House to 
     <lb/>believe that by voting for these resolutions we 
     <lb/>endanger our religious institutions. But it 
     <lb/>appears to me, Mr. SPEAKER, that for all of 
     <lb/>us Catholics, the indissolubility of marriage 
     <lb/>is an article of religion, and that if the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions do not admit that doctrine of the 
     <lb/>Church, they must be rejected by every one 
     <lb/>of us. But it will perhaps be asked—"How 
     <lb/>does it happen that our Catholic clergy 
     <lb/>remain passive whilst one of the dogmas of 
     <lb/>our religion is thus being undermined ?" I 
     <lb/>deny, Mr. SPEAKER, that the Canadian 
     <lb/>clergy are in favor of the Ministerial scheme, 
     <lb/>and I am supported in this by the fact that 
     <lb/>the petitions sent here against the scheme 
     <lb/>were signed by several priests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAUC1">HON. MR. CAUCHON</persName>—By how many ?

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—Several of them have 
     <lb/>
     signed the petitions; I can fancy that some 
     <lb/>
     members of the clergy are in favor of the 
     <lb/>
     project, but I deny that the clergy in general 
     <lb/>
     profess the same sentiments. We have not 
     <lb/>
     received a single petition in favor of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and every day large numbers of them 
     <lb/>
     reach us, praying for the abandonment of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme.

     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—Yes, you have done it 
     <lb/>
     The Honorable Attorney General for Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada said in this House that the clergy 
     <lb/>
     were in favor of the scheme. Now, I main<lb break="no"/>tain that a great many priests are opposed to 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. (Hear, hear.) I find in the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi> of this day a letter written by a 
     <lb/>
     member of the clergy, who expresses himself 
     <lb/>
     in the following terms on the subject of Con<lb break="no"/>federation— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">MR. ROBITAILLE</persName>—Is the letter really 
     <lb/>
     written by a priest ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—If the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member has any doubt on that point, he can 
     <lb/>
     solve it by applying to the honorable member 
     <lb/>
     for the county of Quebec, who is the proprie<lb break="no"/>tor of the paper. This is what the reverend 
     <lb/>
     gentleman says:—" The clergy are not in favor 
     <lb/>
     of your Confederation as it is proposed ; a 
     <lb/>
     great many of them, it is true, have faith in 
     <lb/>
     it, and trust in our public men, but a good 
     <lb/>
     many of them also dread it, and would like to 
     <lb/>
     see it amended." It is quite easy for any one 
     <lb/>
     who takes the trouble to reflect on this matter, 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="779" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0779.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">779</fw>
            
     to understand that among the clergy, as among 
     <lb/>
     the people, there may be a great many persons 
     <lb/>
     who, having always had confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada Ministers, and having been 
     <lb/>
     accustomed to look upon them as the natural 
     <lb/>
     protectors of religion and of our national in<lb break="no"/>stitutions—are ready to accept the declarations 
     <lb/>
     and explanations made in this House by our 
     <lb/>
     Ministers. Now, these explanations simply 
     <lb/>
     stated that the legislation of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government would merely go the length of 
     <lb/>
     declaring the validity of marriages contracted 
     <lb/>
     in any one of the provinces of the Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation when the parties entered Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada; but it is evident that if they accept 
     <lb/>
     such explanations, those members of the 
     <lb/>
     clergy who have always had confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     present Ministers are not easily susceptible of 
     <lb/>
     alarm. But if we take the trouble of inter<lb break="no"/>preting that clause of the resolution in its 
     <lb/>
     true sense, it must be admitted that the legis<lb break="no"/>lation of the Federal Government on marriage 
     <lb/>
     and divorce may in many ways run counter 
     <lb/>
     to our sentiments as Catholics, since it may 
     <lb/>
     declare that marriage is nothing more than a 
     <lb/>
     civil contract, and that religious marriages 
     <lb/>
     contracted either by Protestants or Catholics, 
     <lb/>
     and not ratified by a magistrate, shall not be 
     <lb/>
     valid. Let us now see what will be the effect 
     <lb/>
     of these provisions as regards our laws. The 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Attorney General for Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada gave us a pompous eulogy of our civil 
     <lb/>
     code; he went so far as to state that it was 
     <lb/>
     infinitely superior to the French code, and to 
     <lb/>
     any code he was acquainted with. We are 
     <lb/>
     told that our institutions and our civil laws 
     <lb/>
     will be fully protected, and that the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislature can only legislate on the laws of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, our civil law's being placed 
     <lb/>
     beyond its reach. If this provision relating 
     <lb/>
     to marriage and divorce be adopted, what will 
     <lb/>
     be the effect on our civil laws? The Hon. Soli<lb break="no"/>sitor General for Lower Canada told us that the 
     <lb/>
     object of that resolution was to render valid 
     <lb/>
     throughout the Confederation a marriage con<lb break="no"/>tracted in any one of the provinces. It seems 
     <lb/>
     to me very extraordinary, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
     <lb/>
     a gentleman in the position of  the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Dorchester, and who, in virtue of that 
     <lb/>
     position, may aspire to a seat on the bench, 
     <lb/>
     and who already enjoys precedence over the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the Bar of Lower Canada, should 
     <lb/>
     evince such deplorable ignorance of our civil 
     <lb/>
     law. In article 19, title 5 of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Civil Code</hi>, 
     <lb/>
     relative to marriage, I find the following :—"A 
     <lb/>
     marriage celebrated out of Lower Canada be<lb break="no"/>tween two persons, either or both of whom are 
     <lb/>
    subject to its laws, is valid, if celebrated 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     according to the formalities of the place of 
     <lb/>
     celebration, provided that the parties did not 
     <lb/>
     go there with the intention of evading the law." 
     <lb/>
     Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, since the marriage of a 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadian contracted in another coun<lb break="no"/>try in accordance with its laws, is valid in this 
     <lb/>
     country, the explanation and interpretation 
     <lb/>
     given by the Honorable the Solicitor General, 
     <lb/>
     of the clause relating to marriage and divorce, 
     <lb/>
     has no force whatsoever, and the clause may 
     <lb/>
     as well be struck out of the resolutions. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) If I rightly understand that clause, 
     <lb/>
     the legislature will have power to deal with a 
     <lb/>
     host of matters relating to marriage; thus it 
     <lb/>
     may change that part of the civil code which 
     <lb/>
     defines the age at which a child may marry 
     <lb/>
     without the consent of parents; it may alter 
     <lb/>
     the mode of contracting marriage, change the 
     <lb/>
     mutual rights and duties of married persons; 
     <lb/>
     it will also have power to modify our civil 
     <lb/>
     code in the matter of our obligations arising 
     <lb/>
     from marriage, in the matter of tutorship, 
     <lb/>
     paternal authority, &amp;c., &amp;c., in fact in a mul<lb break="no"/>titude of its provisions. If that be the great 
     <lb/>
     protection afforded by the new Constitution to 
     <lb/>
     our laws, to our religious and civil institutions, 
     <lb/>
     there is every reason to fear that they may one 
     <lb/>
     day receive a fatal blow. I will now call the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House, and particularly of the 
     <lb/>
     French-Canadian members, to the forty-sixth 
     <lb/>
     resolution, which relates to the use of the 
     <lb/>
     French language in the Federal Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     It is as follows :—" The English and French 
     <lb/>
     languages may be used simultaneously in 
     <lb/>
     the proceedings of the Federal Legislature 
     <lb/>
     as well as in the Legislature of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and also in the Federal courts and in 
     <lb/>
     the courts of Lower Canada." A close 
     <lb/>
     examination of this resolution shews at once 
     <lb/>
     that it does not declare that the French 
     <lb/>
     language is to be on the same footing as the 
     <lb/>
     English language in the Federal and Local Le<lb break="no"/>gislatures; in place of the word "shall," which 
     <lb/>
     ought to have been inserted in the resolution,  
     <lb/>
    the word used is " may," so that if the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish majority decide that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings</hi> and Bills of the House shall be 
     <lb/>
     printed only in English, nothing can prevent 
     <lb/>
     the enactment taking effect. Of course we 
     <lb/>
     shall be allowed to use the French language 
     <lb/>
     in debate, but on the other hand, it is evi<lb break="no"/>dent that the majority may, whenever they 
     <lb/>choose, enact that the bills and proceedings 
     <lb/>of the House shall not be printed in French, 
     <lb/>and consequently the clause affords no secur<lb break="no"/>ity whatever to us French-Canadians. I 
     <lb/>take it for granted that as regards all the bills 
     <lb/>or resolutions of this House, the meaning to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="780" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0780.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">780</fw>
            
     be given to words is that given to them by 
     <lb/>
     the law of the country, and I am therefore 
     <lb/>
     justified, when explaining the resolutions be<lb break="no"/>fore us, in holding to the very letter of their 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, and it needs no effort of the im<lb break="no"/>agination to discover the intention of those 
     <lb/>
     who repared them. The provincial statute 
     <lb/>
     22 Victoria, chap. 29, relative to the inter<lb break="no"/>pretation of the statutes, says :—" Whenever 
     <lb/>
    by any act it is provided that a thing shall 
     <lb/>be done, the obligation to do it is to be in<lb break="no"/>ferred ; but when it is said that a thing may 
     <lb/>be done, the power of doing it is permissive." 
     <lb/>In the resolutions submitted us, the word 
     <lb/>used in the English version is " may," which 
     <lb/>is translated into French by the word " <hi rendition="simple:italic">pour- 
     <lb break="yes"/>ront,</hi>" and it is said that the English and 
     <lb/>French languages may be used simultaneously 
     <lb/>in the proceedings of the Federal Parliament 
     <lb/>as well as in the Legislature of Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da, and also in the Federal courts and the 
     <lb/>courts of Lower Canada. It is easy to see, 
     <lb/>then, that the use of the French language is 
     <lb/>rendered extremely precarious, and that the 
     <lb/>majority may proscribe it in our <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and 
     <lb/>Proceedings</hi>, and in our Legislature. The Low<lb break="no"/>er Canada members who have always support<lb break="no"/>ed the Ministry ought to urge them to insert 
     <lb/>a clause in the resolutions declaring that the 
     <lb/>French language shall be on the same footing 
     <lb/>as the English language ; the guarantee afford<lb break="no"/>ed us by the resolutions, as they now stand, 
     <lb/>amounts to nothing. I am not the first to 
     <lb/>point out the danger to our institutions and 
     <lb/>our laws ; the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadien</hi> of this city has enu<lb break="no"/>merated them over and over again, and the 
     <lb/>honorable member for Montmorency himself, 
     <lb/>who quite recently admitted in this House 
     <lb/>that he was the editor in chief of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journal 
     <lb/>de Québec</hi>, wrote as follows in that paper on 
     <lb/>the 18th January, 1865. After having 
     <lb/>spoken of the past conduct of the Upper Can<lb break="no"/>adians, and more particularly of the Honor<lb break="no"/>able President of the Council (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>BROWN), he says :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     For Lower Canada there are other questions 
     <lb/>
     still besides the question of money : there are the 
     <lb/>
     religious, social and national questions. Here 
     <lb/>
     it is that the greatest difficulties exist in the way 
     <lb/>
     of the success of the scheme, for a few slight

     It seems to me, Mr. SPEAKER, that if the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Montmorency was right 
     <lb/>
     in telling the Ministry that our nationality 
     <lb/>
     and our institutions were in danger, and that 
     <lb/>
     changes were required, we French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members are bound to see that the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us afford sufficient protection to 
     <lb/>
     those institutions, and that the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     are not written in such a way as to be suscep<lb break="no"/>tible of two interpretations. How has the 
     <lb/>
     discussion of the scheme of Confederation 
     <lb/>
     been conducted in Lower Canada ? In this 
     <lb/>
     way : in the first place, all the Ministerial 
     <lb/>
     journals begged and prayed the people not to 
     <lb/>
     condemn the scheme before being made ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with it ; they proclaimed stoutly 
     <lb/>
     that the Government must be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     elaborate its measures in peace, and then, 
     <lb/>
     when the scheme was made public, the same 
     <lb/>
     journals declared that certainly the scheme 
     <lb/>
     must be amended in certain particulars be<lb break="no"/>fore being adopted by the country, and that 
     <lb/>
     they would be the first to call for these changes, 
     <lb/>
     which, moreover, could be obtained with<lb break="no"/>out difficulty from the Administration ; if not, 
     <lb/>
     they would oppose the scheme as dangerous 
     <lb/>
     to Lower Canada. Even the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mercury</hi> made 
     <lb/>
     that statement. It was also said : "The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment will not make a Ministerial question 
     <lb/>
     of the adoption of the scheme as it is ; the 
     <lb/>
     project may be discussed, and if it is found 
     <lb/>
     to involve anything dangerous for our re<lb break="no"/>ligious and national institutions, that danger 
     <lb/>
     can be obviated by amending the resolutions." 
     <lb/>
     More than that, at the opening of the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of the scheme, the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General for Upper Canada himself declared 
     <lb/>
     in this House that members might propose 
     <lb/>
     amendments, and that the House would dis<lb break="no"/>pose of them. Now what have we seen 
     <lb/>
     since ? We have seen the same Hon. Minis<lb break="no"/>ter declare that the scheme must be accepted 
     <lb/>
     as it was, and that the Government would 
     <lb/>
     not tolerate any amendment. Is such con<lb break="no"/>duct calculated to inspire confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, and in the Administration who bring 
     <lb/>
     it forward ? I appeal to honorable members 
     <lb/>
     from Lower Canada, and I ask them if they 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to ratify by their verdict the 
     <lb/>
     unjustifiable course adopted by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and whether it is not their duty to 
     <lb/>
     insist on the Government affording us better 
     <lb/>
     security for our religious and national insti<lb break="no"/>tutions ? (Hear. hear.) I trust that the 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada members will not shirk their 
     <lb/>
     duty, and that they will insist on the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment declaring, in their resolutions, that 
     <lb/>
     all these things we hold so dear shall be pro<lb break="no"/>

     tected from the attacks of our adversaries. 
     <lb/>
     Every danger of false interpretation ought to 
     <lb/>
     be removed from these resolutions. If, as it is 
     <lb/>
     stated, our language is to be fully protected 
     <lb/>
     under the new system, I do not see why it is 
     <lb/>
     not so stated clearly in the Constitution. 
     <lb/>
     The explanations of the Honorable Solicitor 
     <lb/>
     General for Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. LAN<lb break="no"/>GEVIN) are all very well, but they are not 
     <lb/>
     sufficient, and I should much prefer a written 
     <lb/>
     statement in the Constitution itself, formally 
     <lb/>
     setting forth that these matters shall not be 
     <lb/>
     affected by any legislation of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Government. (Hear, hear.) I trust the 
     <lb/>
     English members of this House will not take 
     <lb/>
     offence at my insisting on more ample gua<lb break="no"/>rantees for our religious and nation institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and that they will see that it is not 
     <lb/>
     through a spirit of hostility to their institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and that the same motives that induce 
     <lb/>
     them to demand more ample guarantees for 
     <lb/>
     their national minority in Lower Canada— 
     <lb/>
     guarantees which were claimed the other 
     <lb/>
     evening by the honorable member for Mont<lb break="no"/>real Centre (Hon. Mr. ROSE)—make me ask 
     <lb/>
     for the same guarantees for my fellow-coun<lb break="no"/>trymen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANG1">HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN</persName>—Will my 
     <lb/>
     honorable friend allow me to say a few words 
     <lb/>
     in explanation ? He said he hoped the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and members on this side of the House 
     <lb/>
     would admit that his desire was to defend the 
     <lb/>
     religious and national interests of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The honorable member for Verchères 
     <lb/>
     need not be uneasy on that point. For it 
     <lb/>
     must always be taken for granted—and every 
     <lb/>
     member on this side of the House will agree 
     <lb/>
     with me in this—that every sentiment ex<lb break="no"/>pressed on the floor of this House by honor<lb break="no"/>able gentlemen opposite, relative to those ques<lb break="no"/>tions touching our nationality and our re<lb break="no"/>ligion, is frank and sincere, and we, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     feel that in expressing himself as he has done, 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Verchères is per<lb break="no"/>fectly frank and sincere. However, I take the 
     <lb/>
     liberty of answering him on two points. The 
     <lb/>
     first question is that of marriage. The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member did not quote the whole of 
     <lb/>
     that portion of my speech which relates to 
     <lb/>
     marriage ; he simply quoted the first part, 
     <lb/>
     but he ought to have given the second, which 
     <lb/>
     is as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The fact is that the whole matter amounts to 
     <lb/>
     this— the Central Government may decide that 
     <lb/>
     any marriage contracted in Upper Canada or in 
     <lb/>
     any of the onfederated provinces, in accordance 
     <lb/>
     with the laws of the country in which it was con<lb break="no"/>tracted, although that law might be different from 
     <lb/>
     ours, should be deemed valid in Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     in case the parties should come to reside there, 
     <lb/>
     and <hi rendition="simple:italic">vice versa</hi>. 
     <lb/>
         </p></quote>
               
            <p>This was merely a development of what I 
     <lb/>said. I stated before that the interpretation 
     <lb/>I had given of the word "marriage" was 
     <lb/>that of the Government and of the Conference 
     <lb/>of Quebec, and that we wished the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion to be drafted in that sense. The honor<lb break="no"/>able member for Verchères quoted that part 
     <lb/>of the draft of the civil code which states 
     <lb/>that one of the articles provides that a mar<lb break="no"/>riage contracted in any country whatever, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the laws of the country in which it 
     <lb/>shall have been contracted, shall be valid, and 
     <lb/>he argues from that, that since it was declared 
     <lb/>by the civil code, there was no necessity for 
     <lb/>inserting it in the resolutions. But the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member must be aware that that part 
     <lb/>of the code may be repealed at any time, and 
     <lb/>that if this occurred, parties married under 
     <lb/>the circumstances referred to would no longer 
     <lb/>enjoy the protection they now have and which 
     <lb/>we desire to secure for them under the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. I maintain, then, that it was abso<lb break="no"/>lutely necessary to insert the word " mar<lb break="no"/>riage " as it has been inserted, in the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, and that it has no other meaning than 
     <lb/>the meaning I attributed to it in the name 
     <lb/>of the Government and of the Conference. 
     <lb/>Thus the honorable member for Verchères had 
     <lb/>no grounds for asserting that the Federal 
     <lb/>Legislature might change that part of the 
     <lb/>civrl code which determines the age at 
     <lb/>which marriage can be contracted without the 
     <lb/>consent of parents. Another point on which 
     <lb/>the honorable member for Verchères insisted, 
     <lb/>no doubt with the view of obtaining in<lb break="no"/>formation, which I shall be delighted to 
     <lb/>afford if it should induce him to vote for the 
     <lb/>resolutions—and I am perfectly certain it 
     <lb/>ought to be sufficient—is the point as to the 
     <lb/>use of the French language under Con<lb break="no"/>federation. The forty-sixth resolution is as 
     <lb/>follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The English and French languages may be 
     <lb/>
     used simultaneously in the proceedings of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament as well as in the the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of Lower Canada and in the Federal courts 
     <lb/>
     and in the courts of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     The honorable member for Verchères says— 
     <lb/>
     " It is true that the French language may be 
     <lb/>
     used in the Federal Parliament and in the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature of Lower Canada, as well as 
     <lb/>
     in the courts of justice of the Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     but the resolutions do not affirm that 
     <lb/>
     that language may be used in the drafting 
     <lb/>
     of laws and in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Proceedings</hi>   
     <lb/>

     Mr. SPEAKER, I am quite sure the hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Verchères will ' be de<lb break="no"/>lighted to learn that it was perfectly well 
     <lb/>
     understood at the Conference of Quebec that 
     <lb/>
     the French language should not only be 
     <lb/>
     spoken in the courts of justice, in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Parliament and in the Legislature of Lower 
     <lb/>
    Canada, but that, precisely as is now the case,  
     <lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Proceedings</hi> of the Legislature, 
     <lb/>as well as all the Federal laws and those of the 
     <lb/>Legislature of Lower Canada, should be printed 
     <lb/>in both languages. And what is still more, 
     <lb/>under Confederation the French language will 
     <lb/>be spoken before the Federal tribunals, an 
     <lb/>advantage which we do not possess at present 
     <lb/>when we apply to the Court of Appeals of 
     <lb/>Great Britain.  So that the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Verchères and (this honorable House 
     <lb/>will gladly admit that its representatives at 
     <lb/>the Conference of  Quebec did not fail in their 
     <lb/>duty on that point. These are the principles 
     <lb/>upon which the new  Constitution will be 
     <lb/>based, and I feel justified in going so far as 
     <lb/>to say that it was impossible to secure more 
     <lb/>effectually this essential privilege  of our 
     <lb/>nationality, and at the same time our civil 
     <lb/>and religious institutions. I was anxious to 
     <lb/>offer these explanations to the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Verchères and to the House, and 
     <lb/>I trust they will completely satisfy the 
     <lb/>country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GEOF1">MR. GEOFFRION</persName>—The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Dorchester (Hon. Sol. Gen. LANGEVIN) 
     <lb/>
     has explained to us that the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Conference of Quebec was, 
     <lb/>
     not only that the French language should be 
     <lb/>
     used in the Federal Legislature and the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government of Lower Canada, as well as before 
     <lb/>
     the tribunals of the country, but that it was 
     <lb/>
     to be a right guaranteed to the French popu<lb break="no"/>lation by the Constitution under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. The honorable gentleman has also told 
     <lb/>
     us that the word "marriage" inserted in the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions does not signify anything else but 
     <lb/>
     what he explained to the House in his speech, 
     <lb/>
     and that we ought to be happy to see that the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the French population at 
     <lb/>
     the Conference had thus secured the safety 
     <lb/>
     of their civil and religious institutions. For 
     <lb/>
     my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I must say that I 
     <lb/>
     cannot bring myself, like the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber, to see the splendid protection he vaunts 
     <lb/>
     so highly. If the resolutions now before this 
     <lb/>
     House have any meaning, that meaning is only 
     <lb/>
     to be derived from the strict letter of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions themselves. It will always be 
     <lb/>
     optional with the British majority to avail 
     <lb/>
    emselves of the letter of the Constitution, 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     and they may at any time say to us: "You 
     <lb/>
     cannot have it, we oppose it, and the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution does not confer on you the rights you 
     <lb/>
     claim under it." And it will be the more 
     <lb/>
     easy for them to do so from the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     resolution does not affirm that these matters 
     <lb/>
     cannot be disturbed. If the Conference had 
     <lb/>
     any other intention than what appears in the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, the House should be made aware 
     <lb/>
     of it before being called upon to vote on these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. For if the intention of the Con<lb break="no"/>ference was as stated by the Honorable Soli<lb break="no"/>citor General for Lower Canada, and if that 
     <lb/>
     intention be carried into effect, the House will 
     <lb/>
     run the risk of discovering that on all the 
     <lb/>
     other resolutions the intention is different 
     <lb/>
     from the letter, and will be in like manner 
     <lb/>
     carried out, for the resolutions must be inter<lb break="no"/>preted as they stand, without reference to 
     <lb/>
     the intention of the members of the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence. And for that reason I cannot help de<lb break="no"/>claring that we French-Canadians would be 
     <lb/>
     guilty of an act of unpardonable imprudence 
     <lb/>
     in adopting a resolution which declares that 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Legislature is to have the right 
     <lb/>
     of legislating on marriage and divorce, and 
     <lb/>
     which merely declares that the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage <hi rendition="simple:italic">may</hi> be used in the Federal Legislature. 
     <lb/>
     We French-Canadian members, I repeat it, 
     <lb/>
     ought to insist that the word " shall" be sub<lb break="no"/>stituted for the word " may" in the resolution 
     <lb/>
     relating to this matter, with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     publication of the proceedings of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. If this is not done, and if we do not 
     <lb/>
     take every possible precaution, sooner or later 
     <lb/>
     the English speaking majority in the Federal 
     <lb/>
     Legislature will unite against us on this point, 
     <lb/>
     and enact that the laws shall be printed in the 
     <lb/>
     English language only. And if we rest satis<lb break="no"/>fied with the understanding referred to by the  
     <lb/>
     Honorable Solicitor General for Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, we shall be told when we exclaim against 
     <lb/>
     that injustice: "You should have obtained 
     <lb/>
     more full and complete guarantees, and you 
     <lb/>
     should have seen that the Constitution was 
     <lb/>
     made more explicit and more precise on this 
     <lb/>
     point." And we shall have no answer to 
     <lb/>
     make. We must perforce be resigned, and 
     <lb/>
     put up with all the restrictions the majority 
     <lb/>
     may impose upon us. I maintain, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     that it is the duty of the French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     members of this House to induce the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to embody the understanding arrived at 
     <lb/>
     amongst the members of the Conference in 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution, and to require that the 
     <lb/>
     guarantees said to be afforded to us by the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution shall be more clearly expressed 
     <lb/>
     than they are in the resolutions. If we vote 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="783" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0783.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">783</fw>
            
     these resolutions as they are, we shall vote 
     <lb/>
     without knowing exactly the nature of the 
     <lb/>
     guarantees they afford us. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REMI1">MR. RÉMILLARD</persName> said—Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     the question of a Federal union of the 
     <lb/>
     British North American Provinces is one 
     <lb/>
     of such importance, that at the present 
     <lb/>
     time it is engaging the attention, not only 
     <lb/>
     of this honorable House, but also of the 
     <lb/>
     whole political world. I consider, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that it is the duty of those to whom it 
     <lb/>
     is submitted to express, each in his own way, 
     <lb/>
     the reasons which induce them to adopt or 
     <lb/>
     reject the union in question. When for 
     <lb/>
     the first time, in the year 1861, the county 
     <lb/>
     of Bellechasse did me the honor to send me 
     <lb/>
       here as its representative, I had not the 
     <lb/>
    slightest idea that I should be called upon, 
     <lb/>in the beginning of 1865, to take part in 
     <lb/>the discussion of such a measure, upon 
     <lb/>which, in my opinion, our whole future 
     <lb/>depends. So rapid, however, is the growth 
     <lb/>of events in this age of progress of every 
     <lb/>kind, that there is no reason to be surprised 
     <lb/>that we are to-day called upon to grapple 
     <lb/>with the subject of the political position of 
     <lb/>our youthful country. I am prepared at 
     <lb/>once to acknowledge, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
     <lb/>that position has not for several years past 
     <lb/>appeared to me to be an enviable one; and 
     <lb/>in fact what has the political aspect been? 
     <lb/>Within the precincts of this House we have 
     <lb/>looked upon scenes that are to be regretted 
     <lb/>and that were of frequent occurrence. We 
     <lb/>have looked upon bitter and incessant strife 
     <lb/>between our public men on the subject of 
     <lb/>certain sectional difficulties, which should 
     <lb/>be settled in a friendly way, if it is our wish 
     <lb/>at a later period to avoid serious troubles. 
     <lb/>We have seen Ministries succeed each other 
     <lb/>at intervals of hardly six months—Ministries 
     <lb/>which were daily accused, and in many cases 
     <lb/>with good reason, of having been guilty of 
     <lb/>acts of corruption in order to prolong their 
     <lb/>feeble existence. Without these precincts we 
     <lb/>have seen public journals filled with personal 
     <lb/>attacks and insults of every kind, general 
     <lb/>elections every year, carried in many coun<lb break="no"/>ties by means of fraud, and the fomenting of 
     <lb/>wretched prejudices. (Hear, hear.) To 
     <lb/>such a degree had this been carried, that the 
     <lb/>people had come to consider it a highly me<lb break="no"/>ritorious action to calumniate a member or a 
     <lb/>candidate, and to deprive him of that good 
     <lb/>character which he had, in some cases, 
     <lb/>acquired by many and great sacrifices. 
     <lb/> (Hear, hear.) Honest men can experience 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     no feeling other than disgust at such a poli<lb break="no"/>tical course, which is inimical to every feeling 
     <lb/>
     of patriotism, and is fraught with danger to 
     <lb/>
     our institutions. The Canadian people, by 
     <lb/>
     nature brave, intelligent and courageous, are 
     <lb/>
     called upon to play a more noble and a more 
     <lb/>
     worthy part than that. Upon our statesmen, 
     <lb/>
     let them belong to what party they may, it 
     <lb/>
     devolves to provide them with a career which 
     <lb/>
     is suitable to them, without taking into 
     <lb/>
    consideration either prejudices or opinions 
     <lb/>expressed at another period and under other 
     <lb/>circumstances. ( Hear, hear.) We French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Canadians especially, if we are desirous of 
     <lb/>continuing to enjoy, in the  midst of the 
     <lb/>various races who inhabit this vast continent 
     <lb/>of America, the institutions which have been 
     <lb/>so carefully preserved for us, and which are 
     <lb/>more precious to us than life itself, require 
     <lb/>to seek an alliance with the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>the other British. American Provinces, with 
     <lb/>which we have interests in common, which 
     <lb/>will have, in case of invasion, the same 
     <lb/>enemies as ourselves to repulse, and which, 
     <lb/>like ourselves, enjoy the advantage of living 
     <lb/>under the protection of Great Britain. At 
     <lb/>a time when we are, so to speak, threatened 
     <lb/>by the United States, ought we to be so 
     <lb/>foolish as to disregard the advice which 
     <lb/>comes to us from Great Britain, without 
     <lb/>whom we could do nothing for our defence, 
     <lb/>and to pretend seriously that we can 
     <lb/>without danger overthrow the Federal 
     <lb/>union which we are discussing, in  the 
     <lb/>preparation of which our statesmen them<lb break="no"/>selves prescribed the conditions which 
     <lb/>they considered to be most equitable and the 
     <lb/>best calculated to preserve the  interests 
     <lb/>which are most dear to all? Should we act 
     <lb/>in this way, we should be forming a very 
     <lb/>incorrect estimate of our position in relation 
     <lb/>to England, and our formidable neighbours 
     <lb/>the United States. The distinguished men 
     <lb/>who took part in the Conference held at 
     <lb/>Quebec in the month of October last, unani<lb break="no"/>mously declared that " the best interests and 
     <lb/>present and future prosperity of British 
     <lb/>North America will be promoted by a Fede<lb break="no"/>ral union under the Crown of Great Britain, 
     <lb/>provided such union can be effected on prin<lb break="no"/>ciples just to the several provinces." The 
     <lb/>most eminent men in England have repeated 
     <lb/>the same thing, and have approved of the 
     <lb/>scheme of the Conference. I do not pro<lb break="no"/>pose, Mr. SPEAKER, to discuss the several 
     <lb/>articles contained in the plan of union; the 
     <lb/>honorable members who have preceded me 
     <lb/>
            <pb n="784" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0784.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">784</fw>
            
     in this debate have, in my opinion, said all 
     <lb/>
     that can be said on each of the articles. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, the erudite and carefully-weighed 
     <lb/>
    papers on the subject which have been pub<lb break="no"/>lished in this city in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Journal de Québec</hi> 
     <lb/>
    and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Courrier du Canada</hi> have contri<lb break="no"/>buted to diffusing a knowledge of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     in no less degree than the numerous 
     <lb/>
      speeches which have been delivered in this 
     <lb/>
    House. Despite the good opinion which I 
     <lb/>have of some of the honorable members who 
     <lb/>have endeavored to prove to this House and 
     <lb/>to the country that the proposed union would 
     <lb/>be more disastrous than advantageous in its 
     <lb/>results to the several provinces affected by 
     <lb/>it, I must acknowledge that their arguments 
     <lb/>have not convinced me—I will even say did 
     <lb/>not appear to me to be convincing. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) The hon. member for Lotbinière for 
     <lb/>example, in whom, as he is aware, I have 
     <lb/>confidence, and from whom I greatly re<lb break="no"/>gret to differ in opinion on a measure 
     <lb/>of such importance, is opposed to any 
     <lb/>alteration in our present Constitution. He 
     <lb/>finds that everything has been for the best. 
     <lb/>The following is what he said in his eloquent 
     <lb/>speech :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Let us not be dazzled by the ambition of be<lb break="no"/>coming, all at once, a great people. The United

     <lb/>
     their greatness? Let us be satisfied with our lot; 
     <lb/>
     few people have a better.

            <p>
     I agree with my honorable friend to a certain 
     <lb/>
     extent. Like him, I do not envy the lot of 
     <lb/>
     the United States, but I disagree with him 
     <lb/>
     as to the means to be taken to protect us 
     <lb/>
     against our adversaries, even against the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and to preserve our nation<lb break="no"/>ality. The honorable member, to prove that 
     <lb/>
     the union proposed would be an evil, quoted 
     <lb/>
     to us the following extract from Lord 
     <lb/>
     BROUGHAM'S work on <hi rendition="simple:italic">Political Philosophy</hi> : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The Federal union, by keeping up a line of 
     <lb/>
     separation between its members, gives the freest 
     <lb/>
     scope to these pernicious prejudices, feelings 
     <lb/>
     which it is the highest duty of all governments to 
     <lb/>
     eradicate, because they lead directly to confusion 
     <lb/>
     and war. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I may mistake, but it appears to me that 
     <lb/>
     this extract from Lord BROUGHAM'S work is 
     <lb/>
     not so much opposed to a Federal union, 
     <lb/>
     such as that which is proposed to us, as it is 
     <lb/>
     to the existing situation of the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadians. In fact there is a strong line of 
     <lb/>
     demarcation in this province between the 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of Upper Canada and those of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada; it is that very line of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     demarcation which has given rise to the 
     <lb/>
     sectional difficulties which our statesmen 
     <lb/>
     have undertaken to settle in a friendly way. 
     <lb/>
     The leaders of the Opposition themselves 
     <lb/>
     undertook to settle these difficulties in a 
     <lb/>
     manner much less advantageous to Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. If then the opinion of Lord 
     <lb/>
     BROUGHAM is to be an authority in this 
     <lb/>
     case, it would be the duty of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of this province to remove the line of 
     <lb/>
     demarcation to which I have alluded as ex<lb break="no"/>isting between the inhabitants of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada and those of Lower Canada. This, 
     <lb/>
     I am satisfied, is not what my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend desires. (Hear, hear.) When speak<lb break="no"/>ing of the seven United Provinces (now 
     <lb/>
     Holland and Belgium), the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Lotbinière read the following extract from 
     <lb/>
    the first volume of Lord MACAULAY'S <hi rendition="simple:italic">His<lb break="no"/>tory of England</hi> :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The union of Utrecht, rudely formed amidst 
     <lb/>
     the agonies of a revolution, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     meeting immediate exigencies, had never been 
     <lb/>
     deliberately revised and perfected in a time of 
     <lb/>
     tranquillity. Every one of the seven common<lb break="no"/>wealths which that union had bound together 
     <lb/>
     retained almost all the rights of sovereignty, and 
     <lb/>
     asserted those rights punctiliously against the 
     <lb/>
     Central Government.  
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
               
            <p>This is all that the honorable member quoted 
     <lb/>from Lord MACAULAY. As may be seen, 
     <lb/>Mr. SPEAKER, this author is not opposed to 
     <lb/>a Federal union; he simply points out the 
     <lb/>defects of the union of Utrecht. That union 
     <lb/>had been rudely formed, in the midst of a 
     <lb/>revolution, for the purpose of meeting imme<lb break="no"/>diate exigencies. But our plan of union 
     <lb/>was weighed with deliberation, in a time of 
     <lb/>tranquillity, and this tranquillity is certainly 
     <lb/>the result of the formation of the present 
     <lb/>Coalition Government. Therefore, the author 
     <lb/>who has been quoted merely demonstrates 
     <lb/>one thing, and that is, that we should be 
     <lb/>wrong to await the convulsions of a revolu<lb break="no"/>tion, or of an invasion, in order to discuss 
     <lb/>the bases of a Federal union. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>The honorable member for Lotbinière gave 
     <lb/>us to understand that the most certain 
     <lb/>method of obtaining the friendship of the 
     <lb/>Maritime Provinces, and of securing their 
     <lb/>sympathy and zeal in case of attack, was, so 
     <lb/>to speak, to have nothing in common with 
     <lb/>those provinces. I believe, on the contrary, 
     <lb/>that Lower Canada would gain by causing 
     <lb/>herself to be better known, and by causing 
     <lb/>the spirit of justice and of liberality which 
     <lb/>prevails among her inhabitants and her 
     <lb/>institutions, as they at present exist, to be 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="785" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0785.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">785</fw>
            
     better known. Does not the best under<lb break="no"/>standing exist between the people of different 
     <lb/>
     origins in all classes of society? We every 
     <lb/>
     day perceive with pleasure, and I am happy 
     <lb/>
     to say it, that Lower Canada has risen greatly 
     <lb/>
     in the estimation of hon. members from Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, since it has been their lot to reside 
     <lb/>
     in our midst, and to see for themselves what 
     <lb/>
     our institutions are, and what we are our<lb break="no"/>selves. (Hear.) I hope that my honorable 
     <lb/>
     friend the member for Lotbinière will forgive 
     <lb/>
     me if I take the liberty of discussing, for a 
     <lb/>
     few seconds longer, certain portions of his 
     <lb/>
     speech; but I am very anxious to convince 
     <lb/>
     him that I listened to him with great atten<lb break="no"/>tion, and that if he did not succeed in con<lb break="no"/>vincing me, it was from no fault of mine. 
     <lb/>
     To set us on our guard against the proposed 
     <lb/>
     union, the hon. member laid before us a hasty 
     <lb/>
     sketch of the history of Ancient Greece, in 
     <lb/>
     order to shew us the hatred which the 
     <lb/>
     Athenians bore to the Spartans. No doubt 
     <lb/>
     he fears that that hatred, should the union 
     <lb/>
     be consummated, will manifest itself between 
     <lb/>
     the inhabitants of Lower Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of Newfoundland and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island. He also took us a long 
     <lb/>
     journey through various countries, in which 
     <lb/>
     he pointed out to us frequent insurrections, 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">échauffourées</hi> and troubles of all kinds among 
     <lb/>
     people living under a system of Federal 
     <lb/>
     union, and therefrom he drew the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that Federal unions are bad and pernicious. 
     <lb/>
     But did the honorable member shew us that 
     <lb/>
     the political condition of those nations, pre<lb break="no"/>vious to their Federative union, was analogous 
     <lb/>
    to ours? Did he shew us that the basis of  
     <lb/>those Federal unions was similar to the basis 
     <lb/>of that which we propose to establish? Did 
     <lb/>those unions cause those nations to pass 
     <lb/>from a state of prosperity, tranquillity, and 
     <lb/>happiness, to the state in which they have 
     <lb/>been held up to our view? Were they situ<lb break="no"/>ated as we are? Had they the same procli<lb break="no"/>vities, the same tastes, and the same antece<lb break="no"/>dents as we have? Did they, as we do, trace 
     <lb/>their descent from the two wisest, the two 
     <lb/>greatest nations in the world? Lastly, had 
     <lb/>they, as we have, the Crown of England to 
     <lb/>protect them? No! they were not possessed 
     <lb/>of any of the advantages of which we are 
     <lb/>possessed, and no comparison between the 
     <lb/>two cases was possible. (Hear hear.) 
     <lb/> Besides, Mr. SPEAKER, is it not suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to cast a glance at the history of all 
     <lb/>countries, to perceive that everywhere, under 
     <lb/>all possible institutions, there have arisen, not 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
           
    only <hi rendition="simple:italic">échauffourées</hi>, but even frequent wars 
     <lb/>
     and sanguinary revolutions, characterized 
     <lb/>
     by the greatest horrors? Have not the 
     <lb/>
     institutions of England and France been 
     <lb/>
     consecrated in rivers of blood? All these 
     <lb/>
     arguments and reasonings adduced by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Lotbinière are there<lb break="no"/>fore not applicable to the question which is 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us, and are not of a nature to 
     <lb/>
     change the opinions of those who are in 
     <lb/>
     favor of a Federal union of all the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I now return to certain objections offered by 
     <lb/>
     other honorable members of the Opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the present scheme of the Government. 
     <lb/>
     Thus, they spoke to us of divorce, and tried 
     <lb/>
     to show us that great inconvenience would 
     <lb/>
     result from leaving to the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment the right of legislating on that subject. 
     <lb/>
     But they do not remark that by this means 
     <lb/>
     the members from Lower Canada, that is to 
     <lb/>
     say, in the Local Legislature, will be exon<lb break="no"/>erated from taking those questions into 
     <lb/>
     consideration. At the present day, all the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic members from Lower Canada are 
     <lb/>
     opposed to divorce as a matter of expediency 
     <lb/>
     and of conscience, and yet, even in the 
     <lb/>
     existing Legislature, they cannot prevent it. 
     <lb/>
     Why, therefore, blame the Government for 
     <lb/>
     not having prevented in the Federal Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment that which they cannot even prevent 
     <lb/>
     here? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAFR1">HON. MR. LAFRAMBOISE</persName>—They could 
     <lb/>
     prevent divorces in Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REMI1">MR. RÉMILLARD</persName>—Has it ever been 
     <lb/>
     very easy to impose in Lower Canada laws 
     <lb/>
     upon the English inhabitants of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and to prevent them from obtaining 
     <lb/>
     what they consider as a right? No; it 
     <lb/>
     would have been an act of injustice to 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to force our opinions on this subject 
     <lb/>
     on the English and Protestant population of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada; and if an attempt had been 
     <lb/>
     made to do so, Confederation would probably 
     <lb/>
     have failed, because the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Conference would have main<lb break="no"/>tained their claims, and this would have been 
     <lb/>
     sufficient to prevent Confederation. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is not to be urged as a crime against 
     <lb/>
     the Government that they have permitted 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Legislature to have the power 
     <lb/>
     of legislating upon subjects upon which we 
     <lb/>
     ourselves may legislate. For my part, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, I did not enter upon this question 
     <lb/>
     in order to judge the scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I have sufficient confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     clergy to admit that on this question they 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="786" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0786.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">786</fw>
            
     are the best judges, and it is they who ought 
     <lb/>
     to decide whether there is danger or not; 
     <lb/>
     and there can be no doubt but that the 
     <lb/>
     bishops and the clergy have consulted to<lb break="no"/>gether respecting this article, and that they 
     <lb/>
     came to the conclusion that it is an evil 
     <lb/>
     which there are no means of preventing. 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member for Verchères (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     GEOFFRION) maintained that it was neces<lb break="no"/>sary to state clearly in the resolutions what 
     <lb/>
     were the intentions of the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Conference in relation to marriage and divorce, 
     <lb/>
     in order that the Imperial Government may 
     <lb/>
     not impose upon us a Constitution other than 
     <lb/>
     that for which we ask. Now, I have more 
     <lb/>
     confidence than he has in the word of our 
     <lb/>
     public men, and in the sense of justice of the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Government. Our public men 
     <lb/>
     having made a compromise, and asked a 
     <lb/>
      Constitution for the British North American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, which is to do away with the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties which exist in the province, are 
     <lb/>
     we for a single instant to believe that when 
     <lb/>
     this scheme, which is framed to reestablish 
     <lb/>
     that peace, harmony and concord of which 
     <lb/>
     we stand in need, is carried to England that 
     <lb/>
     a clause will be inserted which would raise 
     <lb/>
     the Lower-Canadians like one man? In such 
     <lb/>
     a case we should see petitions pour into the 
     <lb/>
     House headed with the signatures of the 
     <lb/>
     principal members of the clergy, exclaiming 
     <lb/>
     against such injustice; in such a case we 
     <lb/>
     should see real petitions against this attack 
     <lb/>
     upon our religious rights. If our institutions 
     <lb/>
     should be so menaced, the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people would do themselves justice, if it 
     <lb/>
     was refused to them, and we should no 
     <lb/>
     longer enjoy that peace which now prevails 
     <lb/>
     in Canada between populations of different 
     <lb/>
     origins and belief, in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     absence of disquietude among the people— 
     <lb/>
     (hear, hear)—I have confidence enough in 
     <lb/>
     the clergy and bishops of Lower Canada to 
     <lb/>
     believe that if that clause, on which so much 
     <lb/>
     stress is laid, was of a nature to do any 
     <lb/>
     injury to our religious interests, they would 
     <lb/>
     loudly exclaim against it and have justice 
     <lb/>
     done us. Our bishops are not in the habit 
     <lb/>
     of standing in fear of the civil authorities, 
     <lb/>
     when their duty calls them to defend the 
     <lb/>
     interests which are entrusted to them. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is stated also that the 
     <lb/>
     clergy are not in favor of the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, because two or three of its 
     <lb/>
     members have written in newspapers and 
     <lb/>
     have signed petitions opposed to the scheme. 
     <lb/>
     But is that a manifestation of the opinion of 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the clergy? No; for they do not write in 
     <lb/>
     the name of the clergy, but simply in their 
     <lb/>
     individual capacity as citizens; for they sign 
     <lb/>
     their writings under their title as citizens. 
     <lb/>
     Certain members of the clergy may differ 
     <lb/>
     widely in opinion from the remainder of 
     <lb/>
     their brethren; as citizens they may believe 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme of Confederation is a bad 
     <lb/>
     one, but those who hold that opinion are 
     <lb/>
     certainly a minority, just as in the House it 
     <lb/>
     is the minority of the members who are 
     <lb/>
     opposed to Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Mention is also made of the use of the 
     <lb/>
     French language; it is said that it cannot 
     <lb/>
     be used in the Federal Parliament. But, 
     <lb/>
     for my part, I am of opinion that if the 
     <lb/>
     scheme is adopted, the French language will 
     <lb/>
     be more used and will be held in higher 
     <lb/>
     estimation in the Federal Parliament, than 
     <lb/>
     it has been in this Legislature for some 
     <lb/>
     years. It is feared that the laws, the 
     <lb/>
     documents and the proceedings of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Parliament are not to be printed in 
     <lb/>
     the French language. But what does the 
     <lb/>
     46th clause of the resolutions say? It says :— 
     <lb/>
   
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>Both the English and French languages may 
     <lb/>be employed in the General Parliament, and in 
     <lb/>its proceedings, and in the Local Legislature of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada, and also in the Federal courts, 
     <lb/>and in the courts of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
            <p>Thus, if the use of the French language can 
     <lb/>be excluded, so also may the use of the 
     <lb/>English language be excluded, for both are 
     <lb/>on an equal footing. Because it is not 
     <lb/>stated that the laws and the proceedings of 
     <lb/>the Federal Parliament shall be printed in 
     <lb/>the French language, the conclusion is 
     <lb/>drawn that they will be so in English; but 
     <lb/>the same thing might be said of the English 
     <lb/>language, as it is not stated that they will 
     <lb/>be printed in that language. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for Verchères (Mr. GEOFFRION) 
     <lb/>would have something more; instead of the 
     <lb/>resolutions setting forth that the French 
     <lb/>language may be used, he would have them 
     <lb/>declare that it shall be used; in that case 
     <lb/>the members from Lower Canada might be 
     <lb/>compelled to speak French; but are the 
     <lb/>Upper Canadian members also to be forced 
     <lb/>to speak that language, they who do not 
     <lb/>understand a word of it? I should be with 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Verchères if we could 
     <lb/>compel Lower Canadian members to speak 
     <lb/>French, and Upper Canadian members to 
     <lb/>speak English, as in that case each would 
     <lb/>learn the language of the other. I am really 
     <lb/>of opinion that if the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="787" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0787.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">787</fw>
            
     for Lower Canada had never spoken anything 
     <lb/>
     but French in this House, the members 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada would have learned that 
     <lb/>
     language in order to understand him; but 
     <lb/>
     as he wishes to make them understand him 
     <lb/>
     without putting them to that trouble, he 
     <lb/>
     most frequently speaks English. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It is said that in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     the guarantees which we seek to have for 
     <lb/>
     our language, our laws and our institutions 
     <lb/>
     are not clearly enough expressed, and that 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government might, consequent<lb break="no"/>ly, confer upon us something other than that 
     <lb/>
     for which we ask. But could not the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government impose Confederation 
     <lb/>
     upon us as it did the union? And as it 
     <lb/>
     does not do so, but is merely desirous of 
     <lb/>
     being consulted, we ought not to believe 
     <lb/>
     that it will impose upon us conditions which 
     <lb/>
     are opposed to our interests.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAFR1">HON. MR. LAFRAMBOISE</persName>—It is pro<lb break="no"/>posed to impose it on the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     who do not wish for it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REMI1">MR. RÉMILLARD</persName>—Certain hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers consider our present position an excellent 
     <lb/>
     one, and say they do not wish it altered. 
     <lb/>
     But that is not the opinion of the greater 
     <lb/>
     number, and nearly all the hon. members of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition have declared that changes 
     <lb/>
     are indispensible and necessary. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga has acknowledged it, 
     <lb/>
     and has expressed his opinion on the subject. 
     <lb/>
     When I was a supporter of the MACDONALD- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     DORION Administration, I understood that 
     <lb/>
     the members of that Government were of 
     <lb/>
     opinion that changes were necessary, and that 
     <lb/>
     we could not very long remain in our present 
     <lb/>
     position. The hon. member for Hochelaga 
     <lb/>
     has admitted that the opinion of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada must be respected, and that to it 
     <lb/>
     would have to be granted representation 
     <lb/>
     based on population; and the influence of 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada made itself felt by the MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD-DORION Administration; it made 
     <lb/>
     itself felt especially when, just before the 
     <lb/>
     last general elections, it became necessary 
     <lb/>
     to oust the Honorable Mr. SICOTTE from the 
     <lb/>
     Ministry to satisfy Upper Canada. By 
     <lb/>
     means of Mr. SICOTTE, elections had been 
     <lb/>
     secured sufficiently advantageous in their 
     <lb/>
     results to overthrow the CARTIER-MACDON<lb break="no"/>ALD Administration, to which I was opposed, 
     <lb/>
     because I did not wish to see a coalition 
     <lb/>
     between the parties, and because I consid<lb break="no"/>ered that that Government had made too free 
     <lb/>
     a use of the public money. But I foresaw 
     <lb/>
     that sooner or later I should return to the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     Conservative party, from which I had de<lb break="no"/>tached myself in consequence of the extra<lb break="no"/>vagant conduct of two or three of its leaders, 
     <lb/>
     and in consequence I was then elected with<lb break="no"/>out the assistance of any party. Alone I 
     <lb/>
     strove with the Conservative party in my 
     <lb/>
     county. I was faithful to the friends with 
     <lb/>
     whom I went at the time, and I do not regret 
     <lb/>
     that I went with them; so long as they 
     <lb/>
     stood in need of me, I supported them in 
     <lb/>
     order that they might avail themselves of 
     <lb/>
     circumstances to bring about a change in the 
     <lb/>
     financial affairs of the country. I would not 
     <lb/>
     change my party then, but matters and cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances having changed, I consulted my 
     <lb/>
     friends in the county which I represent, 
     <lb/>
     and I was then able to go with the men 
     <lb/>
     whom I consider able to protect and preserve 
     <lb/>
     our institutions and the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     country in general. For this reason I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to accept the scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion prepared by them, for I have more con<lb break="no"/>fidence, as regards the preservation of our 
     <lb/>
     rights and our institutions, in the men who 
     <lb/>
     are now in power than in those with whom 
     <lb/>
     I formerly worked. (Hear, hear.) I can<lb break="no"/>not do otherwise than declare it. It is not 
     <lb/>
     my wish to insult any one; I merely state 
     <lb/>
     the reasons which have decided me to go 
     <lb/>
     with them; and as I find that it is always 
     <lb/>
     necessary to be in favor of one party or the 
     <lb/>
     other in this House, that is to say, for that 
     <lb/>
     one which is considered to be the best, 
     <lb/>
     I do not hesitate to state my opinion and to 
     <lb/>
     declare myself in favor of the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party. (Hear, hear.) It was my intention 
     <lb/>
     to reply to the speech of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Richelieu (Mr. PERRAULT), but I per<lb break="no"/>ceive that my ideas do not flow rapidly, and 
     <lb/>
     moreover, I do not wish longer to fatigue 
     <lb/>
     the House.

            <p>
     SEVERAL VOICES—Go on! go on! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR RÉMILLARD—Well, I listened 
     <lb/>
     with pain to the language used by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Richelieu. Should what he 
     <lb/>
     said in French be repeated by some one in 
     <lb/>
     English, I should greatly fear that it would 
     <lb/>
     give rise to prejudice against us among the 
     <lb/>
     English members. (Hear, hear.) Last 
     <lb/>
     year he said to the members from Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada,—" The French-Canadians are learn<lb break="no"/>ing the use of arms, and if you insist upon 
     <lb/>
     having representation based upon population, 
     <lb/>
     they will be turned against you;" and this 
     <lb/>
     year he says that one Lower Canadian can 
     <lb/>
     stand against ten Upper Canadians. He 
     <lb/>
     considers himself fortunate in being under 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="788" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0788.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">788</fw>
            
     the protection of the English flag, and yet 
     <lb/>
     his whole speech was one insult to the 
     <lb/>
     English Government. (Hear, hear.) Does 
     <lb/>
     he forget, then, that the French-Canadians 
     <lb/>
     are in a minority ? He talked a great deal 
     <lb/>
     about the great men who saved our nation<lb break="no"/>ality ; but if those men had made use of 
     <lb/>
     such language as the hon. member has done, 
     <lb/>
     they would not have obtained that which 
     <lb/>
     they did obtain. (Hear, hear.) Our 
     <lb/>
     nationality would long since have passed 
     <lb/>
     away ; for, I repeat it, his whole speech was 
     <lb/>
     one insult to England and Englishmen. 
     <lb/>
     Fortunately his speech was not understood 
     <lb/>
     by the English members of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     consequently it could produce no effect upon 
     <lb/>
     them ; and those who did understand him, 
     <lb/>
     moreover, are aware that he spoke for 
     <lb/>
    himself alone, and that he does not re<lb break="no"/>present the opinions of the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>members or of the Lower Canadian people. 
     <lb/>I am therefore convinced that they will bear 
     <lb/>no ill-will to the French-Canadians in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of that speech. (Hear, hear.) It 
     <lb/>has been said that the scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion would entail the imposition of enormous 
     <lb/>taxes, and that we should have to provide 
     <lb/>for the defence of the country. And yet 
     <lb/>most of the hon. members who oppose this 
     <lb/>scheme acknowledge that the defence of the 
     <lb/>country must he provided for, or at least 
     <lb/>that we must contribute our share to it. 
     <lb/>Under the present <hi rendition="simple:italic">régime</hi>, the Government 
     <lb/>has the right of presenting a bill respecting 
     <lb/>the militia or the defences, and the members 
     <lb/>may accept it or may reject it if they con<lb break="no"/>sider it too burdensome for us ; and will the 
     <lb/>case be different in the Federal Parliament ? 
     <lb/>We shall lose nothing, under Confederation, 
     <lb/>in respect of defence, for we shall have allies 
     <lb/>who will assist us in economising and in 
     <lb/>preventing the adoption of any measure 
     <lb/>which would be beyond the strength of the 
     <lb/>country, for the people of the other prov<lb break="no"/>inces are no fonder of taxation than are 
     <lb/>those of Lower Canada. It is perfectly well 
     <lb/>known that any change in our position would 
     <lb/>be only to our advantage, under Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, in relation to defence ; for if the United 
     <lb/>States should attack the English provinces, 
     <lb/>they would attack all the provinces together ; 
     <lb/>they would probably begin by attacking 
     <lb/>Canada, because they think more of Canada 
     <lb/>than of the Lower Provinces. In case of 
     <lb/>difficulties arising between England and the 
     <lb/>United States, the burthen of war would 
     <lb/>fall upon us, for we should he first attacked. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     It is, therefore, our interest to be able to 
     <lb/>
     receive aid from the Maritime Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and to be able to convey the reinforcements 
     <lb/>
     which they would send us, and which Eng<lb break="no"/>land would send us, by railway. As regards 
     <lb/>
     defence, I am of opinion that Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     would be found to occupy the most advan<lb break="no"/>tageous position in the Confederacy, being 
     <lb/>
     situated in the centre of all the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) In a material point of view, 
     <lb/>
     we could not but grow and advance. The 
     <lb/>
     annexationists of the district of Montreal 
     <lb/>
     only are afraid of Confederation. Indeed, 
     <lb/>
     all the commercial transactions of the dis» 
     <lb/>
     trict of Montreal are with the United States. 
     <lb/>
     But if we are not desirous of being annexed 
     <lb/>
     to the United States, and if we are desirous 
     <lb/>
     of preserving the institutions which are so 
     <lb/>
     dear to us, I maintain that we must con<lb break="no"/>struct a Confederacy which shall be compe<lb break="no"/>tent to protect us from the United States. 
     <lb/>
     If we will do nothing to show England that 
     <lb/>
     we are disposed to improve our position in 
     <lb/>
     relation to the defence of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces, we expose ourselves to 
     <lb/>
     see England withdraw her forces and aban<lb break="no"/>don us, because she cannot, unaided, carry 
     <lb/>
     on the strife with the United States. With 
     <lb/>
     our help, she would be certain of victory. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) We ought, therefore, to build 
     <lb/>
     up a Constitution which will establish such 
     <lb/>
     relations between all the provinces as shall 
     <lb/>
     make of them a single state and a single 
     <lb/>
     people, who will unite in case of war. We 
     <lb/>
     may change our Constitution without alter<lb break="no"/>ing our institutions, and I maintain that the 
     <lb/>
     more monarchical our government is, the 
     <lb/>
     safer will our institutions be, for in those 
     <lb/>
     institutions the monarchical principle espe<lb break="no"/>cially predominates. It is in consequence of 
     <lb/>
     our having always been at peace that those 
     <lb/>
     institutions have grown and prospered. If 
     <lb/>
     England should abandon her colonies. the 
     <lb/>
     United States would take possession of us, 
     <lb/>
     and we should soon disappear, for the Ame<lb break="no"/>rican Constitution is not sufficient to protect 
     <lb/>
     our institutions. The citizens of the United 
     <lb/>
     States would show but little respect for 
     <lb/>
     those institutions, and the law would not 
     <lb/>
     be powerful enough to prevent the masses 
     <lb/>
     from spreading themselves in our midst, and 
     <lb/>
     from depriving us of what we hold most 
     <lb/>
     dear. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, I say 
     <lb/>
     that I unite with pleasure with the men 
     <lb/>
     who are now proposing a scheme which 
     <lb/>
     I consider to be of a nature to preserve our 
     <lb/>
     institutions, our language, our laws and our 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PAQU1">DR. PAQUET</persName> —Mr. SPEAKER, although 
     <lb/>
     I am not in the habit of addressing the 
     <lb/>
     House, and although the question now under 
     <lb/>
     consideration has already been discussed at 
     <lb/>
     great length, I cannot allow so important an 
     <lb/>
     occasion to pass without making known the 
     <lb/>
     reasons which induce me to protest against 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional changes which are now pro<lb break="no"/>posed, and which tend to nothing less than 
     <lb/>
     the complete overthrowing of the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion under which we have been governed 
     <lb/>
     since the union of Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Since the prorogation of Parliament in June 
     <lb/>
     last, I have endeavored in vain to explain to 
     <lb/>
     myself the advantages which we, Lower Can<lb break="no"/>adians, would derive from Confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     I had lost myself in the motives and the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of a union of this kind, when I had the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of reading in the speech of the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for Sherbrooke that " the 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Confederation had not been a new 
     <lb/>
     question since the days of Lord DURHAM, 
     <lb/>
     that only the question of carrying it into ef<lb break="no"/>fect was wanting." After having read this 
     <lb/>
     significant passage, I set myself to work to 
     <lb/>
     study and ascertain what were the tendencies 
     <lb/>
     and spirit which actuated Lord DURHAM, 
     <lb/>
     and more especially, what object he had in 
     <lb/>
     view. I did not take long to convince myself, 
     <lb/>
     as any Lower Canadian member may do on 
     <lb/>
     reading his celebrated report, that everything 
     <lb/>
     he had in view was calculated to secure our 
     <lb/>
     annihilation as French-Canadians, and that 
     <lb/>
     he desired neither more nor less than to sub<lb break="no"/>ject us to a ruling power exclusively English. 
     <lb/>
     When we see, Mr. SPEAKER, the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers from Upper Canada rejoicing over such 
     <lb/>
     a scheme, and declaring themselves so much 
     <lb/>
     the more satisfied from the fact that they 
     <lb/>
     would obtain, by this fine stroke of policy, 
     <lb/>
     more than they had at first hoped for, when 
     <lb/>
     the honorable member for Lambton  (Mr. A. 
     <lb/>
     MACKENZIE), whilst avowing, as he has al<lb break="no"/>ways done, that his views are but incomplete<lb break="no"/>ly expressed in the language which I am 
     <lb/>
     about to read, there is reason for some little 
     <lb/>
     alarm. This is what that honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     said in the House the other night :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     I believe then, sir, in the first place, that Con<lb break="no"/>federation is desirable ; in the second, that it is 
     <lb/>
     attainable ; and in the third place, that it is the 
     <lb/>
     best thing we can get, and this last is perhaps 
     <lb/>
     the strongest reason of all for accepting it. It is 
     <lb/>
    quite clear that we must have a settlement of our 
     <lb/>difficulties in some way, and I think the scheme 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     proposed is a very favorable settlement of them.

     think it is more than, perhaps, some of us ex<lb break="no"/>pected, at the time when the present Government 
     <lb/>
     was formed, to bring about a settlement, and I 
     <lb/>
     do think, sir, it would be the greatest act of mad<lb break="no"/>ness that western members of this House could 
     <lb/>
     perpetrate, to vote against it. (Hear, hear.) I 
     <lb/>
     am not, however, afraid that it will be voted 
     <lb/>
     against by them. I believe that under it we have 
     <lb/>
     obtained representation by population, that we 
     <lb/>
     have obtained what we have long contended was 
     <lb/>
     justly due to us, that we have obtained our legi<lb break="no"/>timate influence in framing the financial policy of 
     <lb/>
     the conntry, and that beyond this we have ob<lb break="no"/>tained the prospect of building up a great British 
     <lb/>
     union on this continent. We should therefore, I 
     <lb/>
     think, in view of these great advantages, overlook 
     <lb/>
     those objections which may be regarded as ante<lb break="no"/>cedent to the scheme, and endeavor heartily to 
     <lb/>
     carry out the work successfully. I shall willingly 
     <lb/>
     yield my support to the scheme, and I believe it 
     <lb/>
     will be acceptable to the people I represent—not 
     <lb/>
     only to the people of the locality, but to those 
     <lb/>
     who surround me in Upper Canada.

     If, Mr. SPEAKER, honorable gentlemen from 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada are permitted to give utter<lb break="no"/>ance to such opinions as these, I hope that 
     <lb/>
     my fellow-countrymen from Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     will permit me to vindicate their rights. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) But let us proceed to examine 
     <lb/>
     this Confederation, to which the practical 
     <lb/>
     question is alone wanting. I read from the 
     <lb/>
     report of Lord DURHAM :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     I entertain no doubts as to the national char<lb break="no"/>acter which must be given to Lower Canada ; it 
     <lb/>
     must be that of the British Empire ; that of the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the population of British America ; 
     <lb/>
     that of the great race which must, in the lapse of 
     <lb/>
     no long period of time, be predominant over the 
     <lb/>
     whole North American continent. Without 
     <lb/>
     effecting the change so rapidly or roughly as to 
     <lb/>
     shock the feelings and trample on the welfare of 
     <lb/>
     the existing generation, it must henceforth be the 
     <lb/>
     first and steady purpose of the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to establish an English population, with 
     <lb/>
     English laws and language, in this province, and 
     <lb/>
     to trust its government to none but a decidedly 
     <lb/>
     English legislature.

     If the population of Upper Canada is rightly

     Lower Canada at 150,000 and the French at 
     <lb/>
     450,000, the union of the two provinces will not

     only give a clear English majority, but one which 
     <lb/>
     would be increased every year by the influence of

     the French, when once placed, by the legitimate

     The completion of any satisfactory commu<lb break="no"/>nication between Halifax and Quebec would, 
     <lb/>
     in fact, produce relations between these provin<lb break="no"/>ces that would render a general union absolutely

            <p>
     And thus we come to the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way; and it is easy to perceive that Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM, from the beginning to the end of 
     <lb/>
     his report, preaches in favor of the very Con<lb break="no"/>federation which we are about to have im<lb break="no"/>posed upon us. Even before Lord DURHAM, 
     <lb/>
     Judge SEWELL, in 1814, had expressed opin<lb break="no"/>ions nearly similar to those of the noble lord, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1839 the whole of the present plan of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation was traced out. The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Montmorency pretends that Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM was mistaken ; but for my part I 
     <lb/>
     find, in addition to the other causes of reproach 
     <lb/>
     which have been accumulated against the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Conference, we may urge this, 
     <lb/>
     that they did not give Lord DURHAM credit 
     <lb/>
     for the work he had already done, and that 
     <lb/>
     they did not endorse upon the scheme of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation now laid before us the words 
     <lb/>
     " True copy of the scheme of Lord DURHAM 
     <lb/>
     as set forth in his report to the British Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment." (Hear, hear.) French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     nationality has been talked about. Lord 
     <lb/>
     DURHAM speaks of it in his report in the 
     <lb/>
     following terms : "The error of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada consists especially in that vain attempt to 
     <lb/>
     preserve a French-Canadian nationality in the 
     <lb/>
     midst of Anglo-American states and colonies." 
     <lb/>
     When is the imposition of a new nationality 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     spoken of, if not at the time when it is sought 
     <lb/>
     to snatch from a people that which it already 
     <lb/>
     possesses ? There will be opposition, I trust ; 
     <lb/>
     for otherwise, Mr. SPEAKER, I cannot com<lb break="no"/>prehend the logic of honorable members who 
     <lb/>
     emphatically declare that they will stand by it 
     <lb/>
     at any risk. I am well aware that the na<lb break="no"/>tionality of a people cannot be changed by a 
     <lb/>
     mere act of the Legislature ; but why should 
     <lb/>
     obstacles be placed in our path, why should 
     <lb/>
     we submit to the yoke of the oppressor, when 
     <lb/>
     there is no legitimate ground for imposing it 
     <lb/>
     upon us ? Another reason which gives me 
     <lb/>
     good ground for hoping that the work of 
     <lb/>
     destruction will not be accomplished in a 
     <lb/>
     hurry, as desired by the honorable members 
     <lb/>
     of the Administration, is that it is a difficult 
     <lb/>
     matter to ostracise a people which numbers 
     <lb/>
     more than a million. The example of Bel<lb break="no"/>gium suffices to prove it to us, and also that 
     <lb/>
     of Greece, which, after three centuries of ty<lb break="no"/>ranny and oppression, stood up manfully and 
     <lb/>
     exclaimed, " We are still Greeks." I am 
     <lb/>
     confident, then, that following their example, 
     <lb/>
     in defiance of all the constitutions that may 
     <lb/>
     be framed for us, and of all the vexations to 
     <lb/>
     which we may have to submit, we also shall 
     <lb/>
     come out triumphant from our trials exclaim<lb break="no"/>ing, " We are still French-Canadians." (Hear, 
     <lb/>
    hear.) The honorable members of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and especially those from Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, ought not to forget, either in our 
     <lb/>interest or in their own, that a generation 
     <lb/>which detaches itself from the generations 
     <lb/>which preceded it runs the risk of being repu<lb break="no"/>diated by the generations which come after ; 
     <lb/>that social existence is not concentrated in a 
     <lb/>single period, that it influences the future. 
     <lb/>These honorable gentlemen would do well to 
     <lb/>reflect on this before imposing upon us the 
     <lb/>practical question of Lord DURHAM. Passing 
     <lb/>now, Mr. SPEAKER, to the financial question, 
     <lb/>I regret that I cannot agree in the views 
     <lb/>expressed by the honorable member for Dor<lb break="no"/>chester (the Honorable Solicitor General for 
     <lb/>Lower Canada), who claims to have expressed 
     <lb/>an official opinion on this head. Although he 
     <lb/>has aflirmed that he drew them from authentlc 
     <lb/>sources, the results which he has obtained 
     <lb/>from his calculations ditfer from those which 
     <lb/>I have obtained, founded upon the figures 
     <lb/>which he has made use of to establish his 
     <lb/>proposition. He has declared that we shall 
     <lb/>have a surplus of $200,000.

     that sum the estimated amount of the

     and I ask you, Mr. SPEAKER, how are we

     to meet it otherwise than by direct taxation, 
     <lb/>
     or by diminishing the public appropriations, 
     <lb/>
     which are by no means excessive now? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) If we do not adapt the latter 
     <lb/>
     alternative, there will remain, I say, no 
     <lb/>
     other means than direct taxation. The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance, moreover, told us 
     <lb/>
     so expressly, in these words :—

     For my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I affirm that 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
               
     the country is not ready to submit to such a 
     <lb/>
     state of things, and in this matter, as also 
     <lb/>
     upon the scheme itself, I am quite certain 
     <lb/>
     that I express the opinion of my county. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) A third point, which I would 
     <lb/>
     humbly submit for the consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     House, is the expediency of pressing for 
     <lb/>
     the adoption of this measure before an ap<lb break="no"/>peal has been had to the people. I believe 
     <lb/>
     and I hope that the House will have too 
     <lb/>
     much respect for itself and for the people to 
     <lb/>
     vote at once upon the resolutions now sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us. If, however, public opinion is 
     <lb/>
     not to be regarded, I flatter myself that 
     <lb/>
     at all events precedents will not be treated 
     <lb/>
     with contempt.  We find in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">History of 
     <lb/>
     Canada</hi>, by CHRISTIE, that in 1823, when a 
     <lb/>
     proposition was made in the Lower Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to effect changes in the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, the following decision was come to 
     <lb/>
     by the Government of Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     the paragraph I am about to read formed 
     <lb/>
     part of the Speech from the Throne :—

     in England, in 1839, the measure was 
     <lb/>
     opposed at its second reading, and that a 
     <lb/>
     year was given to the Canadian people to 
     <lb/>
     reflect upon the merits of the proposed union 
     <lb/>
     of the two Canadas. (Hear, hear.) I trust 
     <lb/>
     then, Mr. SPEAKER, that what was done in 
     <lb/>
     1839 will again be done in relation to the

     project of Confederation. For these reasons 
     <lb/>
     I am of opinion that the Government ought 
     <lb/>
     not, in the first place, to humiliate us by 
     <lb/>
     taking from us the privileges to which we 
     <lb/>
     are entitled, then ruin us by a scheme which 
     <lb/>
     must triple the expenditure, and lastly, fail 
     <lb/>
     in the respect which they owe to the people, 
     <lb/>
     by refusing to consult them before changing 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution. If I am not greatly mis<lb break="no"/>taken, the party which is seeking these con<lb break="no"/>stitutional changes is the very party which 
     <lb/>
     calls itself Conservative, who obtained their 
     <lb/>
     elections to preserve and guard the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution, and which has always opposed us 
     <lb/>
     because, it exclaimed, we were the allies of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     BROWN), to whom, said they, we were ready 
     <lb/>
     to concede representation by population, the 
     <lb/>
     powerful lever which was to endanger all 
     <lb/>
     our civil and religious institutions.  Well, 
     <lb/>
     what do these hon. gentlemen do to-day ? 
     <lb/>
     Instead of preserving the Constitution, they 
     <lb/>
     change it and indeed destroy it, by granting 
     <lb/>
     to Upper Canada preponderance in the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation. I prove this by citing the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing extract from the speech of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance (Hon. Mr. GALT) :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     Now it became necessary to introduce into the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the Lower House the principle of 
     <lb/>
     representation proportioned to population ; for 
     <lb/>
     without that, Upper Canada, who has so long

     demanded this reform, would never have consent<lb break="no"/>ed to enter into the Confederation.

     If Upper Canada would never have consent<lb break="no"/>ed to enter into the Confederation without 
     <lb/>
     representation by population, then she has 
     <lb/>
     obtained it, as she has consented to enter the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation; and why say that that measure 
     <lb/>
     has not been conceded ? In conclusion, I 
     <lb/>
     affirm that the proposed Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces is only a Legislative union in dis<lb break="no"/>guise, and I will cite the language made use 
     <lb/>
     of a short time ago by a man well known 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country for his talents and 
     <lb/>
     his eloquence, at a meeting, held in the city 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal, to condemn the Ministerial 
     <lb/>
     scheme, that the present Confederation is 
     <lb/>
     but the chrysalis of a Legislative union, and 
     <lb/>
     that the butterfly would not be long in 
     <lb/>
     making its appearance. (Cheers.)

     <persName ref="pers:OHAL1">MR. O'HALLORAN</persName>—Before proceeding, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, to offer a few observations on 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions in your hands, I may say 
     <lb/>
     that if I had any hesitation in pronouncing 
     <lb/>
     on the merits of this scheme, I might have 
     <lb/>
     taken a preliminary exception to the jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion of this House to pass this measure. You, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     sir, and I were sent here to make laws, not 
     <lb/>
     legislatures. (Hear, hear.) We were sent 
     <lb/>
     here to work out the Constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     country—not to undermine and destroy it. 
     <lb/>
     There is not an elector from Gaspé to Sarnia, 
     <lb/>
     however humble he may be, who has not just 
     <lb/>
     as much right to pronounce upon this ques<lb break="no"/>tion as you and I have. Therefore, if it were 
     <lb/>
     my wish to shirk this question, which it is 
     <lb/>
     not, I could justify myself by saying it was 
     <lb/>
     no part of my mandate, or of the compact 
     <lb/>
     between me and those who sent me here. 
     <lb/>
     When we assume the power to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     question, to change the whole system of Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, to effect a revolution, peaceful 
     <lb/>
     though it be, without reference to the will 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this country, we arrogate 
     <lb/>
     to ourselves a right never conferred upon 
     <lb/>
     us, and our set is a usurpation. But I rise 
     <lb/>
     not for the purpose of discussing this scheme 
     <lb/>
     in detail, as it has already been discussed so 
     <lb/>
     fully—and I cannot possibly say much which 
     <lb/>
     may not already in substance have been 
     <lb/>
     said, and much better said than I could 
     <lb/>
     expect to say it—but I rise to record my 
     <lb/>
     protest against the usurpation which this 
     <lb/>
     House, in my humble opinion, is guilty 
     <lb/>
     of in undertaking to pass this measure, or, 
     <lb/>
     so far as in its power lies, to impose upon 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country a Constitution con<lb break="no"/>trary to their wishes—a Constitution which 
     <lb/>
     they will never have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     seeing, until they are called upon to submit to 
     <lb/>
     it and obey it. I rise to protest also against 
     <lb/>
     this parliamentary gag by which the at<lb break="no"/>tempt is made to suppress free discussion in 
     <lb/>
     this House, and to compel it to adopt against 
     <lb/>
     its will, or against its reason and judgment, 
     <lb/>
     a measure with which, perhaps, a very large 
     <lb/>
     number of the honorable members of this 
     <lb/>
     House have no real sympathy. It is no 
     <lb/>
     answer to me to say that I may express my 
     <lb/>
     views freely—that I may fully discuss this 
     <lb/>
     question. It is no answer to say that I have 
     <lb/>
     the privilege of pointing out the defects of 
     <lb/>
     this measure, if I am denied the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     obtaining the sense of this House, and of put<lb break="no"/>ting on record what I may consider its 
     <lb/>
     objectionable features—if I am denied the 
     <lb/>
     right of submitting to the House substantive 
     <lb/>
     motions and resolutions, which might perhaps 
     <lb/>
     meet the sense of the majority of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and which at all events would afford to the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     knowing the views of the honorable members 
     <lb/>
     of this House upon possible amendments 
     <lb/>
     which might be proposed to this measure. At 
     <lb/>
     an early period of this session, I gave notice 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="793" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0793.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">793</fw>
           
     of substantive resolutions which, however lit<lb break="no"/>tle they might have met the sense of the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of this House, express the views of a 
     <lb/>
     large majority of my constituents. It 
     <lb/>
     would interest them to see how far those 
     <lb/>
     views met the approbation of the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people here ; it would interest 
     <lb/>
     them to know how far honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     from Upper Canada are prepared to go to in<lb break="no"/>sure to the English speaking minority of 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada those rights and liberties 
     <lb/>
     which they claim for themselves ; it would 
     <lb/>
     afford us some criterion by which we might 
     <lb/>
     measure the degree of protection we should 
     <lb/>
     find in the Federal Parliament, from possible 
     <lb/>
     oppression in our Local Parliament. For if 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen from Upper Canada, on 
     <lb/>
     the floor of this House, will not hear us to<lb break="no"/>day, if they manifest an indifference to the 
     <lb/>
     injustice about to be inflicted upon the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish speaking inhabitants of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     by the proposed Constitution, what guarantee 
     <lb/>
     have we that similar selfishness may not mark 
     <lb/>
     their conduct after we shall be powerless to 
     <lb/>
     rebuke it? I will read those resolutions which 
     <lb/>
     I had designed to propose, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     obtaining the opinion of the House on a 
     <lb/>
     modification of this measure, which, if it 
     <lb/>
     must be adopted, might possibly have been 
     <lb/>
     so amended as to remove many serious objec<lb break="no"/>tions now entertained to it by a large portion 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Lower Canada. They are

     This resolution I put forth simply for the

            <p>
     Why is it that objection is made to a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive union ? The reason why so large a por<lb break="no"/>tion of the people of Lower Canada of French 
     <lb/>
     origin will not consent to a legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     is the very reason that makes it desirable to 
     <lb/>
     the English speaking population of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. We are in favor of a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union. We desire that Canada should be a 
     <lb/>
     united people, ignoring sectionalism, and bas<lb break="no"/>ing our institutions upon one broad principle 
     <lb/>
     of Canadian nationality, which shall blend all 
     <lb/>
     races, and in time obliterate all accidental 
     <lb/>
     distinctions of language, religion, or origin. 
     <lb/>
     Our French-Canadian fellow-subjects will not 
     <lb/>
     consent to this. If they will not hear our 
     <lb/>
     arguments, let them listen to their own. If 
     <lb/>
     Federalism is necessary for the protection of 
     <lb/>
     their rights, it is necessary in a tenfold degree 
     <lb/>
     for the protection of the rights of the English 
     <lb/>
     speaking minority. They tell us we may rely 
     <lb/>
     upon their well-known liberality and toleration. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot consent to hold our liberties by 
     <lb/>
     mere sufferance, when we are entitled to hold 
     <lb/>
     them by right. It would be unworthy of us 
     <lb/>
     to submit to such humiliation. In these 
     <lb/>
     remarks which are forced from me, and which 
     <lb/>
     I am compelled to make in defence of the 
     <lb/>
     rights and liberties of those who sent me here, 
     <lb/>
     I mean no disrespect to those of another origin 
     <lb/>
     —to the French-Canadian honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men whom I see around me. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     In many respects I sympathise with them, 
     <lb/>
     and have always sympathised with them. I 
     <lb/>
     desire to live among my French-Canadian 
     <lb/>
     fellow-subjects in peace. I desire to maintain 
     <lb/>
     those amicable relations which have always 
     <lb/>
     subsisted between the English-speaking and 
     <lb/>
     the French-Canadian populations of Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. As I said before, I sympathise with 
     <lb/>
     my French-Canadian fellow-subjects in many 
     <lb/>
     respects. I respect their character, I admire 
     <lb/>
     their laws. But this antagonism is not courted 
     <lb/>
     by me. It is forced upon me. Let me call 
     <lb/>
     the attention of honorable gentlemen, more 
     <lb/>
     especially of those from Upper Canada, to 
     <lb/>
     the position in which this proposed Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion now before the House would place the 
     <lb/>
     English-speaking people of Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>
     I may say at the outset, that although they 
     <lb/>
     number only one-fourth of the population, 
     <lb/>
     they pom at least one-third of the property, 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="794" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0794.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">794</fw>
            
     and pay one-half of the taxes. The French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Canadian differs very materially in many 
     <lb/>
     respects from the Englishman, or the Anglo- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Saxon. He is more simple in his habits, 
     <lb/>
     more frugal in his mode of life, and less dis<lb break="no"/>posed to novelty. He is content to ride in a 
     <lb/>
     carriage of the same fashion as that of his grand<lb break="no"/>father. He is wedded to his institutions, his 
     <lb/>
     old customs, and old laws. It is different 
     <lb/>
     with the English-speaking people. They are, 
     <lb/>
     as a people, more extravagant, more eager for 
     <lb/>
     novelty, and in many other respects widely 
     <lb/>
     different from the French-Canadians in their 
     <lb/>
     tastes and habits. Of course a comparison 
     <lb/>
     would be invidious, and I do not desire 
     <lb/>
     to institute one. But I am not at liberty 
     <lb/>
     to ignore the facts. Let us see how, under 
     <lb/>
     this proposed Constitution, the English-speak<lb break="no"/>ing people would be placed in reference to 
     <lb/>
     their peculiar interests and their peculiar 
     <lb/>
     ideas. In the first place, I would desire to 
     <lb/>
     direct your attention to the 14th resolution, 
     <lb/>
     by which it is provided how, especially after 
     <lb/>
     the local governments are established, the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council of the General Government 
     <lb/>
     is to be constituted—by its members being 
     <lb/>
     appointed by the Federal Government on the 
     <lb/>
     nomination of the respective local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. We must bear in mind that in this 
     <lb/>
     Local Legislature which will be imposed on 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, the English element will not 
     <lb/>
     certainly be more than one-fifth in number. 
     <lb/>
     Under these circumstances, and under the 
     <lb/>
     peculiar provisions with reference to the powers 
     <lb/>
     granted to the local governments, by which 
     <lb/>
     the legislative councillors are to be appointed 
     <lb/>
     by the General Government on the recommen<lb break="no"/>dation of the local governments, and in the 
     <lb/>
     case of Lower Canada, when its Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be four-fifths French-Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     only one-fifth of English origin, think you 
     <lb/>
     how many English members from Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada would ever find their way to the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council ? How would it be possible, 
     <lb/>
     when the Legislative Council is to be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed on the recommendation of the Local 
     <lb/>
     Government, and that Local Government 
     <lb/>
     four-fifths French-Canadian, for the English 
     <lb/>
     element to obtain fair representation in the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Council ? When, I say, would an 
     <lb/>
     English-speaking inhabitant of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada ever receive such a recommendation, un<lb break="no"/>less he approved himself more French than 
     <lb/>
     English ? (Hear, hear.) Again, by the 
     <lb/>
     23rd resolution, it is provided that "the Le<lb break="no"/>gislature of each province shall divide such 
     <lb/>
     province into the proper number of constituen<lb break="no"/>cies, and define the boundaries of each of 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     them." How easy would it be, under the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of that clause, for the Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature to snuff out one-half of the English con<lb break="no"/>stituencies in Lower Canada. They might 
     <lb/>
     arrange their bounds in such a manner that 
     <lb/>
     the English-speaking element would be con<lb break="no"/>fined within very narrow limits. There would 
     <lb/>
     be a few constituencies left entirely English, 
     <lb/>
     but the English population would thus be 
     <lb/>
     deprived of the influence which their numbers 
     <lb/>
     and wealth should give them in the Local 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. (Hear, hear.) Again, the 
     <lb/>
    Local Legislature will have power to alter or  
     <lb/>amend their Constitution from time to time. 
     <lb/>We to-day may frame a Constitution—the 
     <lb/>English-speaking majority in this House may 
     <lb/>frame a Constitution which would give proper 
     <lb/>protection to the English-speaking population  
     <lb/>of Lower Canada. But, by this scheme it 
     <lb/>will be in the power of the local legislatures 
     <lb/>to change that, and to modify it so as to suit 
     <lb/>it to the wishes or prejudices of the French 
     <lb/>majority. We would be powerless, after we 
     <lb/>leave these halls, any longer to conserve our 
     <lb/>rights, and the privileges which this Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment might give us may be taken away at the 
     <lb/>very first session of the Local Legislature. 
     <lb/>Then look at the powers which, under this 
     <lb/>Constitution, are conferred on the Local Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The first I find is the power of 
     <lb/>direct taxation. In the case of all govern<lb break="no"/>ments, thc power of taxation is the most im<lb break="no"/>portant power they can possess. It is that 
     <lb/>which concerns all portions and all classes of 
     <lb/>the community, and which gives rise to the 
     <lb/>greatest controversy, and the greatest amount 
     <lb/>of difficulty. It is the most important of all 
     <lb/>legislative powers, and this power is to be con<lb break="no"/>ferred on the Local Legislature of a province, 
     <lb/>where one nationality has four-fifths of the 
     <lb/>numbers, and the other nationality con<lb break="no"/>tributes one-half of the taxes. Then the 
     <lb/>Local Legislature is to have the control  
     <lb/>of immigration—a very important subject 
     <lb/>which deeply interests the English-speak<lb break="no"/>ing population of Lower Canada—but they 
     <lb/>would have no voice in framing the measures 
     <lb/>which might be adopted for directing and 
     <lb/>controlling that important matter. Then 
     <lb/>the Local Legislature is to have the control 
     <lb/>of education. And what subject can there 
     <lb/>be of greater importance ? And what sub<lb break="no"/>ject is there which might be a source of 
     <lb/>greater strife between the two nationalities, 
     <lb/>which by this provision would be brought 
     <lb/>into antagonism ? Even under our present 
     <lb/>system, with sixty-five Upper Canadian Eng<lb break="no"/>lish-speaking members, who would naturally 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="795" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0795.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">795</fw>
            
     be expected to sympathise with the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking peeple of Lower Canada, it is a 
     <lb/>
     crying grievance with the latter that they 
     <lb/>
     cannot get such legislation on the subject of 
     <lb/>
     education as they desire. What, then, 
     <lb/>
     would they have to expect if they went into 
     <lb/>
     a Legislature where four-fifths of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives were of a different nationality and 
     <lb/>
     a different religion, and whose prejudices 
     <lb/>
     and interests were in opposition to the claims 
     <lb/>
     of the one-fifth minority ? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Then the Local Legislature is to have con<lb break="no"/>trol of " the establishment, maintenance and 
     <lb/>
    management of hospitals, asylums, charities, 
     <lb/>and eleemosynary institutions." Now it is a 
     <lb/>positive fact, as I have stated before, that the 
     <lb/>English-speaking population of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, on account of their wealth and expensive 
     <lb/>mode of living, their extravagant habits, 
     <lb/>their desire for change and progress, their 
     <lb/>different ideas generally from the French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Canadians, consume more than one-half of 
     <lb/>the dutiable goods that are brought into this 
     <lb/>country, and pay one-half of the taxes ; and 
     <lb/>yet the money which they would pay into 
     <lb/>the public chest would be distributed by a 
     <lb/>majority over whom they had no control—a 
     <lb/>majority who would not in any manner sym<lb break="no"/>pathise with them ; and their taxes would be 
     <lb/>applied to objects which they might not deem 
     <lb/>desirable—which they might, perhaps, con<lb break="no"/>sider detrimental to their interests. And 
     <lb/>they would be completely without remedy, 
     <lb/>should this proposed Constitution unfortu<lb break="no"/>nately be imposed upon them. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>It is painful to me to be compelled to refer 
     <lb/>to these matters. It is not with pleasure 
     <lb/>that I bring before the House the antagonism 
     <lb/>which would inevitably arise between the 
     <lb/>two nationalities, should they be brought 
     <lb/>together into one Legislature, with such a 
     <lb/>vast disproportion between their means of 
     <lb/>taking their own part We are told, and 
     <lb/>told very truly—I rejoice that it is the fact 
     <lb/>-that hitherto the two races in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada have lived in peace. But it would be 
     <lb/>impossible that they could any longer live 
     <lb/>in peace; it would be impossible that with 
     <lb/>such a disparity of numbers, and with such 
     <lb/>antagonistic interests they should not come 
     <lb/>into conflict. It would be a constant war<lb break="no"/>fare, and this new Constitution, instead of 
     <lb/>settling the sectional difficulties in this 
     <lb/>country, instead of bringing peace to this 
     <lb/>country, instead of removing jealousies 
     <lb/>and heart-burnings, would have the very 
     <lb/>opposite effect. From the fact that the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     field of conflict would be smaller, that the 
     <lb/>
     arena would be more circumscribed, the 
     <lb/>
     strife would be all the fiercer. You are not 
     <lb/>
     bringing peace, but a sword. (Hear, hear.)

     <lb/>But, sir, the English-speaking people of 
     <lb/>Lower Canada are to be amused, and their 
     <lb/>attention is to be diverted from a full exam<lb break="no"/>ination of those serious matters which press 
     <lb/>themselves upon our consideration, by 
     <lb/>cleverly drawn abstractions and sophistries,

     <lb/>—a great empire—and the other plausible 
     <lb/>pretexts that are attempted to be imposed 
     <lb/>upon them. It would be easy to refute and 
     <lb/>show how baseless are all these schemes of 
     <lb/>greatness with which the people of this 
     <lb/>country are sought to be misled. We are 
     <lb/>gravely asked : " What man would remain 
     <lb/>poor, when he could at once become rich ? 
     <lb/>What man would remain weak, when he 
     <lb/>could at once become powerful ? Who 
     <lb/>would be diminutive, when by merely taking 
     <lb/>thought he could add cubits to his stature 
     <lb/>What people would continue to be a mere 
     <lb/>colony, when by the stroke of a pen they 
     <lb/>could at once become an empire, under a 
     <lb/>new nationality ?" Sir, these sophistries will 
     <lb/>not impose upon the people of this country. 
     <lb/>Where is the demonstration furnished us 
     <lb/>that by this scheme you would add one 
     <lb/>dollar to the wealth of this country, or 
     <lb/>one human being to its inhabitants, or one 
     <lb/>inch to its territory ? We do not find it 
     <lb/>afforded during the course of this debate. I 
     <lb/>have listened attentively to the arguments 
     <lb/>in favor of the scheme, but no attempt has 
     <lb/>been made to demonstrate these things. It 
     <lb/>has been repeatedly stated that we are about 
     <lb/>to consolidate the strength of this country, 
     <lb/>in order to resist invasion ; but I should like 
     <lb/>to know in what manner such an end is 
     <lb/>promoted by this measure. Are we not 
     <lb/>already united under one Government? Are 
     <lb/>we not already living under the control of 
     <lb/>the same executive power? Do we not fight 
     <lb/>under the same flag, and pay allegiance to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="796" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0796.jpg"/>

     the same Sovereign? Is not every man in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and Prince Edward Island just as much 
     <lb/>
     under the control of the head of our Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as the inhabitants of this province? 
     <lb/>
     It is all sophistry this idea that we are going 
     <lb/>
     to increase the strength of this country by 
     <lb/>
     the proposed union with the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces An attempt is made to alarm us 
     <lb/>
     by sensational rumors about invasion, and it 
     <lb/>
     is stated that we must put forth every 
     <lb/>
     possible strength to save ourselves from 
     <lb/>
     being swallowed up by the neighboring 
     <lb/>
     republic; and we are gravely told that 
     <lb/>
     through the action of a number of self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     constituted delegates assembled around a 
     <lb/>
     green table, and adopting certain resolutions, 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the physical laws relating to 
     <lb/>
     our country are to be changed. Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and Prince Edward Island are to be 
     <lb/>
     brought up into Lake Ontario, and the 
     <lb/>
     whole of our territory is to be compacted, 
     <lb/>
     consolidated and strengthened. Our ex<lb break="no"/>tended frontier is no longer to be exposed to 
     <lb/>
     attack, and, if attacked, will be much more 
     <lb/>
     easily defended. Is not this the most absurd 
     <lb/>
     sophistry? Can paper resolutions change 
     <lb/>
     the laws of nature, or modify the physical 
     <lb/>
     geography of the country. Will not New<lb break="no"/>foundland be as isolated from this province 
     <lb/>
     after Confederation shall have been adopted, 
     <lb/>
     as it is to-day? I think, sir, it is generally 
     <lb/>
     admitted that Canada is unequal to the 
     <lb/>
     defence of its own frontier against invasion 
     <lb/>
     from the only quarter from which it is 
     <lb/>
     apprehended. It is also admitted that the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces are alike unequal to the 
     <lb/>
     defence of their own frontier. By what 
     <lb/>
     process then will you demonstrate to me, 
     <lb/>
     that by adding the frontier of the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces to that of Canada, and by adding 
     <lb/>
     the force of those provinces to our own, 
     <lb/>
     there will not be the same defencelessness 
     <lb/>
     as at present? Will there not be the same 
     <lb/>
     disproportion between the defensive power 
     <lb/>
     and the object to be defended? (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, in the first place I perceive 
     <lb/>
     no immediate necessity for those constitu<lb break="no"/>tional changes. I think that our present 
     <lb/>
     Constitution is ample for the wants of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country, and that all the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties, either real or imaginary, under which 
     <lb/>
     we labor, might be solved within the limits 
     <lb/>
     of our present Constitution. I consider all 
     <lb/>
     our difficulties to be merely sectional, arising 
     <lb/>
     neither from differences of religion, of origin, 
     <lb/>
     of language, or of laws. On examination it 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     will be found that they are merely fiscal 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, and that they arise from the fact 
     <lb/>
     that our General Government does not con<lb break="no"/>fine itself to the true end and object of its 
     <lb/>
     existence. Do away with your local grants, 
     <lb/>
     and your absurd system of compensating for 
     <lb/>
     one improper expenditure by the creation of 
     <lb/>
     another. Let there be no expenditure for 
     <lb/>
     merely local purposes, or for purposes that 
     <lb/>
     do not preperly come within the functions of 
     <lb/>
     the General Government. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     By what rule of right, for instance, are 
     <lb/>
     the inhabitants of Upper Canada called 
     <lb/>
     upon to pay for the redemption of the 
     <lb/>
     seigniorial tenure of Lower Canada; and 
     <lb/>
     what right has Lower Canada to be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to meet the extravagant municipal 
     <lb/>
     indebtedness of Upper Canada? If our 
     <lb/>
     difficulties arise from differences of language 
     <lb/>
     and races, how comes it that the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking people of Lower Canada have so 
     <lb/>
     long harmonized and sympathized with the 
     <lb/>
     extreme Ultramontane party of Lower Canada? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I think you cannot find any 
     <lb/>
     reason for it, except on the supposition that 
     <lb/>
     they remain united for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     maintaining their sectional power and in<lb break="no"/>fluence, under a system by which the 
     <lb/>
     common exchequer is deemed a legitimate 
     <lb/>
     object of public plunder. Each section 
     <lb/>
     seems to have always regarded the public 
     <lb/>
     chest as fair game; and it is undeniable that 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada has generally had the best 
     <lb/>
     of it. These things caused dissatisfaction 
     <lb/>
     in the minds of people from other sections 
     <lb/>
     of the country, and they undertake to form 
     <lb/>
     combinations for the purpose of obtaining 
     <lb/>
     from the public chest similar undue advan<lb break="no"/>tages. The remedy for this state of things 
     <lb/>
     is to deprive the Legislature of the power 
     <lb/>
     to make grants for local objects. Let 
     <lb/>
    there be no revenue collected more 
     <lb/>than is absolutely necessary for the 
     <lb/>general expenses of the country, and 
     <lb/>let it be distributed for these general pur<lb break="no"/>poses with due economy, and we shall hear 
     <lb/>nothing more of sectional difficulties. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, in connection with 
     <lb/>this same idea, I find in my own mind 
     <lb/>another very important consideration con<lb break="no"/>nected with the administration of the 
     <lb/>government of our country. It has now, I 
     <lb/>believe, ceased to be a crime to "look to 
     <lb/>Washington." Not long ago, the term 
     <lb/>"looking to Washington" was one of re<lb break="no"/>proach. But that time has passed away, 
     <lb/>and our friends on the other side of the 
     <lb/>

     House have not only looked to Washington, 
     <lb/>
     but absolutely gone there, and imported the 
     <lb/>
     worst features of the republican system for in<lb break="no"/>corporation in our new Constitution. While 
     <lb/>
     they were doing this, I regret very much 
     <lb/>
     that they did not import from Washington, 
     <lb/>
     or from some other parts of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     their ideas of economy in the administration 
     <lb/>
     of the fiscal affairs of the country. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I regret they did not import from that 
     <lb/>
     country a very important principle prevail<lb break="no"/>ing there, to the effect that the Government 
     <lb/>
     of the day shall impose as few burdens upon 
     <lb/>
     the people as possible. To-day, sir, we are 
     <lb/>
     paying the man who stands at that door to 
     <lb/>
     admit you to this chamber a greater annual 
     <lb/>
     salary than is paid to the Governor of the 
     <lb/>
     State of Vermont. We are paying the man 
     <lb/>
     who stands in that corner with his paste 
     <lb/>
     brush to wrap up our papers, more than the 
     <lb/>
     indemnity allowed to a United States sena<lb break="no"/>tor. We pay the Governor General a greater 
     <lb/>
     allowance than is received by the President 
     <lb/>
      of the United States of America. We are 
     <lb/>
     the most heavily taxed people, and pay larger 
     <lb/>
     salaries for the work performed, in propor<lb break="no"/>tion to our resources, than any other people 
     <lb/>
     in the world.

     advantage go on in the same channel in

     which they have been doing; and that there 
     <lb/>
     is a necessity for some change. It is made

     a complaint that legislation is obstructed by

     <lb/>
     for the want of new laws. Sir, if there

     is one vulgar error in political economy 
     <lb/>
     more false and unsound than another,

     it is that the prosperity of any country

     We have, as a general thing, too much legis<lb break="no"/>lation. If I may use the term, we are legis<lb break="no"/>lated to death. And when I have seen bills 
     <lb/>
     pouring into this House by the hundred at

     every session, I have said to myself :—

     "What, in Heaven's name, will become of

     <lb/>
     other government that has dared to arrogate 
     <lb/>
     to itself the right of changing the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of their people without consulting them, 
     <lb/>
     except ours. I am surprised, sir, that even 
     <lb/>
     this strong Government of ours have dared 
     <lb/>
     to assume this power, when, sooner or later, 
     <lb/>
     they must go before the pe0ple of the country. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) There comes to my hand, 
     <lb/>
     this evening, a resolution proposed by the 
     <lb/>
     Honorable Attorney General of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land in the Legislature of that colony. It is 
     <lb/>
     instructive as shewing that there was one 
     <lb/>
     uniform sentiment, throughout all the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, in favor of submitting the question 
     <lb/>
     to the people. It was so submitted in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick—it met its fate. It is now about 
     <lb/>
     to be submitted to the peeple of Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia. The Administration ol this province 
     <lb/>
     have been wiser in their generation than 
     <lb/>
     those of the Lower Provinces. They did 
     <lb/>
     not dare to submit it for the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     the people—a course which, if not exhibiting 
     <lb/>
     wisdom on their part, shows, at the least, 
     <lb/>
     that skill and craft in public matters for 
     <lb/>

     which most of them have become famous. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The resolution I have refer<lb break="no"/>red to, and which embodies the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, is as follows :—

     <lb/>
     this committee are of opinion, that having regard

     to the comparative novelty and very great im<lb break="no"/>portance of this project, it is desirable that before

     a vote of the Legislature is taken upon it, it 
     <lb/>
     should be submitted to the consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     people at large, particularly as the action of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces does not appear to require that 
     <lb/>
     it should be hastily disposed of, and as (the 
     <lb/>
     present being the last session of this Assembly) 
     <lb/>
     no unreasonable delay can be occasioned by this 
     <lb/>
     course ; and they, therefore, recommend that a 
     <lb/>
     final determination upon this important subject 
     <lb/>
     be deferred to the next meeting of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture.

            <p>
     AN HON. MEMBER—That is the report 
     <lb/>
     of a committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OHAL1">MR. O'HALLORAN</persName>—Yes, it is the 
     <lb/>
     report of a committee ; but it was submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the Legislature by the Hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General as the policy of the Government. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, if the resolution is not carried in 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature, then the scheme is doubly 
     <lb/>
     defeated. In this little, petty province, 
     <lb/>
     whose interests, as compared with ours, are 
     <lb/>
     of trifling importance in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, the Government considers that the 
     <lb/>
     question is one of sufficient moment to 
     <lb/>
     demand that before the slightest action is 
     <lb/>
     taken upon it by the Legislature, the people 
     <lb/>
     should be consulted ; but in this large 
     <lb/>
     province, with its comparatively large popu<lb break="no"/>lation, and with important interests to be 
     <lb/>
     affected, the scheme is to be hurried through 
     <lb/>
     without allowing the people to have a voice 
     <lb/>
     in the matter, or even to have time for its 
     <lb/>
     consideration. (Hear, hear.) They are to 
     <lb/>
     have no voice in determining what kind of 
     <lb/>
     government they and their children are to 
     <lb/>
     live under for years to come. Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>
     I know very well that it is a bold declaration 
     <lb/>
     for me to make, that this Parliament has no 
     <lb/>
     right to deal with this question; but, sir, I 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     make it not hastily nor unadvisedly, because 
     <lb/>
     I defy honorable gentlemen to find a prece<lb break="no"/>dent for their proposed action in any free 
     <lb/>
     country under similar circumstances. We 
     <lb/>
     are not living to-day in a time of revo<lb break="no"/>lution or of great emergency ; but, even 
     <lb/>
     if our circumstances were different, I 
     <lb/>
     doubt very much if any of the precedents 
     <lb/>
     that have been referred to, as having occur<lb break="no"/>red many years ago and in troublous times, 
     <lb/>
     could again be practised or adapted, even in 
     <lb/>
     England, from which country we draw all 
     <lb/>
     our precedents. The precedents which have 
     <lb/>
     been invoked in approval of the course that 
     <lb/>
     has been adopted by the Government prove 
     <lb/>
     too much. If they form a justification for 
     <lb/>
     the course we are pursuing, then you might 
     <lb/>
     prove by the same means that this House 
     <lb/>
     had the power to perpetuate its existence 
     <lb/>
     beyond the limit fixed for the termination 
     <lb/>
     of the present Parliament, or vote ourselves 
     <lb/>
     members for life. We might just as well 
     <lb/>
     constitute ourselves life members of the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Legislature of the proposed Con<lb break="no"/>federacy, as to take the action that is contem<lb break="no"/>plated. I know that it is represented as 
     <lb/>
     very important that the measure should be 
     <lb/>
     carried-into immediate operation ; but that is 
     <lb/>
     a matter of mere expediency, and has nothing 
     <lb/>
     to do with constitutional principles. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) The Irish union has been trium<lb break="no"/>phantly referred to as a precedent for this 
     <lb/>
     measure. To my mind it is a most unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate one, and little deserving of our imi<lb break="no"/>tation. Let me show you how this matter 
     <lb/>
     has been regarded by one, whose authority 
     <lb/>
     will not be disputed. I read from MAY'S 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Constitutional History of England</hi>, page 505 
     <lb/>
     of the 2nd volume. Speaking of the union of 
     <lb/>
     Ireland with England, he says :—

     This, sir, is the judgment of the impartial

     English historian upon the means by which 
     <lb/>
     this great national crime was consummated, 
     <lb/>
     and it is the just enconium on the noble

     few whose patriotic efforts failed to prevent 
     <lb/>
     it. I read it, in anticipation, as the future 
     <lb/>
     history of the wrong now about to 
     <lb/>
     perpetrated on the people of this country; 
     <lb/>
     and while it implies, on the one hand, in no

     the small band who stand here to-night for 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the people, in opposition to this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, it pronounces, on the other, the

     just condemnation of those who trample on 
     <lb/>
     those rights, and who forget, in the pride of 
     <lb/>
     their brief authority, who it was that raised

     them to the positions they occupy, not that 
     <lb/>
     they might coerce, but carry out the will of

     the people, the only rightful source of all

     <persName ref="pers:ROSS7">MR. J. S. ROSS</persName>—I will not attempt to 
     <lb/>
     address the House at any great length at 
     <lb/>
     this late hour of the evening, as I think 
     <lb/>
     it very desirable that this debate should be 
     <lb/>
     brought to a close at as early a day as 
     <lb/>
     possible; and believing that that is the 
     <lb/>
     prevailing opinion in this House, I shall 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to be as brief as I can. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who has just taken his seat has 
     <lb/>
     referred to one matter on which I shall not 
     <lb/>
     at present say anything, on which I shall 
     <lb/>
     not commit myself. I suppose that it will 
     <lb/>
     be very well understood what I refer to, 
     <lb/>
     without my alluding to it more particularly. 
     <lb/>
    But there was another statement which he 
     <lb/>made—that there was no necessity for any 
     <lb/>change—on which I shall dwell shortly, and 
     <lb/>endeavor to show that there was a necessity 
     <lb/>for a change. It must be in the recollection 
     <lb/>of every hon. member in this House, that 
     <lb/>one year ago affairs were in such a state- 
     <lb break="yes"/>such difficulties presented themselves, that 
     <lb/>legislation was becoming almost impracticable. 
     <lb/>No better proof of this could be desired 
     <lb/>than that the Government of the day found 
     <lb/>themselves so surrounded With difficulties in 
     <lb/>the House, that they declared themselves 
     <lb/>unable to carry on the administration of the 
     <lb/>affairs of the country in a satisfactory man<lb break="no"/>ner. Now, why should a Government 
     <lb/>possessing so much talent and ability as 
     <lb/>that Government did, make that declaration, 
     <lb/>if there was no necessity for it? (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.)

     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—If you had

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS6">MR. ROSS</persName>—Although I always enter<lb break="no"/>tained a very high opinion of the honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who was Premier of that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I differed from him politically. Then, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, there is another matter to 
     <lb/>
     which I shall refer, to show that this House 
     <lb/>
     did acknowledge that there were difficulties 
     <lb/>
     in the way. A motion was made by the 
     <lb/>
     honorable member for South Oxford for the 
     <lb/>
     appointment of a committee on constitutional 
     <lb/>
     changes. That committee reported to this 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     House, and I will just read the last para<lb break="no"/>graph of that report in support of what I 
     <lb/>
     have said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     A strong feeling was found to exist among the 
     <lb/>
     members of the committee in favor of changes in 
     <lb/>
     the direction of a Federative system, applied 
     <lb/>
     either to Canada alone, or to the whole British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces, and such progress 
     <lb/>
     has been made as to warrant the committee in 
     <lb/>
     recommending that the subject be again referred 
     <lb/>
     to a committee at the next session of Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, this was signed by twelve gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     and among them I find the honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Chateauguay, who then declared that 
     <lb/>
     there was a necessity for some change. I 
     <lb/>
     think, Mr. SPEAKER, that this clearly shows 
     <lb/>
     that the matter was not brought upon us in 
     <lb/>
     a hurry, that the scheme now before us is a 
     <lb/>
     subject which has been looked forward to for 
     <lb/>
     some time. When we refer to that period, 
     <lb/>
     we find that the Government of the day 
     <lb/>
     placed their resignations in His Excellency's 
     <lb/>
     hands, a new Government was formed 
     <lb/>
     which met the House on the 3rd of May, 
     <lb/>
     and on the 14th of June they were 
     <lb/>
     defeated. At that time, I believe, they 
     <lb/>
     had obtained from His Excellency per<lb break="no"/>mission to dissolve the House. An effort 
     <lb/>
     was made, however, to effect a change in the 
     <lb/>
     Administration, in order that it might com<lb break="no"/>mand a majority of this House, and be 
     <lb/>
     enabled to carry on the business of the 
     <lb/>
     country. After some time, a reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     was effected, and in the programme which 
     <lb/>
     the present Government adopted, they did 
     <lb/>
     announce that they would take up this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and that when they met the House the 
     <lb/>
     next session, they would be prepared to lay 
     <lb/>
     before the House a measure for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of removing existing difficulties, by intro<lb break="no"/>ducing the Federal principle into Canada, 
     <lb/>
     coupled with such provision as will permit 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces and the North-West 
     <lb/>
     territory to be incorporated with the same 
     <lb/>
     system of government. If there were 
     <lb/>
     objections to a change, why were they not 
     <lb/>
     made at that time? Did not the House 
     <lb/>
     commit itself, then, by receiving it without 
     <lb/>
     any objection ? Hence I think that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment pursued a manly, straightforward 
     <lb/>
     course in coming down and announcing what 
     <lb/>
     their scheme was ; and whether that scheme 
     <lb/>
     is a good or a bad one, they have redeemed 
     <lb/>
     their pledges; they have met this House 
     <lb/>
     with a scheme for the Confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     British North American Provinces. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Whether this scheme is all that we could 
     <lb/>
     desire or not, is perhaps a matter on which 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="800" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0800.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">800</fw>
            
     we shall not be unanimous. I for one, ever 
     <lb/>
     since I have thought anything about poli<lb break="no"/>tics, have always looked forward to the time 
     <lb/>
     when such a scheme as this might be carried 
     <lb/>
     out. I have been an advocate of a legislative 
     <lb/>
     union. I think that is the correct principle, 
     <lb/>
     but I am not ashamed to say that I am open to 
     <lb/>
     conviction, and in dealing with a great 
     <lb/>
     question like this we must not expect to 
     <lb/>
     have everything to meet our own views; we 
     <lb/>
     must be prepared to make concessions, and 
     <lb/>
     take the best we can get. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We know the hesitation with which the 
     <lb/>
     Constitution of the United States was 
     <lb/>
     accepted; that WASHINGTON—the father of 
     <lb/>
     that great country—expressed himself, as 
     <lb/>
     well as many other eminent persons, against 
     <lb/>
     it, but accepted it as the best that could be 
     <lb/>
     had. We find the same expressions falling 
     <lb/>
     from the gentlemen of the Conference which 
     <lb/>
     prepared this measure. They believe that it 
     <lb/>
     was the very best that could be had under 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances. (Hear.) Now, if we 
     <lb/>
     look for one moment at the work of the Con<lb break="no"/>ference which met here in Quebec, whether 
     <lb/>
     the scheme is what we all could desire for the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the country or not, we must admit 
     <lb/>
     that the gentlemen who composed that Con<lb break="no"/>ference were men of ability, men of mind, 
     <lb/>
     men who have for years been the guiding 
     <lb/>
    spirits of public affairs. (Hear, hear.) And 
     <lb/>the honorable gentlemen from the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces stand in their respective provinces 
     <lb/>equally high with those who represented Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, and I am ready to believe that the del<lb break="no"/>egates who composed this Conference ap<lb break="no"/>proached the question in a spirit of the tru<lb break="no"/>est patriotism, with the honest endeavor to 
     <lb/>settle the difficulties of the country, and 
     <lb/>in the hope that the scheme would be accept<lb break="no"/>able to the people, and be the means of bring<lb break="no"/>ing us together, and consolidating and build<lb break="no"/>ing up in this part of the glorious Empire, 
     <lb/>a government that would be lasting and 
     <lb/>stable. (Hear, hear, and cheers.) And, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, I think there has been nothing 
     <lb/>that has proved more acceptable, or that has 
     <lb/>been better received by the people of the 
     <lb/>country. (Hear, hear.) So far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I took the opportunity of bringing 
     <lb/>the subject before my constituents, and when 
     <lb/>I read the first clause of the resolutions— 
     <lb/>" The best interests and present and future 
     <lb/>prosperity of British North America will be 
     <lb/>promoted by a Federal union under the 
     <lb/>Crown of Great Britain, provided such union 
     <lb/>can be effected on principles just to the sev<lb break="no"/>eral provinces," sir, it met with their hearty 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     cheers. (Hear, hear.) Although I have not 
     <lb/>
     the honor to represent one of the largest 
     <lb/>
     constituencies in Upper Canada, yet I re<lb break="no"/>present one that I am proud of—the people 
     <lb/>
    of the good old county of Dundas are sound 
     <lb/>at the core; they do glory in British con<lb break="no"/>nection, and nothing would induce them to 
     <lb/>support me or any other representative who 
     <lb/>would give an uncertain answer to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of whether we should retain that connec<lb break="no"/>tion or not. (Cheers.) Sir, I believe that 
     <lb/>the time is upon us, when we look at the sur<lb break="no"/>rounding difficulties, for us to make some 
     <lb/>change, and there is an uncertainty in the 
     <lb/>minds of Canadians at present that we ought 
     <lb/>to get rid of, and the sooner we approach the 
     <lb/>subject the better. The sooner we find out 
     <lb/>that we have a great future to establish, that 
     <lb/>we have a country here of which we may feel 
     <lb/>proud and rejoice in, I think, sir, the sooner 
     <lb/>that state of things is brought about the bet<lb break="no"/>ter. (Cheers.) Not only in a Canadian 
     <lb/>point of view is this desirable, but also for 
     <lb/>the sake of our position alongside of our 
     <lb/>neighbors, with whom, I am sure, we all de<lb break="no"/>sire to remain at peace, if they will only leave 
     <lb/>us in quiet amongst ourselves. That is all 
     <lb/>that we desire, but at the same time it is 
     <lb/>well that these people should understand that 
     <lb/>we have no desire whatever, not the most 
     <lb/>remote intention, of connectin our destinies 
     <lb/>with theirs. (Cheers.) Now, Mr. SPEAKER, 
     <lb/>it is said that this matter is new, and that it 
     <lb/>is forced upon us. I recollect reading, some 
     <lb/>years ago, most able letters written by Hon. 
     <lb/>Mr. HOWE, of Nova Seotia, addressed to 
     <lb/>Lord JOHN RUSSELL, to show how necessary 
     <lb/>this union was. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PARK2">DR. PARKER</persName>—I would like to ask the 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentleman if those letters were not 
     <lb/>
     in favor of a legislative union? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS6">MR. ROSS</persName>—I think they were; but I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that if he—the writer of them—had 
     <lb/>
     found himself at Quebec as one of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates, he would have done just as they did. 
     <lb/>
     Again, I find that at another time in our coun<lb break="no"/>try, in 1849, in the city of Kingston, one hun<lb break="no"/>dred and forty gentlemen, chosen by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple—the ablest and foremost men of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and presided over by a gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     has since left this state of action—a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman of high mind, and universally respected 
     <lb/>
     —I mean the late Hon. GEORGE MOFFATT— 
     <lb/>
     that organization, the British League, acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged that to lay a basis for the future of 
     <lb/>
     this country, a union of the British North 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces was essential. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     If I had time, sir, I could show that se 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">801</fw>
           
     periods in the House of Commons, the union 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces has been spoken of as what 
     <lb/>
     must eventually take place. And since the 
     <lb/>
     subject has been under discussion in this 
     <lb/>
     country, I have read with the greatest satis<lb break="no"/>faction, in the press of the United States, arti<lb break="no"/>cles showing the advantages of this union; 
     <lb/>
     and in particular one very able article in the 
     <lb/>
     Chicago <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, in which the writer pays the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country a high compliment for 
     <lb/>
     the foresight with which they are seeking to 
     <lb/>
    protect their interests in the future. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) There are other authorities to which I 
     <lb/>could refer to show the advantages of a union 
     <lb/>of these provinces. Whether Legislative or 
     <lb/>Federal unimportant—union is strength, and 
     <lb/>union is desirable if we expect future growth 
     <lb/>and greatness. I think the arguments are 
     <lb/>in favor of a legislative union. When we ap<lb break="no"/>proach the subject fairly, we must acknowledge 
     <lb/>that it is not reasonable to suppose that the 
     <lb/>people of the Lower Provinces should prefer 
     <lb/>a Federal to a Legislative union. I can quite 
     <lb/>understand why they appreciate the advantages 
     <lb/>of the local parliaments; to ask them to give 
     <lb/>up their whole machinery of government, and 
     <lb/>to place themselves in the hands and at the 
     <lb/>tender mercies of a people who would have 
     <lb/>the commanding influences in the legislation 
     <lb/>of the country, and with whom they are com<lb break="no"/>paratively little acquainted, would be asking 
     <lb/>rather too much. here is also some reason 
     <lb/>to fear why a legislative union would be too 
     <lb/>cumbersome. Many think that too much of 
     <lb/>the time of the Legislature of the country 
     <lb/>would be taken up with the local business of 
     <lb/>the different sections of the province. I 
     <lb/>believe, after this machinery has been 
     <lb/>well in Operation, and after we have be<lb break="no"/>come better acquainted with each other , that we 
     <lb/>shall find we can work together, and that 
     <lb/>this has been a movement in the right direction, 
     <lb/>by bringing together the people from all parts 
     <lb/>of the country. We she find that our 
     <lb/>interests are better understood, indeed that 
     <lb/>they are one ; it will be the more easy to do 
     <lb/>away with the local parliaments, and to merge 
     <lb/>them all into one. (Hear, hear.) Then, sir, 
     <lb/>there will be this advantage from the present 
     <lb/>scheme—we shall have the machinery for 
     <lb/>governing the whole country in existence; and 
     <lb/>it will be easy for those who desire it—if in 
     <lb/>the wisdom of the people who will be living 
     <lb/>under the institutions of the country at that 
     <lb/>time, it is thought desirable—the necessary 
     <lb/>machinery will be in existence for consolidation, 
     <lb/>and the change will not be of that radical nature 
     <lb/>that it would be at the present moment. Take 
     <lb/>another view of the case, which I believe will 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
           
     be borne out by the facts; if we are united— 
     <lb/>
     if we shew to the world at large that we have 
     <lb/>
     resolved upon a more enlarged sphere of exist<lb break="no"/>ence for the future— the population of this 
     <lb/>
     country will increase to such an extent, that 
     <lb/>
     there will be work enough for the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments as well as for the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I think, also, that the system will have 
     <lb/>
     the effect of inducing, on the part of the local 
     <lb/>
     administrations, a spirit of emulation in the 
     <lb/>
     way of conducting their respective govern<lb break="no"/>ments as cheaply and as economically as pos<lb break="no"/>sible. I have no doubt, too, that when the 
     <lb/>
     local parliaments are once established, the 
     <lb/>
     peeple will see the advantage of material 
     <lb/>
     changes in the municipal institutions of the 
     <lb/>
     country; those institutions being to a greater 
     <lb/>
     degree subordinated to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments. At all events, these are all matters 
     <lb/>
     for future consideration, and possibly for 
     <lb/>
     future action. (Hear, hear.) I shall now, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, refer briefly to the question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation in a commercial point of view. 
     <lb/>
     It is stated that in this respect no benefit 
     <lb/>
     will accrue to the country—that there will be 
     <lb/>
     no increase of trade between the provinces.  
     <lb/>
     But I ask this House to look at the matter in 
     <lb/>
     this light—and I am sorry to say that we 
     <lb/>
     have good reason for so viewing it—there 
     <lb/>
     can be no doubt of the fact. The United 
     <lb/>
     States have given notice of the abrogation of 
     <lb/>
     the Reciprocity treaty, and there is too much 
     <lb/>
     cause for the apprehension that the bonding 
     <lb/>
     system will also be done away with. Well, if 
     <lb/>
     we are cut off from all these facilities and ad<lb break="no"/>vantages, what is our position ? We are cut 
     <lb/>
     off from the ocean for six months of the year, 
     <lb/>
     and in this respect our position of dependency 
     <lb/>
     on a foreign power is a most humiliating one. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) The construction of the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway has been insisted upon as 
     <lb/>
     a commercial necessity, and although it may 
     <lb/>
     be an expensive work, I think the time has 
     <lb/>
     come when it must be built. I may briefly 
     <lb/>
     state my own sition in regard to that un<lb break="no"/>dertaking.  When the appropriation was 
     <lb/>
     brought up for the Intercolonial Railway sur<lb break="no"/>vey, so strongly was I opposed to that scheme 
     <lb/>
     at the time that I voted against it. But, as 
     <lb/>
     I have already stated, I now see the necessity 
     <lb/>
     for it. I believe the time has come when this 
     <lb/>
     railway should be constructed. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     I hope it will be constructed in a proper and 
     <lb/>
     economical manner, and, when it is built, I 
     <lb/>
     believe that in a commercial point, our posi<lb break="no"/>tion will be greatly improved. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     It is impossible for any honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to shew that by means of that railway no 
     <lb/>
     increase of trade will spring up between the 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="802" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0802.jpg"/>

     different provinces. Western Canada is de<lb break="no"/>cidedly an agricultural country ; it has a large 
     <lb/>
     surplus of grain, and it must find an outlet 
     <lb/>
     for it. Shut out from the United States, and 
     <lb/>
    deprived of winter communication, where are 
     <lb/>we to go? To store and house it throughout 
     <lb/>the winter months would be a great cause of 
     <lb/>loss. It is said that the export of grain during 
     <lb/>the winter is not profitable. But do not the 
     <lb/>United States ship continuously large quan<lb break="no"/>tities of flour and products to England and to 
     <lb/>other parts of the world in the winter season ? 
     <lb/>And what should hinder us from pursuing 
     <lb/>the same course if we have the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>Railway ? (Hear.) Hon. gentlemen may 
     <lb/>attempt to argue that such is not the case, and 
     <lb/>endeavor to conceal the fact; but I firmly 
     <lb/>believe it to be the policy of the United States 
     <lb/>to introduce coercive measures, with the view 
     <lb/>of making us feel that our commercial interests 
     <lb/>are identified with them, and I believe they 
     <lb/>will continue that course of policy towards 
     <lb/>us, not perhaps to the extent of immediate 
     <lb/>invasion and attempted subjugation, but I 
     <lb/>fear that their policy will be one of a re<lb break="no"/>strictive kind, so as to make us feel as much 
     <lb/>as they can our awkward position of depend<lb break="no"/>ence. Such, I believe, is their policy. They 
     <lb/>do not intend immediate invasion, but in<lb break="no"/>stead of that, they will, so to speak, put on 
     <lb/>the screws, in order, if possible, to make us 
     <lb/>feel that our interest is witn them and not 
     <lb/>separate from them. (Hear, hear.) I can 
     <lb/>very well see and very well understand the 
     <lb/>meaning of this desire to annex Canada, al<lb break="no"/>though many have maintained that such is 
     <lb/>not their wish. Going back to the early his<lb break="no"/>tory of the United States, I find that even in 
     <lb/>the articles of Federation of the United 
     <lb/>States, it is provided by the 11th article 
     <lb/>that Canada, acceding, shall be entitled to 
     <lb/>participate in all the rights and privileges of 
     <lb/>the union, whilst they refused to allow any 
     <lb/>other country to come in unless with the con<lb break="no"/>sent of nine states. The war of 1812, too, 
     <lb/>evinced a strong disposition on the part of 
     <lb/>our neighbors to attach Canada. And I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the statesmen of the United States, 
     <lb/>in our own day, are animated by the same 
     <lb/>far-seeing policy in regard to this country, 
     <lb/>and that they are now applying a little gentle 
     <lb/>pressure to make us feel that our interest is 
     <lb/>no longer to remain isolated from them, but 
     <lb/>to connect our destiny with theirs. Not long 
     <lb/>since I listened to a certain lecture in this 
     <lb/>city, in which it appeared to me that induce<lb break="no"/>ments were purposely and designedly held 
     <lb/>out for us to connect our destinies with those 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     of the people of the neighboring States. It 
     <lb/>
     was said that the great cause of difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     the United States was now removed, and that 
     <lb/>
     there was no obstacle now in the way of their 
     <lb/>
     material and social progress. Well, sir, I ac<lb break="no"/>knowledge that they are a great people, and 
     <lb/>
     that their advancement has been great ; but I 
     <lb/>
     fail to perceive that, if true to ourselves, we 
     <lb/>
     have not the same advantages. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     At all events, if our advantages are not so 
     <lb/>
     great, they are sufficient for all our purposes 
     <lb/>
     and we ought to be satisfied. There is one 
     <lb/>
     other consideration to which I desire to al<lb break="no"/>lude. When we look at the people who in<lb break="no"/>habit these provinces, and consider from 
     <lb/>
     whence they come and what are their charac<lb break="no"/>teristics, that they are a progressive, enter<lb break="no"/>prising and go-a-head people, is it reasonable 
     <lb/>
     to suppose that we are always going to re<lb break="no"/>main in this state of uncertainty ? Is it 
     <lb/>
     reasonable to suppose that we are always to 
     <lb/>
     be divided into different provinces, with an 
     <lb/>
     imaginary line ? Have we no desire or wish 
     <lb/>
     to expand and grow ? And, I ask, is it pos<lb break="no"/>sible that we can hope to attain national 
     <lb/>
     greatness in a separate state of existence? I 
     <lb/>
     think that the interests of the several pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be consolidated. There is no 
     <lb/>
     disputing the resources of the country, so far 
     <lb/>
     as territory is concerned. Stretching from 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic to the Pacific, it is ample for the 
     <lb/>
     support and sustenance of a great people. I 
     <lb/>
     have even heard it said, by persons who are 
     <lb/>
     good authority on the subject, that they 
     <lb/>
     believe the child is now born who will sœ 
     <lb/>
     British North America inhabited by a popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 60,000,000. This may be going too 
     <lb/>
     far, but I think there can be no doubt a 
     <lb/>
     large increase to our numbers will take place 
     <lb/>
     when we shall have given effect to the scheme 
     <lb/>
     now in contemplation. (Hear, and cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     The honorable member for Hochelaga (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. DORION) stated in the course of his re<lb break="no"/>marks that it would be a dark day for Ca 
     <lb/>
     nada should these resolutions be adopted. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. SPEAKER, that may be that honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's opinion ; but I must say that I 
     <lb/>
     differ from him entirely. On the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     I believe it will be a dark day for the whole 
     <lb/>
     country if we cannot agree upon some plan 
     <lb/>
     for securing our speedy union. (Cheers.) 
     <lb/>
     The honorable gentleman also stated that the 
     <lb/>
     scheme was far too conservative in its char<lb break="no"/>acter. Well, I can understand why the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentleman should find fault with it on 
     <lb/>
     that account, but I confess that that does 
     <lb/>
     not trouble me in the slightest degree. 
     <lb/>

     the great Liberal party. I should be sorry 
     <lb/>
     to see such a calamity. I have always pro<lb break="no"/>fessed to be a liberal—a moderate man in 
     <lb/>
     politics. (Hear, hear.) While I would be 
     <lb/>
     sorry to see any great party destroyed by this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, I would particularly regret to wit<lb break="no"/>ness the destruction of the great Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party. (Hear, hear.) I believe, however, 
     <lb/>
     that that party will not be destroyed in any 
     <lb/>
     such manner. After this great scheme is 
     <lb/>
     perfected, we will have parties the same as 
     <lb/>
     before. There may be some changes as re<lb break="no"/>gards individuals, but I trust that at all 
     <lb/>
     events there will still be a great Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party. (Cheers and laughter.) Party is 
     <lb/>
     necessary for the good government of the 
     <lb/>
     country ; but I trust that party feeling will 
     <lb/>
     not be manifested for the sake of creating 
     <lb/>
     divisions and discords, but that all parties 
     <lb/>
     will unite to build up a power here which 
     <lb/>
     will be felt and respected throughout the 
     <lb/>
     world. (Hear, hear, and cheers.) The hon<lb break="no"/>orable member for Brome (Mr. DUNKIN) 
     <lb/>
     made some remarks which it struck me were 
     <lb/>
     very singular in their character, but which 
     <lb/>
     are a fair instance of the manner he adopts 
     <lb/>
     to illustrate and substantiate his views. He 
     <lb/>
     quoted from English statesmen and English 
     <lb/>
     publications all that could possibly be cited 
     <lb/>
     to throw doubt upon the scheme ; but the 
     <lb/>
     moment English opinion was invoked in its 
     <lb/>
     favor, he turned round and declared that 
     <lb/>
     English views on Canadian affairs were en<lb break="no"/>tirely unreliable. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     As, however, that honorable gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     not present, I shall not refer further to his 
     <lb/>
     statements. The honorable member for Corn<lb break="no"/>wall (Hon. J. S. MACDONALD), for whom I 
     <lb/>
     have always entertained the highest respect, 
     <lb/>
     said that the cry of annexation had been 
     <lb/>
     raised in order to push this scheme through. 
     <lb/>
     Well, sir, if I am not mistaken, the honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION) 
     <lb/>
     said that this was the very measure to bring 
     <lb/>
     about annexation. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD2">HON. J. S. MACDONALD</persName>—The Pre<lb break="no"/>mier stated that we were being driven towards

     it.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS6">MR. ROSS</persName>—I think I have detained the

     the House while I refer to one or two other

     points hereafter. (Cries of " Go on!") As I 
     <lb/>
     said before, I believe the gentlemen who  met

     resolutions—although there are some things 
     <lb/>
     about them which I would desire to see 
     <lb/>
     changed, I shall give them my support as a 
     <lb/>
     whole. Take the Constitution of the Upper 
     <lb/>
     House for instance—I would prefer rather to 
     <lb/>
     see the present system retained ; but as the 
     <lb/>
     delegates thought fit to change it, I would not 
     <lb/>
     feel justified in voting against the whole scheme 
     <lb/>
     on account of my objection to one or two 
     <lb/>
     items of detail. (Hear, hear.) We must 
     <lb/>
     expect to give up to a certain extent our 
     <lb/>
     opinions in order to the attainment of greater 
     <lb/>
     benefits than we at present enjoy. I, at any 
     <lb/>
     rate, feel it my duty to act in this manner, 
     <lb/>
     and I feel also that the honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     will deserve the best thanks of the country 
     <lb/>
     if the scheme which they have brought 
     <lb/>
     down shall be carried into effect. I do 
     <lb/>
     hope that whatever may take place— that 
     <lb/>
     whatever checks this scheme may meet with 
     <lb/>
     —it will eventually be successful, and that 
     <lb/>
     Addresses will be passed by the respective 
     <lb/>
     legislatures asking Her Majesty to pass a 
     <lb/>
     measure giving effect to this scheme. When 
     <lb/>
     this Constitution shall have been perfected 
     <lb/>
     and ratified—when there shall no longer be 
     <lb/>
     any doubts about its containing the principles 
     <lb/>
     upon which the government of the country is 
     <lb/>
     founded—every true-hearted and loyal Cana<lb break="no"/>dian will have cause to rejoice that his lot has 
     <lb/>
     been cast in such a highly-favored land. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOWM1">MR. BOWMAN</persName>—As the discussion on 
     <lb/>
     this great question appears to be rapidly 
     <lb/>
     drawing to a close, I desire to offer a few re<lb break="no"/>marks upon the scheme of Confederation be<lb break="no"/>fore voting for it. The question of constitu<lb break="no"/>tional reform is not a new one in Canada. It 
     <lb/>
     is a question which has occupied the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the statesmen, the press and the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country for a number of years ; 
     <lb/>
     and so urgent have been the demands for re<lb break="no"/>form on the part of the people of Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada, that it has been found impossible to form 
     <lb/>
     a Government under our present system, for 
     <lb/>
     several years past, which could command a 
     <lb/>
     majority in the House sufficiently large to 
     <lb/>
     carry on the business of the country with 
     <lb/>
     success. The people of Western Canada have, 
     <lb/>
     for a number of years, agitated strongly for 
     <lb/>
     increased representation in Parliament, the 
     <lb/>
     justice of which few will pretend to deny. 
     <lb/>
     Owing to the disparity in the population of 
     <lb/>
     the two sections of the province, and the 
     <lb/>
     manifest injustice which is done to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, I am satisfied that some change 
     <lb/>
     must be made soon, with a view of establish. 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="804" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0804.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">804</fw>
          
     ing a more satisfactory system of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. (Hear, hear.) The people are so 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly in earnest on this question, that I 
     <lb/>
     am persuaded they are prepared to give a fair 
     <lb/>
     trial to any scheme which offers a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     prospect of inaugurating a better and more 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory state of affairs. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     There are, in my opinion, two methods by 
     <lb/>
     which this may be done. The first is a le<lb break="no"/>gislative union between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, based upon representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation ; the second is by a Federal union either 
     <lb/>
     between the two Canadas or between all the 
     <lb/>
     British North American Provinces. Unless 
     <lb/>
     one or other of these two remedies is speedily 
     <lb/>
     applied, there is great danger that an entire 
     <lb/>
     separation of the two provinces may ultimate<lb break="no"/>ly take place, which, in my opinion, would 
     <lb/>
     prove fatal to our existence as a British 
     <lb/>
     colony. (Hear, hear.) Our proximity to 
     <lb/>
     the United States makes it necessary that 
     <lb/>
     the union should be maintained at almost any 
     <lb/>
     cost. In order to effect a change in our Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, it is highly desirable to obtain the 
     <lb/>
     consent of a majority of the representatives of 
     <lb/>
     both sections of the province ; for, although a 
     <lb/>
     scheme might be adopted by the majority of 
     <lb/>
     one section, aided by the minority of the 
     <lb/>
     other section, it would not give such general 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction as could be desired. The de<lb break="no"/>mands made by the people of Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     for representation by population under the 
     <lb/>
     existing union, have hitherto been resisted 
     <lb/>
     by the people of Lower Canada with a degree 
     <lb/>
     of determination that has convinced even the 
     <lb/>
     most sanguine advocates of that measure 
     <lb/>
     that it is impracticable, at least for some 
     <lb/>
     time to come. Admitting, then, that re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population under the exist<lb break="no"/>ing union cannot be obtained, I think it is our 
     <lb/>
     duty to endeavor to find some other solution 
     <lb/>
     of our sectional difficulties. In my opinion 
     <lb/>
     the formation of a system of government based 
     <lb/>
     upon the Federal principle, with a Central 
     <lb/>
     Parliament which shall have the control of 
     <lb/>
     matters common to all the provinces, and a 
     <lb/>
     Local Legislature for each province to man<lb break="no"/>age local affairs, is the only system which will 
     <lb/>
     prove satisfactory to the people of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Such is the scheme now under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion by this House. It is said by some 
     <lb/>
     of the opponents of the present scheme that 
     <lb/>
     there is no necessity for a change, that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Upper Canada have abandoned 
     <lb/>
     their agitation for constitutional reform, and 
     <lb/>
     that they are perfectly content to go on as they 
     <lb/>
     are. I can only say to those honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen that they are entirely mistaken. The 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     desire for a change is as strong now as ever, 
     <lb/>
     and the people of Western Canada will never 
     <lb/>
     be satisfied until their just demands are con<lb break="no"/>ceded in some shape or other. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     We are not the only people who ave found it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to alter their Constitution. There 
     <lb/>
     is hardly a nation in the civilized world which 
     <lb/>
     has not, from time to time, found it itself 
     <lb/>
     compelled to change its form of government 
     <lb/>
     in order to keep pace with the ordinary pro<lb break="no"/>gress of events ; and we generally find that 
     <lb/>
     those great political changes which result in 
     <lb/>
     the consolidation or disruption of empires, 
     <lb/>
     are brought about by violent civil commo<lb break="no"/>tions, involving the sacrifice of thousands of 
     <lb/>
     valuable lives and the expenditure of millions 
     <lb/>
     of money. Of this fact we have a melancholy 
     <lb/>
     example in the present condition of the United 
     <lb/>
     States. The Constitution of that country 
     <lb/>
     was laid down by some of the wisest and 
     <lb/>
     ablest statesmen, yet in less than a cen<lb break="no"/>tury after its formation, the people who 
     <lb/>
     have hitherto looked. upon it as being 
     <lb/>
     the most perfect Constitution in the world, 
     <lb/>
     find themselves in the midst of a most dis<lb break="no"/>astrous war, trying to remove a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional difficulty which has given them a vast 
     <lb/>
     deal of trouble. Now, if we shall succeed in 
     <lb/>
     laying down a permanent basis for the con<lb break="no"/>solidation of these provinces—if we shall 
     <lb/>
     succeed in forming a union which will result 
     <lb/>
     in the perpetuation of British institutions on 
     <lb/>
     this continent, and thus check the absorbing 
     <lb/>
     influence of the neighboring republic—we 
     <lb/>
     shall confer a great boon upon posterity, and 
     <lb/>
     prevent much bitter strife among ourselves. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) While deliberating upon this 
     <lb/>
     scheme, we should divest our minds as much 
     <lb/>
     as possible of old political associations, in 
     <lb/>
     order that we may give it that calm and de<lb break="no"/>liberate consideration which its great impor<lb break="no"/>tance demands. When we consider the sec<lb break="no"/>tional difficulties to be adjusted, the conflict<lb break="no"/>ing interests which are to be reconciled, and 
     <lb/>
     the prejudices which are to be overcome, it is 
     <lb/>
     evident that we must consider this scheme in 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of compromise. Mutual conces<lb break="no"/>sions must be made, so as to respect the rights 
     <lb/>
     and feelings of all, so far as it can be done 
     <lb/>
     without doing an injustice to any. In refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the scheme now before the House, 
     <lb/>
     allow me to say that although there are some 
     <lb/>
     of its details to which I am opposed, yet, 
     <lb/>
     taking it as a whole, I believe it is the best 
     <lb/>
     that can be obtained under our peculiar cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, and therefore I feel it to be my 
     <lb/>
     duty to support it. That part of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     which provides for a nominated Legislative 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="805" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0805.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">805</fw>
           
     Council I believe to be contrary to the wishes 
     <lb/>
     of a majority of the people of Western Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, and particularly of my own constitu<lb break="no"/>ents. I think it will be admitted that the 
     <lb/>
     elective system has given us a class of repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives in that body which would do 
     <lb/>
     honor to any country in the world, and I 
     <lb/>
     should prefer to see that system continued. 
     <lb/>
     But while I would be prepared to vote for an 
     <lb/>
     amendment which would have for its object 
     <lb/>
     the perpetuation of the present system, pro<lb break="no"/>vided it could be done without interfering 
     <lb/>
     with the success of Confederation, yet I do 
     <lb/>
     not believe that my constituents are prepared 
     <lb/>
     to reject the whole scheme, simply because 
     <lb/>
     there are a few features in it which are not 
     <lb/>
     exactly in accordance with their views. And 
     <lb/>
     I can assure you, MR. SPEAKER, that I have 
     <lb/>
     no desire to do so. The opponents of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme appeal to the French population, 
     <lb/>
     telling them that their nationality is in danger, 
     <lb/>
     that they will be entirely absorbed in the 
     <lb/>
     Central Legislature, and that their rights and 
     <lb/>
     liberties will be interfered with. Then the 
     <lb/>
     same parties tell the English of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada that their nationality and their schools 
     <lb/>
     will be entirely at the mercy of the French in 
     <lb/>
     the Local Legislature. And, with a view of 
     <lb/>
     obtaining the defeat of the scheme in the 
     <lb/>
     west, they appeal to the pockets of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada, asserting that they will 
     <lb/>
     have to bear the greater proportion of the 
     <lb/>
     taxation under the new system. Now, I 
     <lb/>
     think it has been clearly shown that the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces will contribute their full 
     <lb/>
     share towards the public revenue—that they 
     <lb/>
     will pay as much per head as Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and much more than Lower Canada, so that 
     <lb/>
     the financial argument against Confederation 
     <lb/>
     cannot be substantiated. Those honorable 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who are trying to defeat the scheme 
     <lb/>
     by appealing to the prejudices and sectional 
     <lb/>
     animosities of the people of Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     should bear in mind that they are pursuing a 
     <lb/>
     course which is calculated to mar the har<lb break="no"/>monious working of any system of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that if they should succeed in de<lb break="no"/>feating the scheme, it would go very far to 
     <lb/>
     convince the people of Upper Canada that 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada is determined not to consent 
     <lb/>
     to any measure of justice to Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is also asserted that this 
     <lb/>
     scheme will bring about a separation from the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country. Now, I believe that the 
     <lb/>
     advocates of union are as desirous to perpe<lb break="no"/>tuate our connection with Great Britain as 
     <lb/>
     its opponents, and that it is desirable to main<lb break="no"/>tain that connection as long as possible. But 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     assuming that we are laying the foundation 
     <lb/>
     of a British North American Empire, which is 
     <lb/>
     destined to become independent of the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, after our resources have become 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently developed, and our vast territory 
     <lb/>
     has been filled up with an industrious, intel<lb break="no"/>ligent and thrifty population, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     such an anticipation should induce us to vote 
     <lb/>
     against it. Another objection which is raised 
     <lb/>
     against this scheme is the supposition that 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces will oppose the open<lb break="no"/>ing up of the North-West territory, which is 
     <lb/>
     an unwarrantable assumption on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the opponents of Confederation ; for I think 
     <lb/>
     it will be found that even the people of those 
     <lb/>
     provinces will see that it is for their interest 
     <lb/>
     to have that portion of our dominions opened 
     <lb/>
     up for settlement. Such a course would extend 
     <lb/>
     their field for trade and commerce, in which 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces are extensively en<lb break="no"/>gaged, so that the advantages would be of a 
     <lb/>
     mutual character. A great deal has been 
     <lb/>
     said about submitting the scheme to the 
     <lb/>
     people before it is finally adopted, and I must 
     <lb/>
     say that I could never make up my mind to 
     <lb/>
     vote for it without first having an expression 
     <lb/>
     of popular opinion upon it in some way or 
     <lb/>
     other, unless I were perfectly satisfied that a 
     <lb/>
     large majority of my constituents are in favor 
     <lb/>
     of it. I took the precaution to hold a number 
     <lb/>
     of public meetings in the constituency which 
     <lb/>
     I represent, in order to obtain the views of 
     <lb/>
     the people upon it, and, in almost every in<lb break="no"/>stance, a large majority present at those meet<lb break="no"/>ings, not only expressed themselves in favor of 
     <lb/>
     the general features of the scheme, but also 
     <lb/>
     expressed a desire that it should be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     and adopted by this Parliament without first 
     <lb/>
     holding a general election. I shall take much 
     <lb/>
     pleasure in voting for the scheme now before 
     <lb/>
     the House, believing that by so doing I shall 
     <lb/>
     best discharge my duty to my constituents 
     <lb/>
     and to the country at large. (Cheers.)

     <persName ref="pers:WALS1">MR. WALSH</persName> said—1t was my intention, 
     <lb/>
     during the earlier stages of this debate, to 
     <lb/>
     have asked the House to bear with me while 
     <lb/>
     I made some lengthened remarks on the im<lb break="no"/>portant subject embraced in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     now in your hands. It was my intention 
     <lb/>
     to review the circumstances which made it 
     <lb/>
     necessary that the scheme now submitted 
     <lb/>
     should be placed before the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     British North America—to trace fully the 
     <lb/>
     course of the sectional agitation with re<lb break="no"/>ference to the difficulties between Upper and 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada—and to show how it had 
     <lb/>
     gradually grown in importance, until the 
     <lb/>
     time had arrived when we had to accept 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="806" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0806.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">806</fw>
            
     one of two alternatives—a dissolution of the 
     <lb/>
     existing union between Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, or some larger scheme, such as that 
     <lb/>
     now contemplated by the people of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces. I should also have stated at 
     <lb/>
     some length my reasons, if we had to decide 
     <lb/>
     between these alternatives for opposing the 
     <lb/>
     former. I believe—and I think hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen almost unanimously in this House 
     <lb/>
     agree with me—that the union existing be<lb break="no"/>tween these provinces at the present time 
     <lb/>
     has, in all its important bearings, more than 
     <lb/>
     realized the most sanguine anticipations of 
     <lb/>
     those who were concerned in bringing it about. 
     <lb/>
     We have seen, since the union, an increase 
     <lb/>
     in the population, revenue and resources of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces seldom witnessed in the 
     <lb/>
     history of any country. We have seen two 
     <lb/>
     peoples entirely dissimilar in race, language 
     <lb/>
     and institutions—having nothing in common 
     <lb/>
     but their joint allegiance to the same Crown 
     <lb/>
     —we have seen those two peoples rapidly be<lb break="no"/>coming one people—one in name, one in 
     <lb/>
     object, one in feeling. And I believe that 
     <lb/>
     in every respect the union under which we 
     <lb/>
     now live has been most happy in its results. 
     <lb/>
     If I had gone, therefore, into the subject, as 
     <lb/>
     I originally intended, I should have stated 
     <lb/>
     fully my views upon it in all its bearings. 
     <lb/>
     And I should have stated, as I now state, 
     <lb/>
     that if I had had to give my vote whether 
     <lb/>
     the connection between these two provinces 
     <lb/>
     should remain, or whether it should be dis<lb break="no"/>solved, and we should go back to the state 
     <lb/>
     of separate existence in which we were be<lb break="no"/>fore the union, I should have been found 
     <lb/>
     for one most hostile to a dissolution of that 
     <lb/>
     union. (Hear, hear.) But circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     over some of which this House has not con<lb break="no"/>trol, while others are within our control, 
     <lb/>
     have led to a probable termination of this 
     <lb/>
     debate at an earlier period than I had an<lb break="no"/>ticipated, and I will not trespass on the 
     <lb/>
     patience of the House, at this late hour, by 
     <lb/>
     detaining honorable members with any 
     <lb/>
     lengthened remarks. In the few obser<lb break="no"/>vations I shall offer, I will confine myself 
     <lb/>
     to a reference to some of the leading 
     <lb/>
    features of the scheme now before us I 
     <lb/>shall not, as many honorable gentlemen 
     <lb/>have done, go into lengthy quotations of 
     <lb/>other men's opinions, or comment on the 
     <lb/>effect of different systems of government in 
     <lb/>other countries. I will confine myself to 
     <lb/>what I consider, from the best means of in<lb break="no"/>formation I can obtain, the probable effect 
     <lb/>and bearing of this proposed scheme upon 
     <lb/>ourselves. (Hear, hear.) I agree with 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     many honorable gentlemen who have pre<lb break="no"/>ceded me, when I say that since I first gave 
     <lb/>
     attention to public matters, I have looked 
     <lb/>
     forward to the time when a more intimate 
     <lb/>
     connection between these British American 
     <lb/>
     Provinces would not only be desirable, but 
     <lb/>
     would become absolutely necessary. I look 
     <lb/>
     upon it as desirable in a military point of 
     <lb/>
     view, and in a commercial point of view. It 
     <lb/>
     must be evident to any honorable gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has occupied a seat in this House—even 
     <lb/>
     for the short period that I have had the 
     <lb/>
     honor of a seat here—that the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the House of late years has very materially 
     <lb/>
     changed with reference to the defences of 
     <lb/>
     the country. I am satisfied that we have, 
     <lb/>
     irrespective of party, become more alive to 
     <lb/>
     our duty in that respect; and that the people 
     <lb/>of this country, acting through those who 
     <lb/>sit here as their representatives, are prepared 
     <lb/>to take upon themselves their just share of 
     <lb/>responsibility for the defence of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. (Hear, hear.) And I look upon 
     <lb/>this scheme of union as a most important 
     <lb/>step in that view ; because while we rely, as 
     <lb/>we do rely to a great extent, on the assist<lb break="no"/>ance of the home Government for the de<lb break="no"/>fence of this country, it must be evident to all 
     <lb/>of us that these provinces, acting in concert 
     <lb/>with each other, and all acting in concert 
     <lb/>with the home Government, can organize a 
     <lb/>more effective system of defence than we 
     <lb/>could do if we remained separate and isolated. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) I believe this question should 
     <lb/>be considered chiefly from a commercial point 
     <lb/>of view. We must necessarily consider the 
     <lb/>question in connection with the more inti<lb break="no"/>mate commercial intercourse which it is con<lb break="no"/>templated will result from the construction 
     <lb/>of the Intercolonial Railway. A new market 
     <lb/>for our commodities will be opened up by 
     <lb/>the removal of the barriers to trade which 
     <lb/>now exist between us. Believing, as I do, 
     <lb/>that our commercial relations with our sister 
     <lb/>provinces should be free and unrestricted, I 
     <lb/>am heartily in favor of the construction of 
     <lb/>this railway. After stating that upon these 
     <lb/>general principles I am in favor of the union 
     <lb/>of these provinces, I may also state that had 
     <lb/>I my choice, and were my vote to decide the 
     <lb/>question, I would say " give us a Legislative 
     <lb/>union," because I believe it would have, for 
     <lb/>its effect, the bringing of all the colonists 
     <lb/>more immediately into contact and connec<lb break="no"/>tion with each other, rendering our interests 
     <lb/>much more identical than by the Federal 
     <lb/>plan But I infer, from the speeches made 
     <lb/>on the floor of this House at the opening of 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="807" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0807.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">807</fw>

     this debate, by honorable gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     were delegates to the Conference held in 
     <lb/>
     this city, that the two schemes were dis<lb break="no"/>cussed in that Conference—the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     and the Federal—and that the former was 
     <lb/>
     found to be impracticable. It is, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     not possible for us now to decide the question 
     <lb/>
     in favor of a legislative union. We have 
     <lb/>
     evidence before us that is satisfactory to my 
     <lb/>
     mind, that probably all of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces would refuse to take part in a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive union. The Honorable Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     West, in his speech at the opening of the 
     <lb/>
     debate, gave us sufficient information on the 
     <lb/>
     point to convince the House that this ques<lb break="no"/>tion had been fully discussed in the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, and the legislative plan rejected, on 
     <lb/>
     account of its being impracticable. For this 
     <lb/>
     reason, sir, believing that the choice before 
     <lb/>
     us is either to accept a Federal union or reject 
     <lb/>
     the proposal entirely, I give my assent to 
     <lb/>
     the present scheme without hesitation. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) It is brought as one of the 
     <lb/>
     strongest arguments against this union 
     <lb/>
     that the Federal Government will be far 
     <lb/>
     more expensive than our present sys<lb break="no"/>tem. That may be true to some extent; 
     <lb/>
     but my impression is that it will not be 
     <lb/>
     found true to the extent represented. We 
     <lb/>
     must bear in mind that we have in each 
     <lb/>
     province a Government fully constituted, 
     <lb/>
     with all the machinery necessary for carry<lb break="no"/>ing on the business of government. Therefore 
     <lb/>
     the new machinery required would be very 
     <lb/>
     little, and would amount simply to the local 
     <lb/>
    legislatures for Upper and Lower Canada. 
     <lb/>Upon these general principles then, I must 
     <lb/>say that I shall give my adhesion to the 
     <lb/>scheme of union submitted to us ; and as was 
     <lb/>well remarked by the hon. member for Dun<lb break="no"/>das (Mr. J. S. ROSS), the language in 
     <lb/>which the scheme has been laid before us 
     <lb/>must prove very acceptable to all who are in 
     <lb/>favor of a union such as that proposed. The 
     <lb/>gentlemen composing the Conference could 
     <lb/>not have used language more acceptable to 
     <lb/>me than that in which the first resolution is 
     <lb/>couched, except in the use of the word 
     <lb/>"Federal," instead of "Legislative." The 
     <lb/>resolution reads :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The best interests and present and future pros<lb break="no"/>perity of British North America will be promoted 
     <lb/>by a Federal union under the Crown of Great 
     <lb/>Britain, provided such a union can be effected on 
     <lb/>principles just to the several provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, sir, I am prepared to say here, and I 
     <lb/>
     think I but echo the voice of every hon. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     gentleman present, that all the people ask is 
     <lb/>
     that the union be based upon principles just 
     <lb/>
     to the several provinces. (Hear, hear.) We 
     <lb/>
     ask nothing more. Again, sir, the language 
     <lb/>
     employed in the third resolution is most 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     In framing a Constitution for the General 
     <lb/>
     Government, the Conference, with a view to the 
     <lb/>
     perpetuation of the connection with the Mother 
     <lb/>
     Country, &amp;c., to the promotion of the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the people of these provinces, desire to 
     <lb/>
     follow the model of the British Constitution, so 
     <lb/>
     far as our circumstances will permit. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Surely, sir, we all agree that no better model 
     <lb/>
     can be found, or better system of government 
     <lb/>
     followed, than that of the British Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. (Hear, hear.) One of the features 
     <lb/>
     of this scheme that commends itself strongly 
     <lb/>
     to my approbation is the marked distinction 
     <lb/>
     between the system that is submitted to us, 
     <lb/>
     and that which is in existence in the neigh<lb break="no"/>boring republic. I believe that to a great 
     <lb/>
     extent we may trace the unfortunate difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that exist in that country to the absurd 
     <lb/>
     doctrine of state rights. Instead of their 
     <lb/>
     Central Government having, in the first in<lb break="no"/>stance, supreme power, and delegating cer<lb break="no"/>tain powers to the local or state governments, 
     <lb/>
     the very reverse is the principle on which 
     <lb/>
     their Constitution is founded. Their local 
     <lb/>
     governments possess the principal power, 
     <lb/>
     and have delegated certain powers to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government. In the scheme sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us, I am happy to observe that the 
     <lb/>principal and supreme power is placed in 
     <lb/>the hands of the General Government, and 
     <lb/>that the powers deputed to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ments are of a limited character. (Hear, 
     <lb/>hear.) I am glad also to observe that in the 
     <lb/>proposed organization of the General Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the united provinces, that question 
     <lb/>which has so long agitated the people of 
     <lb/>Canada—representation by population—is 
     <lb/>in a fair way of being satisfactorily solved. 
     <lb/>It is proposed that in the General Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, or House of Commons as it is to be 
     <lb/>called, each province shall be represented 
     <lb/>in accordance with its population, thereby 
     <lb/>removing that which has been so long a 
     <lb/>source of agitation in Upper Canada, and of 
     <lb/>vexation to Lower Canada, and which has 
     <lb/>led to the discussion of the scheme now be<lb break="no"/>fore the House. In reference to the organiz<lb break="no"/>ation of the Legislative Council, I may say 
     <lb/>that I have always been found among those 
     <lb/>who opposed the introduction of the elective 
     <lb/>principle into the constitution of that body 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="808" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0808.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">808</fw>
            
     in this province, and I, therefore, find no 
     <lb/>
     difficulty in giving my hearty assent to the 
     <lb/>
     change now proposed. I have always believed, 
     <lb/>
     and I still believe, that we could not expect 
     <lb/>
     two branches of the Legislature, owing their 
     <lb/>
     existence to the same source, and being 
     <lb/>
     elected by the same class of voters, to work 
     <lb/>
     in harmony for any length of time. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) It may be called a retrograde move<lb break="no"/>ment, yet I can heartily assent to it, because, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, it places things where they 
     <lb/>
     should have been left. In pressing upon 
     <lb/>
     this House the adoption or rejection of these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions as a whole, I believe the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment are actuated by the best motives, and 
     <lb/>
     that it is their duty to do so. But whilst I 
     <lb/>
    am prepared to give my vote in that direc<lb break="no"/>tion, I am also quite willing to admit the 
     <lb/>force of the objections urged by the Colonial 
     <lb/>Secretary in his despatch to the Governor 
     <lb/>General of the 3rd December last, in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to the constitution of the Upper House, 
     <lb/>so far as the limiting of the number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers is concerned. I for one, although there 
     <lb/>is no doubt that these resolutions will be 
     <lb/>passed by this House precisely in the form 
     <lb/>in which they have been submitted to us, 
     <lb/>am quite content that the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment should make such alterations in that, 
     <lb/>or any other respect, as they consider neces<lb break="no"/>sary, and I shall bow with very great satis<lb break="no"/>faction to such amendments. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>There are two or three questions in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with these resolutions upon which I 
     <lb/>desire to offer a few remarks. One of them 
     <lb/>is that of education. We have already had, 
     <lb/>in the course of this discussion, a good deal 
     <lb/>said on this subject. I would simply say, as 
     <lb/>one of those who gave effect by my vote to 
     <lb/>the present law of Upper Canada for the 
     <lb/>establishment of separate schools, that in 
     <lb/>doing so I believed that I was according to 
     <lb/>the minority of one section of the province 
     <lb/>what I conceived the minority of the other 
     <lb/>section were entitled to, thus doing justice to 
     <lb/>all. It gives me, therefore, great satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion to observe the recognition in these reso<lb break="no"/>lutions of the principle that the rights of the 
     <lb/>minorities, in each section, with respect to 
     <lb/>educational facilities, should be guaranteed. 
     <lb/>I confess that if I were living in Lower 
     <lb/>Canada, I should not feel that I was 
     <lb/>being justly treated in being called upon 
     <lb/>to contribute by taxation to the support 
     <lb/>of schools to which I could not con<lb break="no"/>scientiously send my children. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/> I have the satisfaction of knowing that, after 
     <lb/>giving my vote upon the last Separate School  
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     Bill, and going back to my constituents, they 
     <lb/>
     were fully satisfied with the explanation I 
     <lb/>
     gave them, and my action was endorsed by 
     <lb/>
     them. Another question that I look upon 
     <lb/>
     as of very great importance to these colonies, 
     <lb/>
     is not dealt with in these resolutions in that 
     <lb/>
     manner to which its importance entitles it. 
     <lb/>
     I refer to the management and sale of our 
     <lb/>
     Crown lands. I am very sorry to observe 
     <lb/>
     that they are to be confided to the control 
     <lb/>
     of the local legislatures. I believe that if, 
     <lb/>
     in any one question more than another, the 
     <lb/>
     Government of this province have failed in 
     <lb/>
     their duty in times past, it is in the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of our Crown lands. The complaint I 
     <lb/>
     have to make is that they have not made use 
     <lb/>
     of those lands in establishing a wise and 
     <lb/>
     liberal system of immigration, by offering 
     <lb/>
     them free to all who would come and settle 
     <lb/>
     upon them. It cannot but be humiliating to 
     <lb/>
     every person having a stake in this province 
     <lb/>
     to observe the torrents of immigration that 
     <lb/>
     pour from the Mother Country into the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring republic; and especially so 
     <lb/>
     when they see them passing through the 
     <lb/>
     whole length of Canada by multitudes to the 
     <lb/>
     Western States. (Hear, hear.) We have, 
     <lb/>
     in times past, failed to hold out such induce<lb break="no"/>ments as would stop that tide of immigra<lb break="no"/>tion from flowing past us. I fear that by 
     <lb/>
     leaving those lands in the hands of the local 
     <lb/>
     legislatures, the immigration question will 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with, in future, in the same narrow 
     <lb/>
     spirit in which it has been treated in times 
     <lb/>
     past. I would have been very highly pleased 
     <lb/>
     if I could look forward to the future with 
     <lb/>
     the hope that our General Legislature would 
     <lb/>
     adopt a large, enlightened, and liberal scheme 
     <lb/>
     of immigration, sending their agents to all 
     <lb/>
     the European ports from which the largest 
     <lb/>
     tide of immigration sets in, for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of explaining to the people the advantages 
     <lb/>
     they could derive from settling in these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I am, therefore, very sorry to see 
     <lb/>
     that the delegates were obliged to make the 
     <lb/>
     arrangement they have made with reference 
     <lb/>
     to this important question. (Hear, hear.) 
     <lb/>
     Now, sir, in reference to another of the 
     <lb/>
     questions embraced in these resolutions, 
     <lb/>
     though not forming a part of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Constitution, I am prepared to admit here 
     <lb/>
     that my opinions have undergone a very 
     <lb/>
     material change since I first came into this 
     <lb/>
     House. I refer to the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway. I came here, in 
     <lb/>
     1862, decidedly hostile to our assuming any 
     <lb/>
     portion of the expense of constructing that 
     <lb/>
     road. I believed, at that time, that it 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="809" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0809.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">809</fw>
            
     construction would be of no advantage to 
     <lb/>
     Canada; but the course of events has con<lb break="no"/>vinced me that the time has now arrived 
     <lb/>
     when we should take upon ourselves our fair 
     <lb/>
     share of the expense of constructing this 
     <lb/>
     important work. It cannot be satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to any Canadian, on going to New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick or Nova Scotia, to find that he is a 
     <lb/>
     stranger in a strange country, and among a 
     <lb/>
     people who, though living so close to Canada, 
     <lb/>
     have no commercial intercourse with us. 
     <lb/>
     Although they are neighbors of ours, in one 
     <lb/>
     respect, yet they are neighbors with whom 
     <lb/>
     we have no intercourse. It is very desirable 
     <lb/>
     that the barriers to our intercourse should 
     <lb/>
     be removed, and the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial Railway is, in my opinion, the 
     <lb/>
     only effectual means of removing them. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, it has been argued by a great many 
     <lb/>
     of those who have taken part in debating this 
     <lb/>
     subject that this House is assuming for itself 
     <lb/>
     a power that it does not, or ought not to 
     <lb/>
     possess, in disposing of the question without 
     <lb/>
     submitting it to the popular will. It is said 
     <lb/>
     that before these resolutions take effect an 
     <lb/>
     expression of public opinion should be had 
     <lb/>
     through a general election. Some of those 
     <lb/>
     honorable gentlemen who have taken this 
     <lb/>
     position have stated as a reason for advocat<lb break="no"/>ing that course that the public mind was not 
     <lb/>
     yet properly informed as to the effect of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed change, and that, therefore, time 
     <lb/>
     should be given until public opinion is pre<lb break="no"/>pared to decide upon it. But with a strange 
     <lb/>
     inconsistency those same gentlemen are flood<lb break="no"/>ing this House with petitions from the elec<lb break="no"/>tors, not asking for delay, not asking for fur<lb break="no"/>ther time to consider the matter, but asking 
     <lb/>
     that the scheme be not adopted. They in 
     <lb/>
     effect show by their petitions that they have 
     <lb/>
     considered the subject—that they know all 
     <lb/>
     about it—that their opinions are fully form<lb break="no"/>ed—and that the measure ought not to be 
     <lb/>
     adopted. Either the public mind is fully 
     <lb/>
     ripe for the adoption or rejection of the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, or else those electors are signing 
     <lb/>
     petitions without having sufficient inform<lb break="no"/>ation on which to base the opinions they ex<lb break="no"/>press. But, sir, there is such a thing as 
     <lb/>
     obtaining public opinion on almost any ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and very correctly too, without going 
     <lb/>
     to the polls;  and, for my part, I find 
     <lb/>
    elections very inconvenient. (Hear, hear, 
     <lb/>and laughter.) I believe the majority of the 
     <lb/>electors of Upper Canada have read those 
     <lb/>resolutions, and understand them about as 
     <lb/>well as many members of this House; and, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     sir, we have every reason to believe that the 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of Upper Canada at least is 
     <lb/>
     largely in favor of the adoption of this 
     <lb/>
     scheme. (Hear, hear.) I took occasion to 
     <lb/>
     consult my constituents before coming to 
     <lb/>
     this House on the present occasion. I held 
     <lb/>
     meetings in the various municipalities in the 
     <lb/>
     county, and I believe, sir, according to the 
     <lb/>
     best of my ability, I did submit this scheme 
     <lb/>
     to the electors of that portion of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince. I have heard a good deal said here 
     <lb/>
     about the importance of having the question 
     <lb/>
     submitted to a vote of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAME4">MR. M. C. CAMERON</persName>—I would like 
     <lb/>
     to ask the gentleman whether he laid any 
     <lb/>
     figures before his people to shew the differ<lb break="no"/>ence between the cost of a Legislative and a 
     <lb/>
     Federal union. Unless he did that, the 
     <lb/>
     people were not in a position to express an 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to what was best for their 
     <lb/>
     interests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WALS1">MR. WALSH</persName>—I did not submit figures 
     <lb/>
     to shew the difference in cost between a 
     <lb/>
     Federal or Legislative union, for the simple 
     <lb/>
     reason that until the organization of the 
     <lb/>
     local governments is decided upon, it is 
     <lb/>
     not possible to give reliable figures, and I 
     <lb/>
     therefore think the people as competent to 
     <lb/>
     make calculations on this subject as myself 
     <lb/>
     or my hon. friend, lawyer though he be. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) I may say, however, in 
     <lb/>
     answer to the hon. gentleman, that I did 
     <lb/>
     state to my constituents that the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     now under consideration place in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the present Legislature the preparation of 
     <lb/>
     the constitutions and the organization and 
     <lb/>
     composition of the local governments of 
     <lb/>
     Upper and Lower Canada; and that as the 
     <lb/>
     Federal Government is to pay an annual sub<lb break="no"/>sidy of eighty cents per head of its popula<lb break="no"/>tion to the respective provinces, for carrying 
     <lb/>
     on their local governments and the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of local works, any sum required over and 
     <lb/>
     above that subsidy must necessarily be raised 
     <lb/>
     by direct taxation, and in that fact we have 
     <lb/>
     the strongest possible guarantee that in the 
     <lb/>
     arrangements made by this Legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     in the subsequent management of their 
     <lb/>
     domestic affairs by the local governments, 
     <lb/>
     the strictest simplicity and economy will be 
     <lb/>
     observed. (Hear, hear.) So much, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     SPEAKER, in answer to the question of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. The difference between us 
     <lb/>
     on this question being that whilst we are 
     <lb/>
     both advocates of a legislative union, he will 
     <lb/>
     accept none other. I, believing that un<lb break="no"/>attainable at present, am prepared to accept 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="810" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0810.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">810</fw>
           
     the system now proposed, hoping that the 
     <lb/>
     experience of the people will soon induce 
     <lb/>
     them to agree to the abolition of the local 
     <lb/>
     governments, and the adoption of the legis<lb break="no"/>tive system. (Hear, hear.) I may add— 
     <lb/>and I do so with great personal satisfaction— 
     <lb/>that the meetings which were held in my 
     <lb/>own county were largely in favor of the 
     <lb/>scheme, and that resolutions approving of it 
     <lb/>were moved and seconded, in almost every 
     <lb/>instance, by persons of different political 
     <lb/>opinions. (Hear, hear.) I was going on to 
     <lb/>remark, that it is said by many members of 
     <lb/>this House that the scheme could not be 
     <lb/>submitted to the people, because the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in sending the resolutions to the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Legislature marked them " Pri<lb break="no"/>vate." Now, sir, I managed to get over that 
     <lb/>difficulty without trouble. A copy of the 
     <lb/>resolutions was sent to me, and as I was 
     <lb/>precluded from making use of them in that 
     <lb/>form without violating the confidence re<lb break="no"/>posed in me, I turned to the newspaper 
     <lb/>version of the same resolutions, and finding 
     <lb/>it to be a <hi rendition="simple:italic">verbatim</hi> copy of the original, 
     <lb/>when I attended my meetings I read from 
     <lb/>the newspaper and not from the private 
     <lb/>document itself. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
     <lb/>I think other hon. gentlemen might have 
     <lb/>taken the same course with safety to them<lb break="no"/>selves and profit to their constituents. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Without wishing to detain 
     <lb/>the House longer, I shall content myself by 
     <lb/>simply expressing my regret that on a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of such paramount importance—a ques<lb break="no"/>tion which towers in magnitude above all 
     <lb/>others that have ever come before this House 
     <lb/>—a question which not simply affects Canada, 
     <lb/>but the whole British North American Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—a question which does not only 
     <lb/>interest us, but will be felt in its influence 
     <lb/>upon future generations—I have, I say, to 
     <lb/>express my deep regret that such a question 
     <lb/>should not have been treated apart from 
     <lb/>party feeling, party prejudices, and a desire 
     <lb/>for party triumph. (Cheers.) Our object 
     <lb/>in considering this subject should not be to 
     <lb/>put one party out of office and another 
     <lb/>party in, but to determine what will most 
     <lb/>conduce to the present and future prosperity 
     <lb/>of the British North American Provinces. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) It is a matter of indifference 
     <lb/>to me, so far as it affects this question, who 
     <lb/>occupy the seats on the Treasury benches. I 
     <lb/>look upon this question irrespective of party 
     <lb/>feelings. From the present position of these 
     <lb/>provinces, I think it is our duty and our 
     <lb/>interest alike to give effect to these resolu<lb break="no"/>
      
            <cb/>
            
     tions so far as we can do so. If they fail 
     <lb/>
     through the action of the Lower Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     we shall not be responsible. If we believe 
     <lb/>
     that the resolutions will be conducive to 
     <lb/>
     our interests, we are bound to sustain the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen who agreed to them as a 
     <lb/>
     basis of union. Believing this to be the  
     <lb/>
     proper course to be pursued, I shall, as Ihave 
     <lb/>
     already said, have great pleasure in giving 
     <lb/>
     them my support. (Hear, hear.) There is 
     <lb/>
     just one other remark that I may perhaps be 
     <lb/>
     permitted to refer to, which fell from the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Waterloo (Mr. BOW<lb break="no"/>MAN), that I decidedly dissent from. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman spoke of this scheme as one 
     <lb/>
     which, if adopted, would conduce to in<lb break="no"/>dependence. I must object to that view 
     <lb/>
     being taken of it. If I thought that the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the scheme now before us could 
     <lb/>
     in any respect have the effect of severing 
     <lb/>
     these colonies from the Mother Country, 
     <lb/>
     whatever the consequences might be, I 
     <lb/>
     should have no hesitation in giving my vote 
     <lb/>
     against it. I believe there is nothing more 
     <lb/>
     ardently to be desired—no greater glory 
     <lb/>
     attainable than for these colonies remaining 
     <lb/>
     for all time to come, as we are now, depen<lb break="no"/>dencies of Great Britain. 
     <lb/>

      <persName ref="pers:COCK1">HON. MR. COCKBURN</persName>—The honorable 
     <lb/>
     member for North Waterloo referred to it as

     against the United States. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WALS1">MR. WALSH</persName>—I do not desire to mis<lb break="no"/>represent the hon. gentleman, and I am 
     <lb/>
     glad to hear that I have misconceived the

     tenor of his remarks. Mr. SPEAKER, I have 
     <lb/>
     detained the House longer than I purposed 
     <lb/>
     doing when I rose. I have touched very 
     <lb/>
     briefly on some of the general features of 
     <lb/>
     the scheme; but I have not occupied 
     <lb/>
     valuable time in quoting authorities, or in 
     <lb/>
     reading passages illustrative of  the past 
     <lb/>
     political history of hon. gentlemen on either 
     <lb/>
     side. It matters very little to me, in con<lb break="no"/>sidering this question, what certain hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen thought twelve months ago about 
     <lb/>
     representation by population or any other 
     <lb/>
     subject. This is a question to be decided 
     <lb/>
     by itself, and upon its own merits; and be<lb break="no"/>lieving that the adoption of this scheme, so 
     <lb/>
     far as we in Canada are concerned, will be 
     <lb/>
     fraught with great benefits to ourselves as 
     <lb/>
     well as to those who may come after us, I 
     <lb/>
     repeat that it will afford me great pleasure 
     <lb/>
     in giving my support to the resolutions.

     at this late hour, I feel, in common with

     many hon. members who have preceded me, 
     <lb/>
     that the debate has been sufficiently pro<lb break="no"/>tracted, and should be brought to a close as 
     <lb/>
     speedily as possible. Nevertheless, as a 
     <lb/>
     member lately elected to represent a wealthy 
     <lb/>
     and populous constituency, largely engaged 
     <lb/>
     in commercial, manufacturing, and agricul<lb break="no"/>tural pursuits, I deem it my duty to state my 
     <lb/>
     views on the proposed union of the British 
     <lb/>
     North American Provinces, now under the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of this House. In my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     sir, the gentlemen who occupy the Treasury 
     <lb/>
     benches deserve credit for the earnest and 
     <lb/>
     energetic manner in which they have applied 
     <lb/>
     themselves to carry out the pledges which 
     <lb/>
     they gave the country during the course of 
     <lb/>
     last summer. (Hear, hear.) I look upon 
     <lb/>
     it that the vote about to be taken is a 
     <lb/>
     foregone conclusion, and, for all practical 
     <lb/>
    purposes, might as well have been taken as 
     <lb/>soon as the resolutions had been read and 
     <lb/>spoken to by the Hon. Attorney General 
     <lb/>West. I have remarked, sir, that almost 
     <lb/>every hon. member that has spoken has 
     <lb/>expressed himself as favorable to a union of 
     <lb/>some kind or other with the Maritime 
     <lb/>Provinces. When the delegates from the 
     <lb/>eastern provinces met at Charlottetown ,Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island, they contemplated a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive union among themselves; but when in<lb break="no"/>vited to visit Quebec for the purpose of holding 
     <lb/>a conference with a view to a union of the 
     <lb/>whole of the colonies, the Federal principle 
     <lb/>was sustituted for the Legislative, Lower 
     <lb/>Canada and the eastern provinces voting 
     <lb/>as a unit for it, while the members repre<lb break="no"/>senting Canada West were divided, the Hon. 
     <lb/>Attorney General West preferring a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative union, and the Hon. President of the 
     <lb/>Council a Federal one. The subject of 
     <lb/>" Union of the Provinces " has been looked 
     <lb/>upon with favor, not only by our own states<lb break="no"/>men, who have of late years regarded it as a 
     <lb/>measure calculated to remove the difficulties 
     <lb/>which have surrounded the legislation of 
     <lb/>the country, but by leading statesmen of 
     <lb/>England as well, who view the proposal 
     <lb/>favorably, as being the means of building 
     <lb/>up a great nation, and also of preserving 
     <lb/>monarchical institutions on this continent. 
     <lb/>(Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, whatever may 
     <lb/>have been the points of difference which 
     <lb/>gave rise to the lengthened discussions of 
     <lb/>the Conference, there was one upon which, 
     <lb/>judging by the speeches of the delegates, 
     <lb/>and also from the resolutions themselves, 
     <lb/>there was perfect unanimity—that of loyalty 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     and attachment to the Throne of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. (Hear, hear.) One would have 
     <lb/>
     thought it unnecessary to incorporate such 
     <lb/>
     a sentiment in the resolutions, yet the first 
     <lb/>
     of the series gives utterance to it and is 
     <lb/>
     thus expressed :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     The best interests and present and future pros<lb break="no"/>perity of British North America will be promoted

            <p>
     With regard to the future of this proposed 
     <lb/>
     union, it is curious to note what is said and 
     <lb/>
     written in reference to it, some urging that 
     <lb/>
     its inevitable result will be a separation 
     <lb/>
     from our present happy connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Mother Country, and ultimate independence; 
     <lb/>
     while another class, equally confident, declares 
     <lb/>
     that it will lead to annexation with the 
     <lb/>
     United States. (Hear.) Whatever the ulti<lb break="no"/>mate fate of such a union may be, it is con<lb break="no"/>ceded by all parties that there exists a 
     <lb/>
     necessity for a change of some kind in the 
     <lb/>
     political relations existing between Upper 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada, and it is gratifying to 
     <lb/>
     reflect that an expedient has been devised 
     <lb/>
     for allaying the rancourous party spirit that 
     <lb/>
     has been too frequently exhibited on the 
     <lb/>
     floor of this House. (Hear, hear.) We may 
     <lb/>
     congratulate ourselves, sir, that while our 
     <lb/>
     republican neighbors are engaged in bloody 
     <lb/>
     strife, one portion spilling its best blood in 
     <lb/>
     order to obtain a new Constitution, we can 
     <lb/>
     discuss the propriety of making a change in 
     <lb/>
     our own, which has not been inaptly termed 
     <lb/>
     a "bloodless revolution," without let or 
     <lb/>
     hindrance, but on the contrary with the full 
     <lb/>
     consent and authority of the power to which 
     <lb/>
     we owe allegiance. (Hear.) The provisions 
     <lb/>
     of this new Constitution have been widely 
     <lb/>
     disseminated, and in some sections thorough<lb break="no"/>ly discussed. In the riding which I have 
     <lb/>
     the honor to represent, public attention was 
     <lb/>
     drawn to Confederation during the recent 
     <lb/>
     election, and I am fully justified in stating, 
     <lb/>
     that with a few exceptions here and there, 
     <lb/>
     there were not to be found many dissentients 
     <lb/>
     to it. (Hear, hear.) It is true that upon 
     <lb/>
     one or two occasions there were found lead<lb break="no"/>ing men who took the ground that they did 
     <lb/>
     not think it desirable to enter into this 
     <lb/>
     union, but such instances were rare. One 
     <lb/>
     of these gentlemen, the reeve of one of the 
     <lb/>
     most important townships in the riding, 
     <lb/>
     attended a meeting, where he met a large 
     <lb/>
     number of the electors; but after he had 
     <lb/>
     delivered his address, he could not find one to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="812" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0812.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">812</fw>
            
     respond to the sentiments he had expressed. 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear.) Another gentleman, an ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     reeve and an ex-member of Parliament— 
     <lb/>
     although he never had the honor of taking 
     <lb/>
     his seat in this House—also addressed a 
     <lb/>
     large meeting, but with the same result as 
     <lb/>
     in the previous case. The only opposition 
     <lb/>
     which was manifested throughout the con<lb break="no"/>test was not to the scheme itself, but to 
     <lb/>
     points of detail. (Hear, hear.) The Consti<lb break="no"/>tution of the Legislative Council was the 
     <lb/>
     principal one referred to, my opponent 
     <lb/>
     contending that the Upper House should 
     <lb/>
     continue an elective body, as at present, 
     <lb/>
     instead of being a nominated Chamber, as it 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to make it. I can sustain the view 
     <lb/>
     taken by the Hon. President of the Council 
     <lb/>
     in his opening address the other evening, 
     <lb/>
     when he said he would not hesitate to go 
     <lb/>
     into any liberal constituency in Western 
     <lb/>
     Canada and obtain their sanction to this 
     <lb/>
     principle. (Hear, hear.) Such at all events 
     <lb/>
     was the result in South Ontario. I am free 
     <lb/>
     to admit that a change was not asked for in 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the Legislative Council; 
     <lb/>
     but although the resolutions make the 
     <lb/>
     change, there is a feeling abroad in the 
     <lb/>
     country that on this account the scheme as 
     <lb/>
     a whole should not be rejected. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) Whenever a point was attempted to 
     <lb/>
     be made against me that I was endeavoring, 
     <lb/>
     by my advocacy of the nominative principle, 
     <lb/>
     to build up an aristocracy in this country, 
     <lb/>
     and that the result would be the locking up 
     <lb/>
     of the lands of the province in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     a privileged class, I replied that such had 
     <lb/>
     not been the case in the past, and that in a 
     <lb/>
     country like ours such could never be its 
     <lb/>
     results; and I further stated that the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Reform party, the Hon. President of 
     <lb/>
     the Council, had himself stood almost alone 
     <lb/>
     on his side of the House in 1850, in resist<lb break="no"/>ing the change from the nominative to the 
     <lb/>
     elective principle. My desire, sir, is to see 
     <lb/>
     the union carried out only on a fair and 
     <lb/>
     equitable basis, and this, I think, is likely 
     <lb/>
     to be attained in the manner proposed for 
     <lb/>the assumption by the Central Government 
     <lb/>(at $25 per head) of the debts or portion of 
     <lb/>debts for which each province is new liable. 
     <lb/>I regret, however, that so high a figure as 
     <lb/>80c. per head has been fixed upon as the 
     <lb/>subsidy to the local legislatures, for I fear 
     <lb/>the revenue will be so large that taken in 
     <lb/>connection with the revenues derivable from 
     <lb/>local sources, the surplus, after defraying the 
     <lb/>expenses of government, may induce that 
     <lb/>extravagance which has been so frequently 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     deprecated in the past, and which by this 
     <lb/>
     arrangement may be continued in the future. 
     <lb/>
     I have taken some pains, sir, to ascertain 
     <lb/>
     what will be the probable position of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada under the arrangement as proposed, 
     <lb/>
     and I find that its revenue and probable ex<lb break="no"/>penditure will be about as follows :—

     In this statement I have not included the 
     <lb/>
     Municipality Fund, as the receipts are dis<lb break="no"/>tributed the following year amongst the 
     <lb/>
     municipalities. Estimating the expense of 
     <lb/>
     the Local Government at $150,000, we have 
     <lb/>
     a balance of $475,000 per annum for local 
     <lb/>
     purposes. I regard the subsidy as altogether 
     <lb/>
     too large, and shall hope to see it very 
     <lb/>
     materially reduced. (Hear, hear.) My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from North Ontario, upon the hypo<lb break="no"/>thesis that the Maritime Provinces con<lb break="no"/>tribute one-fifth of the revenue of the pro<lb break="no"/>posed Confederacy, and the balance by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadas, in the relative proportion of two 
     <lb/>
     dollars by Upper Canada to one dollar by 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, founds an argument thereon, 
     <lb/>
     shewing that each additional representative 
     <lb/>
     gained for Upper Canada will cost $17,000. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Mr. SPEAKER, I apprehend that when 
     <lb/>
     the union is accomplished and the duties 
     <lb/>
     equalized, this seeming objection will, to 
     <lb/>
     some extent at least, be removed, for it is 
     <lb/>
     well known that the Maritime Provinces 
     <lb/>
     consume much more largely of imported 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="813" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-03-08_Page_0813.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">813</fw>
           
     goods, per head, than we do. (Hear.) But 
     <lb/>
     let this principle be extended to county and 
     <lb/>
     township matters, and it would necessitate 
     <lb/>
     appropriations to the wealthier townships, in 
     <lb/>
    the proportion each contributed to the revenue 
     <lb/>of the county—a principle which has never 
     <lb/>been contended for, and facts will go to 
     <lb/>show that it is seldom done even upon popu<lb break="no"/>lation, as is proposed by this scheme. But 
     <lb/>as it was necessary to establish some basis 
     <lb/>for contributing to the expenses of the 
     <lb/>local governments, without compelling them 
     <lb/>to resort to direct taxation, I think the 
     <lb/>principle adopted, that of population, is not 
     <lb/>unjust. (Hear, hear.) Again, it is argued 
     <lb/>that as Canada West contributes in the pro<lb break="no"/>portion already alluded to, that in the pay<lb break="no"/>ment of subsidies she will contribute more 
     <lb/>than her fair proportion in the proposed 
     <lb/>Confederacy. To this I reply, if the hypo<lb break="no"/>thesis that the proportion which Upper and 
     <lb/>Lower Canada respectively contribute to the 
     <lb/>general revenue be correct, and that the 
     <lb/>subsidy should be based upon revenue and 
     <lb/>not population, then undoubtedly the argu<lb break="no"/>ment is a good one. But, sir, let us see if 
     <lb/>the proposed arrangement is not a great 
     <lb/>improvement on the present method of dis<lb break="no"/>tributing the public funds. It is well known, 
     <lb/>sir, that the complaint which Upper Canada 
     <lb/>has made in the past was that the appropri<lb break="no"/>ations were made, not upon revenue, nor even 
     <lb/>according to population, but in utter disre<lb break="no"/>gard of both. Under the system which 
     <lb/>has hitherto prevailed for dividing money 
     <lb/>grants, of the proposed subsidy to the two 
     <lb/>Canadas ($2,005,403, or 80 cts. per head),

            </p>
            <p>As the moneys have been distributed equally 
     <lb/>in the past between Upper and Lower Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, I maintain that the balance of the 
     <lb/>public debt, say $5,000,000, to be appor<lb break="no"/>tioned between them, should be divided in 
     <lb/>the same way, and not, as proposed by the 
     <lb/>Hon. Finance Minister, on population. But 
     <lb/>it is said the scheme will lead to extrava<lb break="no"/>gance. I had hoped, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
     <lb/>an alliance with the frugal and thrifty pop<lb break="no"/>ulation of the eastern provinces would in<lb break="no"/>duce the very opposite, and lead to greater 
     <lb/>economy in the public expenditure than we 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     have had in the past. (Hear, hear.) With 
     <lb/>
    reference, sir, to the cost of the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments, that subject has been left in the 
     <lb/>hands of the local legislatures entirely, 
     <lb/>the resolutions shewing whence their in<lb break="no"/>come shall be derived, and what the subsidy 
     <lb/>shall be without compelling a resort to direct 
     <lb/>taxation. I claim for this scheme, Mr. 
     <lb/>SPEAKER, that it will give us national im<lb break="no"/>portance. (Hear.) But here again it is 
     <lb/>objected that to obtain this we must have a 
     <lb/>vast population. When the colonies now 
     <lb/>forming a portion of the American union 
     <lb/>severed the connection from the parent state, 
     <lb/>their population was set down at 2,500,000, 
     <lb/>and although an impression has very gener<lb break="no"/>ally obtained that they have increased in 
     <lb/>population faster than we have, an examina<lb break="no"/>tion into the facts shows that such is not 
     <lb/>the case—for in 1860 their population 
     <lb/>reached 30,000,000, an increase of 1,200 
     <lb/>per cent, while ours in the same period had 
     <lb/>increased from 145,000 in 1784, to 3,000,000 
     <lb/>in 1861, or over 2,300 per cent. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>Confederation, sir, would give us nationality 
     <lb/>—I speak of British nationality—a nation 
     <lb/>created from the fragmentary portions of the 
     <lb/>provinces of Britain on this continent, but 
     <lb/>still retaining its allegiance to the British  
     <lb/>Crown. Then, sir, it is claimed that the 
     <lb/>commercial advantages which may arise 
     <lb/>from Confederation of the provinces can as 
     <lb/>readily be obtained by a Legislative as a 
     <lb/>Federal union. This is admitted; but as 
     <lb/>that is not obtainable, and as a union would 
     <lb/>remove the barriers to commercial inter<lb break="no"/>course and foster the trade between the 
     <lb/>colonies (each of which now effects more 
     <lb/>exchanges with the United States than with 
     <lb/>all the rest of the provinces), it is desirable 
     <lb/>that the union should take place. (Hear.) 
     <lb/>This leads me, sir, to remark upon the 
     <lb/>probable abrogation of the Reciprocity treaty. 
     <lb/>The country will be glad to know, from the 
     <lb/>announcement made to the House on Mon<lb break="no"/>day last, that the Ministry is alive to the 
     <lb/>importance of entering into immediate ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations, through the English Government, 
     <lb/>with that of the United States, for the 
     <lb/>renewal of this treaty. (Hear, hear.) I am 
     <lb/>not of the number who believe that the 
     <lb/>advantages accruing from this treaty have 
     <lb/>been all on the side of Canada; for, from the 
     <lb/>statements lately published, it appears that 
     <lb/>the whole trade of 1854 was... $24,000,000

     I do not fear, sir, but that the treaty will be 
     <lb/>
     renewed; enlightened counsels will prevail, 
     <lb/>
     and, with the better feeling existing between 
     <lb/>
     the two countries, the subject will be taken 
     <lb/>
     up in a proper spirit, and legislated upon 
     <lb/>
     accordingly. (Hear.) The construction of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway is said to be a 
     <lb/>
     necessity of the proposed union, and without 
     <lb/>
     it there can be no union except in name. 
     <lb/>
     Calculations have been made which show 
     <lb/>
      that this road cannot be used for carrying 
     <lb/>
      heavy merchandise at remunerative rates, 
     <lb/>
     more especially flour, which it has been 
     <lb/>
     shown would cost $2.25 per barrel from 
     <lb/>
     Toronto to Halifax, at two cents per ton per 
     <lb/>
     mile. The Grand Trunk Railway now car<lb break="no"/>ries flour from Toronto to Montreal for 25 
     <lb/>
     cents per barrel during winter, and at the 
     <lb/>
     same rate a barrel of flour would cost $1.22. 
     <lb/>
     If this could be done, the difference in cost 
     <lb/>
     between winter rates and shipping via the St. 
     <lb/>
      Lawrence in summer, at 85 cents per barrel, 
     <lb/>
     would be made up in a saving of storage, 
     <lb/>
     interest, and insurance. Then there is the 
     <lb/>
     military aspect of the subject, which has 
     <lb/>
     already been thoroughly discussed. I con<lb break="no"/>tend, sir, that union with the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces not only allies us more closely to 
     <lb/>
     them and to each other, but also to that 
     <lb/>
     power which alone could render us aid 
     <lb/>
    whenever subjected to attack ; and, regarded  
     <lb/>from this point of view, this railroad is said 
     <lb/>to be a necessity. Lord DURHAM in his 
     <lb/>report said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     An union for common defence against foreign 
     <lb/>
     enemies is the national bond of connection that 
     <lb/>
     holds together the great communities of the 
     <lb/>
     world, and between no parts of any kingdom or 
     <lb/>
     state did the necessity exist of such a union 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     more obviously than between the whole of these 
     <lb/>
     colonies. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     (Hear,hear.) In conclusion; sir, if we reject 
     <lb/>
     the proposed union, what is offered as a 
     <lb/>
     substitute? In the absence of anything 
     <lb/>
     better which will settle our existing diffi<lb break="no"/>culties, shall we reject the opportunity now 
     <lb/>
     presented and that may never recur? Rather 
     <lb/>
     let us, as members of the same family, unite 
     <lb/>
     for weal or for woe. By it we secure enlarged 
     <lb/>
     commercial intercourse, greater security in 
     <lb/>
     case of attack, a remedy for the existing dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties between Upper and Lower Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and also render more lasting the connection 
     <lb/>
     now existing with the Mother Country. 
     <lb/>
    (Hear.) While in favor of this measure, 
     <lb/>but believing that it should be submitted for 
     <lb/>the approval of those who are to be affected 
     <lb/>by the contemplated change, I shall feel it 
     <lb/>to be my duty in the first instance to vote 
     <lb/>against the "previous question," in order 
     <lb/>that such an amendment may be put, reserv<lb break="no"/>ing the right to vote for the amendment of 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Peel, when that shall 
     <lb/>come up for discussion, its object being to 
     <lb/>submit the question for popular sanction. 
     <lb/>(Cheers.) If this, however, shall fail, I 
     <lb/>shall vote, Mr. SPEAKER, for the resolution 
     <lb/>now in your hands.

            <p>MR. D. FORD JONES resumed the

     <lb/>favor of a Confederation of all the Provinces 
     <lb/>of British North America. I feel that the 
     <lb/>question is one involving such very great 
     <lb/>interests, involving a change in the whole 
     <lb/>Constitution of the country, and involving 
     <lb/>consequences which may plunge us into 
     <lb/>great difficulties, or which may have the 
     <lb/>very opposite effect— that I feel great 
     <lb/>diffidence and embarrassment in approaching 
     <lb/>it. But I feel it is a duty I owe to myself 
     <lb/>and to those who sent me here, that I should 
     <lb/>express my opinions on this proposed union, 
     <lb/>before I record my vote on the resolutions 
     <lb/>now before the House. I desire to do this,
