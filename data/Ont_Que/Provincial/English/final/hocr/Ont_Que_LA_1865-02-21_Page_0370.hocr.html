<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> single government, we should have been <br />
informed that the Imperial Government <br />
intended to make that treaty, and our rights <br />
would have been respected ; but as we were <br />
but a simple colony, and as there were many <br />
interests brought to bear, we could do nothing <br />
to protect ourselves. I do not desire to <br />
weary the House with quotations, but I trust <br />
I shall be allowed to cite another author, who <br />
in addition to showing how limited are the <br />
objects of ambition presented to the inhabit- <br />
ants of a colony, demonstrates that, though <br />
British subjects, we are almost on the footing <br />
of foreigners in England :— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Here again the contiguity of the colonies
to <br />
the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> suggests
disagreeable compari <br />
sons. In that great republic, the scope for indi- <br />
vidual exertion is immense ; and although the <br />
rewards of success in the higher walks of life are <br />
not generally so great as under most monarchical <br />
governments, some of the “ prizes open to all,” <br />
in that country, are of a very high order. Many a <br />
British North American has seen individuals upon <br />
the United States side of our boundary, whom he <br />
knew from personal acquaintance to be inferior <br />
to him in natural abilities, education, wealth, and <br />
social <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standing,</span> raised in a
short time to the pre <br />
sidency of that republic, a position which would <br />
entitle him to rank with the proudest monarchs of <br />
Europe. At the same time that British American <br />
could not reasonably aspire even to become the <br />
governor of his native province ; and if he were <br />
to go to England, all the inﬂuence which he could <br />
command would probably not procure him a pre- <br />
sentation to his Sovereign. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Does not that show that the position of a
<br />
Canadian, or of any other inhabitant of the <br />
colonies, in England is a position of infe- <br />
riority ? We desire to remove that infe- <br />
riority by adopting the plan of Confederation <br />
now submitted to the House. The honorable <br />
member for Hochelaga stated that Confeder- <br />
ation had not been asked for by the people, <br />
but that it was adopted as the last resource <br />
of a falling party. He referred, of course, <br />
when he expressed that opinion, to the vote <br />
of censure he had proposed last year against <br />
the TACHE—MACDONALD Ministry. After <br />
all his efforts against that ministry, the <br />
honorable gentleman could do no more than <br />
reproach them with an act committed, or <br />
supposed to have been committed, ﬁve years <br />
before by another government ; and by that <br />
means he had succeeded in overthrowing the <br />
ministry. The result of the vote, brought <br />
about by the honorable member, was very <br />
different from what he expected ; it resulted <br />
in the Coalition, and the project of Confeder- <br />
ation now before the House. The honorable <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> gentleman says that the people have not <br />
asked for it, but when the Government <br />
announced to the House that the basis upon <br />
which the new ministry had been formed <br />
was the Confederation of the provinces, the <br />
opposition did not declare that the measure <br />
was a bad one. On the contrary, the great <br />
majority of the members from Upper and <br />
from Lower Canada pronounced themselves <br />
in favor of the plan, and promised their <br />
support to the Government. The honorable <br />
gentleman also asks, who empowered the <br />
delegates to meet and prepare a plan of <br />
Contederation, and submit it to this House ? <br />
l answer, that the power was derived from <br />
the expressed sentiments of the House when <br />
it consented to the formation of the Govern- <br />
ment on that basis. The Government felt <br />
that they had a perfect right not only to <br />
assist at the Quebec Conference, but to bring <br />
it about. And even though there had been <br />
no other reason but the difficulties which had <br />
arisen in Canada some years before ; even <br />
though there had been no other reason than <br />
the care of the interests of the country, we <br />
should have been justiﬁed thereby in assist- <br />
ing at the Charlottetown Conference, and in <br />
calling the Quebec Conference, at which the <br />
measure was adopted by the thirty-three <br />
delegates. The honorable gentleman let fall <br />
the accusation that we consented that <br />
Canada should have but one vote in the <br />
Conference. In making a charge against <br />
the Government, as leader of the O<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pposition,</span>
<br />
the honorable gentleman ought to have <br />
sought to base it on more correct information. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. DORION—I understood it to <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVlN—Yes, <br />
two ; one for Upper and one for Lower <br />
Canada. We could have had more, but that <br />
was not the question. We did not go to the <br />
Conference to discuss simple matters of <br />
form, nor did we go there to force our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span>
<br />
upon others ; we desired to come to an under- <br />
standing with the Lower Provinces. It was <br />
not our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obj</span>ect to frame a feeble and unjust <br />
Constitution, destined, from the very fact, to <br />
last but a day. Hence it would not have <br />
been right, and we did not desire to take <br />
