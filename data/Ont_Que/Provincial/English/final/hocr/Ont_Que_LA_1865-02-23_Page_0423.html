<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He had looked at it in this way. The time
<br />
had <span style="background-color: white;">been when the people of Upper Canada </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
imagined that the Lower Canadians were afraid </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to grant </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span><span style="background-color: white;"> by
population lest western </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
reformers should interfere with their religious </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
institutions. He was fully satisﬁed that that idea </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
was entirely erroneous—that the French people </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
never had the slightest fear of the kind, because </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span><span style="background-color: white;"> knew it would be political
suicide, it would </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
be absolute ruin to any political party having the</span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration</span><span style="background-color: white;"> of affairs</span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr"> in their hands, to perpe-<br />
trate injustice on any section of the people, to <br />
whatever church they belonged. (Cheers.) <br />
There was one element, however, which always <br />
entered largely into the discussion of all our na- <br />
tional questions, and that was that the French <br />
people were a people entirely different from our- <br />
selves in origin, and largely in feeling. We all <br />
had a certain pride in our native country, and <br />
gloried in the deeds of our ancestors. The French <br />
people had that feeling quite as strongly as any <br />
of us ; this reason, and also<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;"> because
they were a </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
conquered people, they felt it necessary to main- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tain a strong national spirit, and to resist all at- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tempts to procure justice by the people of the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
wes,. lest that </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;">national existence
should be broken </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
down. He (Mr. </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">MACKENZIE)</span><span style="background-color: white;"> felt
for one that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
mere representation by population, under such </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances</span><span style="background-color: white;"> would perhaps
scarcely meet the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
expectations </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed</span><span style="background-color: white;"> of it,
because although Up- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
per Canada would have seventeen more members </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
than Lower Canada, it would be an easy thing </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
for the ﬁfty or ﬁfty-ﬁve members representing </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
French constituencies to unite with a minority </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
from Upper Canada, and thus secure an Admin- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
istration subservient to their views. </span><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> These were the sentiments that I uttered <br />
at that meeting, and the sentiments to <br />
which I am prepared now to give utter- <br />
rance again. (Hear, hear.) I believe that that <br />
feeling of nationality has been our sole difﬁcul- <br />
ty, in working our present political system. <br />
But I do not believe for one moment that it <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span><span style="background-color: white;"> be possible or perhaps
desirable to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
extinguish that strong feeling of nationality. </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Break</span><span style="background-color: white;"> down that feeling </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span><span style="background-color: white;"> all patriotism </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
will be broken down with it. (Hear, hear.) </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
I do not think it would be fair, or kind, or </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
honorable, to attempt to do so. When </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Britain conquered the country, she accepted </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the responsibility of governing a foreign </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
people in accordance with their feelings, so </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
far as consistent with British policy. That </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span><span style="background-color: white;"> of nationality obtains so
strongly in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
all countries, that, where attempts have been </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
made, as in Austria, to break it down, they </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">have </span><span style="background-color: white;">signally failed. When such
an attempt </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">failed,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> th</span>ough made by a despotic
government, <br />
with a powerful army at its command, how <br />
could we expect it to succeed in a free coun- <br />

<br />
different nationalities are represented in <br />
the national councils ; and, notwithstanding <br />
all its military power and prestige, Austria <br />
has been compelled to accord local parlia- <br />
ments or assemblies to every one of those <br />
eighteen nationalities. (Hear, hear.) I <br />
have felt, therefore, that it would be utterly <br />
impracticable to obtain representation by <br />
population so long as the French people be- <br />
ieved, as I came to ﬁnd they <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">did</span>
believe, <br />
that this concession to us would involve <br />
destruction to them as a separate people. <br />

<p style="background-color: white;" class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON— That is what they <br />
fear will be the result of the scheme now <br />
proposed. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span style="background-color: white;"> MR. A.

learn that they have any such fear. The </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Attoney General East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER), </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
in his speech, a few evenings ago, adverted </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to the position taken by the French inhabi- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tants of Lower Canada at the time of the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
French revolution, and claimed credit for </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
them, because they remained loyal to the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
British Crown, when all the other North </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
American Colonies </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">threw off </span><span style="background-color: white;">th</span>e
British <br />
sway. The honorable gentleman’s claim <br />
was perfectly just. But I believe that they <br />
were actuated by another feeling beyond the <br />
feeling of loyalty—that they felt their only <br />
safeguard as a distinct peeple— the only <br />
way to preserve their nationality, was to <br />
remain attached to Great Britain. Their <br />
existence for twenty years as a French colony <br />
under British rule, was not perhaps sufﬁcient <br />
to give that attachment which they have <br />
now to the British Government. But it <br />
was perfectly clear to them that, if they <br />
entered the American Union, they would be <br />
absorbed and lost, just as the French colony <br />
of Louisiana has since been. (Hear, hear.) <br />
I have been charged, and others with me, <br />
who have held the same political views, with <br />
deserting our party, because we have ceased <br />
to act with the gentlemen from Lower Can- <br />
ada with whom we formerly acted. I think <br />
there is no fair ground for such a charge. <br />
For what, after all, is party ? It is but an <br />
association of individuals holding opinions <br />
in common on some grounds of public policy, <br />
or some measures which they may believe <br />
to be necessary for the conduct of the <br />
government of the country to which they <br />
belong. Looking at the matter in that light, <br />
there is no part of our party politics in the <br />
west, that we have insisted upon so strongly <br />
as that which concerns the representation of <br />
the people in Parliament. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
