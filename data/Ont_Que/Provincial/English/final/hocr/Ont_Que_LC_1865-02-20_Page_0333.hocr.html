<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> So the amendment was negatived. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ said—I am anx- <br />
ious that honorable gentlemen should have a <br />
full opportunity of expressing themselves upon <br />
the measure which is now before the House, <br />
and as I am the mover of the resolutions, I <br />
think it is but just and fair that I should close <br />
the debate. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) If no
other hon- <br />
orable gentleman desires to speak upon them, <br />
I think that before the vote is taken I should <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> an opportunity of answering
the argu- <br />
ments that have been advanced against the <br />
scheme, and of explaining certain expressions <br />
that have fallen from me. I believe the <br />
House will be disposed to give me that fair <br />
play which has always been given under cir- <br />
cumstances similar to these—(hear, hear)— <br />
and I purpose, therefore—no other honorable <br />
gentleman desiring to address the House—to <br />
close the debate this evening. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—I would ask if it is <br />
the intention of the Government to explain <br />
the resolutions more fully than has been done? <br />

MR. CAMPBELL—The members <br />
of the Government will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">happy to</span>
afford any <br />
information the honorable member may desire. <br />

<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> my constituents to make a few
observations <br />
upon the subject before us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear)</span>
If <br />
the constituency I represent is, perhaps, not <br />
quite the most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">numerous</span> in the
country, it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possesses</span> a large share of the
wealth, busi- <br />
ness and manufacturing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">energy</span>
and commer- <br />
cial enterprise of the province. It also <br />
contains, in not very unequal proportions, <br />
people of the different nationalities. religions <br />
and languages which most largely prevail <br />
amongst us. You have the French element. <br />
with the Roman Catholic religion and <br />
French language; you have the English, <br />
Scotch and Irish Protestant element, and <br />
you have the Irish Roman Catholic element, <br />
which I may be said more especially to repre- <br />
sent, and which is by no means an unimportant <br />
one. Go through Canada, and you will ﬁnd <br />
that these, with a few European foreigners, <br />
such as Germans and Norwegians, make up <br />
nearly the whole population. My division <br />
is, in fact, an epitome of Canada. (Hear, <br />
hear.) It may not be too much to say that <br />
the opinion and feeling of Montreal will be <br />
a fair representation of what the opinion of <br />
the country generally is, and that if Montreal <br />
has come to a nearly unanimous conclusion, <br />
it is very likely the different sections of the <br />
country will have arrived at a very similar <br />
one on the subject of Confederation. I am <br />
happy to be able to state with conﬁdence, <br />
that I have taken pains to ascertain the <br />
opinions of each of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sections</span> of <br />
my constituency to which I have alluded, <br />
and that I believe they are in consonance <br />
with the votes I have given in this chamber. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I have alluded to the energy <br />
of my constituents. to their great commercial <br />
enterprise. I believe that energy is one of <br />
their leading characteristics, and I may say <br />
this, that if that energy has led them, on <br />
rare occasions, a little further than their own <br />
interest and that of the country required, <br />
they, nevertheless, on such occasions acted <br />
on an honest and generous impulse, or were <br />
prompted by the feeling that some injustice <br />
had been done to them. I was greatly <br />
gratified with the remarks of the honorable <br />
and gallant Premier at the commencement <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
this debate, when alluding to events <br />
which long since took place in Montreal; he <br />
put the blame where it really should
rest— <br />
on the Legislature of the day, which was <br />
pressing on the people a measure distasteful<br />
to them, and which was vainly
remonstrated <br />
against by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">numerous</span>
portions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the country. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span>
same impulsive character which led <br />
