</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION—Why do you deduct <br />
the revenue from the Municipal Loan Fund ? <br />
</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_17" title="bbox 1927 609 3402 5242">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Is it because Lower Canada is to be
charged <br />
with the payment of the Municipal Loan Fund <br />
debt ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN—I strike <br />
out the item of revenue from the com- <br />
mon school lands, because in the course of <br />
time the lands will become exhausted, and the <br />
revenue cannot be considered as permanent. <br />
Besides, the amount must be added to the <br />
Common School Fund, and cannot really be <br />
considered as an ordinary source of revenue. <br />
It is the same as regards the Municipal Loan <br />
Fund, which cannot be considered as per- <br />
manent revenue, and I wish to count only the <br />
ordinary items of revenue. But, on the other <br />
hand, it must be seen that many of the items <br />
of revenue will increase in course <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
time, so <br />
that the surplus of revenue over expenditure <br />
in Lower Canada will always be considerable. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION — The honorable <br />
member did not understand my question. I <br />
asked him whether Lower Canada will be <br />
compelled to pay the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">municipal</span>
debt, and he <br />
has not answered. <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN—I un- <br />
derstood the honorable gentleman perfectly <br />
well, but I make it a rule never to allow my- <br />
self to be turned aside by interruptions, and <br />
I shall not depart from that rule now. (Hear, <br />
hear.) The ﬁgures I have given are highly <br />
important, for they demonstrate that Lower <br />
Canada will have a real revenue under the <br />
new Constitution—a revenue which is not <br />
calculated upon the probable increase and <br />
prosperity of the country, but upon the pre-<br />
sent revenue—of nearly $1,500,000, to meet <br />
local expenses. And yet, in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">face</span>
of these<br />
figures, which are based upon the most evi- <br />
dent facts, honorable members talk of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
direct <br />
taxes. They simply want to frighten the <br />
country. But the people will see that there <br />
is no danger of direct taxation with the sur- <br />
plus revenue we shall have. Direct taxation <br />
must be resorted to if Lower Canada should <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> way to extravagance and
spend more <br />
than her means, but not otherwise. Lower <br />
Canada will have a revenue sufficient to meet <br />
all its expenses, unless it follow the example <br />of a person with an income of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£400,</span>
who <br />
should expend £1,000. The total expenses <br />
of Lower Canada for all purposes, less the <br />
cost of legislation and the payment of interest <br />
on the local debt, will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$997,000,</span>
calculating <br />
the expenditure upon the present basis. But <br />
it is evident that Lower Canada will reduce <br />
its expenditure, such for instance as the <br />
expenditure connected with the Crown Lands <br />
department, and that economy will be prac- <br />
