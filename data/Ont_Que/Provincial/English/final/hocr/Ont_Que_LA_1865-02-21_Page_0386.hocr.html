<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> bushels of grain, whilst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day</span> it produces <br />
more than 50,000,000 bushels. At the time <br />
of the union we had only 1,298 schools, and <br />
to-day we have 3,600. At the time of the <br />
union these schools were attended only by <br />
39,000 children, whilst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> are <br />
attended by more than 200,000. At the <br />
union the exportations from the ports of <br />
Quebec and Montreal amounted to $9,000,- <br />
000 ; to-day they exceed $<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18,000,000.</span>
At <br />
the union the number <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> vessels
built <br />
annually in our shipyards was 48 only ; now <br />
we have 88, and the tonnage is quadrupled. <br />
At the time of the union our importations <br />
amounted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$10,000,000,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day</span> they <br />
reach $45,000,000. At the time of the <br />
union our exportations and importations <br />
amounted to $16,000,000 ; to-day they reach <br />
the enormous sum of $87,000,000. And <br />
it is with such ﬁgures as these before us <br />
that we are to be told that we are leaving <br />
the union with a debt of $30,000,000 ! At <br />
the time of the union the revenue arising <br />
from the tax on bank-notes, which affords a <br />
fair indication of the extent of business <br />
done, amounted to $2 200 ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day</span>
it amounts <br />
to $15,800. At the time of the union <br />
the number of merchantmen arriving in <br />
Quebec every year was 1,000 ; now it <br />
is 1,660, and the number of vessels ar- <br />
riving at all the ports in Lower Canada <br />
is 2,463. At the time of the union the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonnage</span> of these vessels was
295,000 tons, <br />
and now in the port of Quebec it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">897,000</span>
<br />
tons, and for the whole of Lower Canada <br />
1,041,000 tons. At the time of the union <br />
25,000 sailors arrived heve annually ; now we <br />
have 35,000. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1839</span> the revenue
of <br />
Lower Canada was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$588 000 ;</span> when
we <br />
enter the Confederacy, although we are not <br />
called upon to pay any of the expenditure <br />
for general purposes, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span>
revenue will be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,446,000,</span> that is to say that
we shall have, <br />
under the Confederation, a revenue three <br />
times as large as it was at the time of the <br />
union ; and instead of having, as we then <br />
had, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> excess of expenditure
amounting to <br />
about $80,000, the total expenditure of <br />
Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ca</span>nada, under the
Confederation, will <br />
be about $1,200,000, leaving a surplus of <br />
more than $200,000! If then our debt has <br />
increased we have made most rapid pro- <br />
gress, and we have received the full value <br />
for our money. Nor must it be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forgotten</span>
<br />
that at the time of the union of Upper and <br />
Lower Canada the country had not a single <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railway,</span> and now it is traversed
from end to <br />

one of the ﬁnest railways on this <br />
continent ; and are long, let us hope in <br />
the interest of our commerce and our <br />
safety, that this iron band will connect the <br />
extreme west with the Atlantic ocean. <br />(Hear, hear.) We entered the union when <br />
the Welland canal had hardly been begun ; <br />
we leave it with one of the most magniﬁcent <br />
canal systems the world has ever seen. And <br />
then the telegraph lines. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">At the</span>
time of the <br />
union the only telegraph we had was that one <br />
with balls, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> so many of us
remember, <br />
and which used to connect the citadel with <br />
the Island of Orleans, and thence communi- <br />
cated with Grosse Isle by a telegraph of the <br />
same kind ; now an immense network of <br />
telegraph wires places us in daily and <br />
immediate communication with the most <br />
remote districts in the different provinces. <br />
We leave the union with a debt greater <br />
than that with which we entered it, <br />
but we leave it with a most perfect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span>
<br />
of lighthouses, wharves, piers, slides, in fact <br />
with a large number of other public works, <br />
which have mainly contributed to the settle- <br />
ment and the prosperity of the country, and <br />
which have more than doubled its resources <br />
since the union. The Grand Trunk Railway <br />
alone, for the sixteen millions which it has <br />
cost us, has contributed to increase the <br />
value of our lands by millions and millions <br />
of dollars, by enhancing the value of our <br />
agricultural productions, which are by its <br />
means brought with greater ease <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
the <br />
different markets, and has moreover entailed <br />
an expenditure in our midst of more than <br />
seventy millions of dollars for its construction <br />
alone. Yes, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> if we
entered the <br />
union with a debt of four hundred thousand <br />
dollars, and if to-day we leave it with a debt <br />
of thirty millions of dollars, we can at all <br />
events show what we have done with the <br />
money, by the immense extent of territory, <br />
then uncleared, which is now covered with <br />
abundant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crops,</span> and which have
served to <br />
keep in the country, not indeed all the child- <br />
ren of our farmers, but at least a very great <br />
number of them, who but for these impro- <br />
vements would have emigrated <span style="font-style: italic;">en </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">masse</span>
to the <br />
neighboring country. Under the Confedera- <br />
tion we shall have the control of our lands, and <br />
we can settle them so as to retain in our <br />
midst all those of the rising generation of <br />
both origins who too often take to a foreign <br />
land their strong right arms, their energy <br />
and devotion. Our mineral lands, so rich and<br />
so productive, the opening up of which
