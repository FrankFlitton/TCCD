<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> their yielding too much on the part of <br />
Canada to gratify the eastern provinces, so <br />
as to enable them to bring about this scheme <br />
at the present moment.  If the scheme is <br />
so marred in its details as to destroy the <br />
whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure,</span> why not reject
it? Then <br />
my hon. friend alluded to the state of the <br />
country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> before the present
Government <br />
was formed, in terms which I hardly think <br />
he was justiﬁed in using. He claimed that <br />
the country was in a state of anarchy and <br />
confusion. Now, hon. gentlemen, I must <br />
say that for my part I saw none of that <br />
anarchy, and I must say very little of <br />
that confusion. I assert that there may <br />
be witnessed in other lands what was <br />
witnessed in this. We saw weak govern- <br />
ments striving month after month to keep <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">themselves in power, and we saw these <br />
governments daily and hourly attacked <br />
by a strong and wary opposition. But, hon. <br />
gentlemen, I have yet to learn that the <br />
giving of 17 additional members to Upper <br />
Canada and 47 members to the eastern pro- <br />
vinces will ensure us against the same state <br />
of thin in the future. It was very well put <br />
by the hon. member for Wellington (Hon. <br />
Mr. SANBORN) when he said, if there was <br />
more patriotism on the part of our public <br />
men, and less desire to sacriﬁce the country <br />
for the good of party, we would not have had <br />
that state of confusion to which my hon. <br />
friend from the Erie Division has alluded. <br />
Then my hon. friend who represents the <br />
Erie Division, in order to fortify the position <br />
he took in supporting the scheme, took up <br />
the resolutions adopted by the Toronto Re- <br />
form Convention in 1859. He stated that I <br />
was a delegate present at that convention ; <br />
but I can only say that, although elected a <br />
delegate, I took no part in the proceedings, <br />
and know nothing more of them than I <br />
learned from the public prints. The hon. <br />
gentleman, however, conveniently read only <br />
a part of the resolutions. But it must be ad- <br />
mitted that these resolutions were the iden- <br />
tical basis upon which the present Govern- <br />
ment was organized. This Government <br />
was organized for the express purpose of <br />
carrying out the arrangements embodied in <br />
the resolutions of that body. And, hon. <br />
gentlemen, a committee was appointed by <br />
the Toronto Convention, and that committee <br />
prepared a draft address to the public. That <br />
was submitted to the executive committee, <br />
and considered on the 15th of February, 1860, <br />
and was revised and sent to the country as <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the address of the convention, of which
the <br />
hon. member for Erie was a member, and <br />
over which he also presided as one of <br />
the vice-chairmen. And what did they <br />
say ? That convention never intended that <br />
Parliament should change the Constitution or <br />
give us a new Constitution without consulting <br />
the people and allowing the public an oppor- <br />
tunity of passing its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judgment</span>
upon the pro- <br />
posed new Constitution. And how did this <br />
convention propose to secure the people the <br />
right of passing judgment upon so impor- <br />
tant a scheme as the adoption of a new <br />
Constitution ? Here it is, in large type—and <br />
I have no doubt my hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>
often <br />
read it in going through his large, wealthy, <br />
and prosperous division. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CHRISTIE—It was not pre- <br />
sented to the convention. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—I wish to put my <br />
hon. friend right. The meeting was held <br />
on the 23rd September, 1859, and was <br />
presided over by the late Hon. ADAM FER- <br />GUSSON ; and my hon. friend, the
member <br />
for Erie Division, and Mr. D. A. MACDON- <br />
ALD were vice-presidents. A special com- <br />
mittee was appointed at that meeting to <br />
draft an address to the people of Upper <br />
Canada on the political affairs of the pro- <br />
vince in support of the resolutions then <br />
adopted.&nbsp; A draft of the address was sub- <br />
mitted to the executive committee. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CHRISTIE—I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> a <br />
member of that committee. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE —The public meeting <br />
was held on the 15th February, 1860. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CHRISTIE—And when was <br />
the address published ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—It was published<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
in this shape in February, 1860. Well, one <br />
of the provisions contained in that address <br />
was this :—“ Secure these rights by a writ- <br />
ten Constitution, ratiﬁed by the people, and <br />
incapable of alteration except by their for- <br />
mal sanction.”&nbsp; Hon. gentlemen, I fear the <br />
hon. member for Erie Division will hardly be <br />
able to justify the course he feels called upon <br />
to take on this occasion by anything contained <br />
in the address or the resolutions of the Toronto <br />
convention. The hon. gentleman would never <br />
have thought of preparing such a scheme as <br />
this to be submitted to the members of such <br />
a convention. But think you that had such a <br />
scheme been presented they would not have <br />
demanded that it should be left to the <br />
people?&nbsp; Think you, hon. gentlemen, that <br />
that scheme we have met the approval <br />
