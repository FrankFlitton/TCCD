<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—Perhaps the Hon. <br />
Commissioner of Crown Lands will inform us <br />
whether, in stating the revenues of the various <br />
provinces, the customs revenue raised on <br />
goods exported from one province to another <br />
was taken into account? Prince Edward Is- <br />
land, in 1861, paid customs duties amounting <br />
to £17,769 sterling; of that, only £11,096 <br />
was paid on goods imported from foreign <br />
countries, or countries other than those which, <br />
it is proposed, shall form part of this union; <br />
so that the people of that island paid only <br />
about 70 cents per head in duties on goods <br />
brought in from countries outside the proposed <br />
Confederation. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—What do you <br />
make the total customs revenue of Prince d- <br />
ward Island for that year? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CURRIE—Seventeen</span>
thousand <br />
seven hundred and sixty-nine pounds sterling. <br />
Great Britain furnished the largest proportion <br />
of the imports; then Nova Scotia; then the <br />
United States; then New Brunswick. The <br />
whole duties, as I have said, paid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span>
goods <br />
coming from other countries than the British <br />
Provinces, were £11,096, or about two-thirds <br />
of the entire customs revenue. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—I suppose the <br />
person who was probably the best informed <br />
about the state of the revenue in Prince <br />
Edward Island, was the Secretary of the <br />
Treasury, Hon. Mr. POPE; and our estimate <br />
of the revenue of that island was based on <br />
a printed return which Mr. POPE handed <br />
round among the members of the Conference, <br />
informing us what had been the revenue of <br />
Prince Edward Island in 1863, and for a <br />
series of years before 1863. In the same way <br />
Hon. Mr. TILLEY furnished the statement of <br />
revenue for New Brunswick, Dr. TUPPER for <br />
Nova Scotia, and Hon. Mr. GALT for Canada; <br />
and on these statements furnished by the <br />
Ministers of Finance for the various pro- <br />
vinces the estimates were based. I observe <br />
that the Minister of Finance, Hon. Mr. GALT <br />
in a speech delivered elsewhere, puts down the <br />
total revenue of Prince Edward Island at <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$197,000,</span> all of which is from
customs and <br />
excise, save about $32,000. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ALEXANDER—My hon. <br />
friend from Niagara (Hon. Mr. CURRIE) in <br />
his own speech stated the revenue of Prince <br />
Edward Island at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$153,000.</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ then rose to wind<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
up the debate, with a general reply. He <br />
said:—Hon. gentlemen, I was very anxious <br />
that ample opportunity should be given to the <br />
members of this Honorable House to express <br />
their opinions on the matter which has been <br />
for the last two or three weeks under debate. <br />
And now as I see no member disposed to rise, <br />
with the view of offering any further remarks. <br />
I think the time has come when the debate <br />
may be closed, if such is the pleasure of the <br />
House. I commenced, hon. gentlemen, to <br />
take notes—pretty copious notes—with the <br />
view of answering the statements and argu- <br />
ments of hon. gentlemen who have spoken in <br />
opposition to the scheme. But, at the sug- <br />
gestion of some of my friends, I have taken <br />
my pen and crossed out all these notes— <br />
(hear, hear)—by way of compromise, if I <br />
may so express my —(laughter)—and in <br />
order that might not provoke further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis-</span>
<br />
cussion. I hope that this sacrifice of mine— <br />
for it is a sacrifice—(laughter)—will be taken <br />
in good part, and that the few remarks I have <br />
now to make will not be of a nature to provoke <br />
any reply. In the ﬁrst place, I must answer <br />
a question that was put to me, I think by my <br />
hon. friend from St. Clair Division (Hon. <br />
Mr. VIDAL). He said he did not understand <br />
exactly what I meant by the province being <br />
at the top of an inclined plane. It is true <br />
that in going over very rapidly the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
<br />
topics on which I touched, I did not explain <br />
that ﬁgure very fully. But I stated that the <br />
province stood in a twofold danger—of being <br />
dragged violently into the American Union, <br />
and, in the next place, as we stood on an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> <br />
clined plane, of slipping down gradually, and <br />
without our being aware of it, into the vortex <br />
below. It seems to me that the thing was <br />
plain enough. Still, as I am a Frenchman, <br />
and cannot express myself in English in the <br />
manner I would like, I think I should be <br />
allowed the privilege which is conceded to per- <br />
sons belonging to certain foreign nationalities. <br />
For instance, they say that an Englishman is <br />
allowed to speak once, an Irishman twice— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> AN HON. MEMBER—Three times. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SIR E. P. TACHÊ—Well, three <br />
times be it; that is still better. And a <br />
Dutchman as long as he ﬁnds it necessary, <br />
until he can make himself understood. Well, <br />
I want to have the privilege allowed to the <br />
Dutchman. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span> As to being
drawn <br />
violently into the American Union, if this <br />
scheme of Confederation does not take place, <br />it seems to me that that might be a very pro-<br />
