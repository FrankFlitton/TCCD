<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> this troublesome advocate of the second,
third <br />
or fourth order of talent, and place him on <br />
the bench, whilst by leaving these appoint- <br />
ments to the Central Government, we are sat- <br />
isﬁed that the selection will be made from <br />
men of the highest order of qualiﬁcations, <br />
that the external and local pressure will not be <br />
so great, and that the Government will be in a <br />
position to act more freely. It may be re- <br />
marked, in passing, that in the proposed Con- <br />
stitution there is an article which provides <br />
that the judges of the courts of Lower Can- <br />
ada shall be appointed from the members of <br />
the bar of that section. This exception was <br />
only made in favor of Lower Canada, and it <br />
is a substantial guarantee for those who fear <br />
the proposed system. Besides, the honorable <br />
member for Hochelaga, who fancies that he <br />
sees danger in the powers given to the Central <br />
Government, knows by experience, as having <br />
himself been a minister of the Crown, that in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> of every appointment of a
judge the <br />
Cabinet always consults the ministers for the <br />
section in which the appointment is to be <br />
made, and accepts their choice. The same <br />
practice would necessarily be followed by the <br />
Central Government, who would be forced to <br />
respect it, because behind the ministers from <br />
each section would be found the members from <br />
that section, and behind our ministers for <br />
Lower Canada will be found the sixty-ﬁve <br />
members whom we shall have sent to repre- <br />
sent and protect our interests in the Federal <br />
Parliament. It is then advantageous, and <br />
there could be no danger in the provision that <br />
the judges should be appointed by the Central <br />
Government ; indeed, it is for our interest, <br />
and the interest of all, that it should be so. <br />
And although it may be looked upon as a <br />
secondary consideration, yet it may as well be <br />
mentioned now, that by leaving the appoint- <br />
ment of our judges to the Central Govern- <br />
ment, we are the gainers by one hundred <br />
thousand dollars, which will have to be paid <br />
for their services by the central power. This <br />
consideration will perhaps have some weight <br />
with the honorable member for Hochelaga, <br />
who makes such an outcry to alarm the peo- <br />
ple that we shall be obliged to have recourse <br />
to direct taxation to defray the expenses of <br />
our Local Legislature. Notwithstanding the <br />
advanced hour of the evening, I cannot pass <br />
over in silence another observation made by <br />
the honorable member, and I beg he will ac- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cord</span> me his undivided attention
at the pre- <br />
sent moment. The honorable gentleman has <br />
asked the Government what meaning was to <br />
be attached to the word “ marriage,” where <br />

desired <br />
to know whether the Government proposed <br />
to leave to the Central Government the right <br />
of deciding at what age, for example, mar- <br />
riage might be contracted I will now an- <br />
swer the honorable gentleman as categorically <br />
as possible, for I am anxious to be under- <br />
stood, not only in this House, but also by all <br />
those who may hereafter read the report of <br />
our proceedings. And ﬁrst of all I will <br />
prove that civil rights form part of those <br />
which, by article 43 (paragraph 15) of the <br />
resolutions, are guaranteed to Lower Canada. <br />
This paragraph reads as follows :— <br />
</p>

</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 1870 601 3348 1942">

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 15. Property and civil rights, excepting
those <br />
portions thereof assigned to the General Parlia-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
ment. <br />

</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 1862 1984 3330 3576">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Well, amongst these rights are all the <br />
civil laws of Lower Canada, and among <br />
these latter those which relate to marriage ; <br />
now it was of the highest importance <br />
that it should be so under the proposed sys- <br />
tem, and therefore the members from Lower <br />
Canada at the Conference took great care to <br />
obtain the reservation to the Local Govern- <br />
ment of this important right, and in consent- <br />
ing to allow the word “ marriage ” after the <br />
word “divorce,” the delegates have not pro- <br />
posed to take away with one hand from the <br />
Local Legislature what they had reserved to it <br />
by the other. So that the word “ marriage,” <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">placed</span> where it is among the
powers of the <br />
Central Parliament, has not the extended signi- <br />
ﬁcation which was sought to be given to it by the <br />
honorable member. With<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> the view
of being <br />
more explicit, I now propose to read how the <br />
word marriage is proposed to be understood :— <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 1859 3601 3326 4168">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The word marriage has been placed in the
draft <br />
of the proposed Constitution to invest the Feder- <br />
al Parliament with the right of declaring what <br />
marriages shall be held and deemed to be valid <br />
throughout the whole extent of the Confederacy, <br />
without, however, interfering in any particular <br />
with the doctrines or rites of the religious creeds <br />
to which the contracting parties may belong. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> This is a point of great importance, and
the <br />
French Canadian members ought to rejoice <br />
to see that their fellow—countrymen in the <br />
Government have not failed in their duty on <br />
a question of so serious a nature. On many <br />
other points many of them will doubtless <br />
claim that we have not thoroughly fuﬁlled <br />
our duty, but as regards the matter in ques- <br />
tion there can be no difference of opinion, as <br />
we have all a common rule to guide us ; and <br />
I repeat that they ought to rejoice that their <br />
co-religionists in the Conference have not been <br />
found wanting on this occasion. The whole <br />
