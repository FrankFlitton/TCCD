<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> that drawn by Lord DURHAM in his day ; <br />
things have changed ! In the Parliament of <br />
the United Canadas, the English are in a <br />
majority ; they have not to deal with a <br />
French majority. But, if circumstances <br />
have altered, men have not ; place them in <br />
the same position in which they were pre- <br />
vious to 1839, and again you will perceive <br />
in them the same sentiments as were depicted <br />
by Lord DURHAM. The seed lies hid in the <br />
soil, it does not shew itself on the surface ; <br />
but a few drops of rain are all that is neces- <br />
sary to cause it to spring up. If such senti- <br />
ments did not exist between the two nation- <br />
alities, why this resolution, to be submitted <br />
to the House by the honorable member for <br />
Missisquoi, which I am now about to read :— <br />
Resolved, That assuming the Federal system of <br />
government to be a political necessity in a union <br />
of the British North American Provinces, any <br />
Confederation of those provinces which ignores <br />
the difference<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> of race, language
and religion of <br />
the inhabitants of the respective states or territories <br />
sought to be thus united, and is not framed with <br />
a view to secure to the inhabitants of such state or <br />
territory the management of their own local <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
in accordance with their own peculiar views and <br />
sentiments, is unwise and inexpedient, and not <br />
conducive to good government or to the peace <br />
and tranquillity of those for whom it is framed ; <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolved,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>That with a view to secure
to that <br />
portion of the inhabitants of Lower Canada <br />
speaking the English language, the free exercise <br />
and enjoyment of their own ideas, institutions <br />
and rights, in any proposed Confederation of the <br />
provinces, Canada should be divided into three <br />
civil divisions, to wit: Western, Central and <br />
Eastern Canada. <br />
At the mere idea of a <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature</span> in which <br />
the French element is to be in a majority in <br />
Lower Canada, the passions described by <br />
Lord DURHAM are evinced. It is true that <br />
the Ministry are doing their best to reassure <br />
both parties, and to each party, separately, <br />
they make promises at the expense of the <br />
other. French-Canadians ! do not allow <br />
yourselves to be led away by those brilliant <br />
promises. An Italian poet describes the <br />
endeavors of a mother to induce her child to <br />
swallow a draught, which is intended to re- <br />
store him to health ; to tempt him, she covers <br />
the edge of the cup with honey ; in like man- <br />
ner, the edge of the cup which is presented <br />
to you has been covered with honey, but in- <br />
stead of containing a health-restoring draught, <br />
that cup contains poison and death. I do <br />
not believe that the French-Canadians will <br />
share the power of their majority in Lower <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span><span style="background-color: white;"> by striving to oppress the English- </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian
;</span><span style="background-color: white;"> b</span>ut there are
too many points <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> on which they disagree to allow of their <br />
living long in peace together, in spite of <br />
their sincere wish to do so, under the sys- <br />
tem of local government which is proposed <br />
to us. The Honorable Prime Minister said <br />
in the Council :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I believe the French-Canadians will do
all in <br />
their power to render justice to their fellow subjects <br />
of English origin ; and it should not be forgotten <br />
that, if the former are in a majority in <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
Canada, the English will be in a majority in the <br />
General Government, and that no act of real <br />
injustice can take place without its being reversed <br />
by the Federal Parliament. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 1628 1794 3092 5059">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But who is to decide whether any act of
the <br />
French-Canadians is really an act of injus- <br />
tice? The Federal Parliament in which <br />
the English element will be all-powerful ! <br />
In political matters, a disinterested opinion <br />
is but seldom come to ; the sympathies of <br />
the majority in the Federal Parliament will <br />
be against us ; I see in this the prospect of <br />
a position which may prove to be a most <br />
dangerous one for us; if the <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">strife</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>should <br />
commence, no one can tell when it will end. <br />
DR. BEAUBIEN—I have conﬁdence in <br />
the conscience of the Federal Parliament. <br />
We ought not to attribute evil intentions to <br />
men, but rather suppose that they will treat <br />
us as they desire to be treated themselves, <br />
with justice, and in a <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">conscientious</span><span style="background-color: white;"> manner. </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> MR. JOLY</span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">—Despite</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>the honorable mem- <br />
ber's sermon—I beg his pardon, I mean <br />
despite the honorable member’s observation— <br />
I am of opinion that we ought not to leave <br />
interests so precious as those which are con- <br />
ﬁded to us to the mercy <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span><span style="background-color: white;"> men with whom </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> we are not always certain of
living on good </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> terms, without any other
guarantee than </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> their conscience.
Confederation, by changing </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> the state of things which
established harmony </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> between the English and French
races in </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> Lower Canada, will destroy that
harmony, </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> and the consequences may be
only too easily </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> foreseen. In Upper Canada there
is </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">much</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;"> more homogeneity, and, by </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequence,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>the <br />
danger of intestine trouble there is much less <br />
great ; true it is, that the enormous power of <br />
the Orangemen and the law respecting sepa-<br />
r<span style="background-color: white;">ate schools may give rise to difficulties, but </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
I fear more for the relations of Upper Canada</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
with the other provinces, and especially the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Atlantic Provinces. Upper Canada objects, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
