<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Hoche- <br />
laga (Hon. Mr. DORION) asserted that we <br />
had advocated this measure merely as a <br />
means of remedying the ﬁnancial injustice <br />
of which we complained. That was not the <br />
case. It is quite true that we urged very <br />
strongly—and I am not prepared at this <br />
moment to withdraw a single statement I <br />
have made with reference to that—we urged <br />
very strongly the injustice of the position <br />
in which we were placed, in contributing <br />
largely to the public revenue, and ﬁnding <br />
that that revenue was expended without due <br />
consideration being given to that part of the <br />
country which cont<span style="background-color: white;">ributed most heavily </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
towards it. But, at the same time, we felt </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
that we were treated unjustly in another </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
respect. We felt that it was not fair—that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
it could not be just—that four men in Lower </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Canada should be equal, politically, to ﬁve </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
men in Upper Canada. We complained </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
that our laws were framed by an eastern </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
majority, in spite of our protestations. It </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
was this which aggrieved us much more </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
deeply than the mere loss of a certain sum </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of money. (Hear, hear.) Up to the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
beginning of 1862 the agitation for a redress </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of this grievance had been carried on </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
throughout the whole of Western Canada ; </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
and I am convinced that at that time there </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
was not an individual who could appear in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
public in Canada West, and take any share </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
in the public discussions of the day, with </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
any chance of getting a favorable hearing, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
unless he asserted that he was in favor ot </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
representation by population. </span><br style="background-color: white;" />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. A. MACKENZIE—The hon. gentle- <br />
man could not have taken stronger ground <br />
than that. I shall come to speak presently of <br />
his own Administration. The hon. member <br />
for Hochelaga seemed to think that, because<br />
the people of Canada West conducted their <br />
agitation with a good deal of system and <br />
order, there was nothing very alarming or <br />
dangerous about it. But the hon. gentleman <br />
should have remembered that it is a character- <br />
istic of the British people, that they on all <br />
occasions conduct a political agitation with <br />
due decorum and due respect to the laws, <br />
and that it is not the less serious on that <br />
account. When they have a deep-seated <br />
feeling that injustice is being perpetrated <br />
upon them, they will not sit still under it, <br />
although they will at the same time, while <br />
conducting the agitation against it, respect <br />
the rights of other parties. (Hear, hear.) <br />
I am free to confess that, when I ﬁrst came <br />
into this House, I labored under some slight <br />
misapprehension of the position which the <br />
Lower Canadians occupied towards us of <br />
Western Canada. There is, or there was <br />
then, a popular opinion that the Lower Ca- <br />
nadians were only afraid of representation by <br />
population, because they dreaded that the <br />
people of Canada West would use the larger <br />
power they would thereby obtain for the inju- <br />
ry, if not the destruction, of their religious <br />
institutions. That is entirely an error. I am <br />
convinced that the people of Lower Canada <br />
have no such opinion and no such fear. In <br />
speaking the other day on that subject, the <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. <br />
DORIAN) quoted from a speech of mine deliv- <br />
ered in Toronto a few days before this <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">session</span><span style="background-color: white;">
</span><br />
commenced ; and I do not think the hon. <br />
gentleman shewed his usual candor or fair- <br />
ness in making the representation he did. <br />
He represented me as having stated at that <br />
meeting, that I had abandoned representa- <br />
tion by population, as a thing that was not <br />
advisable, or possible, or something of that <br />
sort. Now what I did say was this :— <br />
