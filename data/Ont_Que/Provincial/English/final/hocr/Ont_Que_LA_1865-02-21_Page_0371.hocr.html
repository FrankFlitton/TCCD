equality, <br />
not wishing to force our views upon them, <br />
but anxious to come to an understanding, <br />
and to extend justice to all. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION—The statement I <br />
made is not denied, that the votes were given <br />
by provinces. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SOLICITOR GEN. LANGEVIN—It <br />
is true ; the Lower Provinces had each one <br />
vote, as had Upper and Lower Canada, and <br />
it is for us a matter for congratulation. I <br />
may be permitted to remind the House, in <br />
connection with this matter, of the saying of <br />
the ﬁrst NAPOLEON to one of his ambassa- <br />
dors, whom he sent to a prince who was <br />
feeble, poor, and without an army—that <br />
prince was the Pope : “Treat with him as if <br />
he had an army of two hundred thousand <br />
men at his back ! ” Now, that is what we <br />
did ; we treated Nova Scotia, New Bruns- <br />
wick and the other provinces as we desired <br />
to be treated ourselves, that is to say, with <br />
justice and consideration, and the result <br />
shews that we were right. The honorable <br />
gentleman ought to have conﬁned himself to <br />
publishing, in his own way, the secrets of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference,</span> and refrain from
divulging <br />
those of the committee appointed last year <br />
with respect to constitutional difﬁculties. I <br />
understood that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everything</span> was
to have <br />
remained secret in that committee, except <br />
the report made to the House. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION—Does the hon. <br />
gentleman accuse me of divulging the secrets <br />
of that committee ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN—The <br />
hon. gentleman stated that the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney</span>
<br />
General (Hon. J. A. MACDONALD) had <br />
constantly acted and voted in that committee <br />
against the Confederation project, and that <br />
now he presents one himself ; and I maintain <br />
that he ought not to have said that, for the <br />
action of the members of the committee <br />
was to have remained secret. If the deliber- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ations</span> of the committee were to
have <br />
remained secret, the hon. gentleman must <br />
see that he is in a difficult position. The <br />
object of that secrecy is evident ; it was the <br />
same object we had in view in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preserving</span>
<br />
secrecy in the proceedings of the Quebec <br />
Conference ; to give increased freedom of <br />
opinion to each member, and not, as has been <br />
said, to deprive the people of information to <br />
which they were entitled. We knew that if <br />
our proceedings were presented day by day <br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> through the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">press,</span> we should <br />
not have enjoyed that liberty of action and <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of discussion which we required. It is
easy <br />
to understand, that during the deliberations, <br />
a member might one day pronounce against <br />
a resolution or some important point, and <br />
that the arguments of another member in a <br />
contrary sense might make him change his <br />
opinion ; but that this might be, it was neces- <br />
sary to be free from all outside inﬂuence, and <br />
therefore it was that the Conference sat with <br />
closed doors. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION—Will the hon. <br />
member allow me to say a few words? He <br />
has stated that I divulged the secrets of the <br />
committee on sectional difficulties. I assert <br />
that I never attended the sittings of that <br />
committee, that I merely went there on the <br />
ﬁrst day to state that I would not take part <br />
in its proceedings, and that I then withdrew <br />
and did not again attend. I was opposed to <br />
the proceedings of that committee, and I did <br />
not attend it ; but I learned that the Hon. <br />
Attorney General voted, on the last day the <br />
committee sat, against Confederation ; and <br />
that was all I stated. So that if the secrets <br />
of the committee have been revealed, it has <br />
not been done by me. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAUCHON.-—The hon. mem- <br />
ber for Hochelaga has quite forgotten what <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed</span> in the committee. He was
present, <br />
with the hon. member for Chateauguay ( Hon. <br />
Mr. HOLTON),<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> at the commencement
of the <br />
proceedings of the committee, when it was <br />
stated and agreed that everything that passed <br />
in the committee was to be kept secret. I <br />
admit that the hon. gentleman refused to <br />
take part in the proceedings of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commit-</span>
<br />
tee, but at the same time he knew perfectly <br />
well that they were to be secret, and he was <br />
bound to respect that secrecy. He was aware <br />
that the representatives of the press had <br />
been excluded. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION.—The hon. gentle- <br />
man is entirely mistaken, for I was not<br />
present. <br />

that not being myself a member of that com- <br />
