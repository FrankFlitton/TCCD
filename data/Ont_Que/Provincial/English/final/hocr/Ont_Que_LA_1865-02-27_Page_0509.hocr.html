<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ing of his book authorities, he had
better mind <br />
what he is about, with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
painful doubt rising <br />
at every turn whether provincial legislation <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> not be overridden by federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation.</span> <br />
His province may well have legislated on what <br />
it holds a local matter, while the Federal Par- <br />
liament may have legislated on it, thinking it <br />
a federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter.</span> Anywhere there
may well <br />
be some bit of federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span>
contradict- <br />
ing something in a local statute. And do our <br />
resolutions say that the federal statute shall <br />
always override the local statute ? No, only <br />
in cases where there is concurrent jurisdic- <br />
tion. And yet our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judge</span> who is
to decide these <br />
nice questions is paid by one power and re- <br />
moveable by that power, and may have his func- <br />
tions taken away and be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persecuted</span>
to the death <br />
by the other. He will have it bad time of it. <br />
Well, Mr. Speaker, I have so far been deal- <br />
ing with matters, nearly all of which may be <br />
said to be general to every part of this great <br />
Confederacy ; but now I must ask the atten- <br />
tion of the House for a few moments, to some <br />
sources of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misunderstanding</span>
which may more <br />
particularly make trouble, unless human na- <br />
ture <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ceases</span> to be human nature
within this <br />
Canada of ours. There are in Canada, and <br />
especially in Lower Canada, the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span>
<br />
of language and faith ; and there is no doubt <br />
that the real <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remains</span> which have
rendered, <br />
or are supposed to have rendered necessary <br />
this plan of a sort of Federal Government, <br />
are referable to this fact. This machinery is <br />
devised, on purpose to meet a possible or pro- <br />
bable clashing of races and creeds in Canada, <br />
and particularly in Lower Canada. Now, in <br />
the United States, when their constitutional <br />
system was adopted, the framers of it must <br />
have foreseen, of course, that controversy <br />
would arise on the subjects of state rights <br />
and slavery. There was a jealousy be- <br />
tween the small states and the large, and <br />
the commencement of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissent</span>
between the <br />
Northern and the Southern States of the re-<br />
public. There was undoubtedly a foresha- <br />
dowing of trouble on the subject of slavery, <br />
though, by the way, slavery was to all ap- <br />
pearance dying out rapidly in the Northern <br />
States, not so rapidly in the Southern. How, <br />
then, did the framers of that Constitution un- <br />
dertake to deal with these foreseen troubles, <br />
these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questions</span> of state rights
and slavery ? <br />
Sir, they did all they possibly could to keep <br />
both out of sight—to bury them—that they <br />
might not rise up in the future to give trou- <br />
ble. It is true that in so doing they but buried <br />
the dragon's teeth, and that these, all buried <br />
as they were, have yet since sprung up, armed <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> men ; but so far as they could, they kept
them <br />
down, kept them from growing, prevented <br />
recognition of them at that time and for long <br />
after. Well, how are we going to carry out <br />
this scheme of ours? Are we burying, or are <br />
we of set choice sowing, our dragon's teeth ? <br />
Are we trying to keep our difﬁculties out of <br />
the way, to bury them out of sight, that we <br />
may smooth our way for, the future <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lessening</span>
<br />
of them? I think not. On the contrary, <br />
we are setting ourselves as deliberately as we <br />
well can to keep up the distinctions and the diff- <br />
erenccs which exist among us, to hold them <br />
constantly in everybody's sight—in the hope, <br />
I suppose, that while everybody is looking at <br />
them intently, somehow or other no one may <br />
see them at all. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span> In
the United <br />
States, be it remembered, they started with <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> their states sovereign and independent.
From<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
that they went into their system of confed- <br />
eration, which was a great improvement; and <br />
from that they went on into their present <br />
federal-national constitution. At each step <br />
they were moving to limit state rights, and <br />
also, indirectly, the extent and influence of <br />
slavery. It is true they did
not altogether <br />
succeed in this policy, but their want of suc- <br />
cess has been mainly owing to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances</span>
<br />
over which they could exercise no control. <br />
We in Canada, for the last twenty-five years, <br />
have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatively</span> united,
and we have <br />
worked that union in a federal spirit. We <br />
complain that, as a result of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this,</span>
the dis- <br />
tinctions which exist among us have become <br />
so prominent—the truth being, that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
<br />
rather this proposed change which is suddenly <br />
bringing them into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">startling</span>
prominence— <br />
we have worked that union, however, I say,<br />
in a federal spirit, and it is said to have <br />
produced or aggravated a certain state of <br />
feud amongst us ; and now, for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpose</span>
<br />
of perpetuating this state of fund, we are <br />
going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> a professcdly
Federal union <br />
which is even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressly</span>
recommended to us, <br />
or to many of us, as meant and calculated to <br />
be so worked as to amount, for all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practical</span>
<br />
purposes, to disunion. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Under</span> it
Lower <br />
Canada has all sorts of special exceptions <br />
made, as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">phrase</span> runs, in her
favor. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> <br />
Legislative Council is to he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">named</span>
in a <br />
peculiar manner, so far as its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span>
from <br />
Lower Canada are concerned. The other <br />
provinces may have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> laws
made uniform, <br />
but an exception in this respect is made for <br />
Lower Canada, and as if to make it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apparent</span>
<br />
that Lower Canadais never to be like the rest<br />
of the Confederation, it is carelully provided <br />
that the General Parliament may make <br />
