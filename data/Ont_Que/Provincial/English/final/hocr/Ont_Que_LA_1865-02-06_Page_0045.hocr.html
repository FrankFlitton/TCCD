well-being,—the present <br />
and future prosperity of British America.— <br />
(Cheers.) &nbsp; It is our privilege and happiness <br />
to be in such a position, and we cannot be <br />
too grateful for the blessings thus conferred <br />
upon us. &nbsp; (Hear, hear.) &nbsp; I must apologize <br />
for having detained you so long— for having <br />
gone perhaps too much into tedious details <br />
with reference to the questions bearing on <br />
the Constitution now submitted to this <br />
House. —(Cries of “ no, no" and “ go
on.”) <br />
—In conclusion, I would again implore the <br />
House not to let this opportunity to pass. <br />
It is an opportunity that may never recur. <br />
At the risk of repeating myself, I would say, <br />
it was only by a happy concurrence of cir- <br />
cumstances, that we were enabled to bring <br />
this great question to its present position. <br />
If we do not take advantage of the time, if we <br />
show ourselves unequal to the occasion, it <br />
may never return, and we shall hereafter <br />
bitterly and unavailingly regret having failed <br />
to embrace the happy opportunity now <br />
offered of founding a great nation under the <br />
fostering care of Great Britain, and our <br />
Sovereign Lady, Queen Victoria. &nbsp; (Loud <br />
cheers, amidst which the honorable gentle- <br />
man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resumed</span>
his seat). <br />
The House, at eleven, P.M., adjourned. <br />

said that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yester-</span>
<br />
day he had promised to give to the House <br />
to-day an explanation of the provision con- <br />
tained in the 14th resolution relating to the <br />
selection of members for the Legislative <br />
Council of the General Legislature. This <br />
resolution read as follows :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> l4. &nbsp;The
ﬁrst selection of the Members of the <br />
Legislative Council shall be made, except as re- <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a sufficient</span>

ling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to serve ;</span>
such Members shall be appointed <br />
by the Crown at the recommendation of the <br />

nation of the respective Local Governments, and<br />
in such nomination due regard shall be had to <br />
the claims of the Members of the Legislative <br />
Council of the Opposition in each Province, so <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> parties may

should the Confederation <br />
scheme be adopted, come from the existing <br />
Government of this province. &nbsp; In making <br />
such recommendations, the spirit of the reso- <br />
lution would be carefully observed, and both <br />
sides in this House and as well life as elected <br />
members, be equally considered and fairly re- <br />
presented in the new Parliament. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR.FLINT begged
to inquire whether <br />
the resolutions before House were in all <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respects</span> the
same as those sent to the members. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. CAMPBELL said
they were not <br />
in one particular precisely as ﬁrst printed, <br />
there being a clause in those before the House <br />
to allow New Brunswick to impose a duty on <br />
timber and logs, and Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia</span>
on coal, <br />
which was not found in the ﬁrst ; as for the <br />
other provinces, the imposition of such duties <br />
was reserved to the General Legislature. <br />
(Hear, hear, from Mr. CURRIE.) <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR.CAMPBELL</span> said he
hoped that <br />
honorable members would rather aid in f urther- <br />
ing the scheme than take pleasure in detect- <br />
ing the supposed causes of opposition. &nbsp;(Hear.) <br />
HON. MR. CURRIE <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked
whether the dif-</span> <br />
ference between the two sets of resolutions <br />
was merely a misprint. <br />
HON. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR.</span>
CAMPBELL could not say <br />
whether it was owing to a misprint or to an <br />
error in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manuscript.</span>
<br />
HON. MR. CURRIE again asked whether <br />
the members of the Conference had not signed <br />
the instrument containing its resolutions ? <br />
HON. MR. CAMPBELL could only say that <br />
the resolutions now before the House truly <br />
and expressly represented the conclusions the <br />
Conference <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span>
arrived at. &nbsp; (Hear, hear.) <br />
Those conclusions had not been changed. <br />
HON. MR. CURRIE then rose and said <br />
that the measure now before the House was <br />
the most important one ever submitted to a <br />
Colonial Legislature, and he hoped to be able <br />
to approach it with entire freedom from party&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> <br />
spirit, and without the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpose</span>
of ﬁnding out <br />
unnecessary objections. &nbsp; He hoped he would, <br />
at all times, be able to judge of the measures <br />
presented with the fairness and candour of a <br />
Canadian and a British subject. &nbsp; At the out- <br />
set he would, however, say, that the project <br />
now before the House had taken the country <br />
by surprise. &nbsp; The ﬁrst time he had ever ad- <br />
dressed the House&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span>
was reported to have <br />
spoken thus :—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span><br />
