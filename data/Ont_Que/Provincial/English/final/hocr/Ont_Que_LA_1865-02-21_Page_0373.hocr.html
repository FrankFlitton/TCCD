<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">are at the present time. But they will be <br />
better protected under the proposed system, <br />
and that again is one of the strongest reasons <br />
in favor of Confederation. Not only indeed <br />
did we assure ourselves of that protection, <br />
but the provinces who were parties to the <br />
Confederation desired it also. All local <br />
interests will be submitted and left to the de- <br />
cision of the local legislatures. There will <br />
be other exceptions with respect to Lower <br />
Canada, and, in fact, all the exceptions in <br />
the scheme of Confederation are in favor of <br />
Lower Canada. These restrictions in favor <br />
of Lower Canada were obtained by the <br />
delegates from that province ; but they seek <br />
no thanks for their conduct, as they con- <br />
sider that in so doing they only performed <br />
a duty—a duty incumbent on all true patriots <br />
and good citizens. All that they now come <br />
to this House and ask for, is its sanction <br />
to the measure which ensures these privi- <br />
leges to the populations which they repre- <br />
sent. I may add that, under Confederation, <br />
all questions relating to the colonization<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
of our <br />
wild lands, and the disposition and sale of <br />
those same lands, our civil laws and all <br />
measures of a local nature—in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact</span>
every- <br />
thing which concerns and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affects</span>
those in- <br />
terests which are most dear to us as a <br />
people, will be reserved for the action of <br />
our local legislature ; all our charitable and <br />
other institutions will be protected by the <br />
same authority. There is also the question <br />
of education. Upon this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span>
as upon all <br />
others, the Lower Canadian delegates have <br />
seen to the preservation of certain privileges, <br />
and that question has been left to our Local <br />
Legislature, so that the Federal Legislature <br />
shall not be able to interfere with it. It has <br />
been said that with respect to agriculture the <br />
power of legislation would be exercised con- <br />
currently by the Federal Legislature and the <br />
local legislatures. But the House is perfectly <br />
well aware for what reason that concurrent <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> was allowed. Every one,
indeed, is <br />
aware that certain general interests may arise <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respecting,</span> which the
intervention of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Central</span> Legislature may be
necessary ; but, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. SPEAKER</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> all interests relating to local <br />
agriculture, everything connected with our <br />
land will be left under the control of our <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span> Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature,</span> and this is a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point</span> upon which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">invariably insisted, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which was never denied us in the
Conference. <br />
It is thus clear that under Confederation as <br />
proposed,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> the inhabitants of distant
parts of <br />
the Confederacy, having the privilege of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laying</span> their claims before their
respective <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> local legislatures, will not be put to the great<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
trouble of betaking themselves to the central <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
seat of government, when, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instance,</span>
they <br />
wish to obtain authority to build a bridge or <br />
open a road. I now come, Mr. SPEAKER, to <br />
the subject of the details of the measure, and <br />
I shall reply to the observation of the honor- <br />
able member for Hochelaga on that subject. <br />
That honorable gentleman objects to the <br />
appointment of the legislative councillors <br />
by the Central Government, and adds that <br />
those councillors will be appointed by a Tory <br />
government, and will necessarily be selected <br />
from among the tories. In making that <br />
assertion the honorable member did not act <br />
with that frankness which we are entitled to <br />
expect from him. (Hear, hear.) He hardly <br />
alluded, if he did so at all, to the clause <br />
in the resolutions by which the opposition, <br />
in the different parts of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span>
<br />
are protected. In that clause it is provided <br />
that the Central Parliament, in making <br />
the appointments in question, shall be <br />
careful to watch over the interests of the Op- <br />
position, as well as over those of the Ministerial <br />
party. Now, Mr. SPEAKER, when a govern- <br />
ment binds itself in this way, is it reasonable <br />
and fair to believe or to suppose that it will <br />
break its word which has been so solemnly <br />
pledged ? For my part, I am convinced that <br />
the members of the present Government, <br />
should they form part of the Central Gov- <br />
ernment, would fulﬁl what has been promised, <br />
and would watch over the rights of the Opp- <br />
sition as over those of the other party. The <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga also pre- <br />
tended that the Maritime Provinces had <br />
forced upon us the clause which provides <br />
that the legislative councillors in the Gen- <br />
eral Parliament shall be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed</span>
by the <br />
Crown. Yet, the honorable member right <br />
well knows that the elective principle in <br />
our existing Legislative Council was mere- <br />
ly an experiment, and that in Lower Ca- <br />
nada we have become tired of the system, <br />
not because the councillors who have been <br />
elected by the people are unworthy of the <br />
position which they occupy, or because their <br />
selection was an unfortunate selection, but <br />
because the very nature of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span>
prevents <br />
a large number of men of talent, of men <br />
qualiﬁed in every respect and worthy to sit in <br />
the Legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council,</span> from
presenting them-&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
selves for the suffrages of the electors, in con- <br />
sequence of the trouble, the fatigue and enor- <br />
mous expense <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resulting</span> from
these electoral <br />
contests in enormous divisions. We know <br />
that the system has wearied Lower Canada, <br />
