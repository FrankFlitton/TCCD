<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> unanimous in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supporting</span> the scheme of Con- <br />
federation, being convinced that it is the only <br />
sortie from our present political troubles, and <br />
of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continuing</span> under the
British Crown, <br />
knowing well the liberty that all subjects en- <br />

if ever <br />
ﬂie day comes to defend the British ﬂag <br />
on this soil, while a shred is left on the <br />
staff they will be there to defend it. Being <br />
an elected member of this,House, who by <br />
this scheme may be offered a seat for life, <br />
beg to say that I care little for the chance; <br />
but I have been congratulated by my consti- <br />
tuents, on all sides, upon the prospect before <br />
me, and if I vote for the measure as it stands <br />
I shall not, therefore, in any way displease <br />
them. Although I voted for rendering this <br />
House elective, in 1856, yet I did so, contrary <br />
to my Own convictions, for the sole purpose <br />
of sustaining the Government, believing that <br />
this House should be a conservative body. I <br />
consider that this should be a special branch, <br />
where we should judge measures without re- <br />
ference to popular prejudices, if such a <br />
thing were possible. I think we are here to <br />
judge without that political partiality which <br />
actuates most of the members of the Lower <br />
House, some of whom got their seats by a <br />
majority of one. I am sure persons elected <br />
in that manner can hardly claim to represent <br />
the popular feeling of the country. For my <br />
part, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intend</span> to vote for these
resolutions, <br />
for it becomes a matter of choice with us <br />
either to support them and thus become one <br />
strong Confederacy, or else by driblets into <br />
the American Union. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(</span>Hear,
hear.) I am <br />
fully convinced that we are tending rapidly <br />
towards annexation, and that the only thing <br />
that can save us is the formation of a strong <br />
Confederacy. And if that is not done imme- <br />
diately, I ﬁrmly believe that we shall let the <br />
golden opportunity slip, and will not again <br />
have the opportunity. Honorable gentlemen <br />
say that our debt will be rapidly increased <br />
under Confederation. Well, that is hard to <br />
say, but I think it quite likely it may in- <br />
crease slightly. But what would be our debt <br />
if we were annexed to the United States? <br />
What would our taxes be if we had a propor- <br />
tion of the enormous war debt of that country <br />
to pay, in addition to our own? For my <br />
part, believing as I do that this is the only <br />
hope of the country, and the present the only <br />
opportunity we shall have of carrying it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through—and</span> so far as I know it
is the only <br />
one—I should feel myself unworthy the posi- <br />
tion I hold if I did not vote in favor of it. <br />
It is the only practicable scheme that has <br />

the <br />
difficulties that have aﬁieted the country. <br />
For the past ten years, during which I have <br />
had the honor of being a representative of the <br />
people, there has always been a running fight <br />
between the ins and outs—ﬁrst one side and <br />
then the other, contending for office, and the <br />
result has been anything but satisfactory to <br />
the country. I think if honorable members <br />
would take an impartial view of this question, <br />
and consider that we cannot alter the details, <br />
if we desired to do so, without defeating the <br />
whole, they would not hesitate to vote for it. <br />
As I understand it, the details in reference to <br />
the formation of our own local governments <br />
will be brought before us, and we shall <br />
then have ample opportunity of considering <br />
and amending them if we think it necessary. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. REESOR—I do not wish to <br />
make any lengthened remarks; but there are <br />
one or two points to which I wish to call the <br />
attention of the House before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vote</span>
is <br />
taken. (Cries of “Question,” “question!") If <br />
I am out of order, I will take my seat. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. REESOR— I wish to call the <br />
attention of the House to the opinion of the <br />
celebrated author quoted by my honorable <br />
friend from Victoria Division (Hon. Mr. <br />
RYAN). My honorable friend quoted some <br />
part of a work by Mr. JOHN STUART <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MILLS,</span>
<br />
a celebrated writer on Representative Govern- <br />
ment, but he did not go far enough. Mr. <br />
MILLS says:— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The consideration which tells most in my <br />
judgment in favor of two Chambers (and this <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> do regard as of some moment), is the evil
effect <br />
produced upon the mind of any holder of power, <br />
whether an individual or an assembly, by the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consciousness of</span> having only
themselves to con- <br />
sult. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> This is perfectly true. But what does my <br />
honorable friend advocate ? He advocates <br />
that the whole power shall be concentrated in <br />
the General Government; that they shall <br />
have the power to create this House, so that <br />
the whole power shall be legally centred in <br />
“one body.” The writer he quoted goes on <br />
and condemns that principle in the following <br />
words:—<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If the writings by which reputation has
been <br />
gained are unconnected with politics, they are <br />
no evidence of the special qualities required, <br />
while, if political, they would enable successive <br />
ministries to deluge the House with party tools. <br />
