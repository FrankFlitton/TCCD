               If the House will <br /> bear with me, Mr. SPEAKER, I would ask <br /> hon. members
               to consider for a moment the <br /> extent of the territory there possessed. An
               <br /> American writer, who estimates it at <br /> 2,500,000 square miles, puts it in

               <br /> have quoted. Then glance for a moment <br /> at the Saskatchewan, the
               Assiniboine and <br /> the Red River country, with the Red River <br /> settlement of
               10,000 people, forming the <br /> nucleus for a future province—a nucleus <br />
               around which immigration could be drawn <br /> so as to build up in that distant
               region a <br /> powerful section of the Confederation. It <br /> is a country which

               country on its aﬁuent, the <br /> Assiniboine, as “a paradise of fertility.” <br />
               He could speak of it in no other terms <br /> “ than of astonishment and admiration.”

               desire now <br /> to place before the House the extent of the <br /> territory we
               possess in the Atlantic and <br /> Paciﬁc Provinces. The Atlantic Provinces <br />
               comprise Canada East, with an area of <br /> 201,989 square miles; Canada West, 148,-
               <br /> 832; New Brunswick, 27,700; Nova Scotia, <br /> 18,746 ; Prince Edward Island,
               2,134; <br /> Newfoundland, 35,913—together 435,314 <br /> square miles, to which add
               the territory of <br /> Labrador, 5,000 miles, making a grand total <br /> of <span
                  class="lowConfidenceOcr">440,314</span> square miles, embracing a popu- <br />
               lation of something like 4,000,000 of souls. <br /> The Paciﬁc Provinces are British
               Columbia, <br /> containing 200,000 square miles, and Van- <br /> couver’s Island,
               with 12,000 square miles; <br /> and there is the territory of Hudson’s Bay <br />
               (including Central British North America), <br /> with 2,700,000 square miles. (Hear,
               hear.) <br /> I desire now, sir, to thank the House for <br /> the patience with
               which hon. members have <br /> listened to my remarks. I rose at a late <br /> hour
               in the evening, and seeing that the <br /> House was wearied when I commenced, I
