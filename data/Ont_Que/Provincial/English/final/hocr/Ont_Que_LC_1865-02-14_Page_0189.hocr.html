in com- <br />

And, with respect to the constitution of the <br />
local governments, are we, in case the Upper <br />
Canada majority choose to impose their ideas <br />
upon us, are we, I say, to submit to them ? <br />
Such a proceeding would not be fair either to <br />
us or to the country. The hon. member (Hon. <br />
Sir N. F. <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">BELLEAU)</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>tells us that we were not <br />
sincere in asking for an appeal to the people, <br />
because we knew that dissolution would not <br />
reach us. Such expressions do not surprise <br />
me, proceeding as they do from a man who <br />
never had the honor to be the elected repre- <br />
sentative of the people, and who holds his <br />
seat by the favor of the Crown, but I fail to <br />
discover by what right he judges us in such <br />
a manner. In conclusion, I shall move the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. OLIVIER —Before proceed- <br />
ing to a vote, I will ask the hon. member <br />
(Hon. Sir N. F. BELLEAU) who proposed <br />
to my honorable friend (Hon. Mr. LETEL- <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">LIER)</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>and myself to resign our
seats if we <br />
did not now choose to vote for Confedera- <br />

serious in their objections they might resign <br />

by presenting themselves for reelection. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. OLIVIER—I understand the <br />
object of the hon. member in giving that <br />
advice. He would wish to see us retire <br />
from the House during the contest ; but that <br />
is a trap into which we will not fall. Sur- <br />
prise must have been excited that I did <br />
not correct all the inaccuracies of the hon. <br />
member when he spoke of what I had <br />
said ; but I preferred not doing so, as I <br />
should have had to take up nearly every <br />
single word of his in order to correct it, <br />
as he distorted and altered the sense of <br />
nearly everything that I said. I conceive <br />
that a blush must have mantled his forehead <br />
as he concluded his speech. <br />
