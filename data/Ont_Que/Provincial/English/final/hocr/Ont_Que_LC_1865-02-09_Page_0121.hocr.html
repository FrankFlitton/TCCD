<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> though it might claim to be foremost in
es- <br />
tablishing precedents—especially as with the <br />
addition of the Lower Provinces we are told <br />
we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> be the third largest
nation in the <br />
world—(hear, hear, and laughter)—since for <br />
a long series of years the demand had been <br />
made the people. They persisted against <br />
many discouragements, and the reform con- <br />
stituted one of the famous ninety-two resolu- <br />
tions of the constitutional in Lower <br />
Canada, until with other reforms it was at last <br />
conceded and consummated. When the sub- <br />
ject was under discussion, objections were <br />
made and fears expressed that there might <br />
be a feeling among the members, who came <br />
from the to claim the right to ori- <br />
ginate money ills, and that an antagonism <br />
would thus arise between the two branches, <br />
but no such conﬂict of opinion had ever hap- <br />
and the Constitution had worked as <br />
heretofore. The infusion of the elective <br />
element was made gradually with the view of <br />
anticipating such a result, and the effect was <br />
attained, for there had been no clashing of <br />
interests. The elective principle had been <br />
applied to the Legislative Council of Prince <br />
Edward Island, and he would ask, how, <br />
under the 14th resolution of the Confeder- <br />
ation, that body was to be dealt with? He <br />
would read that part of the resolution to which <br />
he referred — “ The ﬁrst selection of the <br />
members of the Legislative Council to be <br />
made from the Legislative Councils of the <br />
various provinces, except as regards Prince <br />
Edward Island, &amp;c. What did this mean? <br />
Were the members from Prince Edward <br />
Island still to be elected ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—No; they were <br />
to be appointed. The resolution was so worded <br />
as not to limit the selection in Prince Edward <br />
Island to the Legislative Council now in ex- <br />
istence there. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. SANBORN—Was it because <br />
the elective principle had worked so badly in <br />
Canada that this change is proposed? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—No; and there- <br />
fore in Canada the selection was to be made <br />
from the House itself. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. SANBORN—It appeared then, <br />
that Prince Edward Island, dissatisfied with <br />
the elective principle, had dictated terms, and <br />
Canada had yielded to the dictation. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—The Confer- <br />
ence had yielded to Prince Edward Island <br />
only in respect of its own members. They <br />
were so dissatisfied with their Legislative <br />
Council that, with reference to themselves, <br />
a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">choice from the people at large was
permit- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ted, but this had no reference whatever
to <br />
Canada. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. SANBORN — Suppose the <br />
elective members should be swept off, what <br />
became of the people’s right of representation <br />
by men of their own choice? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—No such thing <br />
was intended. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. SANBORN said he had only <br />
put the case hypothetically, but had been <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> glad to learn the reasons which had led
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> to resolve upon the
abandonment of <br />
the elective principle in respect of the Legis- <br />
lative Council. Canada, however, did not do- <br />
serve to be used in this way. He would now <br />
ask whether the representatives of Canada in <br />
the Conference had any warrant from the <br />
country to justify their action? They had <br />
none whatever. If they had not acted under <br />
the dictation of Prince Edward Island, they <br />
had acted on their own motion, and without <br />
authority of any kind. The conclusion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
<br />
legitimate and logical. The position they <br />
had assumed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was exceptional</span> and
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distasteful</span>.<br />
Coming to the proposal to amend the resolu- <br />
tions, he would say there existed no reason <br />
why the House, if it thought proper, could <br />
not change them in any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular.</span>
He wil- <br />
lingly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admitted</span> that they were
in the nature <br />
of a treaty, and we must accept them, if ac- <br />
cepted at all, so that their essential character <br />
should not be impaired; but when they were <br />
presented to us, we were bound to decide <br />
whether they were what we wanted or not. <br />
If they were so in the main, there was no <br />
necessity for taking exceptions which would <br />
affect our relations with the other provinces, <br />
but they might be modified and changed in <br />
so far as Canada was concerned, and the other <br />
provinces would have no cause of complaint. <br />
What interest had they in the manner of our <br />
choosing our own representatives? All they <br />
had a right to say in the matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was that</span>
we <br />
should not have more than two-thirds of the <br />
whole number. There was a way of putting <br />
things so as to frighten and convince waver- <br />
ing minds; but he would ask the House to <br />
sift this matter to the bottom—to look at the <br />
reason of things—and to say if his amend- <br />
ment were adopted, which maintained intact <br />
the principle of representation laid down in <br />
the resolutions—only retaining the mode of <br />
choosing the members—the modification could <br />
lead to harm or to anything else than what <br />
had already been declared, viz., that the Im- <br />
perial Parliament might take the scheme with <br />
the amendment under consideration, and act <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />upon said amendment. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CARDWELL</span>
