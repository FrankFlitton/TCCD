<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and that a great portion of the people of
<br />
Great Britain are very anxious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span>
this <br />
measure, and that the press of that country <br />
generally approves of it. But, when they <br />
rightly understand it—when parties holding <br />
our provincial securities know that Con- <br />
federation means more debt, more taxation, <br />
and a worse public credit—we will have <br />
another cry coming from across the Atlantic. <br />
And when British manufacturers know that <br />
Confederation means a higher tariff on <br />
British goods, we shall have different views <br />
from them also, crossing the Atlantic. (Hear, <br />
hear.)  Hon. gentlemen, when I left my <br />
constituency, I had little idea that this <br />
measure was going to be pressed upon the <br />
country in the manner in which I see the <br />
Government of the day are attempting to <br />
press it. I think we should pause before <br />
adopting these resolutions. I think we want <br />
some more information before we adopt <br />
them. Before we vote away our local con- <br />
stitutions—before we vote away in fact our <br />
whole Constitution—we should know some- <br />
thing of what we are going to get in place <br />
of what we are giving away.  Did any hon. <br />
gentleman suppose, before he left his home, <br />
that we would not have the whole scheme <br />
of Confederation brought down to us, and be <br />
asked to pass a judgment on it, or to con- <br />
sider it at all events as a whole scheme? I <br />
think we ought to be cautious in taking <br />
half a measure until we know what is the <br />
whole of it.  (Hear, hear.)  Hon. gentle- <br />
men will remember the caution with which <br />
the Parliament of England proceeded, in <br />
1839, when dealing with the rights of the <br />
people of Canada. At that time there was <br />
an urgent necessity for a new Constitution <br />
for the people of Canada, and a great neces- <br />
sity for it, particularly in the eastern pro- <br />
vince. When the Government of the day <br />
brought down their resolutions—in some- <br />
thing like the same shape as those now <br />
before the House—resolutions embodying <br />
the principle of a Legislative Union—the <br />
leader of the opposition, Lord STANLEY, <br />
claimed that the whole measure should be <br />
brought down ; and the Government of the <br />
day was actually compelled, by the force of <br />
public opinion in and out of Parliament, to <br />
withdraw the resolutions, and to bring down <br />
their entire measure.  <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span>
hear.) And <br />
are we to be less careful of our own consti- <br />
tutional rights —are we to guard more <br />
loosely the interests of ourselves and those <br />
who are to come after us—than the people <br />

lutions to pledge our province—to what ?<br />
To build the Intercolonial Railway,
without <br />
knowing, as I stated the other day, where <br />
it is to run, or what it is to cost. Why do <br />
we not have the report of the able engineer <br />
sent to survey and report upon that work ? <br />
Why is it delayed ? Why is it attempted to <br />
hurry this measure through the Legislature,<br />

we are in the dark with reference to<br />
that great undertaking? It may be that it

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—My hon. friend <br />
is going too far. The report has not yet been <br />
made, and, that being the case, it is some- <br />
what extraordinary to charge the Government <br />
with keeping it back. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—Certainly ; I think <br />
the case is bad enough, when the Govern- <br />
ment are charged merely with what they <br />
have done.&nbsp; And I have no desire to make <br />
an incorrect statement.&nbsp; But I will put it in <br />
this way : I think we have good reason to be <br />
surprised, that the Government should come <br />
down with their scheme, and submit it to <br />
the House, before they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span>
themselves know <br />
what the work is to cost—(hear, hear)——and <br />
ask this House and the country to pledge <br />
themselves to the construction of a work of <br />
which they do not even know the cost them- <br />
selves. (Hear, hear.) But, if the report has <br />
not been prepared, we have been told in the <br />
public prints that the survey is either <br />
ﬁnished, or very nearly ﬁnished. The report, <br />
therefore, can soon be furnished ; and, why <br />
should there be so much hurry and anxiety <br />
to pass these resolutions before we get it ? <br />
Then, again, why do the Government not <br />
bring down those School Bills which have <br />
been promised? Why are the people, or why <br />
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament,</span> to have no
opportunity of pass- <br />
ing judgment upon those measures—the <br />
School Bill for Upper Canada, and the School <br />
Bill for Lower Canada—before this Confeder- <br />
ation scheme is adopted ? I cannot see the <br />
propriety of keeping back these matters; and <br />
I do not think the members of the Govern- <br />
ment can show any reason whatever why <br />
they should not be settled at once. Then, <br />
hon. gentlemen, we should know something <br />
about the division of the public debt. If <br />
hon. gentlemen will take up the Public <br />
Accounts placed in their hands during the<br />
present session, they will ﬁnd a
statement of <br />
