was <br />
declared late in autumn, at the close<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
of navi- <br />
gation—with the little means we have here of <br />
defending ourselves, we would be placed for <br />
ﬁve months in a very disagreeable and trying <br />
position, having no opportunity of obtaining <br />
the powerful succour of the Mother Country. <br />
(Hear, hear.) That must be so easily under- <br />
stood, that I shall make no further remark <br />
upon it. But, my statement about the pro- <br />
vines being placed upon an inclined plane may <br />
require some little comment and explanation. <br />
I say that, if we do not cultivate with our <br />
sister provinces—the Maritime Provinces—a <br />
close commercial, political, and social inter- <br />
course—being all of us British subjects, all <br />
of us monarchists, owing allegiance to the <br />
same Crown—if we neglect the cultivation of <br />
that intercourse, we run a great danger. We <br />
are, in our present position, small, isolated <br />
bodies, and it may probably be with us, as <br />
in the physical world, where a large body <br />
attracts to itself the smaller bodies within the <br />
sphere of its inﬂuence. If we do not make <br />
those alliances with the Lower Provinces—if <br />
we do not open with them those communica- <br />
tions, political, social, and commercial, which <br />
are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">essential</span> for our own
interest, we shall <br />
little by little lose some of those principles <br />
we now esteem so much; we shall lose little by <br />
little our attachment to the Mother Country, <br />
and the interesting reminiscences which, with <br />
many of us, now give intensity to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attach-</span>
<br />
ment; and we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">become—you</span>
may depend <br />
upon it, hon. gentlemen—more and more de- <br />
mocratised, before we are aware of it. (Hear, <br />
hear.) And really, hon. gentlemen, if I <br />
were to form my opinion by some of the <br />
speeches which we have heard in this Honor- <br />
able House since this debate was opened, I <br />
think there are some hon. gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who,</span>
<br />
from the way in which they have expressed <br />
themselves, might be supposed to be—although <br />
I hope in reality they are not—already half <br />
way down the inclined plane. (Hear, hear <br />
and laughter.) Well, hon. gentlemen, I say <br />
that if we want to avoid that, we must have <br />
a Federal union with our fellow-subjects of <br />
the British Provinces, and that besides we <br />
must have easy means of access to the sea- <br />
board, so that, in case of danger, help can <br />
be immediately forwarded to Canada and to all <br />
parts of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span> union, and
that we may <br />
have a powerful army of Great Britain coming <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> here as an auxiliary to the defence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which I</span> <br />
hope we shall be able to make ourselves. <br />

stated that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressed myself</span> to
the effect <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> that, if this Confederation did not take
place, <br />
Canada could not become prosperous. I never <br />
said anything of the kind. I said expressly <br />
the contrary. Perhaps I may not precisely <br />
apprehend the meaning of the word “pros- <br />
perous.” But I said this, that Canada had <br />
within itself all the means to become popul- <br />
ous, to become wealthy, to become a great <br />people. But on the other hand, I said that <br />
Canada and the other British American Pro- <br />
vinces, without union, could not become a <br />
“powerful,” as distinguished from a pros- <br />
perous people. I said that we in Canada <br />
could not become a powerful people unless we <br />
had some maritime elements, unless we had <br />
the means, by having harbors and ports of <br />
our own open at all seasons, of communicating <br />
freely with all the nations of the world. <br />
(Hear, hear.) That is what I said. I never <br />
stated that Canada could not become prosper- <br />
ous, make money, and so forth. No; I think <br />
Canada can do that; but Canada, even though <br />
its population should reach forty millions— <br />
which it may in a century <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hence</span>—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span>
never <br />
be a powerful nation, unless its power is felt <br />
all over the world; and how can its power he <br />
so felt, unless it has its seaports open all the <br />
year round? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) And I
said— <br />
“Point out to me the nation in this world <br />
which is powerful, that has not some maritime <br />
elements.” I say there is no one in the <br />
world. Every nation whose power has been <br />
felt over the globe, has been a nation that <br />
had some maritime outlet. But Canada, <br />
situated as it is, is in great want of free ac- <br />
cess to the sea; and, as long as we are shut <br />
up, during ﬁve months of the year. without <br />
being able to communicate with the rest of <br />
the world—for, notwithstanding our ﬁne <br />
river, we cannot be said to have a real mari- <br />
time element—we are in truth a dependent <br />
people. (Hear, hear.) I have some notes in <br />
French, made with the intention of answering <br />
honorable gentlemen who spoke in that lan- <br />
guage; but I think, having commenced, that <br />
will go on in English. It has been asked by <br />
several honorable gentlemen how we were to <br />
make provision for the protection of the min- <br />
orities in Upper and Lower Canada respec- <br />
tively. We have in Upper Canada a Catho- <br />
lic minority, in Lower Canada a Protestant <br />
minority. Well, those minorities are now in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possession</span> of certain rights; and,
if we were <br />
not to legislate at all upon those rights, my <br />
interpretation of the scheme is, that they <br />
would still, under the local governments, en- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">joy</span> the rights which they now
possess. But <br />
it has been provided that, if necessary, addi- <br />
