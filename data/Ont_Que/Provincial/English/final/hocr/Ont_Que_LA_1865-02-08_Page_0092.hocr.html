<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> that must surround any measure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parlia</span>- <br />
mentary reform for Canada that could possi- <br />
bly be devised. (Cheers.) Will honorable <br />
gentlemen who spend their energies in hunt- <br />
ing out blemishes in this scheme, remember <br />
for a moment the utter injustice of the one <br />
we have at present? Public opinion has made <br />
rapid strides in the last six months on the rep- <br />
resentation question,—but think what it was <br />
a week before the present coalition was formed! <br />
Remember how short a time has elapsed since <br />
the member for Peel (Hon. Mr. J. HILLYARD <br />
CAMERON) proposed to grant one additional <br />
member to Upper Canada, and could not carry <br />
even that. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Remember</span> that but a
few weeks <br />
ago the hon. member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. <br />
DORION), who now leads the crusade against <br />
this measure, publicly declared that five or six <br />
additional members was all Upper Canada was <br />
entitled to, and that with these the Upper Cana- <br />
dians would be content for many years to come. <br />
(Hear, hear.) And when he has reﬂected on <br />
all this, let the man who is disposed to carp <br />
at this great measure of representative reform, <br />
justify his conduct, if he can, to the thousands <br />
of disfranchised freeholders of Upper Canada <br />
demanding justice at our hands. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span>
<br />
For myself, sir, I unhesitatingly say, that the <br />
complete justice which this measure secures, <br />
to the people of Upper Canada in the vital <br />
matter of arliamentary representation alone, <br />
renders <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> the blemishes
averred against <br />
it utterly contemptible in the balance.— <br />
(Continued cheers.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, the <br />
second feature of this scheme as a remedial <br />
measure is, that it removes, to a large extent, <br />
the injustice of which Upper Canada has com- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plained</span> in financial matters. We
in Upper <br />
Canada have complained that though we paid <br />
into the public treasury more than three- <br />
fourths of the whole revenue, we had less con- <br />
trol over the system of taxation and the ex- <br />
penditure of the public moneys than the <br />
people of Lower Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Well,</span>
sir, the <br />
scheme in your hand remedies that. The <br />
absurd line of separation between the pro- <br />
vinces is swept away for general matters; we <br />
are to have seventeen additional members in <br />
the house that holds the purse; and the tax— <br />
pa ers of the country, wherever they reside, <br />
wil have their just share of inﬂuence over <br />
revenue and expenditure. (Hear, hear.) We <br />
have also complained that immense sums of <br />
public money have been systematically taken <br />
from the public chest for local purposes of <br />
Lower Canada, in which the people of Upper <br />
Canada had no interest whatever, though com-<br />
pelled to contribute three-fourths of the cash.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Well, sir, this scheme remedies that. All
local <br />
matters are to be banished from the General <br />
Legislature; local governments are to have <br />
control over local affairs, and if our friends in <br />
Lower Canada choose to be extravagant, they <br />
will have to bear the burden of it themselves. <br />
(Hear, hear.) No longer shall we have to <br />
complain that one section pays the cash while <br />
the other spends it; hereafter, they who pay <br />
will spend, and they who spend more than they <br />
ought will have to bear the brunt. (Hear, <br />
hear.) It was a great thing to accomplish <br />
this, if we had accomplished nothing more, <br />
—for if we look back on our doings of the last <br />
fifteen years, I think it will be acknowledged <br />
that the greatest jobs perpetrated were of a <br />
local character—that our fiercest contests were <br />
about local matters that stirred up sectional <br />
jealousies and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indignation</span> to its
deepest depth. <br />
(Hear, hear.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> have further
complained <br />
that if a sum was properly demanded for some <br />
legitimate local purpose in one section, an <br />
equivalent sum had to be appropriated to the <br />
other as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offset,—thereby</span>
entailing prodigal <br />
expenditure, and unnecessarily increasing the <br />
public debt. Well, sir, this scheme puts an <br />
end to that. Each province is to determine <br />
for itself its own wants, and to find the money <br />
to meet them from its own resources. (Hear, <br />
hear.) But, sir, I am told that though true <br />
it is that local matters are to be separated and <br />
the burden of local expenditure placed upon <br />
local shoulders, we have made an exception <br />
from that principle in providing that a subsidy <br />
of eighty cents per head shall be taken from <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federal</span> chest and granted to
the local <br />
governments for local purposes. Undoubtedly <br />
this is the fact—and I do not hesitate to admit <br />
that it would have been better if this had been <br />
otherwise. I trust I commit no breach of <br />
discretion in stating that in Conference I was <br />
one of the strongest advocates for defraying <br />
the whole of the local expenditures of the <br />
local governments by means of direct taxa- <br />
tion, and that there were liberal men in all <br />
sections of the provinces who would gladly <br />
have had it so arranged. But, Mr. SPEAKER, <br />
there was one difficulty in the way—a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficult</span>
<br />
which has often before been encountered in this <br />
world—and that difficulty was simply this, it <br />
could not be done. (Hear, and laughter.) We <br />
could neither have carried it in Conference <br />
nor yet in any one of the existing provincial <br />
legislatures. Our friends in Lower Canada, <br />
I am afraid, have a constitutional disinclination <br />
to direct taxation, and it was obvious that if <br />
the Confederation scheme had had attached to <br />
it a provision for the imposition of such
a <br />
