<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> knows or ought to know that it is about <br />
$140. Nevertheless he drew a comparison <br />
showing that while the comparatively poor <br />
people of Canada would have to pay $25 <br />
per head, the rich people of Great Brit- <br />
ain had only $37 to pay. It is very re- <br />
markable, however, that the whole of this <br />
portion of the honorable gentleman’s speech <br />
was omitted from the report given in the <br />
papers next morning. I do not propose to go <br />
into these ﬁgures, but merely to refer to a few <br />
facts to place the assertions made by that <br />
honorable gentleman in their true light before <br />
the House. Our debt is indeed very large, <br />
and we could all wish that it was very much <br />
less than it is, but we have got to bear it and <br />
to pay it, and must do the best we can under <br />
the circumstances. The measure of Con- <br />
federation, in my opinion, will not add to nor <br />
yet lessen it, except what may be incurred for <br />
the construction of the Intercolonial Rail- <br />
way. lt is quite possible, of course, that we <br />
may undertake enormous expenditures for <br />
public works calculated to open up and de- <br />
velope the resources of the country, and thus <br />
soon render our debt much heavier than at pres- <br />
ent, and it will be a question for the Govenment <br />
that may be established after Confederation, <br />
to decide how far it will be wise or prudent to <br />
undertake works of great cost until we shall <br />
have a good surplus in hand. (Hear, hear.) <br />
One of the objections urged by the opponents <br />
of the measure is, that it is being hurried <br />
through too fast—that in a matter of so much <br />
much importance to present and future gener- <br />
ations, more time for consideration should be <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">given.</span><span style="background-color: white;"> We have been discussing
this question </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
for many years in Canada West. Since the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Toronto Convention of 1859, the question has </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
been continuously before the people. It is now </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
nearly a year since it was proposed in some- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
thing like its present shape in this House, and </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
since </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span><span style="background-color: white;"> time the whole of our
newspapers</span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
have been writing upon it continually. We <br />
have nearly 300 newspapers in the country— <br />
and they have been carrying on a constant <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span style="background-color: white;">argument for or against the scheme, until
I </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
do not think it is possible to say or write much </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
more upon the subject with any advantage. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
If the question is not now fully understood, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
I fear it will not be much better understood </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
by any delay that can be now accorded. </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> h</span>ear.) Another objection
raised is, <br />
that a measure of such vast importance ought <br />
not to be carried through without its ﬁrst <br />
being submitted to the people. I have mixed <br />
with the people a good deal, and I have found <br />
the opinion all but universal amongst them, <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> that it was expedient to put the measure
into <br />
practical operation as soon as possible. The <br />
peeple consider it utterly impossible to carry <br />
on the former violent political agitation with<br />
any beneﬁt to the country, and the desire is <br />
general that we should get rid of the present <br />
constitutional difficulties and get settled down <br />
to some quiet and permanent way of manag- <br />
ing our governmental business and political <br />
discussions. (Hear, hear.) The charges that <br />
are made against members of this House about <br />
inconsistency in advocating this measure, are <br />
very easily met. In a country like ours, so <br />
full of change, with a constant agitation going <br />
on for constitutional changes and for new <br />
laws, both local and general, it is utterly im- <br />
possible that a man can remain long in public <br />
life without being open to charges of incon- <br />
sistency ; but if these are caused by a strong <br />
effort to settle the difficulties under which <br />
the country has been laboring, like the present <br />
one, I feel certain that the success of the <br />
measure in hand will render the charges of <br />
only evanescent existence. I think it exceed- <br />
ingly desirable, even for the sake of those <br />
people who might reasonably feel the strongest <br />
objections to it—I mean the English minority <br />
of Lower Canada, and the Catholic minority <br />
of Upper Canada—that it should be settled <br />
at once. So long as the question remains in <br />
its present state, there will be a constant agi- <br />
tation going on, and much injury may be <br />
done by the misrepresentations that will be <br />
indulged in, and the misapprehensions which <br />
will exist ; but if these people can be assured <br />
that the scheme provides a perfect remedy <br />
for any injustice that they might apprehend, <br />
they will immediately concur in it. As regards <br />
the people of Lower Canada of French ori- <br />
gin, and who are Roman Catholics, I have <br />
always heard it said in their favor, that a <br />
large degree of liberalism characterizes their <br />
conduct toward their Protestant neighbors. <br />
(Hear, hear.) Lower Canada, I believe, was <br />
the ﬁrst portion of British territory to give <br />
political freedom to the Jew. I believe that a <br />
person of this persuasion sat in the Lower <br />
Canada Legislature thirty years before the same <br />
privileges were accorded in Great Britain. <br />
People who charged the French Canadians <br />
with intolerance should remember this with <br />
some degree of favor. With regard to the <br />
people of British origin, over the whole <br />
Confederacy, I do not think it is at all <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>to defend them from any
charges<br />
of this kind. I do not think they will be in- <br />
clined to persecute the people of Lower Can- <br />
ada if they had it in their power ; but I ad- <br />
