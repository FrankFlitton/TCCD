<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span style="background-color: white;"> I cannot refrain from saying a word as to
</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the Protestants of Lower Canada, and as to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the liberality evinced towards them by the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
French and Catholic population. It is </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
feared that we may combine together in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
order to treat them unjustly. I may be </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
wrong in referring to the fact, but it is true </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
that the French Canadians have always lived </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
on more cordial terms with the English </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Protestants than with the Irish, who are </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
nevertheless of the same religion, and of the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
same belief as themselves. If this good feel- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ing has always existed, what is there to fear? </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
The hon. member for Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
OLIVIER) has said, that the plan of Con- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
federation was not necessary, and in that he </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
agreed with the hon. member for Grand- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ville (Hon. Mr. LETELLIER). He has stated </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
that it would have been possible to regulate </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the difﬁculties which we have witnessed, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
without having recourse to Confederation, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
from the fact that many of these difﬁculties </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
arose from the hatred existing between cer- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tain individuals. Now, for my part, I do </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
not believe that our political men were </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
actuated by motives of mutual hatred. When </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
I witnessed the struggles which occurred in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the House of Assembly, the votes of want </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of conﬁdence which were proposed, I always </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
felt that </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span><span style="background-color: white;"> who proposed them gave good </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
reasons for so doing. But I was not aware </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of the existence of hatred or personal </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
jealousy between the parties, and that upon </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the removal of such feelings, the difﬁculties </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
might be</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;"> easily overcome. But the
state-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ment is made simply for want of any sound </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
arguments against Confederation. The same </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
hon. member also stated, that the minorities </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
in Upper and Lower Canada wished to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
know the fate reserved for them, before </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
voting for Confederation. If he had reﬂect- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ed a little, he would have learned that the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
fate of the minorities will be deﬁned by the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
law, that their religion is guaranteed by </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
treaties, and that they will be protected by the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
vigilance of the Federal Government, which </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
will </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;">never permit the minority of one
por- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tion of the Confederation to be oppressed </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
by the majority. The hon. member also </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
contends that the local governments ought </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to have larger powers than those proposed </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to be conferred upon them, and that the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Federal Government ought to have fewer </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
powers. To hear him, one cannot help </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
thinking that the experience of history is </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
entirely lost on certain </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">individuals.</span><span style="background-color: white;"> He </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
must have been aware, however, that it is in </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> reference to the rights of particular
states, <br />
that civil war now exists in the United <br />
States; nevertheless, he would implant in <br />
this country the same germ of discord. He <br />
would have more power below and less <br />
authority above. For my part I say the <br />
very contrary, if we wish to have a strong <br />
Government capable of enforcing respect for <br />
its authority when it shall be necessary to <br />
enforce it. The hon. member also stated <br />
that he has no conﬁdence in the exercise of <br />
the powers of the Federal Government, <br />
because it would be surrounded by a clique. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. OLIVIER—I did not say that <br />
would be the case, but that, theoretically, it <br />
might occur, and that if it were surrounded <br />
by a clique, the rights of Lower Canada <br />
would be in danger. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SIR. N. F. BELLEAU—That <br />
makes no difference ; for he stated that he <br />
feared the Government would be surrounded <br />
by a clique. But is it not the national <br />
representation that will surround the Federal <br />
Government? Is that a clique? To say <br />
that our Government is a clique, is to vilify<br />
the institutions of the country. The Govern- <br />
ment will be responsible to the Legislature. <br />
Let us never lose sight of the fact, that our <br />
national representatives will always see that <br />
Lower Canada shall have in the Federal <br />
Government one, or perhaps two, representa- <br />
tives—the number is not of importance. <br />
What is of importance is, that such one, or <br />
such two members, should represent in her <br />
Executive Council the national representa- <br />
tion, which will be composed of 65 members, <br />
in the Federal Legislature. And this, <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
sooth, is called a clique ! I insist somewhat <br />
at length upon this point, because the opera- <br />
tion of the principle of responsible govern- <br />
ment in the Federal Legislature is lost sight <br />
of. I beg to call the attention of Lower <br />
Canada members to this. Suppose it were <br />
proposed to adopt a law in the Federal Legis- <br />
lature calculated to injure Lower Canada, <br />
our 65 representatives in the House of <br />
Commons discuss the law, and decide that <br />
they must oppose it ; they at once commu- <br />
nicate with the members of the Government <br />
representing Lower Canada, and inform them <br />
that they cannot accept the measure, and <br />
that if it be passed, they will coalesce with <br />
the minority, which always exists under <br />
responsible government, and that they will <br />
overthrow the Ministry. Such is the weight <br />
of our inﬂuence in the Federal Government;  <br />
and if this were not lost sight of, there <br />
