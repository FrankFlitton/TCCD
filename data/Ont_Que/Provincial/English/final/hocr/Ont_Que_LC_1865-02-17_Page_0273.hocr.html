<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the liabilities of this province,
certifying the <br />
amount to be no less than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$77,203,282.</span>
Now <br />
it is well known that Canada is only allowed <br />
to take into the Confederation the debt of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$62,500,000.</span> We have a right to
ask how <br />
the other $15,000,000 are to be paid ? By <br />
whom are they to be assumed ? What portion <br />
is Upper Canada to assume? What portion <br />
is Lower Canada to assume? (Hear, hear.) <br />
Then, hon. gentlemen, if we adopt these <br />
resolutions, and a bill based on them is <br />
brought into the Imperial Parliament and <br />
carried—look at the power which is given <br />
to the Confederate Parliament. They have <br />
the power to impose local taxation upon each <br />
of the separate provinces   I would like to <br />
know how that power is to be exercised; I <br />
would like to know whether it is to be a capi- <br />
tation tax, or an acreage tax upon the lands <br />
of the province, or whether it is to be a <br />
tax upon the general property of the pro- <br />
vince. I am sure there is no hon. gentle- <br />
man present who would not like information <br />
on these points, before voting for this <br />
scheme. (Hear, hear.) Then, hon. gentle- <br />
men, there is another very important ques- <br />
tion—the question of the defence of these <br />
provinces—which within a few months has <br />
taken a shape which it never took before in <br />
the history of this country. I shall trespass <br />
on the attention of the House for a few <br />
moments, while I read an extract from a <br />
very able report on that question, which <br />
ranks, and in time. to come too will rank, <br />
deservedly high as a State paper.  It is a <br />
memorandum of the Executive Council, <br />
dated October, 1862, at the time the <br />
MACDONALD-SICOTTE Administration held <br />
oﬁce. And, whatever the errors of that <br />
Government might have been, however they <br />
may have been found fault with in other <br />
matters, I believe the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generally</span>
were <br />
of opinion that the stand which the Govern- <br />
ment took on that question, was one which <br />
entitled them to the respect and conﬁdence of <br />
the community at large. The Government <br />
say in this memorandum :— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That they are not unwilling to try to the
<br />
utmost to comply with the suggestions of the <br />
Imperial Government is evidence by the manner <br />
in which the projected Intercolonial Railway has <br />
been entertained. Their conduct in this matter <br />
should relieve them from every imputation. At <br />
the same time, they insist that they are and must <br />
be allowed to be the best judges of the pressure <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> the provincial credit can
sustain. They <br />
are prepared, subject to certain conditions, to <br />
encumber this credit with liabilities arising out of <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> His Grace, while promising liberal
assist- <br />
ance contends that any available supply of <br />
regular troops would be unequal to the defenœ <br />
of the province—and that the main dependence <br />
of such a country for defence must be upon its <br />
own people. Your Excellency’s advisers would <br />
not be faithful to their own convictions or to the <br />
trust reposed in them, if they withheld an expres- <br />
sion of their belief that without very large assis- <br />
tance any efforts or sacriﬁces of which the people <br />
of the province are capable, would not enable <br />
them successfully and for any lengthened period <br />
to repel invasion from the neighboring republic. <br />
They have relied for protection in some degree <br />
upon the fact, that under no conceivable circum- <br />
stances will they provoke war with the United <br />
States, and if therefore Canada should become <br />
the theatre of war resulting from Imperial policy, <br />
while it would cheerfully put forth its strength in <br />
the defence of its soil, it would nevertheless be <br />
obliged to rely for its protection mainly upon <br />
Imperial resources ; and in such an event it is <br />
their opinion that they would be justiﬁed in ex- <br />
pecting to be assisted in the work of defence with <br />
the whole strength of the empire.&nbsp; It is not ne- <br />
cessary at this stage of their history, to put for- <br />
ward assurances of the readiness <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the</span>
Canadian <br />
people to assume whatever responsibilities belong <br />
to them as subjects of Her Majesty. Their devo— <br />
tion has been exhibited too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">often</span>
to be open to <br />
doubt or depreciation. They have made sacri- <br />
ﬁces that should relieve them from suspicion, and <br />
which Her Majesty’s Government should remem— <br />
ber as a pledge of their ﬁdelity.&nbsp; No portion of <br />
the empire is exposed to sufferings and sacriﬁces <br />
equal to those which would inevitably fall upon <br />
this province in the event of war with the United <br />
States. No probable combination of regular <br />
troops and militia would preserve our soil from <br />
invading armies ; and no fortune which the most <br />
sanguine dare hope for would prevent our most <br />
ﬂourishing districts from being the battle ﬁeld of <br />
the war. Our trade would be brought to a stand- <br />
still, our industry would be paralyzed, our richest <br />
farming lands devastated, our towns and villages <br />
destroyed ; homes, happy in peace, would be <br />
rendered miserable by war, and all as the result <br />
of events for the production of which Canada <br />
would be in no wise accountable. <br />
