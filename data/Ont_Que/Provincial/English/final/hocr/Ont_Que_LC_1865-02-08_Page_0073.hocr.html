world, <br />
as regards the tonnage of our commercial <br />
marine, though possibly France might be about <br />
on an equality with us. England, he said, <br />
was the ﬁrst, the United States the second<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span>
<br />
and either France or the contemplated Con- <br />
federation would be the third ; and this is true. <br />
I will read the statement of that honorable <br />
gentleman :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The sea-going tonnage of Canada,
including <br />
that of the inland lakes, amounts to about nine <br />
million tons, a great portion of which, however, <br />
represents the tonnage of vessels <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">performing</span>
the <br />
coasting service, may of which frequently clear <br />
and arrive in the course of one day. It is grati- <br />
fying to know that the trade between Canada and<br />
the States on the other side of the lakes is of a <br />
nature to give employment to a large portion of <br />
this lake tonnage—amounting to 6,907,000 tons. <br />
I cannot class that in the same category as the <br />
tonnage arriving at Quebec and Montreal which, <br />
in most cases, can only make two or three trips <br />
per annum. The sea-going tonnage of Canada <br />
amounts to 2,133,000 tons ; of New Brunswick, <br />
1,386,000 tons ; of Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia,</span>
1,432,000 tons. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Consequently</span> the amount of
sea-going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonnage,</span> <br />
subject only to a small deduction, is actually <br />
about ﬁve million tons. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The way the honorable Minister of Finance
<br />
made up his statement was exactly similar to <br />
that in which the same kind of statistical <br />
statements were made up in England, the <br />
United States, and other great maritime <br />
countries, the object being to show the actual <br />
amount of tonnage employed during each year <br />
in the carrying trade. It does not matter <br />
whether a vessel is engaged in long or short <br />
voyages ; if it be employed merely as a ferry, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the fact</span> of its being so employed
in carrying <br />
goods inwards or outwards is a proof that its <br />
tonnage capacity is required by the trade of <br />
the countries to and from which it plies. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear.)</span> But the honorable member
made it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appear</span> untruly that the statement
of the hon- <br />
orable the Minister of Finance with respect to <br />
the tonnage employed on the Canadian lakes <br />
was put forth for the purpose of misleading <br />
the public and inducing them erroneously to <br />
believe that the Confederation will have a pro- <br />
minent place among the great maritime nations <br />
by reason of the tonnage employed in its <br />
trade. Mr. GALT’s statement was that the <br />
sea-going tonnage of the proposed Confedera- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion</span> would be the third largest
employed in <br />
the trade of the world, and the statistics re- <br />
garding the tonnage of the inland waters of<br />
Canada were superadded to those of the sea-<br />
going tonnage of the Union. The two state-<br />
ments were made perfectly distinct in every <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> table and every speech emanating from the
<br />
Minister of Finance or his department. It <br />
is thus the honorable member has availed <br />
himself of his position for the purpose of <br />
trying to throw dirt upon our leading <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">states-</span>
<br />
men—of endeavoring to asperse the charac- <br />
ters of our most distinguished public men, <br />
and I repeat, for I cannot too strongly urge <br />
it upon the House, that we ought to dis- <br />
countenance such attempts, for we should con- <br />
sider the character of our public men as <br />
public property, not to be lightly attacked <br />
and damaged. If we are to enter into this <br />
scheme, we should at least do so unassailed by <br />
our own people, and with as good a public <br />
reputation as we deserve. (Hear, hear.) The <br />
honorable member next proceeded to read ex- <br />
tracts from old Globes and other newspapers, <br />
in which, with the characteristic features and <br />
bitter feelings of the times in which they <br />
were written, certain things were stated not <br />
specially commendatory of some of the Cana- <br />
dian ministers now concerned in the prepara- <br />
tion of the Confederation scheme. I am not <br />
here to defend these gentlemen—the Hon. <br />
Messrs. BROWN and MCDOUGALL, his own <br />
party leaders, whom he attacked—nor do I <br />
intend to make remarks upon past events, but <br />
this I will say, that the parties alluded to <br />
have entered upon their present work with the <br />
sincere intention, I believe, of putting an end <br />
to the grave difficulties which have so long <br />
distracted the country. This they have done <br />
with the full concurrence and approbation of <br />
their political friends, whose advice they <br />
sought before entering the Administration ; <br />
and I think that, under the circumstances, <br />
instead of being reproached and held up to pub- <br />
lic censure, they ought to be treated with con- <br />
ﬁdence and generosity. I have hitherto <br />
always listened to the honorable member with <br />
pleasure, even when I could not agree with <br />
him, and even in certain parts of the speech <br />
to which I am now referring, the honorable <br />
member exhibited considerable ability ; but <br />
I do think, considering it as a whole, that <br />
a more illogical, self-contradictory, and gen- <br />
erally objectionable address has seldom been <br />
made in the Canadian Legislature. Upon <br />
reviewing the general effect of this re- <br />
markable effort, can only compare it with <br />
the performances of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parrott</span>
guns dis- <br />
charged against Fort Fisher, six of which, we <br />
have been told, slightly wounded two of the <br />
enemy, but killed and disabled about ﬁfty of <br />
the men who served them. I take it that <br />
Hon. Messrs. TILLEY and LYNCH have got <br />
off with very slight wounds indeed, and that <br />
