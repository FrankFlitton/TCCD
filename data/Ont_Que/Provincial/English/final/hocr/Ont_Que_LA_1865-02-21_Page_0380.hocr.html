of<br />
the seigniorial tenure, which amounts to<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three</span> millions, was not included
in the general <br />
debt. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SOLICITOR GENERAL LANGEVIN <br />
—The Minister of Finance stated the whole <br />
debt, in his speech at Sherbrooke, at $67,- <br />
263,994. The amount of the debt is $75,- <br />
578,000 ; but it is necessary to deduct the <br />
Sinking Fund and cash in bank, $7,132,068, <br />
reducing it to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$68,445,953 ;</span> the
Minister of <br />
Finance also deducted the Common School <br />
Fund, which amounts to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,181,958,</span>
and he <br />
arrived at the result I have just given, that is <br />
to say, that the real debt of Canada is $67,- <br />
263,994. I do not give all the items of the <br />
public debt, for I do not think it devolves <br />
upon me to prove that the calculations of the <br />
Finance Minister are not correct ; that is the <br />
task of those who accuse him of error ; and <br />
the Public Accounts are there to shew that <br />
the Finance Minister has stated nothing but <br />
the truth. The honorable member for Ho- <br />
chelaga has manifested excessive anxiety re- <br />
specting the ﬁnancial position of the Confed- <br />
eration ; but in this case also we have the <br />
same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantees</span> as for that of
the local gov- <br />
ernments. He asserted, for instance, that <br />
Newfoundland was too poor to contribute to <br />
the revenue of the Confederation, and that, in <br />
place of receiving anything from that province, <br />
we shall be compelled to send down money to <br />
prevent the people of the island from perish- <br />
ing by cold. The honorable gentleman is, <br />
nevertheless, well aware that Newfoundland <br />
has a large revenue, a revenue of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$480,000,</span>
<br />
and that its expenses are less than its income. <br />
Newfoundland will receive its share from the <br />
Federal chest, but it will also contribute to the <br />
general revenue. While I am considering this <br />
portion of the honorable gentleman’s speech, <br />
I must admit that it is the strongest argument <br />
in behalf of Confederation, from the stand- <br />
point of the Lower Provinces, that could be<br />
brought forward ; and, for my part, I desire <br />
to see thousands of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">copies</span> of
his speech sent <br />
to those provinces, for his object clearly is to <br />
shew that the measure would be entirely to <br />
their advantage. He has attempted to shew <br />
that they will have a larger revenue than they <br />
have at present ; but be omitted to state that <br />
Lower Canada would have $200,000 over and <br />
above her expenses. He knows perfectly well <br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">total revenue </span>of the
provinces forms a <br />
sum of $14,223,320, for 1864, and that the <br />
total expenditure amounted only to $13,350,- <br />
832, so that there is a surplus of $872,488, <br />
apart from the revenue from increase of im- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />ports in 1864. The ﬁnancial position is there<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />-
<br />fore highly favorable for the formation of a<br />
Confederation. The honorable member for <br />
Hochelaga stated that New Brunswick would<br />
have a surplus of $34,000 over its
expendi- <br />
ture, and he complains, upon that ground, of <br />
the subsidy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$63,000</span> it is
proposed to pay <br />
that province during ten years. But every <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one is</span> aware that the subsidy is
to be paid <br />
because that province gives up all its revenues <br />
to the Federal Government, except that derived <br />
from its export duty on timber ; that was the <br />
reason its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> insisted on
the payment <br />
of the subsidy during ten years, and they <br />
were right. The honorable member also <br />
stated that Prince Edward Island was to <br />
receive $48,000 more than its expenses. But <br />
how comes it then that Prince Edward Is- <br />
land has hitherto exhibited reluctance ? It <br />
must be that that province takes a different&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
view from the honorable member. The <br />
truth, however, is that Prince Edward <br />
Island, like the other provinces, was treated <br />
with justice and equity by the Quebec Con- <br />
ference, that its local requirements were con- <br />
sidered, and that a suﬂicient revenue to pro- <br />
vide for them was awarded to it. The hon- <br />
orable member for Hochelaga, who spoke in <br />
English, took that opportunity to make a <br />
violent appeal to the members from Upper <br />
Canada, and told them that there would be <br />
enormous imposts, and that two-thirds of the <br />
revenue and of the taxes would be paid by <br />
them. He did well to speak in English, for <br />
I am certain that he would not make the <br />
same assertion<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> in French in the
presence of <br />
the members from Lower Canada ; he would <br />
make no appeal of that nature, and I regret <br />
it, for that would give us the best of reasons <br />
for entering into the Confederation ; but I <br />
must acknowledge that that statement of the <br />
honorable member is not exactly correct, for <br />
the basis of the Confederation is justice to <br />
all. The honorable member for Hochelaga <br />
also said, in order to produce an effect upon <br />
the members from Upper Canada, that the <br />
extension of the Confederation westward was <br />
a farce, “ an absurd affair,” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because the</span>
wes- <br />
tern provinces do not even think of it, and <br />
because we have no communication with that <br />
territory. <br />
