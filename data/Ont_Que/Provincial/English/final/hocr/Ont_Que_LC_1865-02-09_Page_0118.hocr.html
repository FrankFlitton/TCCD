with the sea-board during the winter was <br />
about to be cut off—that our trade and com- <br />
merce with the United States was hampered <br />
by the most vexatious and needless restric- <br />
tions—and that, furthermore, measures of a <br />
military and naval character having special <br />
reference to our frontier relations, had found <br />
favor and countenance with the Government <br />
and people of the United States. Looking at <br />
all these things, he could not conceive how any <br />
Canadian could feel that this was a time for <br />
his country to remain in her present compara- <br />
tively weak and isolated condition, when an <br />
opportunity was offered of acquiring that <br />
strength which union with the sister pro- <br />
vinces could alone give us. It might be that <br />
there were some honorable gentlemen who <br />
did not view the question, so far as regarded <br />
our relations with the United States, in the <br />
same 1ight that he did. Now, from whatever <br />
point <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> view he looked at the
question of <br />
Confederation, he was equally convinced of <br />
the extreme desirableness of an early settle- <br />
ment of the question. He would be very <br />
unwilling to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follow</span> the example
of some hon- <br />
orable gentlemen in decrying the resources or <br />
underrating the position of Canada; but he <br />
was bound to say, that while be freely admit- <br />
ted and heartily acknowledged the many <br />
sources of material wealth and prosperity <br />
which Canada possessed, in her fertile soil, <br />
her rich minerals, her noble system of canals <br />
and railways, he nevertheless could not shut <br />
his eyes to the fact that our trade and <br />
revenue, our commercial and agricultural in- <br />
terests, had been so injuriously <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affected</span>
by <br />
the state of things on the other side of the <br />
lakes, that unless we could find new avenues <br />
for our commerce, new markets for our pro- <br />
duce, we must inevitably suffer a most serious <br />
check to our prosperity and well-doing. In <br />
this Confederation scheme he believed that a <br />
golden opportunity was offered to us of remedy- <br />
ing the evils under which we were now suf- <br />
fering, and of opening out a new and pros- <br />
perous career for this country, if we would <br />
avail ourselves of it. He believed that it <br />
might be said of nations as of individuals:— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> There is a tide in the affairs of man <br />
Which, taken at the ﬂood, leads on to fortune; <br />
Omitted, all the voyage of their life is spent <br />
ln shallows and miseries. <br />
On such a full sea are we now aﬂoat <br />
And we must take the current as it flows, <br />
Or lose our venture. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. SANBORN said he rose for the <br />purpose of moving the resolution of which be <br />
had given notice, and would take the oppor- <br />
tunity of offering some observations on the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> subject. In his opinion
it could not <br />
injured by discussion, and whatever might <br />
be its merits or demerits after going
through <br />
the crucible, the residuum <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must be</span>
better than <br />
the present condition of the subject, both as <br />
regarded the legislature and the country. On <br />
a former occasion he had expressed himself as <br />
not averse to the question, but as inclined, <br />
from various considerations, to view Confeder- <br />
ation favorably; and acting in the same sense <br />
he would now state certain points, which, in <br />
his opinion, must lead to the conclusion that <br />
such a union would advance the prosperity of <br />
the colonies interested, and their ultimate es- <br />
tablishment as a nation. The principle of as- <br />
sociation, as exhibited in commercial partner- <br />
ships and corporations, continued a secret of <br />
rosperity, the precise nature of which it might <br />be difficult to elucidate and account for, but <br />
which no one could fail to recognize, and so <br />
far as it applied to nations its potency was <br />
sufficiently established to show that the anal- <br />
ogy was presumed and that it was as operative <br />
as in partnerships and corporations. He was <br />
also prepared to admit that diversity of inter- <br />
ests was no sufficient argument against union, <br />
—(hear)—since in this very particular might <br />
frequently be found the strongest bond of <br />
union. As in electricity, opposite poles at- <br />
tracted each other, so among nations a diver- <br />
sity of interests which might a priori be pro- <br />
nounced a bar, was not unfreqnently the most <br />
effectual means of harmony, and thus a diver- <br />
sity of feeling which brought out talent, might <br />
lead to a comparison of opinions which would <br />
induce an enlarged policy calculated to elevate <br />
and not to depress national energies. He was <br />
prepared to admit that Confederation would <br />
enlarge the minds of all, and make us better <br />
to understand our resources and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capabil-</span>
<br />
ities. It would make us more enquiring, <br />
and teach us so to use our industrial power <br />
as to secure the best results. (Hear, hear.) <br />
He was prepared to admit that the results of <br />
the union between Upper and Lower Canada <br />
had been beneficial to both, and he argued <br />
that union with the other provinces, inhabited <br />
by a peeple educated under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
circum- <br />
stances and of different origins, could hardly <br />
