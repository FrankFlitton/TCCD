<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It is represented to be very much of the <br />
nature of the country through which the <br />
Great Western runs westward of Hamilton <br />
over a great portion of the line. The best <br />
portion of the line is equal to the worst por- <br />
tions of the Great Western. Even at the cost <br />
of £7,000 per mile the expense of constructing <br />
the entire road would be a little over ﬁfteen <br />
millions of dollars. The proportion of that <br />
payable by Canada would be about nine mil- <br />
lions. I think it is extremely probable that <br />
when we obtain the report of the engineers <br />
sent out by our Government, it will be found <br />
that a very large portion can be constructed <br />
for much less than £7,000 per mile. But, <br />
whatever the sum may amount to, it is per- <br />
fectly clear that without the road there can <br />
be no union of the provinces. (Hear, hear.) <br />
It is equally clear that on that road there is a <br />
very large proportion of the country that is <br />
exceedingly desirable for settlement, and that <br />
only awaits the opening up of some means of <br />
communication with the markets. Major <br />
ROBINSON reports that on one portion of it— <br />
and I confess that I was not aware of the fact <br />
until I examined the report more closely to- <br />
day—that there is a tract of country along <br />
the New Brunswick portion of the line not <br />
excelled for timber or land in any part of the <br />
world that he ever saw. (Hear, hear.) I do <br />
not propose taking up the time of the House <br />
by<span style="background-color: white;"> reading from this valuable report, but </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimates</span><span style="background-color: white;"> are given showing the
amount of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
population th</span>at these districts will support <br />
when properly settled. He shows that the <br />
country, if the road is once carried through, <br />
will be settled very rapidly. I do not, how- <br />
ever, expect that that road <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span><span style="background-color: white;">
possibly pay </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
as a commercial enterprise for a long time to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
come, and I do not desire to deceive myself </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
or deceive any other person on that point. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
That it will be of importance more as a mili- </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">tary</span><span style="background-color: white;"> work than for any other
purpose, nobody </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
can deny. In 1862, when I opposed the pro- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
position to construct the road, I the</span>n felt that <br />
this was an argument that could fairly be used <br />
in its favor. Military authorities are still <br />
unanimously of opinion that its construction <br />
would be of great importance as a means of <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection</span><span style="background-color: white;"> in case of
hostilities. The most </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
important re</span>ason, however, why it should be <br />
constructed, in addition to the military reason, <br />
is, that without its construction there can be <br />
no union of the provinces, and without a <br />
Federal union of the provinces we cannot hope <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span><span style="background-color: white;"> obtain a settlement of our
sectional difficul- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ties. The one is dependent upon the other, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
and I believe the people of Canada are willing</span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span style="background-color: white;"> to </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">accept</span><span style="background-color: white;">
the con</span>clusion that this argument ne- <br />
cessarily leads us to engage in the construction <br />
of that road. (Hear, hear.) I do not propose <br />
to-night to indulge much in ﬁgures relative to <br />
what our condition will be, ﬁnancially, after <br />
this measure is carried out ; but the honorable <br />
member for Hochelaga made some statements <br />
that I can scarcely allow to pass. He was <br />
understood to say that Lower Canada came <br />
into the union without any debt, and was to <br />
go out with thirty millions of dollars of debt, <br />
while only some twelve millions of dollars were <br />
expended in that section of the province. <br />
Now, sir, there has been spent altogether on <br />
the canals of Canada $20,813,304.03 ; on <br />
roads and bridges in Canada West<span style="background-color: white;">, </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">$562,866,</span><span style="background-color: white;">
</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
and on roads and bridges in Canada East, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
$1,163,829.34 ; on the government buildings </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
at Ottawa there have already been paid over </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
$1,513,412.56 ; and on railroads there have </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
been spent altogether $29,910,825.16, or </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
altogether about </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">$53,964,236.79.</span><span style="background-color: white;">
Now, I </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
think that one-half of this enormous amount </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
is fairly chargeable to Lower Canada. One- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
half or a little more than that of the works </span><br />
on which the money was spent are situated in <br />
Lower Canada, and, if we include the Victoria <br />
Bridge, it is considerably more than one-half. <br />
Besides these, however, there are quite a num- <br />
ber of other items which I do not take into <br />
account. There is the Quebec Fire Loan, <br />
and a deﬁciency in a number of special funds <br />
that I will not take any notice of at this <br />
time. Then take it from another point of <br />
view. From a return made to Parliament, we <br />
ﬁnd that the entire cost of improving the <br />
navigation in Upper Canada, including the <br />
cost of light-houses, canals<span style="background-color: white;">, </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;c.,</span><span style="background-color: white;">
a</span>ltogether <br />
amounted to<span style="background-color: white;"> </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">$7,022,665.61</span><span style="background-color: white;"> ; that
the revenue </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
derived from Upper Canada harbors and </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
canals has been </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,887,291.73</span><span style="background-color: white;"> ;
leaving a </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
balance against Upper Canada of $2,145,- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
373.88. In </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span><span style="background-color: white;"> Canada, during
the same </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
period, the expenditure has been </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,484,-</span><span style="background-color: white;">
</span><br />
566.52, while there was a revenue of <br />
$708,086.80, leaving a balance against Lower <br />
Canada of $4,176,479.72. I give these <br />
ﬁgures simply to prove that the position taken <br />
by the honorable member for Hochelaga was <br />
entirely incorrect ; but it would be superﬂuous <br />
to do that if I were to allude to one item <br />
which he gave when he was comparing the <br />
amount of debt that we would have to pay <br />
per head of our population, compared with <br />
that of Great Britain. The amount per head <br />
with us is about $25, and he gravely told the <br />
House that the amount per head in Great <br />
Britain was only $37. when every person <br />
