<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN—That <br />
Administration had no very long existence, <br />
and I rejoice that I did my part in upsetting <br />
it, for it is probable that, if it had stood, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation based</span> on
population would <br />
have been forced upon us, and we should <br />
not be now in our present position—in a <br />
position to make our own terms as freely as <br />
Upper Canada, and take part, on a footing of <br />
equality, in negotiating a treaty with the <br />
Lower Provinces. This is why I rejoice <br />
that I contributed to overthrow that govern- <br />
ment. The hon. member for Hochelaga <br />
told us the other evening that in 1856 he <br />
spoke as follows :— <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 328 2189 1792 3782">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In 1856, when Parliament was sitting at
To-<br />
ronto, I ﬁrst suggested that one means of sur-<br />
mounting our difﬁculties would be the substitution <br />
of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> of the two
Canadas in place of a <br />
Legislative union. By that arrangement local <br />
questions would be debated in the local legisla-<br />
tures, and the Central Government would have<br />
the control of commercial and other questions<br />
of general interest. I said that considering the <br />
differences of race, religion and laws now exist- <br />
ing between the two sections of the country, it <br />
would be the best means of surmounting them. <br />
That is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> say, I would leave to
a central govern- <br />
ment questions regarding commerce, banking, <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">currency,</span> public works of a
general character, <br />
&amp;c., and to the local legislatures all local ques-<br />
tions. At the same time I said that if these vi<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ews</span><br />
were not accepted, I should certainly be in favor <br />
of representation based on population, with con-<br />
ditions and guarantees which would secure the <br />
interests of Lower Canada, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preserve</span>
to <br />
Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada the institutions which
are so dear <br />
to her. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Well, we see that in 1856, the hon.
member <br />
for Hochelaga was desirous of forming a <br />
new Constitution for the express purpose of <br />
stiﬂing the cry for representation based on <br />
population. In 1858 he formed, together <br />
with the present Hon. President of the Coun- <br />
cil (Hon. Mr. BROWN), the BROWN—DORION <br />
Government ; and again, he stipulated that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> question of representation
based on <br />
population should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> taken into
considera-<br />
tion, and that the Government should con-<br />
sider the means of settling the difficulties <br />
which it involved. In 1859 he signed a <br />
document, which also bore the signatures of <br />
Hon. Mr. DRUMMOND, Hon. Mr. DES- <br />
SAULLES, and Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCGEE,</span> in
which he <br />
said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> his colleagues, that a

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 1872 853 3355 2308">

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If Lower Canada insists on maintaining
the<br />
union intact ; if she will neither consent to a<br />
dissolution of the union, nor consider the project <br />
of a Federation, it is difﬁcult to conceive on what <br />
reasonable grounds the demand for representation <br />
according to population can be resisted. The <br />
plea for such resistance has hitherto been that <br />
danger might arise to some of her peculiar and <br />
most cherished institutions ; but that ground will <br />
be no longer tenable if she rejects a proposition, <br />
the effect of which would be to leave to her<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
own<br />
people the sole and absolute custody of
those <br />
institutions, and to surround them by the most<br />
stringent of all possible safeguards, the provisions <br />
of the fundamental law of the land, unalterable <br />
save by the action of the people affected by them. <br />
The logical alternative now presented to the <br />
people of Lower Canada would, therefore, seem <br />
to be dissolution or federation on the one hand,<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> representation according to
population on the <br />
other. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 1864 2363 3348 3880">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Here, again, he intended to stiﬂe the cry <br />
of representation based on population, and <br />
intended to do it by founding a new Confed-<br />
eration. In 1861 it was just the same ; he <br />
declared that he was desirous of settling <br />
that question of the representation ; that it <br />
was not expedient that it should remain an<br />
open question ; that it was a difficulty to be <br />
got rid of one way or another. In 1862,<br />
also, he went into the Government with the<br />
same object in view. But how did he set <br />
about carrying it out? He made it a close <br />
question, and adopted, with his colleagues, <br />
the plan of the double majority. The hon.<br />
member doubtless had forgotten that in 1859, <br />
when he penned the manifesto which I have<br />
just quoted, he had condemned the double<br />
majority. Here is, in fact, what he said in <br />
that document :— <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_11" title="bbox 1857 3948 3337 5222">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In each section there would still be
minority <br />
and majority parties, and unless the principle of<br />
the double majority could be enacted as a funda<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />-<br />
mental law, we should be exposed to an endless <br />
round of the same complaints that we now hear,<br />
of one section ruling the other contrary to its well <br />
known public opinion, and to see reproduced in <br />
our politics the same passions, the same intrigues, <br />
the same corruption and insincerity. The enact- <br />
ment of the double majority is not advocated in<br />
any quarter. The impossibility
of clearly deﬁning<br />
the cases to which it should apply, and of distin-<br />
guishing them from those to which it should not, <br />
is felt by all ; but<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> were it
even possible, it would<br />
only lead to new phases of diﬂiculty, by compelling <br />
majorities professing opinions and principles<br />
diametrically opposed to each other, to unite, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and, thereby</span> effectually to
extinguish the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂuence</span> <br />
