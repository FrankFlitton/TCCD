But, I would ask what did most of the mem- <br />
bers even of this House know of the scheme <br />
when they ﬁrst came to Quebec? Did we <br />
know as much about it then as we know <br />
now? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ROSS—Yes. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—My hon. friend <br />
from Toronto says, “ Yes.” <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> AN HON. MEMBER— No. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—Another hon. mem- <br />
ber replies, “ no.” I may say for myself that I <br />
have learned something even from the speech <br />
of my hon. friend from Toronto that I did <br />
not know before. The people of the country <br />
have been waiting, expecting this matter <br />
would be discussed in Parliament, and that <br />
the whole scheme would be presented so as <br />
to enable its being judged of as a whole. <br />
Unfortunately, however, it is only a part of <br />
the scheme which we have at this moment <br />
before the Council. I did not have the plea- <br />
sure of hearing the whole of the remarks of <br />
my hon. friend from Montreal (Hon. Mr. <br />
FERRIER), but I was greatly interested in <br />
listening to the portion I did hear. I refer <br />
to what he said respecting the ministerial <br />
crisis in June last.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> I thought that
the cele-<br />
brated memorandum, which, by the bye, <br />
has since been in great part repudiated by <br />
the Government of the day, contained all <br />
the Ministerial explanations. But that scene, <br />
so forcibly described by the hon. gentleman, <br />
where the President of the Council met the <br />
Attorney General East— <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. FERRIER—I did not say I <br />
saw it. I only heard of it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—When the Hon. <br />
Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CARTIER</span> embraced the Hon.
Mr. <br />
BROWN. (Laughter.) <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. FERRIER—I simply said it <br />
was so reported on the streets. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—And the Hon. Mr. <br />
BROWN promised eternal allegiance to the <br />
Hon. Mr. CARTIER. (<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Laughter.)</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. FERRIER<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—I</span> was simply <br />
giving the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="font-style: italic;">on-dit</span></span> of the day. I said I
knew <br />
nothing whatever of it further than what I <br />
had heard on the streets. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRlE—I must have mis- <br />
understood my hon. friend. I thought he was. <br />
a witness of the affecting scene. (Laughter.) <br />
But my hon. friend did tell the House <br />
somethiug which was new to me, and which <br />
must have sounded as new to the country, <br />
when he said that the Grand Trunk Railway <br />
cost the people of Canada very little. The <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> hon. gentleman seemed to think that I was
<br />
very much opposed to the Grand Trunk. <br />
But never in my life have I spoken a <br />
single word against the Grand Trunk as a <br />
railway. I believe there is no hon. gentle- <br />
man who can possibly appreciate more <br />
highly the commercial advantages to this <br />
country of that work than I do. At the <br />
same time, I have taken occasion, and may <br />
do so again if the necessity requires it, to <br />
speak of some of the transactions connected <br />
with that undertaking. Let this work or <br />
any other public work come under the atten- <br />
tion of this Chamber, and it will receive at <br />
my hands in the future, as in the past, that <br />
degree of consideration to which as a public <br />
work it is entitled. I hope the day is not <br />
far distant when the Grand Trunk will <br />
become what it ought to be, a strictly and <br />
entirely commercial work, and when the <br />
people of all classes and parties will look <br />
upon it with favor. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. FERRIER—It is strictly a <br />
commercial work now. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—My hon. friend <br />
stated that it had cost the country a mere <br />
trifle. But unluckily the Public Accounts <br />
do not tell the same story, and they do not <br />
exactly conﬁrm the views of my hon. friend <br />
in relation to this work. If he looks at the <br />
assets of the province—the valuables of the <br />
province—he will ﬁnd there is a charge <br />
against the Grand Trunk of $15,142,000 <br />
for debentures.&nbsp; And besides there is this <br />
little $100,000 which has been used in re- <br />
deeming the city of Montreal bonds. There <br />
is something more besides about subsidiary <br />
lines. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. FERRIER—I spoke of the <br />
ﬁrst capital investment. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—My hon. friend <br />
from the Erie Division (Hon. Mr. CHRISTIE) <br />
admitted in opening his case that this scheme <br />
was very much marred by its details. Ad- <br />
mitting this—which is just the whole argu- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment</span>—that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />the details so greatly
mar the <br />
scheme, it is much to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feared</span>
that the <br />
measure will not work so peacefully, use- <br />
fully, or harmoniously as its originators <br />
expected, and I believe sincerely hoped it <br />
would do ; because I do these hon. gentlemen <br />
the credit of believing that in devising a <br />
scheme which should be for the future as <br />
well as the present welfare of the country , <br />
they were animated by a desire to do the very <br />
best they could under the circumstances. <br />
Their great error, in my opinion, lay in <br />
