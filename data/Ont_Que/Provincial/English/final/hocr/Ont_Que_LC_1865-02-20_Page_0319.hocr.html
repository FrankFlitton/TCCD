<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> elected, it is true that Federation was <br />
before the country, but it was before the <br />
country in a very different shape from what <br />
it is at the present time. After the Govern- <br />
ment of the day was defeated last session, <br />
and after arrangements had been entered <br />
into, it was understood by these arrange- <br />
ments that we were to have Federation of <br />
the two Canadas. That was all that was <br />
placed before us. In issuing my short <br />
address, I stated I was in favor of Feder- <br />
ation. I am so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">still—(hear)—but</span>
while in <br />
favor of Confederation of all the pro- <br />
vinces, I desire it should be carried out in <br />
such a way that it will conduce to the best <br />
interests of all concerned. I wish that no <br />
advantage may be taken by any one of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> over the others. When I
came <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> before my constituents for election, as
hon. <br />
gentlemen may be aware, I had no opposition <br />
—-—I was elected by acclamation. All I could <br />
say to the people on the measure was simply <br />
this, that I approved of the scheme marked <br />
out by the Government when the new ad- <br />
ministration was formed, but I knew nothing <br />
as to what had subsequently taken place. <br />
I told them that I was in favor of change— <br />
that I was in favor of a Federation of the <br />
two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, <br />
in order that we might live together in peace, <br />
as I was satisfied, from what we had witnessed <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> transpiring for many years,
that it was <br />
impossible to live longer together—that it <br />
was better to separate, and in separating we <br />
would probably be better friends. I also <br />
stated that the time must come when the <br />
Confederation of all the provinces would <br />
take place, and that if Confederation was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed</span> upon a just basis, it
would no <br />
doubt be the means of a vast amount of good <br />
to our common country. (Hear, hear.) The <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span> knowledge I had of
Confederation was, <br />
as a matter of course, when the delegates <br />
met and passed the resolutions which <br />
are now before us with a slight alter- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ation</span> or two of no moment. When
these <br />
resolutions were printed by the Government <br />
I received one from the Honorable the Pro- <br />
vincial Secretary, marked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span>Private,”
and I <br />
also at the same time received a note from <br />
that honorable gentleman, stating that these <br />
resolutions were not then intended for the <br />
eye of the public. The consequence was, <br />
I felt that I could not read these resolutions, <br />
and meet my constituents and tell them that <br />
I knew nothing in reference to Confedera- <br />
tion, Thus feeling my hands tied, I placed <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the resolutions in my desk, and left them
<br />
there; and never did examine them to ascer- <br />
tain what honorable gentlemen had done <br />
until I took my seat on the ﬂoor of the <br />
House. I could not feel free to place myself <br />
in a position before my constituents, and on <br />
being asked from time to time what were <br />
the prospects of Confederation and what <br />
were its details, give a truthful reply with <br />
the restrictions placed upon me, were I to <br />
have read the resolutions; and therefore I <br />
did not read the resolutions, so that I might <br />
honestly say I knew nothing about them. I <br />
feel, honorable gentlemen, that it would be <br />
impossible for me, under existing circum- <br />
stances, to vote away that right which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>
<br />
been granted by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution,</span>
of our <br />
country to those who now have the privilege <br />
conferred upon them of exercising the <br />
elective franchise so far as regards this <br />
Chamber. I feel that I should do a great <br />
wrong and perpetrate a great injury to the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">electors</span> who sent me here, were I
to vote for <br />
that portion of the scheme which contem- <br />
plates the taking away of their franchise <br />
altogether. I have no objection, as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat—</span>
<br />
ter of course, to the life members, if they <br />
so desire it, voting away their rights, or of <br />
placing their seats in the hands of the Go- <br />
vernment to be dealt with as they please; <br />
and so far as I am individually concerned, <br />
I would have no objection to sacrifice my <br />
seat in the House for the good of the country <br />
and of my constituents. They have sent me <br />
here, not because I was anxious to be placed <br />
in this position, however honorable it may <br />
be, but because I was their choice. And I<br />
must say that it was one of the proudest <br />
and happiest days of my life when found, <br />
after having battled politically for so many <br />
years on the side of reform, that I could go <br />
into a constituency embracing 75,000 souls, <br />
of all descriptions and shades of politics, and <br />
that I had so far given satisfaction that not <br />
a man was to be found who raised his voice <br />
against my re-election. (Hear, hear.) I <br />
have gained, I may say, all that I desire in <br />
the way of earthly honor; but I feel, like <br />
many other honorable gentlemen, that in <br />
being placed in this high and honorable <br />
position, it is my duty to act faithfully to- <br />
wards those who sent me here; and I feel I <br />
should do wrong if, on an occasion like this, <br />
I should give my vote for placing that portion <br />
of Upper Canada which I am sent to repre- <br />
sent in a worse position than they occupied <br />
before. Having made these few remarks <br />
