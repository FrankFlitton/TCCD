the Federal principle has always and in every </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
case proved a failure, but the cause lay in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the weakness of the central power. We </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
shall obviate that inconvenience, by establish- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ing a central power strong enough to pre- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
serve our Confederation from that danger.” </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
But then it will be no longer a Confeder- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ation ; it will be a legislative union—a union </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
which the most zealous advocates of Confe- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
deration reject as incompatible with the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
various interests of the different provinces. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
If you succeed in establishing this central </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
power, with strength enough to bear sway </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
over the local powers, the latter will no </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
longer have an exclusive existence ; they </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
will become the authorized delegates of the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
central power, their ofﬁcers and every vestige </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of confederation will disappear from your </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Constitution. If you absolutely resolve to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
adopt the Federal principle, you cannot do </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
it without adopting at the same time all its </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
inconveniences. The weakness of the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
central power is not the fruit of the Federal </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
system ; it is its root, it is itself. This is </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the reason why states which are perfectly </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
independent of each other, adopt the Federal </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
principle solely as a means of defence against </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
foreigners, because the central power in a </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

We already possess, under our present Con- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> mean the power of England. It is exercised<br />
by men who live too far from us to hearken <br />
to the bickerings of race or of party, or to be <br />
mixed up with them in any way. But if <br />
that central power was wielded by men taken <br />
from among ourselves, men who have taken <br />
part in our quarrels and animosities, and who <br />
would make use of it to give effect to the <br />
views of their party, it would become in- <br />
supportable. As it now exists, we feel it <br />
only by the beneﬁts it confers. Having <br />
thus shown the serious inconveniences <br />
innate in the Federal system, let us see <br />
whether there be anything exceptional in our <br />
position, operating in our favor, and allow- <br />
ing as to hope for immunity from those evils <br />
which have befallen all former confederations. <br />
What is our position? In what respects is <br />
it more favorable than that of other confed- <br />
erations? Let us begin with Lower Canada ; <br />
its population is composed of about three- <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">fourths</span>
French-Canadians, and of one-fourth <br />
English-Canadians. It is impossible, even <br />
for the blindest admirers of the scheme of <br />
Confederation, to shut out from their view <br />
this great difference of nationality, which is <br />
certainly fated to play an important part in <br />
the destinies of the future Confederation. <br />
When Lord DURHAM wrote his celebrated <br />
report in 1839, he said, when speaking of <br />
the English-Canadians of Lower Canada :— <br />
“ The English population will never submit <br />
to the authority of a parliament in which <br />
the French have a majority, or even the <br />
semblance of a majority.” A little further <br />
on, he added :—“ In the signiﬁcant language <br />
of one of their most eminent men, they assert <br />
that Lower Canada must become English, <br />
even if to effect that object it should be <br />
necessary that the province should cease to <br />
belong to England." Whatever errors Lord <br />
DURHAM may have fallen into in judging <br />
the French-Canadians, he certainly cannot <br />
be reproached with having shewn too great <br />
severity towards the English- Canadians. He <br />
merely depicted their sentiments, as they <br />
manifested themselves in his day. Since <br />
then, things have undergone a change. <br />
And last autumn, at Sherbrooke, the Hon- <br />
orable Minister of Finance presented to us a <br />
very different picture, when he said :—" For  <br />
ﬁve and twenty years harmony has reigned <br />
in Lower Canada, and the English and <br />
French populations have entered into a com- <br />
pact to labor together to promote the common <br />
interests of the country.” This picture is <br />
a true one at the present time, as was also <br />
