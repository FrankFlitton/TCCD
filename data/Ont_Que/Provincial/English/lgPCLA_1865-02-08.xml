            <p> The Order of the Day for resuming the <lb/>
debate on the Resolution for a Union of the <lb/>
British North American Colonies, having been <lb/>
read,-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. GEORGE BROWN</persName> rose and said: <lb/> Mr.
                  SPEAKER, it is with no ordinary gratifi<lb break="no"/>cation I rise to address
                  the House on <lb/> this occasion. I cannot help feeling that <lb/> the struggle of
                  half a life-time for constitu<lb break="no"/>tional reform—the agitations in the
                  country, <lb/> and the fierce contests in this chamber—the <lb/> strife and the
                  discord and the abuse of many <lb/> years,—are all compensated by the great scheme
                  <lb/> of reform which is now in your hands. <lb/> (Cheers.) The Attorney General
                  for Upper <lb/> Canada, as well as the Attorney General for <lb/> Lower Canada, in
                  addressing the House last <lb/> night, were anxious to have it understood that
                  <lb/> this scheme for uniting British America <lb/> under one government, is
                  something different <lb/> from "representation by population," — is <lb/>
                  something different from "joint authority," <lb/> —but is in fact the very scheme
                  of the <lb/> Government of which they were members in <lb/> 1858. Now, sir, it is
                  all very well that my <lb/> honorable friends should receive credit for the <lb/>
                  large share they have contributed towards <lb/> maturing the measure before the
                  House; <lb/> but I could not help reflecting while they <lb/> spoke, that if this
                  was their very scheme in <lb/> 1858, they succeeded wonderfully in bottling <lb/>
                  it up from all the world except themselves<lb/> (hear, hear)—and I could not help
                  regretting <lb/> that we had to wait till 1864 until this <lb/> mysterious plant
                  of 1858 was forced to fruition. <lb/> (Hear, hear, and laughter.) For myself, sir,
                  I <lb/> care not who gets the credit of this scheme, <lb/> —I believe it contains
                  the best features of all <lb/> the suggestions that have been made in the <lb/>
                  last ten years for the settlement of our troubles; <lb/> and the whole feeling in
                  my mind now is <lb/> one of joy and thankfulness that there were <lb/> found men
                  of position and influence in Canada <lb/> who, at a moment of serious crisis, had
                  nerve <lb/> and patriotism enough to cast aside political <lb/> partisanship, to
                  banish personal considera<lb break="no"/>tions, and unite for the accomplishment
                  of a <lb/> measure so fraught with advantage to their <lb/> common country.
                  (Cheers.) It was a bold <lb/> step in the then existing state of public feeling
                  <lb/> for many members of the House to vote for <lb/> the Constitutional Committee
                  moved for by me <lb/> last session—it was a very bold step for many <lb/> of the
                  members of that committee to speak <lb/>
                  <cb/> and vote candidly upon it—it was a still <lb/> bolder thing for many to
                  place their names to <lb/> the report that emanated from that committee, <lb/>
                  —but it was an infinitely bolder step for the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who now
                  occupy these treasury benches, <lb/> to brave the misconceptions and suspicions
                  that <lb/> would certainly attach to the act, and enter <lb/> the same Government.
                  And it is not to be <lb/> denied that such a Coalition demanded no <lb/> ordinary
                  justification. But who does not feel <lb/> that every one of us has to-day ample
                     justifi<lb break="no"/>cation and reward for all we did in the docu<lb break="no"/>ment now under discussion? (Cheers) But <lb/> seven short months
                  have passed away since the <lb/> Coalition Government was formed, yet already
                  <lb/> are we submitting a scheme well-weighed and <lb/> matured, for the erection
                  of a future empire, <lb/> —a scheme which has been received at home <lb/> and
                  abroad with almost universal approval. <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —My hon. friend dis<lb break="no"/>sents from that, but is it possible truthfully to <lb/> deny it?
                  Has it not been approved and en<lb break="no"/>dorsed by the governments of five
                  separate <lb/> colonies ?—Has it not received the all but <lb/> unanimous approval
                  of the press of Canada?<lb break="no"/>Has it not been heartily and unequivocally
                  <lb/> endorsed by the electors of Canada ? (Cries of <lb/> hear, hear, and no,
                  no.) My honorable friend <lb/> opposite cries "no, no," but I say "yes, yes."
                  <lb/> Since the Coalition was formed, and its policy <lb/> of Federal union
                  announced, there have been <lb/> no fewer than twenty-five parliamentary elect<lb break="no"/>ions—fourteen for members of the Upper <lb/> House, and eleven for
                  members of the Lower <lb/> House. At the fourteen Upper House con<lb break="no"/>tests, but three candidates dared to show <lb/> themselves before the people in
                  opposition to <lb/> the Government scheme; and of these, two <lb/> were rejected,
                  and one—only one—succeeded <lb/> in finding a seat. (Hear, hear.) At the eleven
                  <lb/> contests for the Lower House, but one candi<lb break="no"/>date on either
                  side of politics ventured to op<lb break="no"/>pose the scheme, and I hope that
                  even he will <lb/> yet cast his vote in favor of Confederation. <lb/> (Hear,
                  hear.) Of these twenty-five electoral <lb/> contests, fourteen were in Upper
                  Canada, but <lb/> not at one of them did a candidate appear in <lb/> opposition to
                  our scheme. And let it be ob<lb break="no"/>served how large a portion of the
                  country <lb/> these twenty-five electoral districts embraced. <lb/> It is true
                  that the eleven Lower House elec<lb break="no"/>tions only included that number of
                  counties, <lb/> but the fourteen Upper House elections em<lb break="no"/>braced no
                  fewer than forty counties. (Hear, <lb/> hear.) Of the 130 constituencies,
                  therefore, <lb/> into which Canada is divided for representa<lb break="no"/>tion

                  <fw type="num">85</fw> in this chamber, not fewer than fifty have <lb/> been
                  called on since our scheme was announced <lb/> to pronounce at the polls their
                  verdict upon it, <lb/> and at the whole of them but four candidates <lb/> on both
                  sides of politics ventured to give it <lb/> opposition. (Cheers.) Was I not right
                  then <lb/> in asserting that the electors of Canada had, <lb/> in the most marked
                  manner, pronounced in <lb/> favor of the scheme ? (Hear, hear.) And <lb/> will
                  honorable gentlemen deny that the people <lb/> and press of Great Britain have
                  received it <lb/> with acclamations of approval?—that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of England have cordially endorsed <lb/> and accepted it?—aye, that even
                  the press<lb/> and the public men of the United States have <lb/> spoken of it
                  with a degree of respect they never <lb/> before accorded to any colonial
                  movement? <lb/> Sir, I venture to assert that no scheme of <lb/> equal magnitude,
                  ever placed before the world, <lb/> was received with higher eulogiums, with <lb/>
                  more universal approbation, than the mea<lb break="no"/>sure we have new the honor
                  of submit<lb break="no"/>ting for the acceptance of the Canadian <lb/> Parliament.
                  And no higher eulogy could, I <lb/> think, be pronounced than that I heard a few
                  <lb/> weeks ago from the lips of one of the fore<lb break="no"/>most of British
                  statesmen, that the system of <lb/> government we proposed seemed to him a <lb/>
                  happy compound of the best features of the <lb/> British and American
                  Constitutions. And <lb/> well, Mr. SPEAKER, might our present atti<lb break="no"/>tude in Canada arrest the earnest attention of <lb/> other countries. Here is a
                  people composed <lb/> of two distinct races, speaking different lan<lb break="no"/>guages, with religious and social and municip<lb break="no"/>al and education
                  institutions totally different; <lb/> with sectional hostilities of such a
                  character as <lb/> to render government for many years well-nigh <lb/> impossible;
                  with a Constitution so unjust in <lb/> the view of one section as to justify any
                  resort <lb/> to enforce a remedy. And yet, sir, here we <lb/> sit, patiently and
                  temperately discussing how <lb/> these great evils and hostilities may justly
                  <lb/> and amicably be swept away forever. (Hear, <lb/> hear.) We are endeavoring
                  to adjust har<lb break="no"/>moniously greater difficulties than have plunged
                  <lb/> other countries into all the horrors of civil <lb/> war. We are striving to
                  do peacefully and <lb/> satisfactorily what Holland and Belgium, after <lb/> years
                  of strife, were unable to accomplish. We <lb/> are seeking by calm discussion to
                  settle ques<lb break="no"/>tions that Austria and Hungary, that Den<lb break="no"/>mark and Germany, that Russia and Poland, <lb/> could only crush by the iron
                  heel of armed <lb/> force. We are seeking to do without foreign <lb/> intervention
                  that which deluged in blood the <lb/> sunny plains of Italy. We are striving to
                  <lb/> settle forever issues hardly less momentous <lb/>
                  <cb/> than those that have rent the neighboring re<lb break="no"/>public and are
                  now exposing it to all the hor<lb break="no"/>rors of civil war. (Hear, hear.)
                  Have we <lb/> not then, Mr. SPEAKER, great cause of thank<lb break="no"/>fulness
                  that we have found a better way for <lb/> the solution of our troubles than that
                  which <lb/> has entailed on other countries such de<lb break="no"/>plorable
                  results? And should not every <lb/> one of us endeavor to rise to the magnitude
                  <lb/> of the occasion, and earnestly seek to deal <lb/> with this question to the
                  end in the same <lb/> candid and conciliatory spirit in which, so <lb/> far, it
                  has been discussed? (Loud cries of <lb/> hear, hear.) The scene presented by this
                  <lb/> chamber at this moment, I venture to affirm, <lb/> has few parallels in
                  history. One hundred <lb/> years have passed away since these provinces
                  <lb/>became by conquest part of the British <lb/> Empire. I speak in no boastful
                  spirit—I <lb/> desire not for a moment to excite a painful <lb/> thought—what was
                  then the fortune of war <lb/> of the brave French nation, might have been <lb/>
                  ours on that well-fought field. I recall those <lb/> olden times merely to mark
                  the fact that here <lb/> sit to-day the descendants of the victors and <lb/> the
                  vanquished in the fight of 1759, with all <lb/> the differences of language,
                  religion, civil law, <lb/> and social habit, nearly as distinctly marked <lb/> as
                  they were a century ago. (Hear, hear.) <lb/> Here we sit to-day seeking amicably
                  to find a <lb/> remedy for constitutional evils and injustice <lb/> complained
                  of—by the vanquished? No, sir <lb/> —but complained of by the conquerors! <lb/>
                  (Cheers by the French Canadians.) Here <lb/> sit the representatives of the
                  British popula<lb break="no"/>tion claiming justice—only justice ; and here <lb/>
                  sit the representatives of the French popula<lb break="no"/>tion, discussing in
                  the French tongue whether <lb/> we shall have it. One hundred years have <lb/>
                  passed away since the conquest of Quebec, <lb/>but here sit the children of the
                  victor and the <lb/> vanquished, all avowing hearty attachment to <lb/> the
                  British Crown—all earnestly deliberating <lb/> how we shall best extend the
                  blessings of <lb/> British institutions—how a great people may <lb/> be
                  established on this continent in close and <lb/> hearty connection with Great
                  Britain. (Cheers.) <lb/> Where, sir, in the page of history, shall we <lb/> find a
                  parallel to this? Will it not stand as <lb/> an imperishable monument to the
                  generosity <lb/> of British rule? And it is not in Canada <lb/> alone that this
                  scene is being witnessed. Four <lb/> other colonies are at this moment occupied as
                  <lb/> we are—declaring their hearty love for the <lb/> parent State, and
                  deliberating with us how <lb/> they may best discharge the great duty en<lb break="no"/>trusted to their hands, and give their aid in <lb/> developing the
                  teeming resources of these vast <lb/>
                  <pb n="86" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0086.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">86</fw> possessions. And well, Mr. SPEAKER, may the <lb/> work we
                  have unitedly proposed rouse the <lb/> ambition and energy of every true man in
                  <lb/> British America. Look, sir, at the map of <lb/> the continent of America,
                  and mark that <lb/> island (Newfoundland) commanding the mouth <lb/> of the noble
                  river that almost cuts our conti<lb break="no"/>nent in twain. Well, sir, that
                  island is equal <lb/> in extent to the kingdom of Portugal. Cross <lb/> the
                  straits to the main land, and you touch <lb/> the hospitable shores of Nova
                  Scotia, a <lb/> country as large as the kingdom of Greece. <lb/> Then mark the
                  sister province of New <lb/> Brunswick—equal in extent to Denmark and <lb/>
                  Switzerland combined. Pass up the river St. <lb/> Lawrence to Lower Canada—a
                  country as <lb/> large as France. Pass on to Upper Canada, <lb/> —twenty thousand
                  square miles larger than <lb/> Great Britain and Ireland put together. <lb/> Cross
                  over the continent to the shores of the <lb/> Pacific, and you are in British
                  Columbia, the <lb/> land of golden promise,—equal in extent to <lb/> the Austrian
                  Empire. I speak not now of <lb/> the vast Indian Territories that lie between<lb break="no"/>greater in extent than the whole soil of Russia <lb/> —and that
                  will ere long, I trust, be opened up <lb/> to civilization under the auspices of
                  the British <lb/> American Confederation. (Cheers.) Well, <lb/> sir, the bold
                  scheme in your hands is nothing <lb/> less than to gather all these countries into
                  one <lb/> —to organize them all under one government, <lb/> with the protection of
                  the British flag, and in <lb/> heartiest sympathy and affection with our <lb/>
                  fellow-subjects in the land that gave us birth. <lb/> (Cheers.) Our scheme is to
                  establish a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that will seek to turn the tide of <lb/>
                  European emigration into this northern half <lb/> of the American continent—that
                  will strive to <lb/> develope its great natural resources—and that <lb/> will
                  endeavor to maintain liberty, and justice, <lb/> and christianity throughout the
                  land. <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —The hon. member for <lb/>
North Hastings asks when all this can be <lb/>
done? Sir, the whole great ends of this Con<lb break="no"/>federation may not be realized in the lifetime <lb/>
of many who now hear me. We imagine not <lb/>
that such a structure can be built in a month <lb/>
or in a year. What we propose now is but to <lb/>
lay the foundations of the structure—to set in <lb/>
motion the governmental machine that will <lb/>
one day, we trust, extend from the Atlantic to <lb/>
the Pacific. And we take especial credit to <lb/>
ourselves that the system we have devised, <lb/>
while admirably adapted to our present situa<lb break="no"/>tion, is capable of gradual and efficient expan<lb break="no"/>sion in future years to meet all the great pur<lb break="no"/><cb/>poses
           
contemplated by our scheme. But if the <lb/>honorable gentleman will only recall to mind <lb/>
that when the United States seceded from
the <lb/>
Mother Country, and for many years after<lb break="no"/>wards their population was not nearly equal <lb/>
to ours at this moment; that their internal <lb/>
improvements did not then approach to what <lb/>
we have already attained; and that their trade <lb/>
and commerce was not then a third of what <lb/>
ours has already reached; I think he will see <lb/>
that the fulfilment of our hopes may not be so <lb/>
very remote as at first sight might be imagined <lb/>
—(hear, hear.) And he will be strengthened <lb/>
in that conviction if he remembers that what <lb/>
we propose to do is to be done with the cordial <lb/>
sympathy and assistance of that
great Power <lb/>
of which it is our happiness to form a part. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) Such, Mr. SPEAKER,
are the <lb/>
objects of attainment to which the British <lb/>
American Conference pledged itself in Octo<lb break="no"/>ber. And said I not rightly that such a scheme <lb/>
is well fitted to fire the ambition and rouse the <lb/>
energies of every member of this House? <lb/>
Does it not lift us above the petty politics of <lb/>
the past, and present to us high purposes <lb/>
and great interests that may
well call forth all <lb/>
the intellectual ability and all the energy and <lb/>
enterprise to be found among us ? (Cheers.)
<lb/>
I readily admit all the gravity of the question <lb/>
—and that it ought to be considered cautiously <lb/>
and thoroughly before adoption. Far be it <lb/>
from me to deprecate the closest criticism, or <lb/>
to doubt for a moment the sincerity or patriot<lb break="no"/>ism of those who feel it their duty to oppose <lb/>
the measure. But in considering a question <lb/>
on which hangs the future destiny of half a <lb/>
continent, ought not the spirit of mere fault-<lb break="yes"/>finding to be hushed ?—ought not the voice of <lb/>
partisanship to be banished from our debates? <lb/>
—ought we not to sit down and discuss the <lb/>
arguments presented in the earnest and candid <lb/>
spirit of men, bound by the same interests, <lb/>
seeking a common end, and loving the same <lb/>
country? (Hear, hear, and
cheers.) Some <lb/>
honorable gentlemen seem to imagine that the <lb/>
members of Government have a deeper interest <lb/>
in this scheme than others—but what possible <lb/>
interest can any of us have except that which <lb/>
we share with every citizen of the land ? What <lb/>
risk does any one run from this measure in <lb/>
which all of us do not fully participate ? What <lb/>
possible inducement could we have to urge this <lb/>
scheme, except our earnest and heartfelt con<lb break="no"/>viction that it will inure to the solid and <lb/>
lasting advantage of our country ? (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) There is one consideration, Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, that cannot be banished from this discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and that ought, I think, to be remembered <lb/>

            in every word we utter ; it is that the
consti<lb break="no"/>tutional system of Canada cannot remain as it <lb/>
is now. (Loud cries of hear, hear.) Something <lb/>
must be done. We cannot stand still. We <lb/>
cannot go back to chronic, sectional hostility <lb/>
and discord—to a state of perpetual Ministerial <lb/>
crises. The events of the last eight months <lb/>
cannot be obliterated ; the solemn admissions <lb/>
of men of all parties can never be erased. The <lb/>
claims of Upper Canada for justice must be <lb/>
met, and met now. I say, then, that every one <lb/>
who raises his voice in hostility to this measure <lb/>
is bound to keep before him, when he speaks, <lb/>
all the perilous consequences of its rejection,-<lb/>I say that no man who has a true regard for <lb/>
the well-being of Canada, can give a vote <lb/>
against this scheme, unless he is
prepared to <lb/>
offer, in amendment, some better remedy for <lb/>
the evils and injustice that have so long threat<lb break="no"/>ened the peace of our country. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
And not only must the scheme proposed in <lb/>
amendment be a better scheme—it
must be <lb/>
something that can be carried. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
I see an honorable friend now before me, for <lb/>
whose opinions I have the very highest respect, <lb/>
who says to me : " Mr. BROWN, you should <lb/>
not have settled this part of the plan as you <lb/>
have done ; here is the way you should have <lb/>
framed it." " Well, my dear sir," is my reply, <lb/>
"I perfectly agree with you, but
it could not <lb/>
be done. Whether we ask for parliamentary <lb/>
reform for Canada alone or in
union with <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces, the French Canadians <lb/>
must have their views consulted as well as us. <lb/>
This scheme can be carried, and no scheme <lb/>
can be that has not the support
of both sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the province." <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CART2">Hon. Mr.
CARTIER</persName> —Hear, hear ! there <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> is the question ! </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">Hon.
Mr. BROWN</persName> —Yes, that is the ques<lb break="no"/>tion and the whole question. No
constitution <lb/>
ever framed was without defect; no act of <lb/>
human wisdom was ever free from
imperfec<lb break="no"/>tion; no amount of talent and
wisdom and <lb/>
integrity combined in preparing such a scheme <lb/>
could have placed it beyond the
reach of criti<lb break="no"/>cism. And the framers of this
scheme had <lb/>
immense special difficulties to overcome. We <lb/>
had the prejudices of race and
language and <lb/>
religion to deal with; and we had
to encounter <lb/>
all the rivalries of trade and
commerce, and <lb/>
all the jealousies of diversified local interests. <lb/>
To assert, then, that our scheme
is without <lb/>
fault, would be folly. It was
necessarily the <lb/>
work of concession ; not one of
the thirty-three <lb/>
framers but had, on some points, to
yield his <lb/>
opinions; and, for myself, I freely admit that <lb/>
I struggled earnestly, for days
together, to <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
             have portions of the scheme amended. But,

Mr. SPEAKER, admitting all
this—admitting <lb/>
all the difficulties that beset
us—admitting <lb/>
frankly that defects in the measure exist—I <lb/>
say that, taking the scheme as a whole, it has <lb/>
my cordial, enthusiastic support, without hesi<lb break="no"/>tation or reservation. (Hear,
hear.) I be<lb break="no"/>lieve it will accomplish all, and more than all, <lb/>
that we, who have so long fought the battle of <lb/>
parliamentary reform, ever hoped to see ac<lb break="no"/>complished. I believe that, while granting se<lb break="no"/>curity for local interests, it will give free scope <lb/>
for carrying out the will of the whole people <lb/>
in general matters—that it will draw closer <lb/>
the bonds that unite us to Great Britain—and <lb/>
that it will lay the foundations deep and <lb/>
strong of a powerful and prosperous people. <lb/>
(Cheers.) And if the House will allow me <lb/>
to trespass to a somewhat unusual degree on <lb/>
its indulgence, I am satisfied that I can clear<lb break="no"/>ly establish that such are the results fairly to <lb/>
be anticipated from the measure. Mr. SPEAK<lb break="no"/>ER, there are two views in which
this scheme <lb/>
may be regarded, namely, the existing evils it <lb/>
will remedy, and the new advantages it will <lb/>
secure for us as a people. Let us begin by <lb/>
examining its remedial provisions. First, then, <lb/>
it applies a complete and satisfactory remedy <lb/>
to the injustice of the existing system of par<lb break="no"/>liamentary representation. (Hear,
hear.) The <lb/>
people of Upper Canada have bitterly com<lb break="no"/>plained that though they numbered four hun<lb break="no"/>dred thousand souls more than the population <lb/>
of Lower Canada, and though they have con<lb break="no"/>tributed three or four pounds to the general <lb/>
revenue for every pound contributed by the <lb/>
sister province, yet the Lower Canadians send <lb/>
to Parliament as many representatives as they <lb/>
do. Now, sir, the measure in your hands <lb/>
brings this injustice to an end ;-—it sweeps <lb/>
away the line of demarcation between the two <lb/>
sections on all matters common to the whole <lb/>
province ; it gives representation according to <lb/>
numbers wherever found in the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly ; and it provides a simple and conve<lb break="no"/>nient system for re-adjusting the representa<lb break="no"/>tion after each decennial census. (Cheers.)
<lb/>
To this proposed constitution of the Lower <lb/>
Chamber, I have heard only two objections. <lb/>
It has been alleged that until after the census <lb/>
of 1871, the number of members is to re<lb break="no"/>main as at present; but this is a mistake. <lb/>
Upper Canada is to receive from the start <lb/>
eighty-two representatives, and
Lower Canada <lb/>
sixty-five; and whatever increase the census <lb/>
of 1871 may establish will be
then adjusted. <lb/>
It has also been objected that though the reso<lb break="no"/>lutions provide that the existing Parliament <lb/>
           
            <pb n="88" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0088.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">88</fw>
           of Canada shall establish the electoral
divisions <lb/>
for the first organization of the Federal Par<lb break="no"/>liament, they do not determine in whose hands <lb/>
the duty of distributing any additional mem<lb break="no"/>bers is to be vested. No doubt on this head <lb/>
need exist; the Federal Parliament will of <lb/>
course have full power to regulate all arrange<lb break="no"/>ments for the election of its own members. <lb/>
But I am told by Upper Canadians—the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the Lower House is all well <lb/>
enough, it is in the Upper House arrangements <lb/>
that the scheme is objectionable. And first, <lb/>
it is said that Upper Canada should have had <lb/>
in the Legislative Council a greater number <lb/>
of members than Lower Canada.-<lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:WALL5">MR. T. C. WALLBRIDGE</persName> —Hear, hear! <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —The honorable mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Hastings is of that opinion; <lb/> but that honorable
                  gentleman is in favor <lb/> of a legislative union, and had we been form<lb break="no"/>ing a legislative union, there might have <lb/> been some force in
                  the demand. But <lb/> the very essence of our compact is that <lb/> the union
                  shall be federal and not legisla<lb break="no"/>tive. Our Lower Canada friends
                  have agreed <lb/> to give us representation by population in <lb/> the Lower
                  House, on the express condition <lb/> that they shall have equality in the Upper
                  <lb/> House. On no other condition could we have <lb/> advanced a step; and, for
                  my part, I am quite <lb/> willing they should have it. In maintaining <lb/> the
                  existing sectional boundaries and handing <lb/> over the control of local matters
                  to local <lb/> bodies, we recognize, to a certain extent, a <lb/> diversity of
                  interests; and it was quite natural <lb/> that the protection for those interests,
                  by <lb/> equality in the Upper Chamber, should he <lb/> demanded by the less
                  numerous provinces. <lb/> Honorable gentlemen may say that it will <lb/> erect a
                  barrier in the Upper House against <lb/> the just influence that Upper Canada will
                     ex<lb break="no"/>ercise, by her numbers, in the Lower House<lb/> over the
                  general legislation of the country. <lb/> That may be true, to a certain extent,
                  but <lb/> honorable gentlemen will bear in mind that <lb/> that barrier, be it
                  more or less, will not affect <lb/> money bills. (Hear, hear.) Hitherto we <lb/>
                  have been paying a vast proportion of the <lb/> taxes, with little or no control
                  over the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. But, under this plan, by our <lb/> just
                  influence in the Lower Chamber; we <lb/> shall hold the purse strings. If, from
                  this <lb/> concession of equality in the Upper Chamber, <lb/> we are restrained
                  from forcing through meas<lb break="no"/>ures which our friends of Lower Canada
                  may <lb/> consider injurious to their interests, we shall, <lb/> at any rate, have
                  power, which we never had <lb/> before, to prevent them from forcing through <lb/>
                  <cb/> whatever we may deem unjust to us. I <lb/> think the compromise a fair one,
                  and am per<lb break="no"/>suaded that it will work easily and satisfac<lb break="no"/>torily. (Hear, hear.) But it has been said <lb/> that the members
                  of the Upper House ought <lb/> not to be appointed by the Crown, but should <lb/>
                  continue to be elected by the people at large. <lb/> On that question my views
                  have been often <lb/> expressed. I have always been opposed to a <lb/> second
                  elective chamber, and I am so still, <lb/> from the conviction that two elective
                  houses <lb/> are inconsistent with the right working of the <lb/> British
                  parliamentary system. I voted, almost <lb/> alone, against the change when the
                  Council <lb/> was made elective, but I have lived to see a <lb/> vast majority of
                  those who did the deed wish <lb/> it had not been done. It is quite true, and I
                  <lb/> am glad to acknowledge it, that many evils an<lb break="no"/>ticipated from
                  the change, when the measure <lb/> was adopted, have not been realized. (Hear,
                  <lb/> hear.) I readily admit that men of the high<lb break="no"/>est character and
                  position have been brought <lb/> into the Council by the elective system, but it
                  <lb/> is equally true that the system of appointment <lb/> brought into it men of
                  the highest character <lb/> and position. Whether appointed by the Crown <lb/> or
                  elected by the people, since the introduction <lb/> of parliamentary government,
                  the men who have <lb/> composed the Upper House of this Legislature <lb/> have
                  been men who would have done honor to <lb/> any legislature in the world. But what
                  we <lb/> most feared was, that the Legislative Council<lb break="no"/>lors would
                  be elected under party responsibili<lb break="no"/>ties; that a partisan spirit
                  would soon show <lb/> itself in the chamber; and that the right. <lb/> would soon
                  be asserted to an equal control <lb/> with this House over money bills. That fear
                  <lb/> has not been realised to any dangerous extent. <lb/> But is it not possible
                  that such a claim might <lb/> ere long be asserted? Do we not hear, even <lb/>
                  now, mutterings of a coming demand for it? <lb/> Nor can we forget that the
                  elected members <lb/> came into that chamber gradually ; that the <lb/> large
                  number of old appointed members exer<lb break="no"/>cised much influence in
                  maintaining the old <lb/> forms of the House, the old style of debate, <lb/> and
                  the old barriers against encroachment on <lb/> the privileges of the commons. But
                  the ap<lb break="no"/>pointed members of the Council are gradually <lb/>passing
                  away, and when the elective element <lb/> becomes supreme, who will venture to
                  affirm <lb/> that the Council would not claim that power <lb/> over money bills
                  which this House claims as of <lb/> right belonging to itself? Could they not
                  justly <lb/> say that they represent the people as well as we <lb/> do, and that
                  the control of the purse strings <lb/> ought, therefore, to belong to them as much
                  as <lb/> to us. (Hear, hear.) It is said they have not <lb/>
                  <pb n="89" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0089.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">89</fw> the power. But what is to prevent them from <lb/> enforcing
                  it? Suppose we had a conservative <lb/> majority here, and a reform majority
                     above<lb break="no"/>or a conservative majority above an a reform <lb/>
                  majority here—all elected under party obliga<lb break="no"/>tions,—what is to
                  prevent a dead-lock between <lb/> the chambers? It may be called unconstitu<lb break="no"/>tional—but what is to prevent the Councillors <lb/> (especially if
                  they feel that in the dispute of <lb/> the hour they have the country at their
                  <lb/> back) from practically exercising all the pow<lb break="no"/>ers that belong
                  to us? They might amend <lb/> our money bills, they might throw out all our <lb/>
                  bills if they liked, and bring to a stop the <lb/> whole machinery of government.
                  And what <lb/> could we do to prevent them? But, even <lb/> supposing this were
                  not the case, and that the <lb/> elective Upper House continued to be guided <lb/>
                  by that discretion which has heretofore actu<lb break="no"/>ated its
                  proceedings,—still, I think, we must <lb/> all feel that the election of members
                  for such <lb/> enormous districts as form the constituencies <lb/> of the Upper
                  House has become a great prac<lb break="no"/>tical inconvenience. I say this from
                  personal <lb/> experience, having long taken an active inter<lb break="no"/>est in
                  the electoral contests in Upper Canada. <lb/> We have found greater difficulty in
                  inducing <lb/> candidates to offer for seats in the Upper <lb/> House, than in
                  getting ten times the number <lb/> for the Lower House. The constituencies are
                  <lb/> so vast, that it is difficult to find gentlemen <lb/> who have the will to
                  incur the labor of such <lb/> a contest, who are sufficiently known and <lb/>
                  popular enough throughout districts so wide, <lb/> and who have money
                  enough—(hear)— to <lb/> pay the enormous bills, not incurred in any <lb/> corrupt
                  way,—do not fancy that I mean that <lb/> for a moment—but the bills that are sent
                  in <lb/> after the contest is over, and which the candi<lb break="no"/>dates are
                  compelled to pay if they ever hope <lb/> to present themselves for re-election.
                  (Hear, <lb/> hear.) But honorable gentlemen say—"This <lb/> is all very well, but
                  you are taking an impor<lb break="no"/>tant power out of the hands of the people,
                  <lb/> which they now possess." Now this is a <lb/> mistake. We do not propose to
                  do anything <lb/> of the sort. What we propose is, that the <lb/> Upper House
                  shall be appointed from the best <lb/> men of the country by those holding the
                     con<lb break="no"/>fidence of the representatives of the people in <lb/> this
                  Chamber. It is proposed that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the day, which only
                  lives by the ap<lb break="no"/>proval of this Chamber, shall make the ap<lb break="no"/>pointments, and be responsible to the people <lb/> for the
                  selections they shall make. (Hear, <lb/> hear.) Not a single appointment could be
                  made, with regard to which the Government<lb/> would not be open to censure, and
                  which the<lb/>
                  <cb/> representatives of the people, in this House, <lb/> would not have an
                  opportunity of condemning. <lb/> For myself, I have maintained the appointed <lb/>
                  principle, as in opposition to the elective, ever <lb/> since came into public
                  life, and have never <lb/> hesitated, when before the people, to state my <lb/>
                  opinions in the broadest manner; and yet not <lb/> in a single instance have I
                  ever found a con<lb break="no"/>stituency in Upper Canada, or a public meet<lb break="no"/>ing declaring its disapproval of appointment <lb/> by the Crown and
                  its desire for election by the <lb/> people at large. When the change was made
                  <lb/>in 1855 there was not a single petition from <lb/> the people asking for
                  it—it was in a manner <lb/> forced on the Legislature. The real reason <lb/> for
                  the change was, that before Responsible <lb/> Government was introduced into this
                  country, <lb/> while the old oligarchical system existed, the <lb/> Upper House
                  continuously and systemati<lb break="no"/>cally was at war with the popular
                  branch, and <lb/> threw out every measure of a liberal ten<lb break="no"/>dency.
                  The result was, that in the famous <lb/> ninety-two resolutions the introduction
                  of the <lb/> elective principle into the Upper House was <lb/> declared to be
                  indispensable. So long as Mr. <lb/> ROBERT BALDWIN remained in public life, <lb/>
                  the thing could not be done; but when he <lb/> left, the deed was consummated. But
                  it is <lb/> said, that if the members are to be appointed <lb/> for life, the
                  number should be unlimited<lb break="no"/>that, in the event of a dead lock
                  arising be<lb break="no"/>tween that chamber and this, there should be <lb/> power
                  to overcome the difficulty by the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of more members.
                  Well, under <lb/> the British system, in the case of a legislative <lb/> union,
                  that might be a legitimate provision. <lb/> But honorable gentlemen must see that
                  the <lb/> limitation of the numbers in the Upper House <lb/> lies at the base of
                  the whole compact on <lb/> which this scheme rests. (Hear, hear.) It <lb/> is
                  perfectly clear, as was contended by those <lb/> who represented Lower Canada in
                  the Con<lb break="no"/>ference, that if the number of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Councillors was made capable of in<lb break="no"/>crease, you would
                  thereby sweep away the <lb/> whole protection they had from the Upper <lb/>
                  Chamber. But it has been said that, though <lb/> you may not give the power to the
                  Executive <lb/> to increase the numbers of the Upper House, <lb/> in the event of
                  a dead-lock, you might limit <lb/> the term for which the members are appointed.
                  <lb/> I was myself in favor of that proposition. I <lb/> thought it would be well
                  to provide for a <lb/> more frequent change in the composition of the <lb/> Upper
                  House, and lessen the danger of the <lb/> chamber being largely composed of
                  gentlemen <lb/> whose advanced years might forbid the punc<lb break="no"/>tual and
                  vigorous discharge of their public <lb/>
                  <pb n="90" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0090.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">90</fw> duties. Still, the objection made to this was <lb/> very
                  strong. It was said: "Suppose you <lb/> appoint them for nine years, what will be
                  the <lb/> effect? For the last three or four years of' <lb/> their term they would
                  be anticipating its <lb/> expiry, and anxiously looking to the Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the day for reappointment; and the <lb/> consequence
                  would be that a third of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers would be under the influence
                  of the Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive." The desire was to render the Upper <lb/> House
                  a thoroughly independent body—one <lb/> that would be in the best position to
                  canvass <lb/> dispassionately the measures of this House, and <lb/> stand up for
                  the public interests in opposition <lb/> to hasty or partisan legislation. It was
                     con<lb break="no"/>tended that there is no fear of a dead-lock. <lb/> We were
                  reminded how the system of appoint<lb break="no"/>ing for life had worked in past
                  years, since <lb/> Responsible Government was introduced; we <lb/> were told that
                  the complaint was not then, <lb/> that the Upper Chamber had been too obstruc<lb break="no"/>tive a body—not that it had sought to restrain <lb/> the popular
                  will, but that it had too faith<lb break="no"/>fully reflected the popular will.
                  Undoubtedly <lb/> that was the complaint formerly pressed upon <lb/> us—(hear,
                  hear)—and I readily admit that <lb/> if ever there was a body to whom we could
                  <lb/> safely entrust the power which by this mea<lb break="no"/>sure we propose to
                  confer on the members <lb/> of the Upper Chamber, it is the body of <lb/>
                  gentlemen who at this moment compose <lb/> the Legislative Council of Canada. The
                  <lb/> forty-eight Councillors for Canada are to <lb/> be chosen from the present
                  chamber. There <lb/> are now thirty-four members from the one <lb/> section, and
                  thirty-five from the other. I <lb/> believe that of the sixty-nine, some will not
                  <lb/> desire to make their appearance here again, <lb/> others, unhappily, from
                  years and infirmity, <lb/> may not have strength to do so; and there <lb/> may be
                  others who will not desire to qualify <lb/> under the Statute. It is quite clear
                  that when <lb/> twenty-four are selected for Upper Canada <lb/> and twenty-four
                  for Lower Canada, very few <lb/> indeed of the present House will be excluded
                  <lb/> from the Federal Chamber; and I confess I <lb/> am not without hope that
                  there may be some <lb/> way yet found of providing for all who desire <lb/> it, an
                  honorable position in the Legislature <lb/> of the country. (Hear, hear.) And,
                  after <lb/> all, is it not an imaginary fear—that of a <lb/> dead-lock? Is it at
                  all probable that any <lb/> body of gentlemen who may compose the <lb/> Upper
                  House, appointed as they will be for <lb/> life, acting as they will do on
                  personal and <lb/> not party responsibility, possessing as they <lb/> must, a deep
                  stake in the welfare of the <lb/> country, and desirous as they must be of <lb/>
                  <cb/> holding the esteem of their fellow subjects<lb break="no"/>would take so
                  unreasonable a course as to <lb/> imperil the whole political fabric? The <lb/>
                  British House of Peers itself does not venture, <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">á l'outrance</hi>, to resist the popular will, and <lb/> can it be anticipated
                  that our Upper Chamber <lb/> would set itself rashly against the popular will?
                  <lb/> If any fear is to be entertained in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter, is it not
                  rather that the Councillors will <lb/> be found too thoroughly in harmony with the
                  <lb/> popular feeling of the day? An we have <lb/> this satisfaction at any rate,
                  that, so far as its <lb/> first formation is concerned—so far as the pre<lb break="no"/>sent question is concerned—we shall have a <lb/> body of gentlemen
                  in whom every confidence <lb/> may be placed. (Hear, hear.) But it is ob<lb break="no"/>jected that in the constitution of the Upper <lb/> House, so far as
                  Lower Canada is concerned, <lb/> the existing electoral divisions are to be
                     main<lb break="no"/>tained, while, as regards Upper Canada, they <lb/> are to
                  be abolished—that the members from <lb/> Lower Canada are to sit as representing
                  the <lb/> divisions in which they reside or have their <lb/> property
                  qualification; while in Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada there is no such arrangement.
                     Un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly this is the fact; it has been so <lb/> arranged to
                  suit the peculiar position of this <lb/> section of the province. Our Lower Canada
                  <lb/> friends felt that they had French Canadian <lb/> interests and British
                  interests to be protected, <lb/> and they conceived that the existing system<lb/>
               </p>
            <p> of electoral divisions would give protection to <lb/> these separate interests. We,
                  in Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, on the other hand, were quite content <lb/> that
                  they should settle that among them<lb break="no"/>selves, and maintain their
                  existing divisions if <lb/> they chose. But, so far as we in the west <lb/> were
                  concerned, we had no such separate in<lb break="no"/>terests to protect—we had no
                  diversities of <lb/> origin or language to reconcile—and we felt <lb/> that the
                  true interest of Upper Canada was <lb/> that her very best men should be sent to
                  the <lb/> Legislative Council, wherever they might <lb/> happen to reside or
                  wherever their property <lb/> was located. (Hear, hear.) If there is one <lb/>
                  evil in the American system which in my <lb/> mind stands out as preeminently its
                  greatest <lb/> defect, except universal suffrage, it is that <lb/> under that
                  Constitution the representatives of <lb/> the people must reside in the
                  constituencies <lb/> for which they sit. (Hear, hear.) The result <lb/> is that a
                  public man,—no matter what his <lb/> talent, or what his position—no matter how
                  <lb/> necessary it may be for the interest of the <lb/> country that he should be
                  in public life, unless <lb/> he happens to belong to the political party <lb/>
                  popular for the time being in the constituency <lb/> where he resides, cannot
                  possibly find a seat <lb/>
                  <pb n="91" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0091.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">91</fw> in Congress. And over and over again have we <lb/> seen the
                  very best men of the Republic, the <lb/> most illustrious names recorded in its
                  political <lb/> annals, driven out of the legislature of their <lb/> country,
                  simply because the majority in the <lb/> electoral division in which they lived
                  was of <lb/> a different political party from them. I do <lb/> think the British
                  system infinitely better than <lb/> that, securing as it does that public men may
                  <lb/> be trained to public life, with the assured <lb/> conviction that if they
                  prove themselves wor<lb break="no"/>thy of public confidence, and gain a position
                  <lb/> in the country, constituencies will always be <lb/> found to avail
                  themselves of their services, what<lb break="no"/>ever be the political party to
                  which they may <lb/> adhere. You may make politicians by the <lb/> other, but
                  assuredly this is the way that states<lb break="no"/>men are produced. But it is
                  further objected <lb/> that the property qualification of the members <lb/> of the
                  Upper House from Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land and Newfoundland may be
                  either real or <lb/> personal estate, while in the others it is to be <lb/> real
                  estate alone. This is correct; but I fancy <lb/> it matters little to us upon what
                  species of <lb/> property our friends in Prince Edward Island <lb/> or in
                  Newfoundland base their qualification. <lb/> Here in Canada real estate is
                  abundant; every <lb/> one can obtain it; and admittedly by all it is <lb/> the
                  best qualification, if it be advisable to <lb/> have any property qualification at
                  all. But <lb/> in Newfoundland it would be exceedingly in<lb break="no"/>convenient to enforce such a rule. The pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands there are
                  not even surveyed to any <lb/> considerable extent; the people are almost <lb/>
                  entirely engaged in fishing and commercial <lb/> pursuits, and to require a real
                  estate qualifi<lb break="no"/>cation would be practically to exclude some <lb/> of
                  its best public men from the Legislative <lb/> Council. Then in Prince Edward
                  Island a <lb/> large portion of the island is held in exten<lb break="no"/>sive
                  tracts by absentee proprietors and leased <lb/> to the settlers. A feud of long
                  standing has <lb/> been the result, and there would be some <lb/> difficulty in
                  finding landed proprietors who <lb/> would be acceptable to the people as mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Upper House. This also must <lb/> be remembered, that
                  it will be every diff<lb break="no"/>erent thing for a member from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land or Prince Edward Island to attend the <lb/> Legislature at
                  Ottawa from what it is for one <lb/> of ourselves to there. He must give up <lb/>
                  not only his time, but the comfort and conve<lb break="no"/>nience of being near
                  home—and it is desirable <lb/> to throw no unnecessary obstacle in the way <lb/>
                  of our getting the very best men from these <lb/> provinces. (Hear.) But it is
                  further ob<lb break="no"/>jected that these resolutions do not define how <lb/>
                  the legislative councillors are to be chosen at <lb/>
                  <cb/> first. I apprehend, however, there is no doubt <lb/> whatever as regards
                  that. Clause 14 says: <lb/> "the first selection of the members to constitute
                  <lb/> the Federal Legislative Council shall be made <lb/> from the members of the
                  now existing legis<lb break="no"/>lative councils, by the Crown, at the recom<lb break="no"/>mendation of the General Executive Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, upon
                  the nomination of the respective <lb/> local governments." The clear meaning of
                  <lb/> this clause simply is, that the present gov<lb break="no"/>ernments of the
                  several provinces are to <lb/> choose out of the existing bodies—so far as <lb/>
                  they can find gentlemen willing and qualified <lb/> to serve—the members who shall
                  at starting <lb/> compose the Federal Legislative Council; <lb/> that they are to
                  present the names so selected <lb/> to the Executive Council of British America
                  <lb/> when constituted—and on the advice of that. <lb/> body the Councillors will
                  be appointed by the <lb/> Crown. (Hear.) And such has been the <lb/> spirit shown
                  from first to last in carrying out <lb/> the compact of July last by all the
                  parties to <lb/> it, that for one have no apprehension what<lb break="no"/>ever
                  that full justice will not be done to the <lb/> party which may be a minority in
                  the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but is certainly not in a minority either <lb/> in
                  the country or in this House. I speak not <lb/> only of Upper Canada but of Lower
                  Canada <lb/> as well-<lb/>

                  laughs, but I assure him, and he will not say <lb/> I do so for the purpose of
                  deceiving him, that <lb/> having been present in Conference and in <lb/> Council,
                  having heard all the discussions and <lb/> well ascertained the feelings of all
                  associated <lb/> with me, I have not a shadow of a doubt on <lb/> my mind that
                  full justice will be done in the <lb/> selection of the first Federal Councillors,
                  not <lb/> only to those who may have been in the habit <lb/> of acting with me,
                  but also to those who have <lb/> acted with my honorable friend the member <lb/>
                  for Hochelaga. (Hear, hear.) Now, Mr. <lb/> SPEAKER, I believe I have answered
                  every <lb/> objection that has come from any quarter <lb/> against the proposed
                  constitution o the Fed<lb break="no"/>eral Legislature. I am persuaded there is
                  <lb/> not one well-founded objection that can be <lb/> urged against it. It is
                  just to all parties; it <lb/> remedies the gross injustice of the existing <lb/>
                  system; and I am convinced it will not only <lb/> work easily and safely, but be
                  entirely satis<lb break="no"/>factory to the great mass of our people. But <lb/> I
                  go further; I say that were all the objec<lb break="no"/>tions urged against this
                  scheme sound and <lb/> cogent, they sink into utter insignificance in <lb/> view
                  of all the miseries this scheme will re<lb break="no"/>lieve us from,—in view of
                  all the difficulties <lb/>

                  <lb/> that must surround any measure of parlia<lb break="no"/>mentary reform for
                  Canada that could possi<lb break="no"/>bly be devised. (Cheers.) Will honorable
                  <lb/> gentlemen who spend their energies in hunt<lb break="no"/>ing out blemishes
                  in this scheme, remember <lb/> for a moment the utter injustice of the one <lb/>
                  we have at present? Public opinion has made <lb/> rapid strides in the last six
                  months on the rep<lb break="no"/>resentation question,—but think what it was <lb/>
                  a week before the present coalition was formed! <lb/> Remember how short a time
                  has elapsed since <lb/> the member for Peel (Hon. Mr. J. HILLYARD <lb/> CAMERON)
                  proposed to grant one additional <lb/> member to Upper Canada, and could not carry
                  <lb/> even that. Remember that but a few weeks <lb/> ago the hon. member for
                  Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. <lb/> DORION), who now leads the crusade against <lb/> this
                  measure, publicly declared that five or six <lb/> additional members was all Upper
                  Canada was <lb/> entitled to, and that with these the Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>dians would be content for many years to come. <lb/> (Hear, hear.) And when he
                  has reflected on <lb/> all this, let the man who is disposed to carp <lb/> at this
                  great measure of representative reform, <lb/> justify his conduct, if he can, to
                  the thousands <lb/> of disfranchised freeholders of Upper Canada <lb/> demanding
                  justice at our hands. (Cheers.) <lb/> For myself, sir, I unhesitatingly say, that
                  the <lb/> complete justice which this measure secures, <lb/> to the people of
                  Upper Canada in the vital <lb/> matter of parliamentary representation alone,
                  <lb/> renders all the blemishes averred against <lb/> it utterly contemptible in
                  the balance.<lb break="no"/>(Continued cheers.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, the <lb/> second
                  feature of this scheme as a remedial <lb/> measure is, that it removes, to a large
                  extent, <lb/> the injustice of which Upper Canada has com<lb break="no"/>plained
                  in financial matters. We in Upper <lb/> Canada have complained that though we paid
                  <lb/> into the public treasury more than three- <lb break="yes"/> fourths of the
                  whole revenue, we had less con<lb break="no"/>trol over the system of taxation and
                  the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of the public moneys than the <lb/> people of
                  Lower Canada. Well, sir, the <lb/> scheme in your hand remedies that. The <lb/>
                  absurd line of separation between the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces is swept away for
                  general matters; we <lb/> are to have seventeen additional members in <lb/> the
                  house that holds the purse; and the tax<lb break="no"/>pa ers of the country,
                  wherever they reside, <lb/> wil have their just share of influence over <lb/>
                  revenue and expenditure. (Hear, hear.) We <lb/> have also complained that immense
                  sums of <lb/> public money have been systematically taken <lb/> from the public
                  chest for local purposes of <lb/> Lower Canada, in which the people of Upper <lb/>
                  Canada had no interest whatever, though com<lb break="no"/>pelled to contribute
                  three-fourths of the cash.<lb/></p>
            
               <cb/>
            <p> Well, sir, this scheme remedies that. All local <lb/> matters are to be banished
                  from the General <lb/> Legislature; local governments are to have <lb/> control
                  over local affairs, and if our friends in <lb/> Lower Canada choose to be
                  extravagant, they <lb/> will have to bear the burden of it themselves. <lb/>
                  (Hear, hear.) No longer shall we have to <lb/> complain that one section pays the
                  cash while <lb/> the other spends it; hereafter, they who pay <lb/> will spend,
                  and they who spend more than they <lb/> ought will have to bear the brunt. (Hear,
                  <lb/> hear.) It was a great thing to accomplish <lb/> this, if we had accomplished
                  nothing more, <lb/> —for if we look back on our doings of the last <lb/> fifteen
                  years, I think it will be acknowledged <lb/> that the greatest jobs perpetrated
                  were of a <lb/> local character—that our fiercest contests were <lb/> about local
                  matters that stirred up sectional <lb/> jealousies and indignation to its deepest
                  depth. <lb/> (Hear, hear.) We have further complained <lb/> that if a sum was
                  properly demanded for some <lb/> legitimate local purpose in one section, an <lb/>
                  equivalent sum had to be appropriated to the <lb/> other as an offset,—thereby
                  entailing prodigal <lb/> expenditure, and unnecessarily increasing the <lb/>
                  public debt. Well, sir, this scheme puts an <lb/> end to that. Each province is to
                  determine <lb/> for itself its own wants, and to find the money <lb/> to meet them
                  from its own resources. (Hear, <lb/> hear.) But, sir, I am told that though true
                  <lb/> it is that local matters are to be separated and <lb/> the burden of local
                  expenditure placed upon <lb/> local shoulders, we have made an exception <lb/>
                  from that principle in providing that a subsidy <lb/> of eighty cents per head
                  shall be taken from <lb/> the federal chest and granted to the local <lb/>
                  governments for local purposes. Undoubtedly <lb/> this is the fact—and I do not
                  hesitate to admit <lb/> that it would have been better if this had been <lb/>
                  otherwise. I trust I commit no breach of <lb/> discretion in stating that in
                  Conference I was <lb/> one of the strongest advocates for defraying <lb/> the
                  whole of the local expenditures of the <lb/> local governments by means of direct
                     taxa<lb break="no"/>tion, and that there were liberal men in all <lb/> sections
                  of the provinces who would gladly <lb/> have had it so arranged. But, Mr. SPEAKER,
                  <lb/> there was one difficulty in the way—a difficult <lb/> which has often before
                  been encountered in this <lb/> world—and that difficulty was simply this, it <lb/>
                  could not be done. (Hear, and laughter.) We <lb/> could neither have carried it in
                  Conference <lb/> nor yet in any one of the existing provincial <lb/> legislatures.
                  Our friends in Lower Canada, <lb/> I am afraid, have a constitutional
                  disinclination <lb/> to direct taxation, and it was obvious that if <lb/> the
                  Confederation scheme had had attached to <lb/> it a provision for the imposition
                  of such a <lb/>
                  <pb n="93" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0093.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">93</fw> system of taxation, my honorable friends op<lb break="no"/>posite would have had a much better chance <lb/> of success in blowing the
                  bellows of agitation <lb/> than they now have. (Laughter, and cheers.) <lb/> The
                  objection, moreover, was not confined to <lb/> Lower Canada—all the Lower
                  Provinces stood <lb/> in exactly the same position. They have not <lb/> a
                  municipal system such as we have, discharg<lb break="no"/>ing many of the
                  functions of government; <lb/> but their General Government performs all <lb/> the
                  duties which in Upper Canada devolve <lb/> upon our municipal councils, as well as
                  upon <lb/> Parliament. If then the Lower Provinces <lb/> had been asked to
                  maintain their customs <lb/> duties for federal purposes, and to impose on <lb/>
                  themselves by the same act direct taxation for <lb/> all their local purposes, the
                  chances of carrying <lb/> the scheme of union would have been greatly <lb/>
                  lessened. (Hear, hear.) But I apprehend <lb/> that if we did not succeed in
                  putting this <lb/> matter on the footing that would have been <lb/> the best, at
                  least we did the next best thing. <lb/> Two courses were open to us—either to
                     sur<lb break="no"/>render to the local governments some source <lb/> of
                  indirect revenue, some tax which the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government proposed
                  to retain,—or col<lb break="no"/>lect the money by the federal machinery, and
                  <lb/> distribute it to the local governments for <lb/> local purposes. And we
                  decided in favor of <lb/> the latter. We asked the representatives of <lb/> the
                  different governments to estimate how <lb/> much they would require after the
                     inaugura<lb break="no"/>tion of the federal system to carry on their <lb/>
                  local machinery. As at first presented to us, <lb/> the annual sum required for
                  all the provinces <lb/> was something like five millions of dollars—an <lb/>
                  amount that could not possibly have been al<lb break="no"/>lotted. The great
                  trouble was that some of <lb/> the governments are vastly more expensive <lb/>
                  than others—extensive countries, with sparse <lb/> populations, necessarily
                  requiring more money <lb/> per head for local government than countries <lb/> more
                  densely populated. But as any grant <lb/> given from the common chest, for local
                     pur<lb break="no"/>poses, to one province, must be extend to <lb/> all, on the
                  basis of population, it follows that <lb/> for every $1,000 given, for example, to
                  New <lb/> Brunswick, we must give over $1,300 to Nova <lb/> Scotia, $4,000 to
                  Lower Canada, and $6,000 <lb/> to Upper Canada—thereby drawing from the <lb/>
                  federal exchequer much large sums than <lb/> these provinces needed for local
                  purposes. <lb/> The course we adopted then was this: We <lb/> formed a committee
                  of Finance Ministers and <lb/> made each of them go over his list of expendi<lb break="no"/>tures, lopping off unnecessary services and <lb/> cutting down
                  every item to the lowest possible <lb/> figure. By this means we succeeded in
                     re<lb break="no"/><cb/>ducing the total annual subsidy required for <lb/> local
                  government to the sum of $2,630,000<lb break="no"/>of which Lower Canada will
                  receive annually <lb/> $880,000, and Upper Canada $1,120,000. But<lb/> it is said
                  that in addition to her eighty cents <lb/> per head under this arrangement, New
                     Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick is to receive an extra grant from the <lb/> federal
                  chest of $63,000 annually for ten <lb/> years. Well, this is perfectly true. After
                  <lb/> cutting down as I have explained the local <lb/> expenditures to the lowest
                  mark, it was found <lb/> that New Brunswick and Newfoundland could <lb/> not
                  possibly carry on their local governments <lb/> with the sum per head that would
                  suffice for <lb/> all the rest. New Brunswick imperatively <lb/> required $63,000
                  per annum beyond her <lb/> share, and we had either to find that sum for <lb/> her
                  or give up the hope of union. The <lb/> question then arose, would it not be
                  better to <lb/> give New Brunswick a special grant of <lb/> $63,000 for a limited
                  number of years, so that <lb/> her local revenues might have time to be <lb/>
                  developed, rather than increase the subsidy to <lb/> all the local governments,
                  thereby lacing <lb/> an additional burden on the federal exchequer <lb/> of over
                  eight hundred thousand dollars per <lb/> annum? We came unanimously to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that the extra sum needed by New <lb/> Brunswick was too
                  small to be allowed to stand <lb/> in the way of union—we also determined that it
                  <lb/> would be the height of absurdity to impose a <lb/> permanent burden on the
                  country of $800,000 <lb/> a year, simply to escape a payment of $63,000 <lb/> for
                  ten years—and so it came about that New <lb/> Brunswick got this extra grant—an
                     arrange<lb break="no"/>ment which received and receives now my <lb/> hearty
                  approval. (Hear, hear.) It is only <lb/> right to say, however, that New Brunswick
                  <lb/> may possibly be in a position to do without <lb/> this money. The House is
                  aware that the <lb/> Federal Government is to assume the debts of <lb/> the
                  several provinces, each province being en<lb break="no"/>titled to throw upon it a
                  debt of $25 per <lb/> head of its population. Should the debt of <lb/> any
                  province exceed $25 per head, it is to <lb/> pay interest on the excess to the
                  federal <lb/> treasury; but should it fall below $25 per <lb/> head, it is to
                  receive interest from the feder<lb break="no"/>al treasury on the difference
                  between its <lb/> actual debt and the debt to which it is en<lb break="no"/>titled. Now, it so happens that the existing <lb/> debt of New Brunswick is much
                  less than it <lb/> is entitled to throw on the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.
                  It is, however, under liability for <lb/> certain works, which if proceeded with
                  would <lb/> bring its debt up to the mark of $25 a head. <lb/> But if these works
                  are not proceeded with <lb/> New Brunswick will be entitled to a large <lb/>
                  <pb n="94" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0094.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">94</fw> amount of annual interest from the federal <lb/> chest, and
                  that money is to be applied to the <lb/> reduction of the sixty-three thousand
                  extra <lb/> grant. (Hear, hear.) And this, moreover, <lb/> is not to be forgotten
                  as regards New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, that she brings into the union exten<lb break="no"/>sive railways now in profitable operation, the <lb/> revenues from
                  which are to go into the federal <lb/> chest. (Hear.) A similar arrangement was
                  <lb/> found necessary as regards the Island of <lb/> Newfoundland—it, too, being a
                  vast country <lb/> with a sparse population. It was found ab<lb break="no"/>solutely essential that an additional grant <lb/> beyond eighty cents per head
                  should be made <lb/> to enable her Local Government to be properly <lb/> carried
                  on. But, in consideration of this <lb/> extra allowance, Newfoundland is to cede
                  to <lb/> the Federal Government her Crown lands and <lb/> minerals—and assuredly ,
                  if the reports of geo<lb break="no"/>logists are well founded, this arrangement
                  will <lb/> be as advantageous to us as it will be to the <lb/> inhabitants of
                  Newfoundland. I am per<lb break="no"/>suaded then, Mr. SPEAKER, that the House
                  <lb/> will feel with me that we in Canada have very <lb/> little to complain of in
                  regard to the subsidies <lb/> for local government. But if a doubt yet <lb/>
                  remains on the mind of any honorable member, <lb/> let him examine the Trade
                  Returns of the <lb/> several provinces, and he will see that, from <lb/> the large
                  quantity of dutiable goods consumed <lb/> in the Maritime Provinces, they have
                  received <lb/> no undue advantage under the arrangement. <lb/> Let this too ever
                  be kept in mind that the $2,630,000 to be distributed to the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments from the federal chest is to be in <lb/> full and final
                  extinguishment of all claims <lb/> hereafter for local purposes; and that if this
                  <lb/> from any cause does not suffice, the local <lb/> governments must supply all
                  deficiencies from <lb/> direct tax on their own localities. (Hear, <lb/> hear.)
                  And let honorable members from <lb/> Upper Canada who carp at this annual sub<lb break="no"/>sidy, remember for a moment what we pay <lb/> now, and they will
                  cease their grumbling. <lb/> Of all the money raised by the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for local purposes in Canada, the <lb/> tax-payers of Upper
                  Canada now pay more <lb/> than three-fourths; but far from getting back <lb/> in
                  proportion to what they contribute, or even <lb/> in proportion to their
                  population, they do not <lb/> get one-half of the money spent for local <lb/>
                  purposes. But how different will it be under <lb/> Federation! Nine hundred
                  thousand people <lb/> will come into the union, who will contribute <lb/> to the
                  revenue quite as much, man for man, <lb/> as the Upper Canadians, and in the
                     distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of the local subsidy we will receive our <lb/>
                  share on the basis of population. A very <lb/>
                  <cb/> different arrangement from that we now endure. <lb/> (Hear, hear.) I confess
                  to you, sir, that one <lb/> of the strongest arguments in my mind for <lb/>
                  Confederation is the economical ideas of the <lb/> people of these Maritime
                  Provinces, and the con<lb break="no"/>viction that the influence of their public
                  men in <lb/> our legislative halls will be most salutary in all <lb/> financial
                  matters. A more economical people it <lb/> would be difficult to find; their prime
                     min<lb break="no"/>isters and their chief justices get but £600 <lb/> a year,
                  Halifax currency, and the rest of their <lb/> civil list is in much the same
                  proportion. <lb/> (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, there is <lb/> another great
                  evil in our existing system that <lb/> this scheme remedies; it secures to the
                  people <lb/> of each province full control over the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration
                  of their own internal affairs. We in <lb/> Upper Canada have complained that the
                  <lb/> minority of our representatives, the party de<lb break="no"/>feated at the
                  polls of Upper Canada, have <lb/> been, year after year, kept in office by Lower
                  <lb/> Canada votes, and that all the local patron<lb break="no"/>age of our
                  section has been dispensed by <lb/> those who did not possess the confidence <lb/>
                  of the people. Well, sir, this scheme remedies <lb/> that. The local patronage
                  will be under local <lb/> control, and the wishes of the majority in <lb/> each
                  section will be carried out in all local <lb/> matters. (Hear, hear.) We have
                  complained <lb/> that the land system was not according to the <lb/> views of our
                  western people; that free lands <lb/> for actual settlers was the right policy for
                  us <lb/> —that the price of a piece of land squeezed <lb/> out of an immigrant was
                  no consideration <lb/> in comparison with the settlement among us <lb/> of a hardy
                  and industrious family; and that <lb/> the colonization road system was far from
                  <lb/> satisfactory. Well, sir, this scheme remedies <lb/> that. Each province is
                  to have control of its <lb/> own crown lands, crown timber and crown <lb/>
                  minerals,—and will be free to take such steps <lb/> for developing them as each
                  deems best.<lb break="no"/>(Hear, hear.) We have complained that local <lb/> works
                  of various kinds—roads, bridges and <lb/> landing piers, court houses, gaols and
                  other <lb/> structures—have been erected in an inequitable <lb/> and improvident
                  manner. Well, sir, this <lb/> scheme remedies that; all local works are to <lb/>
                  be constructed by the localities and defrayed <lb/> from local funds. And so on
                  through the whole <lb/> extensive details of internal local administra<lb break="no"/>tion will this reform extend. The people of <lb/> Upper Canada will
                  have the entire control of <lb/> their local matters, and will no longer have to
                  <lb/> betake themselves to Quebec for leave to open <lb/> a road, to select a
                  county town, or appoint a <lb/> coroner. But I am told that to this general <lb/>
                  principle of placing all local matters under <lb/>
                  <pb n="95" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0095.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">95<lb/></fw> local control, an exception has been made in <lb/> to
                  the common schools. (Hear, hear.) <lb/> The clause complained of is as
                  follows:-<lb/>
               </p>
            <p>6. Education; saving the rights and
privileges <lb/>
which the Protestant or Catholic minority in <lb/>
both Canadas may possess as to their Denomi<lb break="no"/>national Schools at the time when the Union <lb/>
goes into operation. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Now, I need hardly remind the House that<lb/>
I have always opposed and continue to oppose <lb/>
the system of sectarian education, so far as the <lb/>
public chest is concerned. I have never had <lb/>
any hesitation on that point. I have never <lb/>
been able to see why all the people of the <lb/>
province, to whatever sect they may belong, <lb/>
should not send their children to the same <lb/>
common schools to receive the ordinary <lb/>
branches of instruction. I regard the parent <lb/>
and the pastor as the best religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tors—and so long as the religious faith of the <lb/>
children is uninterfered with, and ample op<lb break="no"/>tunity afforded to the clergy to
give religious <lb/>
instruction to the children of their flocks, I <lb/>
cannot conceive any sound objection to mixed <lb/>
schools. But while in the Conference and <lb/>
elsewhere I have always maintained this view, <lb/>
and always given my vote against sectarian <lb/>
public schools, I am bound to admit, as I have <lb/>
always admitted, that the sectarian system, <lb/>
earned to the limited extent it has yet been in <lb/>
Upper Canada, and confined as it chiefly is to <lb/>
cities and towns, has not been a very great <lb/>
practical injury. The real cause of alarm was <lb/>
that the admission of the sectarian principle <lb/>
was there, and that at any moment it might <lb/>
be extended to such a degree as to split up <lb/>
our school system altogether. There are but <lb/>
a hundred separate schools in Upper Canada, <lb/>
out of some four thousand, and all Roman <lb/>
Catholic. But if the Roman Catholics are <lb/>
entitled to separate schools and to go on <lb/>
extending their operations, so are the members <lb/>
of the Church of England, the Presbyterians, <lb/>
the Methodists, and all other sects. No can<lb break="no"/>did Roman Catholic will deny this for a <lb/>
moment; and there lay the great danger to <lb/>
our educational fabric, that the separate <lb/>
system might gradually extend itself until the <lb/>
whole country was studded with nurseries <lb/>
of sectarianism, most hurtful to the best <lb/>
interests of the province, and entailing an <lb/>
enormous expense to sustain the hosts of <lb/>
teachers that so prodigal a system of public <lb/>
instruction must inevitably entail. Now <lb/>
it is known to every honorable member of <lb/>
this House that an Act was passed in 1863, <lb/>
as a final settlement of this sectarian contro<lb break="no"/>versy. I was not in Quebec at the time, but <lb/>
               <cb/>
               if I had been here I would have voted
against <lb/>
that bill, because it extended the facilities for <lb/>
establishing separate schools. It had, how<lb break="no"/>ever, this good feature, that it was accepted <lb/>
by the Roman Catholic authorities, and car<lb break="no"/>ried through Parliament as a final compromise <lb/>
of the question in Upper Canada. When, <lb/>
therefore, it was proposed that a provision <lb/>
should be inserted in the Confederation scheme <lb/>
to bind that compact of 1863 and declare it a <lb/>
final settlement, so that we should not be com<lb break="no"/>pelled, as we have been since 1849,
to stand <lb/>
constantly to our arms, awaiting fresh attacks <lb/>
upon our common school system, the propo<lb break="no"/>sition seemed to me one that was not rashly <lb/>
to be rejected. (Hear, hear.) I admit that, <lb/>
from my point of view, this is a blot on the <lb/>
scheme before the House, it is, confessedly, one <lb/>
of the concessions from our side that had to be <lb/>
made to secure this great measure of reform. <lb/>
But assuredly, I, for one, have not the slightest <lb/>
hesitation in accepting it as a necessary condi<lb break="no"/>tion of the scheme of union, and doubly accept<lb break="no"/>able must it be in the eyes of honorable gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite, who were the authors of the bill <lb/>
of 1863. (Cheers.) But it was
urged that <lb/>
though this arrangement might perhaps be fair <lb/>
as regards Upper Canada, it was not so as re<lb break="no"/>gards Lower Canada, for there were matters of <lb/>
which the British population have long com<lb break="no"/>plained, and some amendments to the existing <lb/>School Act were required to secure them equal <lb/>
justice. Well, when this point was raised, <lb/>
gentlemen of all parties in Lower Canada at <lb/>
once expressed themselves prepared to treat it <lb/>
in a frank and conciliatory manner, with a <lb/>
view to removing any injustice that might be <lb/>
shown to exist; and on this understanding the <lb/>
educational clause was adopted by the Con<lb break="no"/>ference. <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —I would like to know <lb/>
                  how much "power" the honorable gentleman has <lb/> now to legislate upon it? Let

                  all the sectarian school acts of Upper <lb/> Canada, and how many votes would he
                  get for <lb/> it? Would twenty members vote for it out <lb/> of the one hundred
                  and thirty who com <lb/> this House? If the honorable gentleman had <lb/> been
                  struggling for fifteen years, as I have <lb/> been, to save the school system of
                  Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada from further extension of the sectarian <lb/>
                  element, he would have found precious little <lb/> diminution of power over it in
                  this very mod<lb break="no"/>erate compromise. And what says the hon<lb break="no"/><pb n="96" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0096.jpg"/><fw type="num">96</fw>orable gentleman to leaving the British popu<lb break="no"/>lation of Lower Canada in the unrestricted <lb/> were of the Local Legislature?
                  The Common <lb/> Schools of Lower Canada are not as in Upper <lb/> Canada—they are
                  almost entirely non-sectarian <lb/> Roman Catholic Schools. Does the honorable
                  <lb/> gentleman, then, desire to compel the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants of Lower
                  Canada to avail themselves of <lb/> Roman Catholic institutions, or leave their
                  <lb/> children without instruction? (Hear hear, and <lb/> cheers.) But, Mr.
                  SPEAKER, I am further in <lb/> favor of this scheme because it will bring to an
                  <lb/> end the sectional discord between Upper and <lb/> Lower Canada. It sweeps
                  away the boundary <lb/> line between the provinces so far as regards <lb/> matters
                  common to the whole people—it places <lb/> all on an equal level—and the members
                  of <lb/> the Federal Legislature will meet at last as <lb/> citizens of a common
                  country. The questions <lb/> that used to excite the most hostile feelings <lb/>
                  among us have been taken away from the <lb/> General Legislature, and placed under
                  the <lb/> control of the local bodies. No man need <lb/> hereafter be debarred
                  from success in public <lb/> life because his views, however popular in his <lb/>
                  own section, are unpopular in the other,—for <lb/> he will not have to deal with
                  sectional ques<lb break="no"/>tions ; and the temptation to the Government <lb/>
                  of the day to make capital out of local preju<lb break="no"/>dices will be greatly
                  lessened, if not altogether <lb/> at an end. What has rendered prominent <lb/>
                  public men in one section utterly unpopular <lb/> in the other in past years? Has
                  it been our <lb/> views on trade and commerce—immigration <lb/> —land
                  settlement—the canal system—the <lb/> tariff,—or any other of the great questions
                  <lb/> of national interest? No, sir, it was from our <lb/> views as to the
                  applying of public money <lb/> to local purposes—the allotment of public <lb/>
                  lands to local purposes,—the building of local <lb/> roads, bridges, and
                  landing-piers with public <lb/> funds—the chartering of ecclesiastical insti<lb break="no"/>tutions—the granting of public money for <lb/> sectarian
                  purposes—the interference with our <lb/> school system—and similar matters, that
                  the <lb/> hot feuds between Upper and Lower Canada <lb/> have chiefly arisen, and
                  caused our public men, <lb/> the more faithful they were to the opinions <lb/> and
                  wishes of one section, to be the more <lb/> unpopular in the other. A most happy
                  day <lb/> will it be for Canada when this bill goes into <lb/> effect, and all
                  these subjects of discord are <lb/> swept from the discussion of our Legislature.
                  <lb/> (Hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, I am further in <lb/> favor of this scheme as a
                  remedial measure, <lb/> because it brings to an end the doubt that has <lb/> so
                  long hung over our position, and gives a sta<lb break="no"/>bility to our future
                  in the eyes of the world that <lb/>
                  <cb/> could not otherwise have been attended. (Re<lb break="no"/>peated marks of
                  approval, but ironical cheers <lb/> from <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">Hon. Mr.
                     HOLTON</persName>.) The hon. member <lb/> for Chateauguay cries "hear, hea" in
                  a very <lb/> credulous tone; but the hon. member should <lb/> be one of the very
                  last to express doubts on <lb/> this point. Has he not, for many years, ad<lb break="no"/>mitted the absolute necessity of constitutional <lb/> changes, ere
                  peace and prosperity could be es<lb break="no"/>tablished in our land? Has he not
                  taken part <lb/> in the contests to obtain those changes ? Has <lb/> he not
                  experienced the harsh and hostile feel<lb break="no"/>ings that have pervaded this
                  House and the <lb/> whole country? And did he not sign the re<lb break="no"/>port
                  of my committee last session, declaring a <lb/> Federal union to be the true
                  solution of our <lb/> troubles, political and constitutional? And <lb/> does the
                  honorable member think these matters <lb/> were not well known in the United
                  States, <lb/> and that the hope of our annexation to the <lb/> republic was not
                  kept alive by them from year <lb/> to year? Does he fancy that our discords <lb/>
                  and discontent were not well known in Great <lb/> Britain, and that the capitalist
                  and the emi<lb break="no"/>grant were not influenced by our distractions? <lb/>
                  Does he fancy that people abroad, as well as <lb/> at home, did not perfectly
                  understand that <lb/> Upper Canada would not much longer submit <lb/> to the
                  injustice from which she suffered—and <lb/> that until the future relations of the
                  two sec<lb break="no"/>tions were adjusted, no one could predict <lb/> safely what
                  our future position might be? But <lb/> when the measure before us has been
                  adopted <lb/> —when justice has been done to both sections<lb break="no"/>when all
                  are placed on an equal footing—when <lb/> the sectional matters that rent us have
                  been <lb/> handed over to sectional control—when sec<lb break="no"/>tional
                  expenditure shall be placed on sectional <lb/> shoulders—will not a sense of
                  security and <lb/> stability be inspired, which we never before <lb/> enjoyed and
                  never could have enjoyed under <lb/> existing circumstances? (Cheers.) Viewed
                  <lb/> then, Mr. SPEAKER, from a merely Canadian <lb/> stand-point—viewed solely as
                  a remedial mea<lb break="no"/>sure—I fearlessly assert that the scheme in your
                  <lb/> hands is a just and satisfactory remedy for the <lb/> evils and injustice
                  that have so long distracted <lb/> the province—(cheers)—and so strongly do I
                  <lb/> feel this, that were every word of objection <lb/> urged against our union
                  with the Maritime <lb/> Provinces just and true to the very letter, I <lb/> would
                  not hesitate to adopt the union as the <lb/> price of a measure of constitutional
                  reform in <lb/> Canada, so just and so complete as now pro<lb break="no"/>posed.
                  (Cheers.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, so far from <lb/> the objections urged against union
                  with the <lb/> Maritime Provinces being sound, so far from <lb/> union with them
                  being a drawback to this <lb/>
                  <pb n="97" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0097.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">97</fw> measure, I regard it as the crowning advan<lb break="no"/>tage of the whole scheme. (Continued cheer<lb break="no"/>ing.) Sir, I make no
                  pretension to having <lb/> been in past years an advocate of the imme<lb break="no"/>diate union of the British American Colon<lb break="no"/>ies. I
                  always felt and always said that no <lb/> statesman could doubt that such was the
                  best <lb/> and almost the certain future destiny of these <lb/> colonies; but I
                  doubted greatly whether the <lb/> right time for the movement had yet arrived.
                  <lb/> I knew little of the Maritime Provinces or <lb/> the feelings of their
                  people ; the negotiations <lb/> for a union were likely to be difficult and long
                  <lb/> protracted, and I was unwilling to accept the <lb/> hope of a measure so
                  remote and so uncertain <lb/> in lieu of the practical remedy for practical <lb/>
                  evils in Canada which we were earnestly seeking <lb/> to obtain, and which our own
                  Legislature had <lb/> the power immediately to grant. But of late, <lb/> sir, all
                  this has been changed. The circum<lb break="no"/>stances are entirely altered. A
                  revolution <lb/> has occurred in Great Britain on the subject <lb/> of colonial
                  relations to the parent state—the <lb/> Government of the United States has become
                  <lb/> a great warlike power—our commercial rela<lb break="no"/>tions with the
                  republic are seriously threatened <lb/> —and every man in British America has now
                  <lb/> placed before him for solution the practical <lb/> question, what shall be
                  done in view of the <lb/> changed relations on which we are about to <lb/> enter?
                  Shall we continue to struggle along <lb/> as isolated communities, or shall we
                  unite <lb/> cordially together to extend our commerce, to <lb/> develope the
                  resources of our country and to <lb/> defend our soil? But more than this—many
                  <lb/> of us have learned, since we last met here, far <lb/> more of the Maritime
                  Provinces than we ever <lb/> did before. We have visited the Maritime <lb/>
                  Provinces—we have seen the country—we <lb/> have met the people and marked their
                     intelli<lb break="no"/>gence and their industry and their frugality<lb break="no"/>we have investigated their public affairs and <lb/> found them
                  satisfactory—we have discussed <lb/> terms of union with their statesmen and found
                  <lb/> that no insuperable obstacle to union exists, <lb/> and no necessity for
                  long delay. We come <lb/> to the consideration of the question to-day in <lb/> a
                  totally different position from what we ever <lb/> did before—and if the House
                  will grant me <lb/> its indulgence, I think I can present un<lb break="no"/>answerable arguments to show that this union <lb/> of all British America should
                  be heartily and <lb/> promptly accepted by all the provinces. <lb/> (Cheers) Mr.
                  SPEAKER, I am m favor of a <lb/> union of the British American Colonies, first,
                  <lb/> because it will raise us from the attitude of a <lb/> number of
                  inconsiderable colonies into a great <lb/> and powerful people. (Cheers.) The
                  united <lb/>
                  <cb/> population of Canada, Nova Scotia, New <lb/> Brunswick, Newfoundland and
                  Prince Edward <lb/> Island, is at this moment very close on four <lb/> millions of
                  souls. Now, there are in Europe <lb/> forty-eight Sovereign States, and out of
                  that <lb/> number there are only eleven having a greater <lb/> population than
                  these colonies united—(hear, <lb/> hear)—while three of the eleven are so little
                  <lb/> ahead of us, that before the next census is <lb/> taken, in 1871, we shall
                  stand equal in popu<lb break="no"/>lation to the ninth Sovereign State of Europe.
                  <lb/> (Hear.) Then, sir, the public revenues of <lb/> the united provinces for
                  1864 were $13,260,<lb break="no"/>000, and their expenditures summed up to $12,<lb break="no"/>507,000. And, large as these sums may <lb/> appear, it is
                  satisfactory to know that the tax<lb break="no"/>ation of British America—were
                  there no re<lb break="no"/>duction from present burdens, which I am <lb/> sure
                  there will be—will be one-third less per <lb/> head than the taxation of England
                  or <lb/> France. There are only five or six countries <lb/> in Europe in which the
                  taxation is less than <lb/> ours will be—and these, moreover, are either <lb/>
                  petty principalities or states which do not <lb/> enjoy a very high degree of
                  civilization. <lb/> (Hear.) Then, sir, as regards the Imports <lb/> and Exports of
                  the united provinces, they <lb/> summed up in 1863, to the following dimen<lb break="no"/>sions:-<lb/>
               </p>
            <table><row><cell>Imports</cell> <cell>................ </cell> <cell rendition="simple:right">$70,600,963</cell></row> 
               <row><cell>Exports</cell> <cell>................</cell> <cell rendition="simple:right"><hi rendition="simple:underline">66,846,604</hi></cell></row>
<row><cell>Total trade</cell> <cell>..........</cell> <cell rendition="simple:right">$137,447,567</cell></row>
            </table>

            <p> Now, sir, I should like honorable
gentlemen <lb/>
to notice this fact, that in 1793—long after <lb/>
the United States had achieved their inde<lb break="no"/>pendence and established a settled Govern<lb break="no"/>ment—their exports and imports did not <lb/>
amount to one-third what ours do at this <lb/>
moment. (Cheers) There are few states in <lb/>
Europe, and those with a vastly greater popula<lb break="no"/>tion than ours, that can boast of anything like <lb/>
the extent of foreign commerce
that now passes <lb/>
through our hands. (Hear.) Then,
sir, as <lb/>
to our agricultural resources, I find that <lb/>
45,638,854 acres have passed from the gov<lb break="no"/>ernments of these colonies into private hands, <lb/>
of which only 13,128,229 are yet tilled, and <lb/>
32,510,625 acres have still to be brought into <lb/>
cultivation. The whole of these forty-five mil<lb break="no"/>lions are picked lands—most of them selected <lb/>
by the early settlers in this country; and if <lb/>
our annual agricultural products are so great <lb/>
now, what will they be when the thirty-two <lb/>
millions yet to pass under the plough have <lb/>
been brought into cultivation?—and what will <lb/>
they not be when the vast tracts still held by <lb/>
Government are peopled with hardy settlers? <lb/>
            </p>

            <fw type="num">98</fw>
            <p> (Hear.)
According to the census of 1861, <lb/>
the value of the agricultural productions of <lb/>
the previous year in the united provinces of <lb/>
British America was $120,000,000; and if <lb/>
we add to that the garden products, and <lb/>
the improvements made on new lands by <lb/>
the agricultural laborers of the provinces, <lb/>
it will be found that the actual product of <lb/>
the industry of our farmers in that year <lb/>
was $150,000,000. (Hear, hear.) The <lb/>
assessed value of our farms—which is always <lb/>
greatly less than the real value—was
$550,<lb break="no"/>000,000 in the year 1861. (Hear-.) Then, <lb/>
sir, in regard to the minerals of the united <lb/>
provinces—what vast fields of profitable indus<lb break="no"/>try will we have in the great coal beds of <lb/>
Nova Scotia—in the iron deposits found all <lb/>
over the provinces—in the exhaustless copper <lb/>
regions of Lakes Huron and Superior and the <lb/>
Eastern Townships of Lower Canada—and <lb/>
in the gold mines of the Chaudière and Nova <lb/>
Scotia. And if the mind stretches from the <lb/>
western bounds of civilization through those <lb/>
great north-western regions, which we hope <lb/>
ere long will be ours, to the eastern slope of <lb/>
the Rocky Mountains, what vast sources of <lb/>
wealth to the fur trader, the miner, the gold <lb/>
hunter and the agriculturist, lie there ready <lb/>
to be developed. (Hear, hear.)
Nor can <lb/>
another source of wealth be altogether for<lb break="no"/>gotten. The President of the United States <lb/>
is said recently to have declared that the <lb/>
produce of the petroleum wells of the United <lb/>
States will in half a dozen years pay off the <lb/>
whole national debt of the republic. Well, <lb/>
sir, we too have "struck oil," and every day <lb/>
brings us intelligence of fresh discoveries<lb break="no"/>(hear, hear, and laughter)—and if the enor<lb break="no"/>mous debt of our neighbors may possibly be <lb/>
met by the oily stream, may we not hope <lb/>
that some material addition to our annual <lb/>
industrial revenue may flow from our petro<lb break="no"/>leum regions? (Hear, hear.) Another vast <lb/>
branch of British American industry is the tim<lb break="no"/>ber and lumber trade. In the year 1862, our <lb/>
saw-mills turned out not less than 772,000,<lb break="no"/>000 feet of manufactured lumber, and our whole <lb/>
timber exports summed up to the value of <lb/>
fifteen millions of dollars. (Hear, hear.) The <lb/>
manufacturing interests of the provinces, too, <lb/>
are fast rising into importance; agricultural <lb/>
implement works, woollen factories and cotton <lb/>
mills, tanneries and shoe factories, iron works <lb/>
and rolling mills, flax works and paper mills, <lb/>
and many other extensive and profitable me<lb break="no"/>chanical establishments are springing up among <lb/>
us, and rapidly extending their operations. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) And to add to all, we have <lb/>
               <cb/>
               already 2,500 miles of railway, 4,000
miles of <lb/>
electric telegraph, and the noblest canal system <lb/>
in the world, but which, I hope, will soon be <lb/>
infinitely improved. (Cheers) These, Mr. <lb/>
SPEAKER, are some examples of the industrial <lb/>
spectacle British America will present after <lb/>
the union has been accomplished; and I ask <lb/>
any member of this House to say whether we <lb/>
will not, when thus united,
occupy a position <lb/>
in the eyes of the world, and command a de<lb break="no"/>gree of respect and influence that we never <lb/>
can enjoy as separate provinces? (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
Must it not affect the decision of many an <lb/>
intending emigrant, when he is told not <lb/>
of the fishing and mining pursuits of Nova <lb/>
Scotia, or of the ship-building of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, or of the timber trade of Lower Canada, <lb/>
or of the agriculture of Upper Canada, but <lb/>
when he is shown all these in one view, as <lb/>
the collective industrial pursuits of British <lb/>
America? (Hear, hear.) I am persuaded <lb/>
that this union will inspire new confidence in <lb/>
our stability, and exercise the most beneficial <lb/>
influence on all our affairs. I believe it will <lb/>
raise the value of our public securities, that it <lb/>
will draw capital to our shores, and secure the <lb/>
prosecution of all legitimate enterprises;
and <lb/>
what I saw, while in England, a few weeks <lb/>
ago, would alone have convinced me of this.
<lb/>
Wherever you went you encountered the most
<lb/>
marked evidence of the gratification with which <lb/>
the Confederation scheme was received by all <lb/>
classes of the people, and the deep interest <lb/>
taken in its success. Let me state one fact in <lb/>
illustration. For some time previous to No<lb break="no"/>vember last our securities had gone very low <lb/>
down in the market, in consequence, as my <lb/>
honorable friend the Finance Minister ex<lb break="no"/>plained the other night, of the war raging <lb/>
on our borders, the uncertainty which hung <lb/>
over the future of this province, and the <lb/>
fear that we might be involved in trouble with <lb/>
our neighbors. Our five per cent. debentures <lb/>
went down in the market so low as 71, but <lb/>
they recovered from 71 to 75, I think, upon <lb/>
the day the resolutions for Confederation, <lb/>
which we are now discussing, reached London. <lb/>
Well, sir, the resolutions were published in the <lb/>
London papers, with eulogistic editorial ar<lb break="no"/>ticles, and the immediate effect of the scheme <lb/>
upon the public mind was such that our five <lb/>
per cents. rose from 75 to 92. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> —What has put them <lb/>
down since? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —I will presently tell <lb/>
the honorable gentleman what has put them <lb/>
down since. But I say that, if anything <lb/>
could show more clearly than another the <lb/>
          
            <pb n="99" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0099.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">99</fw>
          effect
this union is to have on our position over <lb/>
the world, it is a fact like this, that our secu<lb break="no"/>rities went up 17 per cent. in consequence of <lb/>
the publication of the details of our scheme. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) The honorable
member for <lb/>
Chateauguay asks, "What put them down <lb/>
again?" I will tell him. They remained at <lb/>
91 or 92 until the news came that a raid had <lb/>
been made from Canada into the United <lb/>
States, that the raiders had been arrested and <lb/>
brought before a Canadian Court, and that <lb/>
upon technical legal grounds, not only had <lb/>
they been set free, but the money of which <lb/>
they had robbed the banks had been handed <lb/>
over to the robbers. The effect of this news, <lb/>
coupled with General DIX's order, was to <lb/>
drive down our securities 11 per
cent. almost <lb/>
in one day. (Hear, hear.) But, as my hon<lb break="no"/>orable friend the Finance Minister suggests, <lb/>
this is but an additional roof of the accuracy <lb/>
of the argument I have been
sustaining—for <lb/>
this would not have happened, at all events to <lb/>
the same extent, if all the provinces had been <lb/>
united and prepared, as we are now proposing, <lb/>
not only for purposes of
commerce but for pur<lb break="no"/>poses of defence. (Hear, hear.) But secondly, <lb/>
Mr. SPEAKER, I go heartily for the union, <lb/>
because it will throw down the barriers of <lb/>
trade and give us the control of a market of <lb/>
four millions of people. (Hear, hear.) What <lb/>
one thing has contributed so much to the won<lb break="no"/>drous material progress of the United States <lb/>
as the free passage of their products from one <lb/>
State to another? What has tended so much <lb/>
to the rapid advance of all branches of their <lb/>
industry, as the vast extent of their home <lb/>
market, creating an unlimited demand for all <lb/>
the commodities of daily use, and stimulating <lb/>
the energy and ingenuity of producers? Sir, <lb/>
I confess to you that in my mind this one <lb/>
view of the union—the addition of nearly a <lb/>
million of people to our home
consumers<lb break="no"/>sweeps aside all the petty objections that are <lb/>
averred against the scheme. What, in com<lb break="no"/>parison with this great gain to our farmers and <lb/>
manufacturers, are even the fallacious money <lb/>
objections which the imaginations of honorable <lb/>
gentlemen opposite have summoned up? All <lb/>
over the world we find nations eagerly longing <lb/>
to extend their domains, spending large sums <lb/>
and waging protracted wars to them<lb break="no"/>selves of more territory, untilled and uninhabit<lb break="no"/>ed. (Hear, hear.) Other countries offer
<lb/>
large inducements to foreigners to emigrate to <lb/>
their shores—free passages, free
lands, and free <lb/>
food and implements to start them in the <lb/>
world. We, ourselves, support costly estab<lb break="no"/>lishments to attract immigrants to our coun<lb break="no"/><cb/>try, and are satisfied when our annual
outlay <lb/>
brings us fifteen or twenty thousand souls. <lb/>
But here, sir, is a proposal which is to add, in <lb/>
one day, near a million of souls to our popula<lb break="no"/>tion—to add valuable territories to our domain, <lb/>
and secure to us all the advantages of a large <lb/>
and profitable commerce, now existing. And <lb/>
because some of us would have liked certain of <lb/>
the little details otherwise arranged, we are to <lb/>
hesitate in accepting this alliance! (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
Have honorable gentlemen forgotten that the <lb/>
United States gladly paid twenty millions in <lb/>
hard cash to have Louisiana incorporated in <lb/>
the Republic? But what was Louisiana then <lb/>
to the Americans, in comparison with what <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces are at this moment to <lb/>
Canada? I put it to honorable gentlemen <lb/>
opposite—if the United States were now to <lb/>
offer us the State of Maine, what possible <lb/>
sum could be named within the compass of <lb/>
our ability that we would not be prepared to <lb/>
pay for that addition to our country? (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) If we were offered Michigan, Iowa or <lb/>
Minnesota, I would like to know what sum <lb/>
within the compass of Canada, we
would <lb/>
not be prepared to pay? These are portions <lb/>
of a foreign country, but here is a people <lb/>
owning the same allegiance as ourselves, loving <lb/>
the same old sod, enjoying the same laws
and <lb/>
institutions, actuated by the same
impulses <lb/>
and social customs,—and yet when it is pro<lb break="no"/>posed that they shall unite with us for pur<lb break="no"/>poses of commerce, for the defence of our <lb/>
common country, and to develope the vast <lb/>
natural resources of our united domains, we <lb/>
hesitate to adopt it! If a Canadian goes <lb/>
now to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, or <lb/>
if a citizen of these provinces comes here, <lb/>
it is like going to a foreign country. The <lb/>
customs officer meets you at the frontier, <lb/>
arrests your progress, and levies his im<lb break="no"/>posts on your effects. But the proposal <lb/>
now before us is to throw down all barriers <lb/>
between the provinces—to make a citizen of <lb/>
one, citizen of the whole; the proposal is, <lb/>
that our farmers and manufacturers and <lb/>
mechanics shall carry their wares unquestioned <lb/>
into every village of the Maritime Provinces; <lb/>
and that they shall with equal freedom bring <lb/>
their fish, and their coal, and their West India <lb/>
produce to our three millions of inhabitants. <lb/>
The proposal is, that the law courts, and <lb/>
the schools, and the professional and in<lb break="no"/>dustrial walks of life, throughout all the <lb/>
provinces, shall be thrown equally open to us <lb/>
all. (Hear, hear). But, thirdly, Mr. SPEAKER, <lb/>
I am in favor of a union of the provinces

            <p> gentlemen opposite

(Hear, hear.) When this union is accom<lb break="no"/>plished, but two countries in the world will <lb/>
be superior in maritime influence to British <lb/>
America—and those are Great Britain and <lb/>
the United States. (Hear, hear.) In 1863, <lb/>

            <p> Now, sir, in 1861—the year preceding the <lb/>
outbreak of the civil war—all the vessels <lb/>
built in the United States, with their vast <lb/>
seaboard and thirty millions of
people, were <lb/>
in the aggregate but 233,193 tons—only <lb/>
three thousand tons in excess of the British <lb/>
American Provinces. (Hear, hear.) And I <lb/>
hesitate not to affirm that if the
people of <lb/>
British America unite cordially together in <lb/>
utilizing the singular facilities we unitedly <lb/>
possess for the extension of the shipping and <lb/>
ship-building interests, many years will not <lb/>
elapse before we greatly surpass our neighbors <lb/>
in this lucrative branch of industry. (Cheers)

built by our mechanics to the large amount <lb/>
of $9,000,000 in gold. (Cheers) But if my <lb/>

            <p> Now, sir, it is quite true that the
United <lb/>
States have a much larger commercial navy <lb/>
than this, and Great Britain a vastly larger <lb/>
one—but it is equally true that the country <lb/>
next to them in importance is France, and <lb/>
that notwithstanding her thirty-five millions <lb/>
of people, large foreign trade, and extensive <lb/>
sea-coast, she owns but 60,000
tons of ship<lb break="no"/><pb n="101" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0101.jpg"/><fw type="num">101</fw>ping more than British America. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) In 1860, the aggregate commercial <lb/>
navy of France was but 996,124 tons. I <lb/>
say then, that even as ship-owners, the British <lb/>
American Confederacy will occupy from the <lb/>
first, a proud place among the Maritime <lb/>
States of the world—and that when
all her <lb/>
ships hoist a distinctive flag alongside the <lb/>
Cross of Red, there will be few seas in which it <lb/>
will not be unfurled. And let me here mention <lb/>
a fact which came under my notice while re<lb break="no"/>cently in the Lower Provinces—a fact of great <lb/>
importance, and from which, I think, we, who <lb/>
are more inland, may well profit. I learned <lb/>
that, as in the British Isles, a
system of joint- <lb break="yes"/>
stock ship-building has been spreading over <lb/>
many parts of the Maritime Provinces. Ships <lb/>
are built and owned in small shares—say in <lb/>
sixteenth, thirty-second, or
sixty-fourth parts, <lb/>
and all classes of the people are taking small <lb/>
ventures in the trade. Most of
the ships so <lb/>
built are sold, but a portion, and an increasing <lb/>
portion, every year, are sailed, and sailed with <lb/>
profit, by the original joint-stock
builders. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I was delighted to be told <lb/>
that some of those clipper
vessels which we <lb/>
often hear of as making wonderful trips from <lb/>
China and India and Australia to British <lb/>
ports, are vessels built and
owned in New <lb/>
Brunswick, under this joint-stock system. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) So much for the building and <lb/>
ownership of ships. Now let me show you <lb/>
what will be the strength of the united pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in seafaring men. By the census of <lb/>
1861, it appears that the numbers of sailors <lb/>
and fishermen were then-<lb/>

            <p> Whether regarded
merely as a lucrative <lb/>
branch of industry, or as affecting our mari<lb break="no"/>time position before the world, or as a bulwark <lb/>
of defence in time of need, this one fact that <lb/>
British America will have a combined force <lb/>
of seventy thousand seamen, appears to me an <lb/>
immense argument in favor of the union. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) And let us look at
the pro<lb break="no"/>ducts of the labor of a portion of these men <lb/>
—the fishermen. From the latest returns I <lb/>
have been able to meet with, I find the joint <lb/>
products of our sea-coasts and inland lakes <lb/>
were, in the years named, estimated at the <lb/>
following values:-<lb/>

            <p> (Hear, hear.) I was unable to find an <lb/>
estimate as regards Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
but fancy the amount there must be about <lb/>
$200,000. But, be this as it may,
so valuable <lb/>
a fishing trade as this of the united provinces <lb/>
does not exist in any part of the world. And <lb/>
no doubt these estimates are far under the <lb/>
fact, as a large portion of the delicious food <lb/>
drawn by our people from the sea and inland <lb/>
waters could not possibly be included in the <lb/>
returns of the fishery inspectors. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) And let us observe, for a moment, the <lb/>
important part played by this fishing industry <lb/>
in the foreign commerce of the provinces. <lb/>
The exports of products of the sea in the year <lb/>
1863 were as follows:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <table>

            </table>

            <p> Add to this, nine millions of dollars received <lb/> in the same year for new ships,
                  and we have <lb/> $16,696,021 as one year's foreign exports of <lb/> our
                  ship-building and fishing interests. (Hear, <lb/> hear.) With such facts before us
                  as the re<lb break="no"/>sult of only a partially-developed traffic, may <lb/> we
                  not fearlessly look forward to the future in <lb/> the confident hope of still
                  more gratifying re<lb break="no"/>sults, when, by combined and energetic action,
                  <lb/> a new impetus has been given to these valua<lb break="no"/>ble branches of
                  industry? But there remains <lb/> a still more singular comparison to be made.
                  <lb/> The Minister of Finance referred to it last <lb/> night—but he scarcely did
                  justice to our <lb/> position, because he excluded altogether the <lb/> inland
                  shipping. I refer to the statement of <lb/> ships annually entering and leaving
                  our ports. <lb/> Of course every one comprehends that a large <lb/> amount of the
                  tonnage entering and leaving <lb/> ports on the upper lakes is repeated in the
                     re<lb break="no"/>turns over an over again. This is the case, <lb/> for
                  instance, with the ferry boats between the <lb/> American and Canadian shores,
                  that carry <lb/> passengers and a small quantity of goods. It <lb/> would be
                  unfair to put down the tonnage of <lb/> such boats every time they enter or leave
                  a <lb/> port, as foreign commerce. Still there is a <lb/>

                  shipping and that which is inland. <lb/> Acting on this plan, I find that in 1863,

            <p> Now, sir, the United States are in the
same po<lb break="no"/>sition as we are in respect to this inland traffic, <lb/>
and they include it in their returns as is done <lb/>
here. And what, sir, do you think is the <lb/>
difference between their tonnage and ours? <lb/>
Why ours is over twelve millions and theirs <lb/>
is but sixteen millions. There are not four <lb/>
millions of tons of difference between the <lb/>
two. (Hear, hear.) And let it be recol<lb break="no"/>lected that the United States have had <lb/>
seventy years start of us. As regards <lb/>
France, the whole amount of shipping that <lb/>
entered and left the ports of that great <lb/>
country in one year was but 8,456,734 tons<lb break="no"/>four millions of tons less than that of the <lb/>
British American Provinces. May we not <lb/>
then, when this union is accomplished, fairly <lb/>
claim to be the third maritime state of the <lb/>
world; and may we not even entertain the <lb/>
hope that, at some future day, a still higher <lb/>
position is not beyond our reach, when the <lb/>
days of puberty have been passed and the <lb/>
strength of manhood has been reached? I <lb/>
ask honorable gentlemen, in looking at these <lb/>
figures, to consider what the effect
must be <lb/>
when they are set down thus collectively, side <lb/>
by side, in official commercial returns, in com<lb break="no"/>parison with the commerce of all the great <lb/>
maritime states? Will it not strengthen our <lb/>
position abroad?—will it not give us a degree <lb/>
of influence and importance to have it known <lb/>
that British America wields so large a share <lb/>
of the world's commerce?—And if honorable <lb/>
gentlemen will still further consider the deep <lb/>
importance to Canada, in her inland position, <lb/>
of exercising her just influence in the control <lb/>
of so valuable a maritime interest, I think they <lb/>
will come to the conclusion that all the objec<lb break="no"/>tions urged against this union are, in the bal<lb break="no"/>ance of its advantages, utterly contemptible. <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p> (Cheers.) But, in the fourth place, Mr. <lb/>
SPEAKER, I go for a union of the provinces, <lb/>
because it will give a new start to immigration <lb/>
into our country. It will bring us out anew <lb/>
prominently before the world—it will turn ear<lb break="no"/>nest attention to our resources, and bring to <lb/>
our shores a stream of immigration greater, <lb/>
and of a better class, than we ever had before. <lb/>
I was in England when the first public an<lb break="no"/>nouncement of this scheme was made, and <lb/>
witnessed, with pleasure, the marked impres<lb break="no"/>sion it produced. You could not go abroad, <lb/>
you could not enter into any company, in an <lb/>
class of society, where Canada or the British <lb/>
American Provinces were mentioned, but you <lb/>
heard this union movement spoken of almost <lb/>
with enthusiasm. And I say it is desirable <lb/>
that this scheme should not be delayed, but <lb/>
be carried through promptly and vigorously. <lb/>
I hesitate not to say that it should be accom<lb break="no"/>panied with a vigorous effort to
give a new <lb/>
impetus to our industrial enterprises, to open <lb/>
up fresh lands for settlement, and to cheapen <lb/>
the transport of our produce to the sea-board. <lb/>
With the consummation of this union, I trust <lb/>
we will have a new immigration and a new <lb/>
land settlement policy—that we will ascertain <lb/>
every lot of land we actually own, so that a <lb/>
printed list may be placed in the hands of every <lb/>
immigrant—that the petty price we have been <lb/>
heretofore exacting will no longer be exacted, <lb/>
but that to actual settlers, who come among <lb/>
us to hew out for themselves and their chil<lb break="no"/>dren homes in the forest, no burthen or condi<lb break="no"/>tion will be demanded, beyond resident occupa<lb break="no"/>tion for a certain number of years, and a fixed <lb/>
amount of improvement on the land.-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> —Unfortunately for <lb/>
your argument, the lands will be in the hands <lb/>
of the local governments. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —So much the better. <lb/>
My honorable friend can manage his public <lb/>
lands in Lower Canada as he likes, and we <lb/>
will manage ours. And, speaking for the <lb/>
western section, I am bound to say there are <lb/>
very few shrewd men in Upper Canada who <lb/>
do not feel that far more public benefit is to <lb/>
be gained from the industry of a hardy actual <lb/>
settler upon 100 acres of land given to him <lb/>
free, than the trumpery $150 that
can be <lb/>
squeezed out of him as its price, the payment <lb/>
of which keeps him in trouble perhaps for <lb/>
years, and retards the progress of the country. <lb/>
On this question of immigration turns, in my <lb/>
opinion, the whole future success of this great <lb/>
scheme which we are now discussing. Why, <lb/>
sir, there is hardly a political or financial or <lb/>
social problem suggested by this union that <lb/>
          
            <pb n="103" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0103.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">103</fw>
          does not find its best solution in a large
influx <lb/>
of immigration. The larger our population,
<lb/>
the greater will be our productions, the more <lb/>
valuable our exports, and the greater our <lb/>
ability to develop the resources of our country. <lb/>
The greater the number of tax-payers, and the <lb/>
more densely they are settled, the more lightly <lb/>
will the burden of taxation fall upon us all. <lb/>
And in this question of
immigration is found <lb/>
the only true solution of the problem of defence. <lb/>
Fill up our vacant lands, double
our popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and we will at once he in a position to <lb/>
meet promptly and effectually any invader <lb/>
who may put his foot with hostile intent upon <lb/>
our soil. (Hear, hear.) And this question <lb/>
of immigration naturally brings me to the <lb/>
great subject of the North-West territories. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) The resolutions before us <lb/>
recognize the immediate necessity of those <lb/>
great territories being brought within the <lb/>
Confederation and opened up for settlement. <lb/>
But I am told that, while the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railroad has been made an absolute condition <lb/>
of the compact, the opening up of the Great <lb/>
West and the enlargement of our canals have <lb/>
been left in doubt. Now, sir, nothing can be <lb/>
more unjust than this. Let me read the reso<lb break="no"/>lotions:-<lb/></p>
            
            <p>The
General Government shall secure,
<lb/>
without delay, the completion of
the Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway from Rivière du Loup,
through New <lb/>
Brunswick, to Truro in Nova Scotia. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The communications
with the North-West<lb break="no"/>ern Territory, and the improvements required <lb/>
for the development of the trade of the Great <lb/>
West with the seaboard are regarded by this <lb/>
Conference as subjects of the highest importance <lb/>
to the Federated Provinces, an shall be prose<lb break="no"/>cuted at the earliest possible period that the state <lb/>
of the finances will permit. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The Confederation is, therefore, clearly
com<lb break="no"/>mitted to the carrying out of both these en<lb break="no"/>terprises. I doubt if there was a
member of <lb/>
the Conference who did not
consider that the <lb/>
Opening up of the North-West and
the improve<lb break="no"/>ment of our canal system, were not as clearly <lb/>
for the advantage of the Lower Provinces as <lb/>
for the interests of Upper Canada. Indeed, <lb/>
one gentleman held that the Lower
Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were more interested—they
wished to <lb/>
get their products into the west—they wanted <lb/>
a back country as much as we did—they <lb/>
wanted to be the carriers for that great <lb/>
country—and they were, therefore,
to say the <lb/>
least, as much interested in these questions as <lb/>
we were. But honorable gentlemen lay stress <lb/>
upon the point, that, while the
one enter<lb break="no"/>prise is to be undertaken at
once, the other <lb/>
is not to be commenced until the state of the <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p> finances will permit. No doubt this is corrects, <lb/>
and the reason for it is simply this—the <lb/>
money has already been found for the Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
colonial Railway. They must be well aware that <lb/>
the late Government (the MACDONALD-SICOTTE
<lb/>
Administration) agreed to build the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway, and obtained from the Imperial <lb/>
Government a guarantee of the debentures for <lb/>
building it—so that that money is ready at a <lb/>
very low rate of interest, whenever required. <lb/>
We know where to find the money for one enter<lb break="no"/>prise at a rate we are able to bear, and can thus <lb/>
at once go on with a work which must be gone <lb/>
on with if this union is to be consummated. <lb/>
But we don't know this of the other great <lb/>
work—and we all felt that it would be exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly indiscreet—I, myself, as the special ad<lb break="no"/>vocate of opening up the Great West and of <lb/>
the enlargement of our canals,—felt
that I <lb/>
could not put my name to a document which <lb/>
declared that at all hazards, while our five <lb/>
per cent. debentures were quoted at 75 or <lb/>
80 per cent. in the money market—we
would <lb/>
commence at once, without an hour's delay, <lb/>
any great public work whatever. (Hear, <lb/>
hear.) Honorable gentlemen opposite must not <lb/>
imagine that they have to do with a set of <lb/>
tricksters in the thirty-three gentlemen who <lb/>
composed that Conference. What we have <lb/>
said in our resolutions was deliberately adopted, <lb/>
in the honest sense of the words employed, and <lb/>
not for purposes of deception. Both works <lb/>
are to go on at the earliest possible moment <lb/>
our finances will permit, and honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen will find the members of the Cabinet <lb/>
from Lower, as well as from Upper Canada, <lb/>
actuated by the hearty desire to have this <lb/>
whole scheme carried out in its fair meaning. <lb/>

           of my
honorable friends from Lower Canada. <lb/>
During the discussion on the question for some <lb/>
years back I had occasion to dip
deep in North- <lb break="yes"/>
West lore—into those singularly interesting <lb/>
narratives of life and travels in the North-West <lb/>
in the olden time, and into the history of the <lb/>
struggles for commercial domainancy in the <lb/>
great fur-bearing regions,—and it has always <lb/>
struck me that the French Canadian people <lb/>
have cause to look back with pride to the bold <lb/>
and successful part they played in the adven<lb break="no"/>tures of those days. Nothing perhaps has <lb/>
tended more to create their present national <lb/>
character than the vigorous habits, the power <lb/>
of endurance, the aptitude for outdoor
life, <lb/>
acquired in their prosecution of the North- <lb break="yes"/>
West fur-trade. (Hear, hear.) Well may <lb/>
they look forward with anxiety to the <lb/>
realization of this part of our scheme, in <lb/>
confident hope that the great north-western <lb/>
traffic shall be once more opened up to the <lb/>
               hardy French Canadian traders and <hi rendition="simple:italic">voyageurs</hi>. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) Last year furs to the value of <lb/>
£280,000 stg. ($1,400,000) were carried from <lb/>
that territory by the Hudson's Bay Company <lb/>
—smuggled off through the ice-bound regions <lb/>
of James' Bay, that the pretence of the bar<lb break="no"/>renness of the country and the difficulty of <lb/>
conveying merchandise by the natural route <lb/>
of the St. Lawrence may be kept up a little <lb/>
longer. Sir, the carrying of merchandise into <lb/>
that country, and bringing down the bales of <lb/>
pelts ought to be ours, and must ere long be <lb/>
ours, as in the days of yore—(hear, hear)<lb break="no"/>and when the fertile plains of that great Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan territory are opened up for settle<lb break="no"/>ment and cultivation, I am confident that it will <lb/>
not only add immensely to our annual agricul<lb break="no"/>tural products, but bring us sources of mineral <lb/>
and other wealth on which at present we do <lb/>
not reckon. (Hear, hear.) While speaking on <lb/>
this question of immigration, I would remind <lb/>
the House, and it is impossible to urge it <lb/>
too strongly, that these provinces are now <lb/>
presented to the world in a very
disadvantage<lb break="no"/>ous aspect, as different communities. When a <lb/>
party in Europe thinks of emigrating here, he <lb/>
has to ascertain separately all about New <lb/>
Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and <lb/>
Nova Scotia, and Upper and Lower Canada; <lb/>
and if by chance he meets a party from some one <lb/>
of these provinces, he has to listen to a picture <lb/>
of the merits of that one section in high contrast <lb/>
to the demerits of all the rest, and the result <lb/>
is the poor man's ideas about us become a mass <lb/>
of confusion. On the other hand, if he seeks <lb/>
to know the inducements for emigration to <lb/>
New South Wales, or New Zealand, he gets it <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         in one picture—in an official form—and the <lb/>
offer is made to pay his passage to these lands <lb/>
of hope. A large amount of emigration, and <lb/>
of money which the emigrant takes with him, <lb/>
are thus carried off to a much more distant land <lb/>
than this, and one that does not offer equal <lb/>
inducements to the settler. But how different <lb/>
will all this be when these provinces stand <lb/>
united, and present to emigrants a combination <lb/>
of so many branches of profitable industry ? <lb/>
In turning over some United States statistics <lb/>
I recently fell upon a very curious official
cal<lb break="no"/>culation made by the United States Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, as to the value of immigration. By the <lb/>
census of 1861 the population of the United <lb/>
States was over thirty millions; and this cal<lb break="no"/>culation was to ascertain what the population <lb/>
would have been had there been no immigra<lb break="no"/>tion into the country, but had the population <lb/>
been left to advance solely by its own natural <lb/>
increase. And what do you think, sir, was <lb/>
the result ? Why, it is shewn that if the <lb/>
United States had received all the immigrants <lb/>
that came to them up to 1820, and then stopped <lb/>
receiving them—the population, at this moment, <lb/>
instead of thirty millions, would have been but <lb/>
14,601,485. (Hear, hear.) It is
shewn that <lb/>
if immigration had gone on until 1810 and <lb/>
stopped then, the population now would
have <lb/>
been only 12,678,562. Had it stepped in <lb/>
1800, the population now would have been <lb/>
10,462,944; and had it stopped in 1790, <lb/>
the population now, instead of thirty millions, <lb/>
would have been but 8,789,969. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
These, sir, are most valuable facts, which <lb/>
should be impressed on the mind of every <lb/>
public man in British America. If we wish <lb/>
our country to progress, we should not leave <lb/>
a single stone unturned to attract the tide <lb/>
of emigration in this direction; and I know <lb/>
no better method of securing that result, than <lb/>
the gathering into one of these five provinces, <lb/>
and presenting ourselves to the world in the <lb/>
advantageous light which, when united, we <lb/>
would occupy. (Cheers) But,
fifthly, Mr. <lb/>
SPEAKER, I am in favor of a union of these <lb/>
provinces, because it will enable us to meet, <lb/>
without alarm, the abrogation of the American <lb/>
Reciprocity Treaty, in case the United States <lb/>
should insist on its abolition. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
I do not believe that the American Government <lb/>
is so insane as to repeal that treaty. But <lb/>
it is always well to be prepared for contingen<lb break="no"/>cies—and I have no hesitation in saying that if <lb/>
they do repeal it, should this union of British <lb/>
America go on, a fresh 'outlet for our com<lb break="no"/>merce will be opened up to us quite as advan<lb break="no"/>tageous as the American trade has ever been. <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="105" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0105.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">105</fw>
            <p> I have never heretofore ventured to make this <lb/> assertion, for I know well what
                  a serious task it <lb/> is to change, in one day, the commercial rela<lb break="no"/>tions of such a country as this. When the traffic <lb/> of a
                  country has passed for a lengthened <lb/> period through a particular channel, any
                  <lb/> serious change of that channel tends, for a time, <lb/> to the embarrassment
                  of business men, and <lb/> causes serious injury to individuals, if not to <lb/>
                  the whole community. Such a change we in <lb/> Canada had in 1847. But as it was
                  in 1847, so <lb/> it will be in 1866, if the Reciprocity Treaty is <lb/>
                  abolished. Our agricultural interest had been <lb/> built up on the protective
                  legislation of Great <lb/> Britain, and in 1847 it was suddenly brought <lb/> to
                  an end. We suffered severely, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence, for some years; but,
                  by degrees, new <lb/> channels for our trade opened up—the Recip<lb break="no"/>rocity Treaty was negotiated—and we have <lb/> more prosperous since 1847 than
                  we ever <lb/> were before. And so, I have not a doubt, will <lb/> it be in the
                  event of the Reciprocity Treaty <lb/> being abolished. Profitable as that treaty
                  has <lb/> unquestionably been to us—and it has been <lb/> more profitable to the
                  Americans—still, were <lb/> it brought to an end to-morrow, though we <lb/> would
                  suffer a while from the change, I am <lb/> convinced the ultimate result would be
                  that <lb/> other foreign markets would be opened to us, <lb/> quite as profitable,
                  and that we would speedily <lb/> build up our trade on a sounder basis than at
                  <lb/> present. A close examination of the working of <lb/> the Reciprocity Treaty
                  discloses facts of vital <lb/> importance to the merits of the question, to <lb/>
                  which you never hear the slightest allusion <lb/> made by American speakers or
                  writers. Our <lb/> neighbours, in speaking of the treaty, keep <lb/> constantly
                  telling us of the Canadian trade<lb break="no"/>what they take from Canada and
                  what Cana<lb break="no"/>da takes from them. Their whole story is <lb/> about the
                  buying and selling of commodities <lb/> in Canada. Not a whisper do you ever hear
                  <lb/> from them about their buying and selling <lb/> with the Maritime
                  Provinces—not a word <lb/> about the enormous carrying trade for all the <lb/>
                  provinces which the monopolize—not a word <lb/> of the large sums drawn from us
                  for our vast <lb/> traffic over their railways and canals—and not <lb/> a whisper
                  as to their immense profits from <lb/> fishing in our waters, secured to them by
                  the <lb/> treaty. (Hear, hear.) No, sir, all we hear <lb/> of is the exports and
                  imports of Canada—all <lb/> is silence as to other parts of the treaty. But <lb/>
                  it must not be forgotten that if the treaty is <lb/> abolished and this union is
                  accomplished, an <lb/> abolition of reciprocity with Canada means <lb/> abolition
                  of reciprocity with all the British <lb/> American Provinces—means bringing to an <lb/>
                  <cb/> end the right of the Americans to fish in our <lb/> waters; their right to
                  use our canals; their <lb/> right to the navigation of the St. Lawrence; <lb/> and
                  that it also implies the taking out of their <lb/> hands the vast and lucrative
                  carrying trade <lb/> they now have from us. (Hear, hear.) It <lb/> must be always
                  kept in mind that though the <lb/> United States purchase from Canada a large
                  <lb/> amount of agricultural products, a great por<lb break="no"/>tion of what
                  they purchase does not go into <lb/> consumption in the States, but is merely
                     pur<lb break="no"/>chased for transmission to Great Britain and <lb/> the West
                  India markets. (Hear, hear.) They <lb/> merely act as commission agents and
                  carriers <lb/> in such transactions, and splendid profits they <lb/> make out of
                  the business. But beyond this, <lb/> another large portion of these produce pur<lb break="no"/>chases, for which they take so much credit to <lb/> themselves,
                  they buy in the same manner for <lb/> export to the Maritime Provinces of British
                  <lb/> America, reaping all the benefit of the sea<lb break="no"/>going as well as
                  the inland freight—charges <lb/> and commissions. (Hear, hear.) The com<lb break="no"/>mercial returns of the Lower Provinces show <lb/> not only that the
                  Americans send a large <lb/> quantity of their own farm products to those <lb/>
                  provinces, but a considerable amount of what <lb/> they (the Americans) receive
                  from us, thereby <lb/> gaining the double advantage of the carrying <lb/> trade
                  through the United States to the sea<lb break="no"/>board, and then by sea to the
                  Lower Provinces. <lb/> (Hear, hear.) I hold in my hand a return <lb/> of the
                  articles purchased by the Maritime <lb/> Provinces from the United States in 1863,
                  <lb/> which Canada could have supplied. I will <lb/> not detain the House by
                  reading it, but any <lb/> member who desires can have it or examina<lb break="no"/>tion. I may state, however, in brief, that in <lb/> that year the breadstuffs
                  alone bought by the <lb/> Lower Provinces amounted to no less than <lb/>
                  $4,447,207—that the import of meats, <lb/> fresh and cured, amounted to
                  $659,917-<lb/> and that the total value of products which the <lb/> Lower
                  Provinces might have bought more <lb/> advantageously from us, summed up to over
                  <lb/> seven millions of dollars. (Hear, hear.) The <lb/> Americans must,
                  therefore, bear in mind, that <lb/> if they abolish the Reciprocity Treaty, they
                  <lb/> will not only lose that seven millions which <lb/> they now receive for
                  their products, but the <lb/> carrying trade which goes with it. But on the <lb/>
                  other hand, when we have this union, these <lb/> products will, as they naturally
                  should, go <lb/> down the St. Lawrence, not only for the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage
                  of our farmers—but swelling the <lb/> volume of our own shipping interests. (Hear,
                  <lb/> hear.) The Americans, hitherto, have had a <lb/> large portion of our
                  carrying trade; they have <lb/>
                  <pb n="106" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0106.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">106</fw> brought us our goods—even our European <lb/> goods—and
                  taken our produce not only to <lb/> Europe but even to the Lower Provinces; and
                  <lb/> I say one of the best features of this union <lb/> is, that if in our
                  commercial relations with <lb/> the United States we are compelled by them <lb/>
                  to meet fire with fire—it will enable us to stop <lb/> this improvidence and turn
                  the current of our <lb/> own trade into our own waters. Far be it from <lb/> me to
                  say I am an advocate of a coercive com<lb break="no"/>mercial policy—on the
                  contrary, entire freedom <lb/> of trade, in my opinion, is what we in this <lb/>
                  country should strive for. Without hesitation, <lb/> I would, to-morrow, throw
                  open the whole of <lb/> our trade and the whole of our waters to the <lb/> United
                  States, if they did the same to us. <lb/> But, if they tell us, in the face of all
                  the ad<lb break="no"/>vantages they get by Reciprocity, that they are <lb/>
                  determined to put a stop to it, and if this is <lb/> done through a hostile
                  feeling to us—deeply <lb/> as I should regret that this should be the first <lb/>
                  use made by the Northern States of their new<lb break="no"/>found liberty—then, I
                  say, we have a policy, <lb/> and a good policy of our own, to fall back <lb/>
                  upon. And let me say a word as to the effect <lb/> of the repeal of Reciprocity on
                  the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can fishing interest. The Americans, in 1851, <lb/> had
                  engaged in the cod and mackerel fishing, <lb/> in our waters, shipping to the
                  extent of 129,<lb break="no"/>014 tons—but under the influence of the <lb/>
                  Reciprocity Treaty it rose, in 1861, to 192,<lb break="no"/>662—an increase, in
                  ten years, of upwards of <lb/> 63,000 tons, or fifty per cent. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
                  The repeal of Reciprocity will give us back <lb/> all this increase, and more, for
                  it will be a <lb/> very different thing in the future from what it <lb/> was
                  formerly, to poach on our fishing grounds, <lb/> when these provinces are united
                  and determined <lb/> to protect the fisheries of the Gulf. This <lb/> fishing
                  interest is one which may be cul<lb break="no"/>tivated to an extent difficult,
                  perhaps, for many <lb/> of us to conceive. But we have only to <lb/> look at the
                  amount of fish taken from our <lb/> waters by the Americans and other nations,
                  <lb/> and the advantages we possess, to perceive <lb/> that, if we apply
                  ourselves, as a united people, <lb/> to foster that trade, we can vastly increase
                  the <lb/> great traffic we now enjoy. (Hear, hear.) On <lb/> the whole, then, sir,
                  I come firmly to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that, in view of the possible
                  stoppage <lb/> of the American Reciprocity Treaty, and our <lb/> being compelled
                  to find new channels for our <lb/> trade, this union presents to us advan<lb break="no"/>tages, in comparison with which any objection <lb/> that has been
                  offered, or can be offered to it, is <lb/> utterly insignificant. (Hear, hear.)
                  But, <lb/> sixthly, Mr. SPEAKER, I am in favor of the <lb/> union of the
                  provinces, because, in the event <lb/>
                  <cb/> of war, it will enable all the colonies to defend <lb/> themselves better,
                  and give more efficient aid <lb/> to the Empire, than they could do separately.
                  <lb/> I am not one of those who ever had the war- <lb break="yes"/> fever; I have
                  not believed in getting up large <lb/> armaments in this country; I have never
                  <lb/> doubted that a military spirit, to a certain ex<lb break="no"/>tent, did
                  necessarily form part of the character <lb/> of a great people ; but I felt that
                  Canada had <lb/> not yet reached that stage in her progress <lb/> when she could
                  safely assume the duty of de<lb break="no"/>fence; and that, so long as peace
                  continued <lb/> and the Mother Country threw her shield <lb/> around us, it was
                  well for us to cultivate our <lb/> fields and grow in numbers and material <lb/>
                  strength, until we could look our enemies <lb/> fearlessly in the face. But it
                  must be admit<lb break="no"/>ted—and there is no use of closing our eyes <lb/> to
                  the fact—that this question of defence has <lb/> been placed, within the last two
                  years, in a <lb/> totally different position from what it ever oc<lb break="no"/>cupied before. The time has come—it matters <lb/> not what political party may
                  be in power in <lb/> England—when Britain will insist on a re<lb break="no"/>consideration of the military relations which a <lb/> great colony, such as
                  Canada, ought to hold <lb/> to the Empire. And I am free to admit that <lb/> it is
                  a fair and just demand. We may doubt <lb/> whether some of the demands that have
                  been <lb/> made upon us, without regard to our peculiar <lb/> position at the
                  moment, and without any at<lb break="no"/>tempt to discuss the question with us in
                  all its <lb/> breadth, were either just or well-considered. <lb/> But of this I
                  think there can be no doubt, that <lb/> when the time comes in the history of any
                  <lb/> colony that it has overcome the burdens and <lb/> embarrassments of early
                  settlement, and has <lb/> entered on a career of permanent progress and <lb/>
                  prosperity, it is only fair and right that it <lb/> should contribute its quota to
                  the defence of <lb/> the Empire. What that quota ought to be, I <lb/> think, is a
                  matter for grave deliberation and <lb/> discussion, as well as the measure of
                  assistance <lb/> the colony may look for, in time of war, from <lb/> the parent
                  state—and, assuredly, it is in this <lb/> spirit that the present Imperial
                  Government <lb/> is desirous of approaching the question. <lb/> (Hear, hear.) I am
                  persuaded that nothing <lb/> more than that which is fairly due at our <lb/> hands
                  will be demanded from us, and anything<lb/> less than this, I am sure, the people
                  is of Canada <lb/> do not desire. (Hear, hear.) In the con<lb break="no"/>versations I had, while in England, with pub<lb break="no"/>lic men of different
                  politics—while I found <lb/> many who considered that the connection <lb/> between
                  Canada and England involved the <lb/> Mother Country in some danger of war with
                  <lb/> the powerful state upon our borders, and that <lb/>
                  <pb n="107" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0107.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">107</fw> the colonial system devolved heavy and un<lb break="no"/>reasonable burdens upon the Mother Country <lb/> —and while a still larger
                  number thought <lb/> we had not acted as cordially and energetically <lb/> as we
                  ought in organizing our militia for the <lb/> defence of the province, still I did
                  not meet one <lb/> public man, of any stripe of politics, who did <lb/> not
                  readily and heartily declare that, in case <lb/> of the invasion of Canada, the
                  honor of Great <lb/> Britain would be at stake, and the whole <lb/> strength of
                  the Empire would be unhesita<lb break="no"/>tingly marshalled in our defence.
                  (Hear, <lb/> hear.) But, coupled with this, was the in<lb break="no"/>variable and
                  most reasonable declaration that <lb/> a share of the burden of defence, in peace
                  and <lb/> in war, we must contribute. And this stipu<lb break="no"/>lation applies
                  not only to Canada, but to every <lb/> one of the colonies. Already the Indian
                     Em<lb break="no"/>pire has been made to pay the whole expense <lb/> of her
                  military establishment. The Austra<lb break="no"/>lian Colonies have agreed to pay
                  £40 sterling <lb/> per man for every soldier sent there. This <lb/> system is
                  being gradually extended—and union <lb/> or no union, assuredly every one of these
                  <lb/> British American Colonies will be called upon <lb/> to bear her fair share
                  towards the defence of <lb/> the Empire. And who will deny that it is a <lb/> just
                  demand, and that great colonies such as <lb/> these, should be proud to meet it in
                  a frank <lb/> and earnest spirit. (Cheers.) Nothing, I <lb/> am persuaded, could
                  be more foreign to the <lb/> ideas of the people of Canada, than that the <lb/>
                  people of England should be unfairly taxed <lb/> for service rendered to this
                  province. Now, <lb/> the question presented to us is simply this : <lb/> will
                  these contributions which Canada and <lb/> the other provinces must hereafter make
                  to the <lb/> defence of the Empire, be better rendered by <lb/> a hardy,
                  energetic, population, acting as <lb/> one people, than as five or six separate
                  <lb/> communities? (Hear, hear.) There is no <lb/> doubt about it. But not only do
                  our <lb/> changed relations towards the Mother Country <lb/> call on us to assume
                  the new duty of military <lb/> defence—our changed relations towards the <lb/>
                  neighboring Republic compel us to do so. For <lb/> myself, I have no belief that
                  the Americans <lb/> have the slightest thought of attacking us. I <lb/> cannot
                  believe that the first use of their new<lb break="no"/>found liberty will be the
                  invasion, totally un<lb break="no"/>provoked, of a peaceful province. I fancy that
                  <lb/> they have had quite enough of war for a good <lb/> many years to come—and
                  that such a war as <lb/> one with England would certainly be, is the <lb/> last
                  they are likely to provoke. But, Mr. <lb/> SPEAKER, there is no better mode of
                  warding <lb/> off war when it is threatened, than to be pre<lb break="no"/>pared
                  for it if it comes. The Americans are <lb/>
                  <cb/> now a warlike people. They have large <lb/> armies, a powerful navy, an
                  unlimited supply <lb/> of warlike munitions, and the carnage of war <lb/> has to
                  them been stript of its horrors. The <lb/> American side of our lines already
                  bristles <lb/> with works of defence, and unless we are wil<lb break="no"/>ling to
                  live at the mercy of our neighbors, we, <lb/> too, must put our country in a state
                  of efficient <lb/> preparation. War or no war—the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of
                  placing these provinces in a thorough <lb/> state of defence can no longer be
                     post<lb break="no"/>poned. Our country is coming to be re<lb break="no"/>garded
                  as undefended and indefensible<lb break="no"/>the capitalist is alarmed, and the
                     immi<lb break="no"/>grant is afraid to come among us. Were <lb/> it merely as a
                  measure of commercial advan<lb break="no"/>tage, every one of these colonies must
                  meet <lb/> the question of military defence promptly and <lb/> energetically. And
                  how can we do this so <lb/> efficiently and economically as by the union <lb/> now
                  proposed? (Hear, hear.) I have already <lb/> shown that union would give us a body
                  of <lb/> 70,000 hardy seamen ready and able to defend <lb/> our sea-coasts and
                  inland lakes; let us now <lb/> see what would be the military strength of the
                  <lb/> Confederation. By the last census (1861) it <lb/> appears that the men
                  capable of bearing arms <lb/> in British America were as follows:-<lb/>

            <p> With the body of efficient soldiers that <lb/>
might be obtained from this vast array of men, <lb/>
the erection of defensive works at salient <lb/>
points, and the force of British troops that <lb/>
would soon come to our aid—who can doubt <lb/>
that the invasion of our country would be <lb/>
successfully resisted? But, seventhly, Mr. <lb/>
SPEAKER, I am in favor of this union because <lb/>
it will give us a sea-board at all seasons of the <lb/>
year. (Hear, hear.) It is not to be denied
<lb/>
that the position of Canada, shut off as she is <lb/>
from the sea-board during the winter months,
<lb/>
is far from satisfactory—and should the United
<lb/>
States carry out their insane threat of abolish<lb break="no"/>ing the bonding system, by which our mer<lb break="no"/>chandise passes free through their territory,
it <lb/>
would be still more embarrassing. The Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces are equally cut off from com-</p>
            <p>munication inland. Now, this embarrassment <lb/>
will be ended by colonial union. The Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
colonial Railway will give us at all times
<lb/>
access to the Atlantic through British terri<lb break="no"/><pb n="108" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0108.jpg"/><fw type="num">108</fw>tory. (Hear,
hear.) As a commercial enter<lb break="no"/>prise, the Intercolonial Railway has not, I <lb/>
apprehend, any considerable merit; as a work <lb/>
of defence it has, however, many advocates; <lb/>
but, if the union of the provinces is to go on, <lb/>
it is an absolute necessity; and, as the price <lb/>
of union, were there no other argument' m its <lb/>
favor, I heartily go for it. (Hear, hear.) <lb/>
The advantage it will confer on the Maritime <lb/>
Provinces can hardly be over-rated. It will <lb/>
make Halifax and St. John the Atlantic sea<lb break="no"/>ports of half a continent—it will insure to <lb/>
Halifax, ere long, the establishment of a line <lb/>
of powerful steamers running in six days from <lb/>
her wharves to some near point on the west <lb/>
coast of Ireland—and it will bring
a constant <lb/>
stream of passengers and immigrants through <lb/>
those Lower Provinces that never otherwise <lb/>
would come near them. Mr. SPEAKER, I <lb/>
could go on for many hours piling up argu<lb break="no"/>ments in favor of this scheme, but already I <lb/>
have detained the House too long—(cries of <lb/>
"no, no;" "go on!")—and must draw to a <lb/>
close. But I think I have given reasons <lb/>
enough to satisfy every candid man who <lb/>
desires the advancement of his country, why <lb/>
this House should go unanimously and enthu<lb break="no"/>siastically for " the union, the whole union, <lb/>
and nothing but the union!" Before sitting<lb/>
down, however, there are one or two general<lb/>
objections urged against the scheme which I <lb/>
am desirous of meeting, and I will try to do <lb/>
so as briefly as possible. And first, sir, I am <lb/>
told that we should have made the union <lb/>
legislative and not federal. Undoubtedly this <lb/>
is a point on which different
opinions may be <lb/>
honestly held by men sincerely seeking the <lb/>
same ends—but, speaking my own views, I <lb/>
think we came to a most wise conclusion. <lb/>
Had we continued the present legislative <lb/>
union, we must have continued with it <lb/>
the unjust system of taxation for local pur<lb break="no"/>poses that now exists—and the sectional bicker<lb break="no"/>ing would have gone on as before. And can <lb/>
any honorable gentleman really believe that <lb/>
it would have been possible for a body of men <lb/>
sitting at Ottawa to administer efficiently <lb/>
and wisely the parish business of Red River <lb/>
and Newfoundland, and all the country be<lb break="no"/>tween? Only think of bringing suitors and <lb/>
witnesses such distances to promote a bill for <lb/>
closing. a side-line or
incorporating a club! <lb/>
And if such a thing were desirable, would it <lb/>
be possible for any body of men to go through <lb/>
such a mass of work? Why, sir, the Impe<lb break="no"/>rial Parliament with 650 members sits for <lb/>
eight months in the year, and even our Par<lb break="no"/>liament sits three or four months,—how then <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
           would it be possible for the legislature of all <lb/>
the Provinces with a thousand or twelve hun<lb break="no"/>dred bills before it, to accomplish it all?
The <lb/>
whole year would not suffice for it—and who <lb/>
in these colonies is able to sacrifice his whole <lb/>
time to the duties of public life? But there <lb/>
is another reason why the union was not <lb/>
made legislative—it could not be carried. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) We had either to take a federal <lb/>
union or drop the negotiation. Not only were <lb/>
our friends from Lower Canada against it, but <lb/>
so were most of the delegates from the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces. There was but one choice <lb/>
open to us—federal union or nothing. But <lb/>
in truth the scheme now before us has all the <lb/>
advantages of a legislative union and a federal <lb/>
one as well. We have thrown over on the lo<lb break="no"/>calities all the questions which experience has <lb/>
shown lead directly to local jealousy and dis<lb break="no"/>cord, and we have retained in the hands of <lb/>
the General Government all the powers neces<lb break="no"/>sary to secure a strong and efficient adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of public affairs. (Hear, hear.) By <lb/>
placing the appointment of the judges in the <lb/>
hands of the General Government, and the <lb/>
establishment of a central court of appeal, <lb/>
we have secured uniformity of justice over <lb/>
the whole land. (Hear, hear.) By vesting <lb/>
the appointment of the lieutenant governors <lb/>
in the General Government, and giving a veto <lb/>
for all local measures, we have secured that <lb/>
no injustice shall be done without appeal in <lb/>
local legislation. (Hear, hear.)
For all deal<lb break="no"/>ings with the Imperial Government and for<lb break="no"/>eign countries we have clothed the General <lb/>
Government with the most ample powers.<lb break="no"/>And finally, all matters of trade and com<lb break="no"/>merce, banking and currency, and all questions <lb/>
common to the whole people, we have vested <lb/>
fully and unrestrictedly in the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The measure, in fact, shuns the <lb/>
faults of the federal and legislative systems <lb/>
and adopts the best parts of both, and I am <lb/>
well persuaded it will work efficiently and <lb/>
satisfactorily. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. <lb/>
SPEAKER, I am told that the cost of working <lb/>
this Federation scheme will be enormous. <lb/>
Now, it would be a very rash thing of me, or <lb/>
of any other person, to assert that the ex<lb break="no"/>pense will not be great ; for we
all know that <lb/>
any system of government may be made either <lb/>
economical or extravagant, precisely according <lb/>
to the discretion of those who administer it. <lb/>
But this I am confident of, that with ordinary <lb/>
discretion, far from being more costly than <lb/>
the existing system, a very considerable re<lb break="no"/>duction may be readily effected; and one <lb/>
thing is quite certain, that no ingenuity <lb/>
           

            <pb n="109" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0109.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">109</fw>
      could make it a more costly or
extravagant <lb/>
system than the one we have now. (Loud <lb/>
cries of hear, hear.) Undoubtedly the mode <lb/>
in which the local governments shall be con<lb break="no"/>structed will very much affect the cost of the<lb/>
whole scheme; but if we adopt (as I earnestly<lb/>
hope we will) simple and inexpensive machinery<lb/>
for local purposes, I am quite satisfied that <lb/>
there will a reduction to the people of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada on the amount they now contribute. I <lb/>
have great confidence in the economical effect <lb/>
of placing local expenditures on local should<lb break="no"/>ers, and in the salutary influence in the same <lb/>
direction, of the representatives of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces when they come among us. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> —The trouble is that <lb/>
they will spend our money—not theirs. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —The honorable gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is entirely wrong, and I am amazed at <lb/>
his making such a statement. There is no <lb/>
portion of the community that will pay more <lb/>
money, per head, to the revenue than the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Maritime Provinces. If the honor<lb break="no"/>able gentleman had turned up the commercial <lb/>
returns of those Lower Provinces and calcula<lb break="no"/>ted the effect of our tariff, if
applied to them <lb/>
—or even a tariff less than ours, for our <lb/>
tariff must be reduced, he would have known <lb/>
that they will bear their full proportion of <lb/>
the national burdens. (Hear, hear.) But, <lb/>
Mr. SPEAKER, I am told that the
arrange<lb break="no"/>ment as to the debt is unfair—that we have <lb/>
thrown on the Federal exchequer the whole of <lb/>
the debts of the Maritime Provinces, but only <lb/>
a portion of the debt of Canada. There is not <lb/>
a particle of force in this objection. The <lb/>
whole debt of Canada is $67,500,000,
but five <lb/>
millions of this is due to our own people, to <lb/>
meet which there are certain local funds. <lb/>
Now, if we had thrown the whole
$67,500,000 <lb/>
on the Federal treasury, we must also have <lb/>
handed over to it the local revenues, which, so <lb/>
far as these five millions are concerned, would <lb/>
have been precisely the same thing. But, as <lb/>
regards the public debt with which the Fede<lb break="no"/>ral Government would start, it would not have <lb/>
been the same thing. By restricting
the debt <lb/>
of Canada to $62,500,000, we
restricted the <lb/>
debt of the Maritime Provinces to the same <lb/>
proportion, or $25 per head of
their popula<lb break="no"/>tion; but had we thrown our whole debt of <lb/>
sixty-seven and a half millions on the Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, the proportion of debt for the several <lb/>
Maritime Provinces must have been increased, <lb/>
and the whole debt very greatly augmented. <lb/>
(Hear.) But in throwing these five
millions on <lb/>
the local governments of Upper and Lower <lb/>
Canada, do we impose a burden on them they <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          are unable to bear? Quite the contrary—for<lb/>
with the debt, we give them the corresponding <lb/>
sources of revenue from which to meet it. The <lb/>
local governments of Upper and Lower Canada<lb/>
will severally not only have funds from the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy and other sources, to meet all expenditure, <lb/>
but a large surplus besides. But, Mr. SPEAKER, <lb/>
I am told that this Federation scheme may be all <lb/>
very right—it may be just and the very <lb/>
thing the country needs—but this Government <lb/>
had no authority from Parliament to negotiate <lb/>
it. The honorable member for Cornwall (Hon. <lb/>
JOHN S. MACDONALD) particularly pressed <lb/>
this objection, and I am sorry he is not in his <lb/>
seat. <lb/>

declared that the Government it
was formed for <lb/>
the initial purpose of maturing a scheme of<lb/>
Federal union, and that it would
take means, <lb/>
during the recess, for opening negotiations <lb/>

say we received the approval of the House for <lb/>

           British system, that ever existed. We
have <lb/>
but made a compact, subject to the approval <lb/>
of Parliament. So far as this Government is <lb/>
concerned, we are firmly committed to the <lb/>
scheme; but so far as the members of the <lb/>
Legislature are concerned, they are as free as <lb/>
air; but I am confident that this House will <lb/>
almost unanimously accept it, and not with <lb/>
changes and amendments, but as a whole—as <lb/>
the very best compromise arrangement that <lb/>
can be obtained. <lb/>

hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, I am told, that the <lb/>
people of Canada have not considered this <lb/>
scheme, and that we ought not to pass it with<lb break="no"/>out appealing to the electors for their approval. <lb/>
Now, sir, a statement more incorrect than this, <lb/>
or more injurious to the people of Canada, could <lb/>
not be made. They not only have consider<lb break="no"/>ed this scheme—for fifteen years they have <lb/>
been earnestly considering it—but the per<lb break="no"/>fectly comprehend it. (Hear, hear.) If ever <lb/>
question was thoroughly debated in any <lb/>
country, the whole subject of constitutional <lb/>
change has been in Canada. There is not a <lb/>
light in which it could be placed that has not <lb/>
been thoroughly canvassed ; and if the House <lb/>
will permit me, I will show from our historical <lb/>
record how totally absurd this objection is. <lb/>
The question of a Federal union was agitated <lb/>
thirty years ago, and here is the resolution <lb/>
adopted by both Houses of the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament so far back as 1837:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>That great inconvenience has been
sustained <lb/>
by His Majesty's subjects inhabiting the provinces <lb/>
of Lower Canada and Upper Canada, from the <lb/>
want of some adequate means for regulating and <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
          adjusting questions respecting the trade
and com<lb break="no"/>merce of the said provinces, and divers other <lb/>
questions wherein the said provinces have a com<lb break="no"/>mon interest ; and it is
expedient that the legis<lb break="no"/>latures of the said provinces respectively, be <lb/>
authorized to make provision for the joint regu<lb break="no"/>lation and adjustment of such their common <lb/>
interests. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> In the instructions given to Lord  DURHAM <lb/>
by the Imperial Government in 1838, this <lb/>
passage occurs:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It is clear that some plan must be
devised to <lb/>
meet the just demands of Upper Canada. It will <lb/>
be for your Lordship, in conjunction with the <lb/>
Committee, to consider if this should not be done <lb/>
by constituting some joint legislative authority, <lb/>
which should preside over all questions of com<lb break="no"/>mon interest to the two provinces,
and which <lb/>
might be appealed to in extraordinary cases. to <lb/>
arbitrate between contending parties in either; <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> preserving, however, to each province its
distinct <lb/>legislature, with authority in all matters of an <lb/>
exclusively domestic concern. If this should be <lb/>
your opinion. you will have further time to consider <lb/>
what should be the nature and limits of such <lb/>
authority, and all the particulars which ought to <lb/>
be comprehended in any scheme for its establish<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> In Lord DURHAM'S admirable report of <lb/>
1839, I find this passage:-<lb/>
            </p>
   <p><quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The bill should contain provisions by
which <lb/>
any or all of the other North American colonies <lb/>
may, on the application of the legislature, be <lb/>
with the consent of the two Canadas, or their <lb/>
united legislature, admitted into the union on <lb/>
such terms as may be agreed on between them. <lb/>
As the mere amalgamation of the Houses of <lb/>
Assembly of the two provinces would not be <lb/>
advisable, or give at all a due representation to <lb/>
each, a parliamentary commission should be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed, for the purpose of forming the electoral <lb/>
divisions and determining the number of members <lb/>
to be returned on the principle of giving repre<lb break="no"/>sentation as near as may be, in proportion to <lb/>
population. The same commission should form <lb/>
a plan of local government by
elective bodies, <lb/>
subordinate to the general legislature, and exer<lb break="no"/>cising a complete control over such local affairs <lb/>
as do not come within the province of general <lb/>
legislation. The plan so framed should be made <lb/>
an act of the Imperial Parliament, so as to pre<lb break="no"/>vent the general legislature from encroaching on <lb/>
the powers of the local bodies. A general Execu<lb break="no"/>tive on an improved principle should be establish<lb break="no"/>ed, together with a supreme court of appeal for <lb/>
all the North American Colonies. <lb/></quote>
            </p>

            <p> And here is the statement of Lord JOHN <lb/>
RUSSELL, in 1839, while introducing the origi<lb break="no"/>nal bill founded on Lord DURHAM'S report:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The bill provides for the establishment
of a cen<lb break="no"/>tral district at Montreal and its
neighbourhood, at <lb/>
which the Government shall be carried on, and <lb/>

          where the Assembly shall meet. The other
parts <lb/>
of Upper and of Lower Canada are each to be <lb/>
divided into two districts. It is proposcd that <lb/>
these districts should be formed for the purpose of <lb/>
becoming municipal districts, for the imposition <lb/>
of taxes and rates, for all local purposes. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> My next quotation shall be from the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of a body of gentlemen who made a <lb/>
great commotion in their day and generation <lb/>
—the British American League. I hold in <lb/>
my hand the proceedings of the League of 3rd <lb/>
November, 1849, and among other names <lb/>
mentioned I find those of the Hon. GEORGE <lb/>
MOFFAT, THOHAS WILSON, the Hon.
GEORGE<lb/>
CRAWFORD, the Hon. ASA A.
BURNHAM, <lb/>
JOHN W. GAMBLE, Mr. AIKMAN, of
Barton, <lb/>
OGLE R. GOWAN, JOHN DUGGAN, the Hon. <lb/>
Col. FRASER, GEORGE BENJAMIN, the Hon. <lb/>
P. M. VANKOUGHNET, and last, though not <lb/>
least, the Hon. JOHN A. MACDONALD—of <lb/>
whom, however, I find it recorded that he <lb/>
spoke in a very jocose manner. Here is the <lb/>
resolution of the League:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">That whether protection or reciprocity
shall be <lb/>
conceded or withheld, it is essential to the wel<lb break="no"/>fare of this colony, and its future good
govern<lb break="no"/>ment, that a Constitution should be framed in <lb/>
unison with the wishes of the people, and suited <lb/>
to the growing importance and intelligence of the <lb/>
country, and that such Constitution should em<lb break="no"/>brace a union of the British North American <lb/>
Provinces on mutually advantageous and fairly <lb/>
arranged terms, with the concession from the <lb/>
Mother Country of enlarged powers of self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p> I pass on to 1856 when we had the motion <lb/>
and speech of my honorable friend the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Finance (Hon. Mr. GALT) in favor of <lb/>
a union of all the British American Provinces, <lb/>
but, as the whole House is familiar with it, I <lb/>
shall not read the document. But in the Votes <lb/>
and Proceedings of this House, of 25th April, <lb/>
1856, I find a very remarkable document. It <lb/>
is a notice of motion to be made in this House <lb/>
—and its contents are as follow:-<lb/>

opposite (Hon. Mr. DORION) and myself and <lb/>
our ten colleagues viewed the position of the <lb/>
country from the denial of constitutional <lb/>
reform, I will read the official statement of <lb/>
the basis on which the Government was <lb/>
formed. I read, sir, from the Journals of the <lb/>
Legislative Council for 1858:-<lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">For some years past, sectional feelings have <lb/>

            <p> (Hear, hear.) Here, sir, was a Government
<lb/>
formed seven years ago for the express purpose <lb/>
of doing that which we are now engaged in<lb break="no"/>a Government distinctly telling the Governor <lb/>
General that the ace and prosperity of the <lb/>
country were an angered because constitu<lb break="no"/>tional remedies were deferred; and yet my <lb/>
honorable friends opposite, who with me were <lb/>
responsible for that document, tell us that we <lb/>
are not now in a fit position to legislate upon <lb/>
this question. (Hear, hear.) But I come <lb/>
next to the famous despatch to the Colonial <lb/>
Minister, signed in 1858 by my honorable <lb/>
friend the Minister of Finance, the Attorney <lb/>
General East, and the Hon. JOHN ROSS. It <lb/>
stated that "very grave difficulties now pre<lb break="no"/>sented themselves in conducting the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada"—that "the progress of pop<lb break="no"/>ulation has been more rapid in the western <lb/>
section, and claims are now made on behalf of <lb/>
its inhabitants for giving them representation <lb/>
in the Legislature in proportion to their num<lb break="no"/>bers"—that " the result is shown by an agita<lb break="no"/>tion fraught with great danger to the peaceful <lb/>
and harmonious working of our constitutional <lb/>
system, and, consequently, detrimental to the <lb/>
progress of the province"—that "this state of <lb/>
things is yearly becoming worse"—and that <lb/>
"the Canadian Government were impressed <lb/>
with the necessity of seeking for such a mode <lb/>
of dealing with these difficulties as may for <lb/>
ever remove them." What must have been <lb/>
the state of public feeling when the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive Government of 1858 ventured to use such <lb/>
language as this ?—and how can any one pre<lb break="no"/>tend that the people do not comprehend this <lb/>
question, when seven years of agitation have <lb/>
passed since that document was penned? <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, I come to <lb/>
a still more important document—one that <lb/>
goes into the details and the merits of just <lb/>
such a scheme as that before the House. I <lb/>
refer to the manifesto issued, in 1859, by the <lb/>
Lower Canada members of the liberal party <lb/>
in this House. (Hear, hear.) It is very long, <lb/>

                  DESSAULLES, four of the <lb/> most able and most popular leaders of the <lb/>
                  Lower Canada liberal party—the party now <lb/> virulently opposing the resolutions
                  before the <lb/> Chair. (Hear, hear.) So my honorable <lb/> friend opposite (Hon.
                  Mr. DORION) not only <lb/> agitated the country for constitutional changes, <lb/>
                  but insisted that it should take the shape of <lb/> a Federal union, because of
                  the cheapness of <lb/> that system and the facility it afforded for <lb/> bringing
                  within the federation the other <lb/> British American Provinces—(cheers and <lb/>
                  laughter)—and yet, six years after the promul<lb break="no"/>gation of this
                  document, my honorable friend <lb/> gets up and repudiates a Federal union <lb/>

great meeting of the Reformers of Upper <lb/>
Canada, known as the Toronto Convention of <lb/>
1859, and at which 570 delegates were present <lb/>
from all parts of the western province. Here <lb/>
are the two chief resolutions:-<lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">5. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Resolved</hi>,—That
in the opinion of this as<lb break="no"/>sembly, the best practicable remedy for the evils <lb/>

to be found in the formation of two or more local <lb/>
governments, to which shall be committed the <lb/>
control of all matters of a local or sectional <lb/>
character, and some joint authority charged with <lb/>
such matters as are necessarily common to both <lb/>
sections of the province. <lb/>

            <p> Here we have the very essence of the mea<lb break="no"/>sure now before us for adoption—deliberately <lb/>
approved of by the largest body of representa<lb break="no"/>tive men ever assembled in Upper Canada for <lb/>
a political purpose; and yet we are to be told <lb/>
that our people do not understand the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and we must go to them and explain it, <lb/>
letter by letter, at an immense cost to the <lb/>
country, and at the risk of losing the whole <lb/>
scheme! (Hear, hear.) But let us see what <lb/>
followed. A general election was ordered in <lb/>
1861—there was a fierce contest at the polls <lb/>
—and the main question at every hustings, <lb/>
was the demand for constitutional changes. <lb/>
The result of that contest was the overthrow <lb/>
of the CARTIER-MACDONALD Ministry
and <lb/>
the formation of the MACDONALD-SICOTTE <lb/>
Administration in its room. But so bitter had <lb/>
been the struggle for and against constitu<lb break="no"/>tional changes, and so clearly defined were  <lb/>
          
            <cb/> 
           party-lines upon it, that it was found
impos<lb break="no"/>sible to construct that Government without a <lb/>
distinct pledge that it would resist every <lb/>
motion made upon the subject-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> —Did you recognize <lb/>
the propriety of that course ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —No, indeed, I did <lb/>
not. I but cite the fact to show how thor<lb break="no"/>oughly the whole question has been agitated, <lb/>
and how perfectly its bearings have, for <lb/>
years past, been understood. Well, sir, mark <lb/>
what followed. One short year had not passed <lb/>
over the heads of the MACDONALD-SICOTTE
<lb/>
Ministry before they tattered to their fall<lb break="no"/>and so repugnant to the House and to the <lb/>
country was their conduct on the constitutional <lb/>
question, that they dared not appeal to the <lb/>
country until they had changed their avowed <lb/>
policy upon it, and replaced the men <lb/>
who had forced upon them the narrow <lb/>
policy of the year before, by gentlemen <lb/>
understood to be more in favor of con<lb break="no"/>stitutional changes. The Government (MAC<lb break="no"/>DONALD-DORION), so reconstructed, went to <lb/>
the country in 1863, but in the year follow<lb break="no"/>ing it, too, fell in its turn, simply because it <lb/>
did not deal boldly with the constitutional <lb/>
question—
</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DORI1">HON. MR. DORION</persName> —We had the support <lb/>
of all who were in favor of the question. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —Indeed, you had not. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLT1">HON. MR. HOLTON</persName> —We should have <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —I entirely deny that; <lb/>
had you pursued a bold policy upon it you <lb/>
might have been in office up to this hour. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) Well, sir, the MACDONALD-<lb break="yes"/>DORION made way for the TACHÉ-MACDON<lb break="no"/>ALD Administration—but it, too, soon fell by <lb/>
a majority of two, simply because it did not <lb/>
deal with the constitutional question-<lb/>

   <p> <persName ref="pers:ANON1">A VOICE</persName> —Oh, oh ! <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BROW4">HON. MR. BROWN</persName> —My honorable friend <lb/>
                  cries "oh, oh," and I am perfectly amazed at <lb/> his doing so. I am about to
                  offer my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend the most complete proof of the cor<lb break="no"/>rectness of my statement—proof so conclusive <lb/> that if he does
                  not accept of it as such, I do <lb/> not know how he can be convinced of anything.
                  <lb/> In one single day the TACHÉ-MACDONALD <lb/> Administration, by taking up the
                     constitu<lb break="no"/>tional question boldly, turned their minority <lb/> of
                  two into a majority of seventy. (Loud cries <lb/> of hear, hear.) Could anything
                  prove more <lb/> unanswerably than this the deep hold this <lb/> question has on
                  the public mind, and the as<lb break="no"/>sured confidence of the members of this

                  <fw type="num">114</fw> merits, when, in one day, such a startling poli<lb break="no"/>tical revolution was brought about ? Was it, <lb/> think you, a
                  doubtful consideration that could <lb/> have induced the Upper Canada Opposition,
                  <lb/> almost as one man, to cast down their party <lb/> intrenchments and make
                  common cause with <lb/> their opponents? Could there have been the <lb/> slightest
                  doubt as to the sentiments of our <lb/> people and the imperative necessity of
                     imme<lb break="no"/>diate action, when such men as now sit on <lb/> the
                  treasury benches, were forced, by their <lb/> supporters, to unite for the
                  settlement of this <lb/> question? And could there be a more con<lb break="no"/>clusive proof of the ripeness of public opinion <lb/> than the unanimous and
                  cordial manner in <lb/> which our so uniting has been sustained <lb/> by the press
                  of all parties, and by the elec<lb break="no"/>tors at the polls? (Hear, hear.)
                  Never, <lb/> I venture to assert, was any great measure so <lb/> thoroughly
                  understood, and so cordially en<lb break="no"/>dorsed by the people of Canada, as
                  this measure <lb/> now under consideration. (Hear, hear.)<lb break="no"/>The
                  British Government approves of it—the<lb/> Legislative Council approves of it—this
                  <lb/> House almost unanimously approves of it<lb break="no"/>the press of all
                  parties approves of it<lb break="no"/>and though the scheme has already been di<lb break="no"/>rectly submitted to fifty out of the one hun<lb break="no"/>dred
                  constituencies into which Canada is di<lb break="no"/>vided, only four candidates
                  ventured to appear <lb/> at the hustings in opposition to it—all of <lb/> them in
                  Lower Canada—and but two of them <lb/> were elected. (Cheers) And yet, sir, we are
                  <lb/> to be told that we are stealing a march upon <lb/> the country; that it is
                  not understood by the <lb/> people; and that we must dissolve the ease <lb/> upon
                  it, at a vast cost to the exchequer, and <lb/> at the risk of allowing political
                  partisanship <lb/> to dash the fruit from our hands at the very <lb/> moment we
                  are about to grasp it! (Hear, <lb/> hear.) Sir, I have no fears whatever of an
                  <lb/> appeal to the people. I cannot pretend to <lb/> speak as to the popular
                  feeling in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada, but I think thoroughly understand the
                  <lb/> popular mind of the western province, and <lb/> hesitate not to say that
                  there are not five <lb/> gentlemen in this chamber (if so many) who <lb/> could go
                  before their constituents in Upper <lb/> Canada in opposition to this scheme, with
                  the <lb/> slightest chance of being returned. (Hear, <lb/> hear.) It is because I
                  thoroughly compre<lb break="no"/>hend the feelings of the people upon it, that
                  <lb/> I urge the adoption of this measure at the <lb/> earliest possible moment.
                  The most gross <lb/> injustice is to be rectified by it; the tax-payer <lb/> is to
                  be clothed with his rightful influence by <lb/> it; new commercial relations are
                  to be opened <lb/> up by it; a new impulse to the industrial <lb/>
                  <cb/> pursuits of the country will be given by it<lb break="no"/>and I for one
                  would feel myself false to the <lb/> cause I have so long sustained, and false to
                  <lb/> the best interests of my constituents, if I <lb/> permitted one hour
                  unnecessarily to pass with<lb break="no"/>out bringing it to a final issue.
                  (Cheers) It <lb/> was only by the concurrence of most propiti<lb break="no"/>ous
                  circumstances that the wonderful progress <lb/> this movement has made could have
                     ac<lb break="no"/>complished. Most peuliar were the circum<lb break="no"/>stances that enable such a coalition to be <lb/> formed as that now existing for
                  the settlement <lb/> of this question—and who shall say at what <lb/> hour it may
                  not be rent asunder? And yet, <lb/> who will venture to affirm that if party
                  spirit <lb/> in all its fiereeness were once more to be let <lb/> loose amongst
                  us, there would be the slightest <lb/> hope that this great question could be
                     ap<lb break="no"/>proached with that candor and harmony neces<lb break="no"/>sary to its satisfactory solution? (Hear, hear.) <lb/> Then, sir, at the very
                  moment we resolved to <lb/> deal with this question of constitutional change,
                  <lb/> the Maritime Provinces were about to assem<lb break="no"/>ble in joint
                  conference to consider whether <lb/> they ought not to form a union among them<lb break="no"/>selves—and the way was thus most propitiously <lb/> opened up for
                  the consideration of a union of <lb/> a British America. The civil war too, in
                  <lb/> the neighboring republic; the possibility of <lb/> war between Great Britain
                  and the United <lb/> States; the threatened repeal of the Recipro<lb break="no"/>city Treaty; the threatened abolition of the <lb/> American bonding system for
                  goods in <lb/> transitu to and from these provinces; the un<lb break="no"/>settled
                  position of the Hudson's Bay Company; <lb/> and the changed feeling of England as
                  to <lb/> the relations of great colonies to the parent <lb/> state;—all combine at
                  this moment to arrest <lb/> earnest attention to the gravity of the situa<lb break="no"/>tion, and unite us all in one vigorous effort to <lb/> meet the
                  emergency like men. (Hear, hear.) <lb/> The interests to be affected by this
                  scheme of <lb/> union are very large and varied—but the pres<lb break="no"/>sure
                  of circumstances upon all the colonies is so <lb/> serious at this moment, that if
                  we cannot now <lb/> banish partisanship and sectionalism and <lb/> petty
                  objections, and look at the matter on its <lb/> broad intrinsic merits, what hope
                  is there of <lb/> our ever being able to do so? An appeal to <lb/> the people of
                  Canada on this measure simply <lb/> means postponement of the question for a <lb/>
                  year—and who can tell how changed ere then <lb/> may be the circumstances
                  surrounding us? <lb/> Sir, the man who strives for the postponement <lb/> of this
                  measure on any ground, is doing what <lb/> he can to kill it almost as effectually
                  as if he <lb/> voted against it. (Hear, hear.) Let there be <lb/> no mistake as to
                  the manner in which the <lb/>
                  <pb n="115" facs="final/images/Ont_Que_LA_1865-02-08_Page_0115.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">115</fw> Government presents this measure to the <lb/> House. We do
                  not present it as free from <lb/> fault, but we do present it as a measure so
                  <lb/> advantageous to the people of Canada, that <lb/> all the blemishes, real or
                  imaginary, averred <lb/> against it, sink into utter insignificance in <lb/>
                  presence of its merits. (Hear, hear.) We pre<lb break="no"/>sent it, not in the
                  precise shape we in Canada <lb/> would desire it, but as in the best shape the
                  five <lb/> colonies to be united could agree upon it. We <lb/> present it in the
                  form in which the five gov<lb break="no"/>ernments have severally adopted it—in
                  the <lb/> form the Imperial Government has endorsed it <lb/> —and in the form in
                  which we believe all the <lb/> legislatures of the provinces will accept it. <lb/>
                  (Hear, hear.) We ask the House to pass it <lb/> in the exact form in which we have
                  presented <lb/> it, for we know not how alterations may affect <lb/> its safety in
                  other places, and the process of <lb/> alteration once commenced in four different
                     le<lb break="no"/>gislatures—who can tell where that would end? <lb/> Every
                  member of this House is free as air to <lb/> criticise it if he so wills, and
                  amend it if he is <lb/> able—but we warn him of the danger of <lb/> amendment, and
                  throw on him all the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility of the consequences. (Hear,
                  hear.) <lb/> We feel confident of carrying this scheme as it <lb/> stands—but we
                  cannot tell what we can do if <lb/> it be amended. (Hear, hear.) Let not hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen approach this measure as a <lb/> sharp critic
                  deals with an abstract question, <lb/> striving to point out blemishes and display
                  <lb/> his ingenuity; but let us approach it as men <lb/> having but one
                  consideration before us—the <lb/> establishment of the future peace and pros<lb break="no"/>perity of our country. (Hear, hear.) Let us <lb/> look at it in the
                  light of a few months back<lb break="no"/>in the light of the evils and injustice
                  to which <lb/> it applies a remedy—in the light of the years <lb/> of discord and
                  strife we have spent in seeking <lb/> for that remedy—in the light with which the
                  <lb/> people of Canada would regard this measure <lb/> were it to be lost, and all
                  the evils of past <lb/> years to be brought back upon us again. <lb/> (Hear,
                  hear.) Let honorable gentlemen look <lb/> at the question in this view—and what
                  one of <lb/> them will take the responsibility of casting his <lb/> vote against
                  the measure? Sir, the future <lb/> destiny of these great provinces may be <lb/>
                  affected by the decision we are about to give <lb/> to an extent which at this
                  moment we may be <lb/> unable to estimate—but assuredly the welfare <lb/> for many
                  years of four millions of people <lb/> hangs on our decision. (Hear, hear.) Shall
                  <lb/> we then rise equal to the occasion ?—shall we <lb/> approach this discussion
                  without partisanship, <lb/> and free from every rsonal feeling but the <lb/>
                  earnest resolution to discharge conscientiously <lb/>
                  <cb/> the duty which an over-ruling Providence has <lb/> placed upon us? Sir, it
                  may be that some <lb/> among us will live to see the day when, as the <lb/> result
                  of this measure, a great and powerful <lb/> people may have grown up in these
                     lands<lb break="no"/>when the boundless forests all around us shall <lb/> have
                  given way to smiling fields and thriving <lb/> towns— and when one united
                  government, <lb/> under the British flag, shall extend from <lb/> shore to
                  shore:—but who would desire to <lb/> see that day if he could not recall with
                     sat<lb break="no"/>isfaction the part he took in this discussion? <lb/> Mr.
                  SPEAKER I have done. I leave the sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the conscientious
                  judgment of the <lb/> House, in the confident expectation and be<lb break="no"/>lief that the decision it will render will be <lb/> worthy of the Parliament of
