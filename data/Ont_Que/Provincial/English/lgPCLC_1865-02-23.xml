     HON. J. S. MACDONALD—Is my honor<lb break="no"/>able friend ignorant of the resolutions which 
     <lb/>
     have been passed by the Catholics of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada ? Is he ignorant that Vicar-General 
     <lb/>
     MCDONNELL of Kingston is here at the 
     <lb/>
     Palace, to give effect to them ? And does he 
     <lb/>
     say that whatever opinions I may entertain on 
     <lb/>
     the question, I must not presume to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Government to state their intentions with 
     <lb/>
    regard to it ? Their answer should not be 
     <lb/>delayed on the plea set up to-night by the 
     <lb/>President of the Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN), 
     <lb/>that they are to consider the matter. It is a 
     <lb/>matter worthy of consideration, and I press it 
     <lb/>on the attention of the Government in order 
     <lb/>that they may be prepared, for it must come.

            <p>
     MR. A. MACKENZIE—What must come? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. J.  S. MACDONALD—The question 
     <lb/>
     must be brought up in this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. BROWN—Well, bring it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. J. S. MACDONALD—I want the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the Treasury benches, when 
     <lb/>
     the question is brought up and put to them, 
     <lb/>
     to be prepared to say what they are to do with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the Catholic minority of Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada, as the Attorney General East has 
     <lb/>
     manfully stated what he will do for the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority of Lower Canada. (Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear.) I have never come to this House to 
     <lb/>
     act as the champion of any religious sect. I 
     <lb/>
     have come to do justice to all parties, and I 
     <lb/>
     claim that we are entitled to understand, when 
     <lb/>
     it is intended to make distinctions for the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the minority in one section of the 
     <lb/>
     province, whether similar distinctions are to 
     <lb/>
     be made also for the benefit of the minority 
     <lb/>
     in the other section. (Hear, hear.)

     MR. A. MACKENZIE resumed the ad<lb break="no"/>journed debate. He said — Before proceed<lb break="no"/>ing, Mr. SPEAKER, to discuss the measure of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation itself, I think it desirable to 
     <lb/>
     revert for a moment to the position which 
     <lb/>
     we have occupied, in discussing those con<lb break="no"/>stitutional questions that have so long separ<lb break="no"/>ated parties, and involved the two sections 
     <lb/>
     of the province in serious dissensions. I do 
     <lb/>
     this to meet the charges of inconsistency 
     <lb/>
     brought against myself and others, because 
     <lb/>
     we support the present Coalition Government 
     <lb/>
     with a view to obtain the solution of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties with which we have had to 
     <lb/>
     contend—in a way not perhaps hitherto 
     <lb/>
     advocated very extensively, especially in that 
     <lb/>
     part of the province to which I myself 
     <lb/>
     belong. Since I had the honor of having a 
     <lb/>
     seat in this House, I have never advocated 
     <lb/>
     representation by population as the sole 
     <lb/>
     measure I would accept as a settlement of 
     <lb/>
     those difficulties. In the first speech I ever 
     <lb/>
     made in this House, I used the following 
     <lb/>
     language :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not myself bound down to representation 
     <lb/>
     by population as the only possible measure. If 
     <lb/>
     the opponents of that measure can suggest any 
     <lb/>
     other remedy, I am quite willing to give it a can<lb break="no"/>did consideration ; and I am quite sure that the 
     <lb/>
     large constituency I represent will support me in 
     <lb/>
     considering any measure which will place it out of 
     <lb/>
     the power of the Government of the day to per<lb break="no"/>petrate sectional injustice ; but until such a 
     <lb/>
     remedy is suggested, I feel bound to advocate 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
