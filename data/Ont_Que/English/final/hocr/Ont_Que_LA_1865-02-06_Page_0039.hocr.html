<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> how many shall Upper
Canada have with a <br />
larger population? &nbsp; I was in favor of a larg- <br />
er House than one hundred and ninety-four, <br />
but was overruled. &nbsp; I was perhaps singular <br />
in the opinion, but I thought it would be <br />
well to commence with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span>
representa- <br />
tion in the lower branch.&nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span>
arguments <br />
against this were, that, in the ﬁrst place, it <br />
would cause additional expense ; in the next <br />
place, that in a new country like this, we <br />
could not get a sufﬁcient number of qualiﬁed <br />
men to be representatives. &nbsp; My reply was <br />
that the number is rapidly increasing as <br />
we increase in education and wealth ; that <br />
a larger ﬁeld would be open to political am- <br />
bition by having a larger body of represen- <br />
tatives ; that by having numerous and small- <br />
er constituencies, more people would be in- <br />
terested in the working of the union, and that <br />
there would be a wider ﬁeld for selection for <br />
leaders of governments and leaders of parties. <br />
These are my individual sentiments,—which, <br />
perhaps, I have no right to express here— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> but I was overruled,
and we ﬁxed on the <br />
number of one hundred and ninety-four, <br />
which no one will say is large or extensive, <br />
when it is considered that our present <br />
number in Canada alone is one hundred <br />
and thirty. &nbsp; The difference between one <br />
hundred and thirty and one hundred and <br />
ninety-four is not great, considering the large <br />
increase that will be made to our population <br />
when Confederation is carried into effect. <br />
While the principle of representation by popu- <br />
lation is adopted with respect to the popular <br />
branch of the legislature, not a single mem- <br />
ber of the Conference, as I stated before, not <br />
a single one of the representatives of the <br />
government or of the opposition of any one <br />
of the Lower Provinces was in favor of <br />
universal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffrage.
&nbsp;</span> Every one felt that in <br />
this respect the principle of the British Con- <br />
stitution should be carried out, and that class- <br />
es and property should be represented as well <br />
as numbers. &nbsp; Insuperable difficulties would <br />
have presented themselves if we had attempt- <br />
ed to settle now the qualiﬁcation for the elec- <br />
tive franchise. We have different laws in each <br />
of the colonies ﬁxing the qualiﬁcation of elec- <br />
tors for their own local legislatures ; and we <br />
therefore adopted a similar clause to that <br />
which is contained in the Canada Union Act <br />
of 1841, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">viz.,</span>
that all the laws which affect-<br />
ed the qualiﬁcation of members and of voters, <br />
which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affected</span>

of returning offcers and the proceedings at <br />
elections, as well as the trial of controverted&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> elections in the
separate provinces, should <br />
obtain in the ﬁrst election to the Confederate <br />
Parliament, so that every man who has now <br />
a vote in his own province should continue <br />
to have a vote in choosing a representative <br />
to the ﬁrst Federal Parliament. &nbsp; And it was <br />
left to the Parliament of the Confederation, <br />
as one of their ﬁrst duties, to consider and <br />
to settle by an act of their own the qualiﬁca- <br />
tion for the elective franchise, which would <br />
apply to the whole Confederation. &nbsp; In consid- <br />
ering the question of the duration of Parlia- <br />
ment, we came to the conclusion to recom- <br />
mend a period of ﬁve years. I was in favor of <br />
a longer period. &nbsp; I thought that the duration <br />
of the local legislatures should not be short- <br />
ened so as to be less than four years, as at pre- <br />
sent, and that the General Parliament should <br />
have as long a duration as that of the United <br />
Kingdom. &nbsp; I was willing to have gone to the <br />
extent of seven years ; but a term of ﬁve years <br />
was preferred, and we had the example of the <br />
New Zealand carefully considered, not only <br />
locally, but by the Imperial Parliament, and <br />
which gave the provinces of those islands <br />
a general parliament with a duration of ﬁve <br />
years. &nbsp; But it was a matter of little import- <br />
ance whether ﬁve years or seven years was <br />
the term, the power of dissolution by the <br />
Crown having been reserved. &nbsp; I ﬁnd, on look- <br />
ing at the duration of parliaments since the <br />
accession of George III. to the Throne, that <br />
excluding the present parliament, there have <br />
been seventeen parliaments, the average pe- <br />
riod of whose existence has been about <br />
three years and a half. &nbsp; That average is less <br />
than the average duration of the parliaments <br />
in Canada since the union, so that it was <br />
not a matter of much importance whether we <br />
ﬁxed upon ﬁve or seven years as the period <br />
of duration of our General Parliament. &nbsp; A <br />
good deal of misapprehension has arisen from <br />
the accidental omission of some words from <br />
the 24th resolution. &nbsp; It was thought that by <br />
it the local legislatures were to have the <br />
power of arranging hereafter, and from time <br />
to time of readjusting the different constitu- <br />
encies and settling the size and boundaries <br />
of the various electoral districts. The mean- <br />
ing of the resolution is simply this, that for <br />
the ﬁrst General Parliament, the arrange- <br />
ment of constituencies shall be made by the <br />
existing local legislatures ; that in Canada, <br />
for instance, the present Canadian Parliament <br />
shall arrange what are to be the constituen- <br />
cies of Upper Canada, and to make such <br />
changes as may be necessary in arranging <br />
