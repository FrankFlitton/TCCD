<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the colonial system devolved heavy and
un- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable</span> burdens upon the
Mother Country <br />
—and while a still larger number thought <br />
we had not acted as cordially and energetically <br />
as we ought in organizing our militia for the <br />
defence of the province, still I did not meet one <br />
public man, of any stripe of politics, who did <br />
not readily and heartily declare that, in case <br />
of the invasion of Canada, the honor of Great <br />
Britain would be at stake, and the whole <br />
strength of the Empire would be unhesita- <br />
tingly marshalled in our defence. (Hear, <br />
hear.) But, coupled with this, was the in- <br />
variable and most reasonable declaration that <br />
a share of the burden of defence, in peace and <br />
in war, we must contribute. And this stipu- <br />
lation applies not only to Canada, but to every <br />
one of the colonies. Already the Indian Em- <br />
pire has been made to pay the whole expense <br />
of her military establishment. The Austra-<br />
lian Colonies have agreed to pay £40 sterling <br />
per man for every soldier sent there. This <br />
system is being gradually extended—and union <br />
or no union, assuredly every one of these <br />
British American Colonies will be called upon <br />
to bear her fair share towards the defence of <br />
the Empire. And who will deny that it is a <br />
just demand, and that great colonies such as <br />
these, should be proud to meet it in a frank <br />
and earnest spirit. (Cheers.) Nothing, I <br />
am persuaded, could be more foreign to the <br />
ideas of the people of Canada, than that the <br />
people of England should be unfairly taxed <br />
for service rendered to this province. Now, <br />
the question presented to us is simply this : <br />
will these contributions which Canada and <br />
the other provinces must hereafter make to the <br />
defence of the Empire, be better rendered by <br />
a hardy, energetic, population, acting as <br />
one people, than as ﬁve or six separate <br />
communities? (Hear, hear.) There is no <br />
doubt about it. But not only do our <br />
changed relations towards the Mother Country <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">call</span> on us to assume the new duty
of military <br />
defence—our changed relations towards the <br />
neighboring Republic compel us to do so. For <br />
myself, I have no belief that the Americans <br />
have the slightest thought of attacking us. I <br />
cannot believe that the ﬁrst use of their new- <br />
found liberty will be the invasion, totally un- <br />
provoked, of a peaceful province. I fancy that <br />
they have had quite enough of war for a good <br />
many years to come—and that such a war as <br />
one with England would certainly be, is the <br />
last they are likely to provoke. But, Mr. <br />
SPEAKER, there is no better mode of warding <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off </span>war when it is threatened,
than to be pre- <br />
pared for it if it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comes.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Americans are <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> now a warlike people. They have large <br />
armies, a powerful navy, an unlimited supply <br />
of warlike munitions, and the carnage of war <br />
has to them been stript of its horrors. The <br />
American side of our lines already bristles <br />
with works of defence, and unless we are wil- <br />
ling to live at the mercy of our neighbors, we, <br />
too, must put our country in a state of efficient <br />
preparation. War or no war—the neces- <br />
sity of placing these provinces in a thorough <br />
state <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> defence can no longer
be post-<br />
poned. Our country is coming to be re-<br />
garded as undefended and indefensible— <br />
the capitalist is alarmed, and the immi-<br />
grant is afraid to come among us. Were <br />
it merely as a measure of commercial advan-<br />
tage, every one of these colonies must meet <br />
the question of military defence promptly and <br />
energetically. And how can we do this so <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efficiently</span> and economically as by
the union <br />
now proposed? (Hear, hear.) I have already <br />
shown that union would give us a body of <br />
70,000 hardy seamen ready and able to defend <br />
our sea-coasts and inland lakes; let us now <br />
see what would be the military strength of the <br />
Confederation. By the last census (1861) it <br />
appears that the men capable of bearing arms <br />
in British America were as follows:— <br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
Upper Canada, from 20 to 60..... <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">308,955</span>
<br />
Lower Canada, from 20 to 60...... 225,620 <br />
Nova Scotia, from 20 to 60.......67,367 <br />
New Brunswick, from 20 to 60.....51,625 <br />
Newfoundland from 20 to 60......25,532 <br />
Prince Edward Island, 21 to 60.....14,819 <br />

might be obtained from this vast array of men, <br />
the erection of defensive works at salient <br />
points, and the force of British troops that <br />
would soon come to our aid—who can doubt <br />
that the invasion of our country would be <br />
successfully resisted? But, seventhly, Mr. <br />
SPEAKER, I am in favor of this union because <br />
it will give us a sea-board at all seasons of the <br />
year. (Hear, hear.) It is not to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">denied</span>
<br />
that the position of Canada, shut off as she is <br />
from the sea-board during the winter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">months,</span>
<br />
is far from satisfactory—and should the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span>
<br />
States carry out their insane threat of abolish-<br />
ing the bonding system, by which our mer-<br />
chandise passes free through their territory<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> <br />
would be still more embarrassing. The Mari-<br />
time Provinces are equally cut off from com-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">munication inland. Now, this embarrassment <br />
will be ended by colonial union. The Inter- <br />
colonial Railway will give us at all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">times</span>

access to the Atlantic through British terri- <br />
