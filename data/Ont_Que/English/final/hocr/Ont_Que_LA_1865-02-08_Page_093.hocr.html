op- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posite</span> would have had a much
better chance <br />
of success in blowing the bellows of agitation <br />
than they now have. (Laughter, and cheers.) <br />
The objection, moreover, was not confined to <br />
Lower Canada—all the Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span>
stood <br />
in exactly the same position. They have not <br /><span style="background-color: white;">
a municipal system such as we have, discharg-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ing many of the functions of government; </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
but their General Government performs all </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the duties which in Upper Canada devolve </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
upon our municipal councils, as well as upon </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Parliament. If then the Lower Provinces </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
had been asked to maintain their customs </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
duties for federal purposes, and to impose on </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
themselves by the same act direct taxation for </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
all their local purposes, the chances of carrying </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the scheme of union would have been greatly </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
lessened. (Hear, hear.) But I apprehend </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
that if we did not succeed in putting this </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
matter on the footing that would have been </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the best, at least we did the next best thing. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Two courses were open to us—either to sur- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
render to the local governments some source </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of indirect revenue, some tax which the Gene- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ral Government proposed to retain,—or col- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
lect the money by the federal machinery, and </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
distribute it to the local governments for </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
local purposes. And we decided in favor of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the latter. We asked the representatives of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the different governments to estimate how </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
much they would require after the inaugura- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tion of the federal system to carry on their </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
local machinery. As at first presented to us, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the annual sum required for all the provinces </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
was something like five millions of dollars—an </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
amount that could not ibly have been al- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
lotted. The great trouble was that some of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the governments are vastly more expensive </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
than others—extensive countries, with sparse </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
populations, necessarily requiring more money </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
per head for local government than countries </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
more densely populated. But as any grant </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
given from the common chest, for local pur- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
poses, to one province, must be extend to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
all, on the basis of population, it follows that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
for every $1,000 given, for example, to New </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> we must give over
$1,300 to Nova </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
Scotia, $4,000 to Lower Canada, and $6,000 </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to Upper Canada—thereby drawing from the </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">federal exchequer</span><span style="background-color: white;"> much large sums
than </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
these provinces needed for local purposes. </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
The course we adopted then was this: We </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
formed a committee of Finance Ministers and </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
made each of them go over his list of expendi- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
tures, lopping off unnecessary services </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span><span style="background-color: white;">
</span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
cutting down every item to the lowest possible </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">figure.</span><span style="background-color: white;"> By this means we

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ducing the total annual subsidy required
for <br />
local government to the sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,630,000—</span>
<br />
of which Lower Canada will receive annually <br />
$880,000, and Upper Canada $1,120,000. But<br />
it is said that in addition to her eighty cents <br />
per head under this arrangement, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New B</span>runs- <br />
wick is to receive an extra grant from the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federal</span> chest of $63,000
annually for ten <br />
years. Well, this is perfectly true. After <br />
cutting down as I have explained the local <br />
expenditures to the lowest mark, it was found <br />
that New Brunswick and Newfoundland could <br />
not possibly carry on their local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments</span>
<br />
with the sum per head that would suffice for <br />
all the rest. New Brunswick imperatively <br />
required $63,000 per annum beyond her <br />
share, and we had either to find that sum for <br />
her or give up the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hope</span> of
union. The <br />
question then arose, would it not be better to <br />
give New Brunswick a special grant of <br />
$63,000 for a limited number of years, so that <br />
her local revenues might have time to be <br />
developed, rather than increase the subsidy to <br />
all the local governments, thereby lacing <br />
an additional burden on the federal exchequer <br />
of over eight hundred thousand dollars per <br />
annum? We came unanimously to the con- <br />
clusion that the extra sum needed by New <br />
Brunswick was too small to be allowed to stand <br />
in the way of union—we also determined that it <br />
would be the height of absurdity to impose a <br />
permanent burden on the country of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$800,000</span>
<br />
a year, simply to escape a payment of $63,000 <br />
for ten years—and so it came about that New <br />
Brunswick got this extra grant—an arrange- <br />
ment which received and receives now my <br />
hearty approval. (Hear, hear.) It is only <br />
right to say, however, that New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick</span>
<br />
may possibly be in a position to do without <br />
this money. The House is aware that the <br />
Federal Government is to assume the debts of <br />
the several provinces, each province being en- <br />
titled to throw upon it a debt of $25 per <br />
head of its population. Should the debt of <br />
any province exceed $25 per head, it is to <br />
pay interest on the excess to the federal <br />
treasury; but should it fall below $25 per <br />
head, it is to receive interest from the feder- <br />
al treasury on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span>
between its <br />
actual debt and the debt to which it is en- <br />
titled. Now, it so happens that the existing <br />
debt of New Brunswick is much less than it <br />
is entitled to throw on the Federal Govern- <br />
ment. It is, however, under liability for <br />
certain works, which if proceeded with would <br />
bring its debt up to the mark of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$25</span>
a head. <br />
But if these works are not proceeded with <br />
New Brunswick will be entitled to a large
