<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> duties. Still, the objection made to this
was <br />
very strong. It was said: “Suppose you <br />
appoint them for nine years, what will be the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect?</span> For the last three or
four years of‘ <br />
their term they would be anticipating its <br />
expiry, and anxiously looking to the Adminis- <br />
tration of the day for reappointment; and the <br />
consequence would be that a third of the mem- <br />
bers would be under the inﬂuence of the Ex- <br />
ecutive.” The desire was to render the Upper <br />
House a thoroughly independent body—one <br />
that would be in the best position to canvass <br />
dispassionately the measures of this House, and <br />
stand up for the public interests in opposition <br />
to hasty or partisan legislation. It was con- <br />
tended that there is no fear of a dead-lock. <br />
We were reminded how the system of appoint- <br />
ing for life had worked in past years, since <br />
Responsible Government was introduced; we <br />
were told that the complaint was not then, <br />
that the Upper Chamber had been too obstruc— <br />
tive a body—not that it had sought to restrain <br />
the popular will, but that it had too faith- <br />
fully reﬂected the popular will. Undoubtedly <br />
that was the complaint formerly pressed upon <br />
us—(hear, hear)—and I readily admit that <br />
if ever there was a body to whom we could <br />
safely entrust the power which by this mea- <br />
sure we propose to confer on the members <br />
of the Upper Chamber, it is the body of <br />
gentlemen who at this moment compose <br />
the Legislative Council of Canada. The <br />
forty-eight Councillors for Canada are to <br />
be chosen from the present chamber. There <br />
are now thirty-four members from the one <br />
section, and thirty-five from the other. I <br />
believe that of the sixty-nine, some will not <br />
desire to make their appearance here again, <br />
others, unhappily, from years and infirmity, <br />
may not have strength to do so; and there <br />
may be others who will not desire to qualify <br />
under the Statute. It is quite clear that when <br />
twenty-four are selected for Upper Canada <br />
and twenty-four for Lower Canada, very few <br />
indeed of the present House will be excluded <br />
from the Federal Chamber; and I confess I <br />
am not without hope that there may be some <br />
way yet found of providing for all who desire <br />
it, an honorable position in the Legislature <br />
of the country. (Hear, hear.) And, after <br />
all, is it not an imaginary fear—that of a <br />
dead-lock? Is it at all probable that any <br />
body of gentlemen who may compose the <br />
Upper House, appointed as they will be for <br />
life, acting as they will do on personal and <br />
not party responsibility, possessing as they <br />
must, a deep stake in the welfare of the <br />
country, and desirous as they must be of <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> holding the esteem of their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fellow subjects—</span> <br />
would take so unreasonable a course as to <br />
imperil the whole political fabric? The <br />
British House of Peers itself does not venture, <br />á l'outrance, to resist the popular will, and <br />
can it be anticipated that our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper</span>
Chamber <br />
would set itself rashly against the popular will? <br />
If any fear is to be entertained in the mat- <br />
ter, is it not rather that the Councillors will <br />
be found too thoroughly in harmony with the <br />
popular feeling of the day? An we have <br />
this satisfaction at any rate, that, so far as its <br />
first formation is concerned—so far as the pre- <br />
sent question is concerned—we shall have a <br />
body of gentlemen in whom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span>
confidence <br />
may be placed. (Hear, hear.) But it is ob- <br />
jected that in the constitution of the Upper <br />
House, so far as Lower Canada is concerned, <br />
the existing electoral divisions are to be main- <br />
tained, while, as regards Upper Canada, they <br />
are to be abolished—that the members from <br />
Lower Canada are to sit as representing the <br />
divisions in which they reside or have their <br />
property qualification; while in Upper Ca- <br />
nada there is no such arrangement. Un- <br />
doubtedly this is the fact; it has been so <br />
arranged to suit the peculiar position of this <br />
section of the province. Our Lower Canada <br />
friends felt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> they had
French Canadian <br />
interests and British interests to be protected, <br />
and they conceived that the existing system<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of electoral divisions would give
protection to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> separate interests. We, in
Upper Ca- <br />
nada, on the other hand, were quite content <br />
that they should settle that among <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them-</span>
<br />
selves, and maintain their existing divisions if <br />
they chose. But, so far as we in the west <br />
were concerned, we had no such separate in- <br />
terests to protect—we had no diversities of <br />
origin or language to reconcile—and we felt <br />
that the true interest of Upper Canada was <br />
that her very best men should be sent to the <br />
Legislative Council, wherever they might <br />
happen to reside or wherever their property <br />
was located. (Hear, hear.) If there is one <br />
evil in the American system which in my <br />
mind stands out as preeminently its grea<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">test</span>
<br />
defect, except universal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffrage,</span>
it is that <br />
under that Constitution the representatives of <br />
the people must reside in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituencies</span>
<br />
for which they sit. (Hear, hear.) The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">result</span>
<br />
is that a public man,—no matter what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span>
<br />
talent, or what his position—no matter how <br />
necessary it may be for the interest of the <br />
country that he should be in public life, unless <br />
he happens to belong to the political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party</span>
<br />
popular for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> being in
the constituency <br />
where he resides, cannot possibly find a seat <br />
