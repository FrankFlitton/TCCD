<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ment unsought for by the country ? Much <br />
had been said about the risk of collision <br />
between two elective Houses, that legislation <br />
might come to a dead-lock; now it was a <br />
remarkable fact that under the present system <br />
there had been no such difficulties, while both <br />
in England and in Canada, previous to the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduction</span> of the elective
system, they had <br />
occurred, and on several occasions the power <br />
of the Crown had been called in to overcome <br />
them by appointing additional members. <br />
What would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> the position of
the House <br />
under the new scheme ? It would be the <br />
most irresponsible body in the world; and if a <br />
dead-lock should occur there would be no way <br />
of overcoming it, for the casualties of death, <br />
resignation or acceptance of office, which had <br />
been so strongly insisted upon as sufficiently <br />
numerous to enable the Government of the <br />
day to modify the character of the House, <br />
would not in his opinion be adequate to meet <br />
such an exigency. Such was apparently the <br />
view of the Colonial Secretary; and it would <br />
in all probability be found necessary to leave <br />
the Crown unfettered in the exercise of its <br />
preogative of apppointment. The hon- <br />
orable gentleman concluded by saying that he <br />
would not now comment upon any other <br />
details of the scheme, as he understood the <br />
resolutions were to be discussed seriatim, but <br />
he did not very clearly see the advantage of <br />
such a discussion when it was so distinctly <br />
stated that the only question for the House to <br />
determine was whether the scheme as now <br />
submitted, unchanged and unchangeable, <br />
should be rejected or adop<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ted.</span>
(Hear, hear.) <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ said the scheme, <br />
it was true, must be taken as a whole, or re- <br />
jected, since it was not the property of the Gov- <br />
ernment of Canada alone, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> of
all the other <br />
provinces as well. But it did not therefore <br />
follow that honorable members who might dis- <br />
sent from some parts of it might not inscribe <br />
that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissent on</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">journals.</span> If the amend- <br />
ments proposed were passed, the motion for an <br />
Address would not be pressed; but, if they did <br />
not carry, then the votes of the honorable mem- <br />
bers who had supported them would be on record. <br />
In former days, before the yeas and nays were <br />
taken, it was the practice for members who <br />
objected to any particular measure, in confor- <br />
mity with the practice of the House of Lords, <br />
to enter a protest on the journals exhibiting <br />
their reasons for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissent,</span> and
he knew of no <br />
rule which would prevent such a course from <br />
being pursued on the present occasion. It <br />
was quite in the power of honorable members, <br />
if they chose, to propose amendments, and so <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Cries of “ adjourn! adjourn!” <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MOORE</span>
said, as there was an <br />
evident desire for an adjournment, he would <br />
not occupy the time of the House for more <br />
than a few minutes, his intention being merely <br />
to refer to a portion of the remarks made <br />
by the honorable gentleman (Hon. Mr. VIDAL) <br />
who had just sat down. Though be generally <br />
agreed in what had been said by that honor- <br />
able member, there was one particular in which <br />
he (Hon. Mr. MOORE) thought he was in error. <br />
He (Hon. Mr. VIDAL) seemed to have become <br />
impressed with the idea that it was not compe- <br />
tent for the House to amend the resolutions, but <br />
that they should either be adopted or rejected <br />
as a whole. It was true the Government had <br />
so laid it down, but he (Hon. Mr. MOORE) held <br />
that the question could be dealt with in the <br />
same manner as any other that might come <br />
before the House. His honorable friend was <br />
also of opinion that, if no suggestions or amend- <br />
ments were to be adopted, it was wasting time <br />
to discuss the scheme. In this respect he <br />
(Hon. Mr. MOORE) begged to differ with the <br />
honorable gentleman, holding that it was not <br />
only useful, but essentially necessary that the <br />
details of a measure fraught with such grave and <br />
momentous importance to the country should <br />
be thoroughly discussed. A calm and con- <br />
siderate discussion—and every latitude for <br />
discussion—were necessary, and he hoped the <br />
Government would not press the measure with <br />
any unseemly haste, for they not only owed it <br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature,</span> but to the
country, that <br />
ample opportunity for consideration of the <br />
project should be afforded to
the people’s <br />
representatives. He also considered it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">import</span>-<br />
ant that members should have an opportunity <br />
to confer with their constituents on the sub- <br />
ject, in order to vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advisedly</span>
when the time <br />
came; and he trusted the Government would <br />
not press the matter, nor hinder the expression <br />
of views, even if those views extended to <br />
amendment in certain particulars. The hon- <br />
orable gentleman then sat down, repeating <br />
that he thought the House might deal with <br />
the question as with any other that might <br />
come before it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The debate was then adjourned until the <br />
morrow. <br />
