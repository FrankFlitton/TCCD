<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> orable gentleman to leaving the British
popu- <br />
lation of Lower Canada in the unrestricted <br />
wer of the Local Legislature? The Common <br />
Schools of Lower Canada are not as in Upper <br />
Canada—they are almost entirely non-sectarian <br />
Roman Catholic Schools. Does the honorable <br />
gentleman, then, desire to compel the Protes- <br />
tants of Lower Canada to avail themselves of <br />
Roman Catholic institutions, or leave their <br />
children without instruction? (Hear hear, and <br />
cheers.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, I am further in <br />
favor of this scheme because it will bring to an <br />
end the sectional discord between Upper and <br />
Lower Canada. It sweeps away the boundary <br />
line between the provinces so far as regards <br />
matters common to the whole people—it places <br />
all on an equal level—and the members of <br />
the Federal Legislature will meet at last as <br />
citizens of a common country. The questions <br />
that used to excite the most hostile feelings <br />
among us have been taken away from the <br />
General Legislature, and placed under the <br />
control of the local bodies. No man need <br />
hereafter be debarred from success in public <br />
life because his views, however popular in his <br />
own section, are unpopular in the other,—for <br />
he will not have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal</span> with
sectional ques- <br />
tions ; and the temptation to the Government <br />
of the day to make capital out of local preju- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dices</span> will be greatly lessened,
if not altogether <br />
at an end. What has rendered prominent <br />
public men in one section utterly unpopular <br />
in the other in past years? Has it been our <br />
views on trade and commerce—immigration <br />
—land settlement—the canal system—the <br />
tariff,—or any other of the great questions <br />
of national interest? No, sir, it was from our <br />
views as to the applying of public money <br />
to local purposes—the allotment of public <br />
lands to local purposes,—the building of local <br />
roads, bridges, and landing-piers with public <br />
funds—the chartering of ecclesiastical insti- <br />
tutions—the granting of public money for <br />
sectarian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purposes—the</span>
interference with our <br />
school system—and similar matters, that the <br />
hot feuds between Upper and Lower Canada <br />
have chiefly arisen, and caused our public men, <br />
the more faithful they were to the opinions <br />
and wishes of one section, to be the more <br />
unpopular in the other. A most happy day <br />
will it be for Canada when this bill goes into <br />
effect, and all these subjects of discord are <br />
swept from the discussion of our Legislature. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear.)</span> But, Mr. SPEAKER, I am
further in <br />
favor of this scheme as a remedial measure, <br />
because it brings to an end the doubt that has <br />
so long hung over our position, and gives a sta- <br />
bility to our future in the eyes of the world that <br />

(Re- <br />
peated marks of approval, but ironical cheers <br />
from Hon. Mr. HOLTON.) The hon. member <br />
for Chateauguay cries “hear, hea” in a very <br />
credulous tone; but the hon. member should <br />
be one of the very last to express doubts on <br />
this point. Has he not, for many years, ad- <br />
mitted the absolute necessity of constitutional <br />
changes, ere peace and prosperity could be es- <br />
tablished in our land? Has he not taken part <br />
in the contests to obtain those changes ? Has <br />
he not experienced the harsh and hostile feel- <br />
ings that have pervaded this House and the <br />
whole country? And did he not sign the re- <br />
port of my committee last session, declaring a <br />
Federal union to be the true solution of our <br />
troubles, political and constitutional? And <br />
does the honorable member think these matters <br />
were not well known in the United States, <br />
and that the hope of our annexation to the <br />
republic was not kept alive by them from year <br />
to year? Does he fancy that our discords <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> discontent were not well
known in Great <br />
Britain, and that the capitalist and the emi- <br />
grant were not inﬂuenced by our distractions? <br />
Does he fancy that people abroad, as well as <br />
at home, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did</span> not perfectly
understand that <br />
Upper Canada would not much longer submit <br />
to the injustice from which she suffered—and <br />
that until the future relations of the two sec- <br />
tions were adjusted, no one could predict <br />
safely what our future position might be? But <br />
when the measure before us has been adopted <br />
—when justice has been done to both sections— <br />
when all are placed on an equal footing—when <br />
the sectional matters that rent us have been <br />
handed over to sectional control—when sec- <br />
tional expenditure shall be placed on sectional <br />
shoulders—will not a sense of security and <br />
stability be inspired, which we never before <br />
enjoyed and never could have enjoyed under <br />
existing circumstances? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span>
Viewed <br />
then, Mr. SPEAKER, from a merely Canadian <br />
stand-point—viewed solely as a remedial mea- <br />
sure—I fearlessly assert that the scheme in your <br />
hands is a just and satisfactory remedy for the <br />
evils and injustice that have so long distracted <br />
the province—(cheers)—and so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strongly</span>
do I <br />
feel this, that were every word of objection <br />
urged against our union with the Maritime <br />
Provinces just and true to the very letter, I <br />
would not hesitate to adopt the union as the <br />
price of a measure of constitutional reform in <br />
Canada, so just and so complete as now pro- <br />
posed. (Cheers.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, so far from <br />
the objections urged against union with the <br />
Maritime Provinces being sound, so far from <br />
union with them being a drawback to this <br />
