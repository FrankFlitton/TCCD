divisions <br />
for the first organization of the Federal Par- <br />
liament, they do not determine in whose hands <br />
the duty of distributing any additional mem- <br />
bers is to be vested. No doubt on this head <br />
need exist; the Federal Parliament will of <br />
course have full power to regulate all arrange- <br />
ments for the election of its own members. <br />
But I am told by Upper Canadians—the con- <br />
stitution of the Lower House is all well <br />
enough, it is in the Upper House arrangements <br />
that the scheme is objectionable. And first, <br />
it is said that Upper Canada should have had <br />
in the Legislative Council a greater number <br />
of members than Lower Canada.— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. T. C. WALLBRIDGE—Hear, hear! <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN —The honorable mem- <br />
ber for North Hastings is of that opinion; <br />
but that honorable gentleman is in favor <br />
of a legislative union, and had we been form- <br />
ing a legislative 'union, there might have <br />
been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> force in the demand.
But <br />
the very essence of our compact is that <br />
the union shall be federal and not legisla- <br />
tive. Our Lower Canada friends have agreed <br />
to give us representation by population in <br />
the Lower House, on the express condition <br />
that they shall have equality in the Upper <br />
House. On no other condition could we have <br />
advanced a step; and, for my part, I am quite <br />
willing they should have it. In maintaining <br />
the existing sectional boundaries and handing <br />
over the control of local matters to local <br />
bodies, we recognize, to a certain extent, a <br />
diversity of interests; and it was quite natural <br />
that the protection for those interests, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span>
<br />
equality in the Upper Chamber, should he <br />
demanded by the less numerous provinces. <br />
Honorable gentlemen may say that it will <br />
erect a barrier in the Upper House against <br />
the just inﬂuence that Upper Canada will ex- <br />
ercise, by her numbers, in the Lower House<br />
over the general legislation of the country. <br />
That may be true, to a certain extent, but <br />
honorable gentlemen will bear in mind that <br />
that barrier, be it more or less, will not affect <br />
money bills. (Hear, hear.) Hitherto we <br />
have been paying a vast proportion of the <br />
taxes<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> with little or no control
over the ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">penditure.</span> But, under this plan,
by our <br />
just inﬂuence in the Lower Chamber; we <br />
shall hold the purse strings. If, from this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concession</span> of equality in the
Upper Chamber, <br />
we are restrained from forcing through meas- <br />
ures which our friends of Lower Canada may <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider</span> injurious to their
interests, we shall, <br />
at any rate, have power, which we never had <br />
before, to prevent them from forcing through <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> whatever we may deem unjust to us. I <br />
think the compromise a fair one, and am per- <br />
suaded that it will work easily and satisfac- <br />
torily. (Hear, hear.) But it has been said <br />
that the members of the Upper House ought <br />
not to be appointed by the Crown, but should <br />
continue to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> elected by the
people at large. <br />
On that question my views have been often <br />
expressed. I have always been opposed to a <br />
second elective chamber, and I am so still, <br />
from the conviction that two elective houses <br />
are inconsistent with the right working of the <br />
British parliamentary system. I voted, almost <br />
alone, against the change when the Council <br />
was made elective, but I have lived to see a <br />
vast majority of those who did the deed wish <br />
it had not been done. It is quite true, and I <br />
am glad to acknowledge it, that many evils an- <br />
ticipated from the change, when the measure <br />
was adopted, have not been realized. (Hear, <br />
hear.) I readily admit that men of the high- <br />
est character and position have been brought <br />
into the Council by the elective system, but it <br />
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equally</span> true that the system
of appointment <br />
brought into it men of the highest character <br />
and position. Whether appointed by the Crown <br />
or elected by the people, since the introduction <br />
of parliamentary government, the men who have <br />
composed the Upper House of this Legislature <br />
have been men who would have done honor to <br />
any legislature in the world. But what we <br />
most feared was, that the Legislative Council- <br />
lors would be elected under party responsibili- <br />
ties; that a partisan spirit would soon show <br />
itself in the chamber; and that the right. <br />
would soon be asserted to an equal control <br />
with this House over money bills. That fear <br />
has not been realised to any dangerous extent. <br />
But is it not possible that such a claim might <br />
ere long be asserted? Do we not hear, even <br />
now, mutterings of a coming demand for it? <br />
Nor can we forget that the elected members <br />
came into that chamber gradually ; that the <br />
large number of old appointed members exer- <br />
cised much inﬂuence in maintaining the old <br />
forms of the House, the old style of debate, <br />
and the old barriers against encroachment on <br />
the privileges of the commons. But the ap- <br />
pointed members of the Council are gradually <br />passing away, and when the elective element <br />
becomes supreme, who will venture to aﬂirm <br />
that the Council would not claim that power <br />
over money bills which this House claims as of <br />
right belonging to itself? Could they not justly <br />
say that they represent the people as well as we <br />
do, and that the control of the purse strings <br />
ought, therefore, to belong to them as much as <br />
to us. (Hear, hear.) It is said they have not <br />
