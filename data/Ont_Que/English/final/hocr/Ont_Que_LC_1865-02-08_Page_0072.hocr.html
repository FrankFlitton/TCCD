<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Intercolonial Union, they might
afterwards <br />
have said “save us from our friends." (Hear.) <br />
He took the very singular course of ﬁrst <br />
decrying the credit of the Lower Provinces, <br />
and then decrying that of Canada itself, en- <br />
deavoring to show ﬁrst that we were making <br />
a very bad bargain in uniting our destiny <br />
with such poor provinces as they were, <br />
and afterwards that such was our state <br />
of bankruptcy that they would be very <br />
foolish indeed in joining their fate with <br />
ours. (Laughter.) It would, indeed, be almost <br />
a sufficient answer to the honorable mem- <br />
ber to take his speech in separate paragraphs <br />
and to place certain of them opposite to others <br />
as the reply, for a more illogical and inconse- <br />
quential address I hardly ever heard. Nor <br />
was he content with dealing in what he thought <br />
was irony or sarcasm, but ventured to attack <br />
important statements of fact made by the pub- <br />
lic men of this and the other provinces. Now, <br />
if we are to have a Confederation at all, I think <br />
we should be careful what language we use with<br />
respect to such men, and what statements
we <br />
place before the public. If language such as <br />
the hon. member permitted himself to use he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">encouraged,</span> it will be impossible
to secure the <br />
good feeling and harmony which are indispen- <br />
sably necessary to the well-working of the <br />
contemplated union. I am, however, satisﬁed <br />
that the sober sense of the House will condemn <br />
such language, not only when it comes from <br />
the hon. member for Niagara, but when falling <br />
from any other hon. member. (Hear, hear.) <br />
The hon. member commenced his attacks upon <br />
the public men of the provinces by quoting <br />
from a speech of Mr. LYNCH, recently deliv- <br />
ered at Halifax, and did his best to turn it <br />
into ridicule, as well as to excite contemptuous <br />
laughter at the expense of that gentleman. <br />
Now the statements Mr. LYNCH made are <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts,</span> not foolish inventions, as
the hon. mem- <br />
ber pretended. That gentleman spoke by <br />
the book, and relied for his information upon <br />
the official report of one of our public depart- <br />
ments, and if the hon. member will turn to <br />
the census of 1852, he will ﬁnd, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span>
page 32, a <br />
table comparing the produce of Canada and <br />
the United States, from which it appears that, <br />
while that of the latter increased 48 per cent., <br />
that of Canada increased 400 per cent. during <br />
the previous decade. This is what Mr. LYNCH <br />
stated, and what the hon. member for Niagara <br />
asserted to be untrue. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—That was between <br />
the years 1841 and 1851, while the remarks <br />
of Mr. LYNCH had reference to the subsequent <br />
decade.<br />
</p>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 1939 677 3424 5277">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ROSS—It is not so; Mr. LYNCH <br />
spoke of an increase of ten years; he read <br />
from our official records in proof, and read <br />
correctly. The hon. member probably derived <br />
his information from some newspaper, and the <br />
error he has committed should teach him to be <br />
more cautious how he assails public men on <br />
such evidence. (Hear, hear.) He then turned <br />
from Mr. LYNCH to the Premier of New <br />
Brunswick, a gentleman of the highest char- <br />
acter and ability, who is so strong in the <br />
esteem and conﬁdence of the people of that <br />
province that it seems impossible to displace him. <br />
Now I maintain that, to say the least it is in <br />
extremely bad taste to attack high-placed <br />
public men, especially those of other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">countries,</span>
<br />
and more especially those of the sister colonies, <br />
as the hon. member has done. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—I did not attack <br />
them. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ROSS—The hon. member has <br />
attacked their veracity; he has denied the cor- <br />
rectness of the statements they made openly <br />
as public men. The Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TILLEY</span>
quoted <br />
the ﬁgures of our own Minister of Finance, <br />
and the hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represented</span>
him as not <br />
speaking the truth, but as, in effect, attempting <br />
to deceive those whom he addressed. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—I beg to know when <br />
the Finance Minister of Canada stated that <br />
the average duties collected in Canada were <br />
11 per cent. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">figures—</span> <br />
</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ROSS—The honorable member <br />
will ﬁnd it in the Finance Minister’s speech, <br />
and while I do not think it proper in him <br />
to interrupt me for the purpose of going into <br />
calculations just at this moment, I maintain <br />
that by taking all the imports, including those <br />
free of duty, the honorable member will ﬁnd <br />
that the rate stated is exactly correct. The <br />
imports in 1863 amounted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$45,964,493,</span>
<br />
and the duty collected was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5,169,173,</span>
which <br />
is just 11 per cent. of the whole. I repeat, <br />
honorable gentlemen, that, instead of making <br />
such attacks on great public men, I conceive <br />
it to be more properly our duty to defend <br />
them. (Hear.) Having thus disposed of the <br />
remarks the honorable member made on the <br />
veracity of Mr. LYNCH and Hon. Mr. TILLEY, <br />
I will now advert to that portion of his remarks <br />
in which he endeavored to show that Hon. Mr. <br />
GALT’S statements were incorrect. He referred <br />
to the ﬁgures respecting the tonnage of the pro- <br />
posed Confederation, as quoted by Hon. Mr.<br />
GALT, and pooh=poohed his remarks in a way
<br />
which was no doubt intended to be very amusing. <br />
The Minister of Finance declared that when <br />
the Union was effected, we should be, he be- <br />
