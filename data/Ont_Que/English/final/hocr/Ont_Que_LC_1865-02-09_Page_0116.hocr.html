<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> acquiesced in the scheme as a whole, to
some <br />
of the particular features of which their own <br />
convictions might be opposed, and in reference <br />
to which they perhaps had no opportunity of <br />
ascertaining definitely the views of their con- <br />
stituents. Now, he would ask honorable gen- <br />
tlemen, did it not constantly happen that in <br />
the business of life they were obliged to dele- <br />
gate to a few the conduct of many matters in <br />
which they were most deeply interested them- <br />
selves, but which, from the very nature of the <br />
interests involved, could not be dealt with ad- <br />
vantageously otherwise, and if they had con- <br />
ﬁdence in the judgment and ability of those to <br />
whom the task had been committed, were they <br />
not satisfied to accept their recommendations, <br />
although their views on all points might not <br />
coincide with their own ? Just so in the ease <br />
of the Confederation scheme—it was one which <br />
required special ability, tact and judgment, to <br />
deal with. It was one in which so many con- <br />
ﬂicting interests, so many nice questions were <br />
involved, that it would have been next to im- <br />
possible to have arrived at any satisfactory <br />
settlement of the question, had the task been <br />
committed to a popular assembly or any other <br />
large body. Now, he was satisfied that the <br />
people of this country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span>
fully persuaded at <br />
the time of the Conference that the task of <br />
framing a scheme for the union of all the <br />
North American Provinces had been assumed <br />
by those statesmen who, by their ability, ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perience</span> and judgment were, of
all men, the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">best qualified for the duty; and he had
yet to <br />
learn, from any expression of public opinion, <br />
either out of doors or in the press, that this <br />
confidence had been shaken, or that the scheme, <br />
as a whole, had been disapproved of. On the <br />
contrary, the people of Canada had now been <br />
acquainted with all the important features of <br />
the measure for some three months at least, <br />
and he believed the result had been that, <br />
while various opinions had been expressed in <br />
reference to the details of the scheme, the great <br />
majority of the people were perfectly satisfied <br />
to leave the matter in the hands of their re- <br />
presentatives, to be assented to by them as a <br />
whole, if, after a full discussion of its merits, <br />
they were satisfied that they so far outweighed <br />
its defects as to commend itself to their <br />
adoption. If then, in the best exercise of <br />
his judgment, he had come to the conclusion <br />
that the peculiar circumstances of the times, <br />
and the merits of the scheme as a whole, out- <br />
weighed any of the defects which might present <br />
themselves in the details, he thought he should <br />
be fully warranted, acting on behalf of his <br />
constituents, in according his support to the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> measure, without being in any way
chargeable <br />
with a dereliction of duty or a betrayal of the <br />
trust committed to him. He would new state <br />
to the House what were the considerations <br />
which induced him to give his support to the <br />
measure, and which, to him at least, appeared <br />
of sufficient importance to outweigh all objec- <br />
tions that had been brought against it. They <br />
were twofold—arising in the first place from <br />
our internal condition, and in the second lace <br />
from our position with regard to the neighbor- <br />
ing States. And first, with regard to our in- <br />
ternal condition, while he partly agreed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>
<br />
the remark which fell from the honorable <br />
member for the Brock Division, that our poli-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
tical differences alone could perhaps scarcely <br />
be said to necessitate such great and important <br />
constitutional changes as those involved in <br />
Confederation; yet taken in connection with <br />
our external relations, he thought no one would <br />
deny that the state of chronic weakness of the <br />
governing body had become a subject of grave <br />
apprehension to every well-wisher of their <br />
country. No one would deny that when storms <br />
were impending, it was doubly necessary that <br />
the ships of the state should be guided by firm <br />
and determined hands—that weakness and <br />
vacillation under such circumstances would be <br />
sure to end in disaster. Yet for the last few <br />
years, when the political horizon had been <br />
growing darker an darker, when fresh causes <br />
of irritation had unhappily sprung up from <br />
time to time between us and our neighbors, <br />
we had seen ministry after ministry break <br />
down, until anything like a stable and vigorous <br />
government seemed to have become a hopeless <br />
impossibility. Who could say that such a <br />
state of things was not fraught with danger to <br />
any community. He believed that in Federa- <br />
tion they had found a remedy for those sec- <br />
tional differences between Upper and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span>
<br />
Canada, which had so long agitated the <br />
country, and had been a source of weakness to <br />
so many administrations. Under the scheme <br />
now proposed, all causes of jealousy and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis-</span>
<br />
trust between the two provinces would be <br />
removed, and they might well hail with satis- <br />
faction any change which, by removing these <br />
stumbling-blocks which sectional feeling and <br />
party strife had placed in the way of so man <br />
successive ministries, had enabled the ablest <br />
men of all parties to unite their councils <br />
for the formation of a strong, vigorous and <br />
permanent government. For these con- <br />
siderations, amongst others, the measure <br />
before the House should have his hearty <br />
support, but there were to his mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">graver</span>
<br />
reasons still why the union of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span>
