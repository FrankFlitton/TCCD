<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> wishes of the people chiefly interested?<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> Hon- <br />
orable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> who betray such
anxiety to <br />
press this scheme at once should remember <br />
that we are not voting away our own but the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people’s</span> money, and that this
should not be <br />
done to the extent that is now proposed, <br />
without consulting their wishes in the matter. <br />
This the law requires before a municipal <br />
council can make any special grant of money. <br />
In such cases a vote of the people has to be<br />
taken, which is conclusive as to whether the <br />
proposed expenditure shall be incurred or not; <br />
and yet we are here passing a measure of vast- <br />
ly greater importance to them, a measure in- <br />
volving a revolution in our political affairs—a <br />
measure involving an immense outlay of money <br />
without asking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> the
people are favorable <br />
to it or not. (Hear, hear.) I maintain, honor- <br />
able gentlemen, that before it is ﬁnally passed<br />
upon, the whole question should be submit.- <br />
tcd to the people, and that the law which re- <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">quires a reference to them in minor
matters, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be extended in a matter
which so near- <br />
ly concerns their future condition and pros- <br />
perity. The people of the eastern provinces <br />
have very little to complain of in the plan of <br />
Confederation proposed. The fact is, they <br />
will be largely the gainers by it, if it is <br />
carried out. In Nova Scotia and New Bruns- <br />
wick, the members of the governments of <br />
those provinces, and other public men, see the <br />
great advantage they have gained over Cana- <br />
da, and are not slow to set them before the <br />
people. They are naturally anxious that the <br />
scheme shall be carried as speedily as pos- <br />
sible, and are making every effort in this di- <br />
rection, for under it unprofitable local works <br />
in those provinces are assumed and paid for <br />
by the General Government; such, for in— <br />
stance, as the railways of New Brunswick, <br />
which, before ﬁve years go round, will, I have <br />
no doubt, be run at very considerable cost be- <br />
yond the returns they will yield to the Gene- <br />
ral Government. The Hon. Mr. TILLEY, in <br />
a speech to the electors of St. John, sets forth <br />
the advantages to be gained by New Bruns- <br />
wick by the union, as follows:— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> New Brunswick is allowed to enter the
Confed- <br />
eration with a debt of seven millions, and Nova <br />
Scotia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with a debt of eight millions.
Now, what <br />
was the nature of the arrangement by which we <br />
came in? It was found that the debt of Canada <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> not much larger per head than
that of New <br />
Brunswick. We came in on better terms than <br />
that province. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. TILLEY then proceeds to show how New <br />
Brunswick gained a clear advantage of $610,- <br />
000 a year for all time to come on the Interco- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> lonial Railway alone. So much better are
the <br />
terms to that province under the Intercolonial <br />
scheme than those upon which they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span>
<br />
themselves to join us in building that road, <br />
two years ago, Hon. Mr. TILLEY says :— <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 1637 1108 3149 1884">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Of the cost of that road (the
Intercolonial Rail <br />
way) New Brunswick and Nova Scotia had guar-<br />
anteed the provincial credit for seven twelfths, <br />
and Canada for ﬁve-twelfths. Now, if the Con-<br />
federation would build the road, New Brunswick <br />
and Nova Scotia would be relieved of the inter- <br />
est on the seven<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> millions,
amounting to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$420,000,</span> <br />
as well as upon the interest of the three and a <br />
half-twelfths of the three millions sterling, <br />
amounting to $l90,000, making in all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$610,000</span>
<br />
provided for by the General Government. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> This liberal bribe to bring New Brunswick
<br />
into the union, one would think, was quite <br />
enough to satisfy the little province; but on. <br />
Mr. TILLEY adds:— <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 1633 2255 3107 3027">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Over and above all these advantages, we
get <br />
for ten years a subsidy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$63,000</span>
per anuum. <br />
Our local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditures</span> summed up
amount to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$320,630,</span> and we get from the
General Govern- <br />
ment, without increased taxation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$90,00</span>0,
in <br />
lieu of our import duty and casual territorial <br />
revenue, 80 cents per head on the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
population,<br />
making <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$201,637,</span> and a special
subsidy of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$63,000</span> a year for ten years,
making in all <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$354,637,</span> being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$34,000</span> over and above our <br />
present necessities. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> These (says Hon. Mr. TILLEY) are the
prin— <br />
cipal points looked to. Hon. Mr. TILLEY is <br />
very candid, and acknowledges these advan <br />
tages in the name of “subsidies.” He further <br />
assures his audience in the following words <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:—</span><br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_12" title="bbox 1636 3491 3111 4177">

what guarantee have on that <br />
you will continue to receive these subsidies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-</span> <br />
mised by the General Government? Most un- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questionable</span> security—we are not
at the mercy of <br />
the Canadians. ' ‘ <span class="unclear" title="unidentifiable marks.">?</span> So close is the contest <br />
between parties in the Canadian Legislature, that <br />
even the ﬁve Prince Edward Island <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> votes, could turn victory

admit that I was not far astray the other day <br />
when I said that our public men had acted <br />
with a great deal of recklessness. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appears</span>
