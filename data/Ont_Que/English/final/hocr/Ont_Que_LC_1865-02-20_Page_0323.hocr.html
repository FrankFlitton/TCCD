<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of the year, having their powerful
neighbors, <br />
as we have now, to contend with. The Che- <br />
valier D’IBERVILLE, one of the brave sons of <br />
Montreal, the equal, as it is admitted by the <br />
best navy historians, of the celebrated JEAN <br />
BART, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> having made, in
1695, two glori- <br />
ous expeditions to the Hudson Bay, Newfound- <br />
land, and to some of the other present Mari- <br />
time Provinces, wrote a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mémoire</span>,</span> in 1701, on <br />
the situation of Boston and New York and <br />
other coasts of the then British colonies, <br />
pointing out the necessity of possessing a sea- <br />
port during winter. Well, honorable gentle- <br />
men, this now may be effected without shed- <br />
ding of blood or money, only by securing the <br />
Confederation as agreed at the Convention by <br />
the most distinguished parties <span style="font-style: italic;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">contractantes</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><br />
of these British Provinces, in extending the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> railroad from Rivière du
Loup to the <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Maritime Provinces, so as to connect in
winter <br />
the most remote parts of Western Canada to <br />
the sea. The advantages to be derived from <br />
the annexation of these Maritime Provinces <br />
have been most ably developed at the begin- <br />
ning of this debate by the brilliant speech and <br />
sound logic of the gallant Premier, and also <br />
by other able speeches in support of those <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolutions.</span> I will,
nevertheless, add that the <br />
Province of Canada will also derive the im- <br />
mense advantage of beginning the nucleus of <br />
our future military being, particularly if you <br />
get the great assistance of the Imperial Gov- <br />
ernment that we are entitled to. Let us all <br />
recollect that France commenced her Canadian <br />
being by sending divers companies of troops <br />
by rotation to the present Maritime Provinces, <br />
and also to Louisiana. Those companies were <br />
commanded by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">officers</span> who held
the rank of <br />
<span style="font-style: italic;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">capitaines</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> des </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">détachements</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">de</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="font-style: italic;">la marine</span>,</span>
equal <br />
in rank to a lieutenant-colonel in the army. <br />
Those companies were in the habit of being <br />
trained for navy purposes. I entertain no <br />
doubt that the frequent intercourse with those <br />
Maritime Provinces, coupled with the navy <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ship</span> school that the Imperial
Government, as <br />
I understand, has the intention of establishing <br />
at Quebec, similar to those in England and <br />
France, will promote this object; and especially <br />
if England open the door of her academies of <br />
Woolwich and Sandhurst to our youths, as <br />
France was in the habit of doing when pos- <br />
sessed of these colonies—in admitting, as <br />
<span style="font-style: italic;"> cadets de marine</span>, at Brest
and Rochefort, the <br />
sons of those colonists who, as military and <br />
civilian administrators, had deserved such a <br />
reward—and, by so doing, they formed a good <br />
colonial navy, and it was from it sprang <br />
up those able and brave oﬁcers—the glory of <br />

great number whose memory ought not to be <br />forgotten, not only by the people of this Pro— <br />
vince, but also by the Maritime Provinces, at <br />
the birth and development of a new nation, <br />
and to the defence of which those men have <br />
contributed by their intelligence and courage, <br />
I will name, amongst others, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BONAVENTURE,</span>

&amp;c.; and many <br />
of those distinguished navy oﬂicers became <br />

NIÈRE, was even complimented by Fox in the <br />
English Parliament, for his generous and gal- <br />
lant conduct towards his enemies. Now, hon- <br />
orable gentlemen, besides the establishment of <br />
the colonial navy, we should also promote the <br />
military organization and martial spirit, the <br />
natural accompaniment and the best safe- <br />
guard of freedom, by assuming part of the <br />
military defences of this colony, proportioned <br />
to our population and revenues, of course <br />
with the effective assistance of the Imperial <br />
Government. And I hope that England will <br />
call out, to exercise the highest functions of <br />
statesmanship, such of her subjects in those <br />
colonies as will render themselves ﬁt to ﬁll <br />
such situations in future. Why should she <br />
not even employ them in the diplomatic ser— <br />
vice, or as governors of her other colonies, as <br />
France did formerly, in granting those favors <br />
for eminent services? And in spite of the <br />
intrigues of those near the <span style="font-style: italic;">soleil levant </span>at <span style="font-style: italic;">Ver- </span><br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">
sailles</span>, the daring exploits of those brave col- <br />
onists, in that glorious struggle from 1698 to <br />
1759, forced the French monarch to do them <br />
ample justice, and by so doing the most of <br />
the military commands and governorships <br />
of the French colonies fell into the hands of <br />
Canadian born subjects. 1 have said so much <br />
to show that the policy of England ought to <br />
have been directed to promote, in these colonies, <br />
the appointments in the civil as well as in the <br />
military career to her colonial subjects, as <br />
well as those living in the British Isles.— <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) Referring again to
the Mari- <br />
time Provinces, I will say to my French Can- <br />
adian countrymen that they have too many <br />
glorious pages in the past history of America, <br />
