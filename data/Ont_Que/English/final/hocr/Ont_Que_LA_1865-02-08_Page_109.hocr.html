extravagant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
system than the one we have now. (Loud <br />
cries of hear, hear.) Undoubtedly the mode <br />
in which the local governments shall be con- <br />
structed will very much affect the cost of the<br />
whole scheme; but if we adopt (as I earnestly<br />
hope we will) simple and inexpensive machinery<br />

there will a reduction to the people of Ca- <br />

have great conﬁdence in the economical effect <br />
of placing local expenditures on local should- <br />

direction, of the representatives of the Mari- <br />
time Provinces when they come among us. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—The trouble is that <br />
they will spend our money—not theirs. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. BROWN—The honorable gen- <br />
tleman is entirely wrong, and I am amazed at <br />
his making such a statement. There is no <br />
portion of the community that will pay more <br />
money, per head, to the revenue than the peo- <br />
ple of the Maritime Provinces. If the honor- <br />
able gentleman had turned up the commercial <br />
returns of those Lower Provinces and calcula- <br />
ted the effect of our tariff<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> if
applied to them <br />
—or even a tariff less than ours, for our <br />
tariff must be reduced, he would have known <br />
that they will bear their full proportion of <br />
the national burdens. (Hear, hear.) But, <br />
Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> I am told that the
arrange- <br />
ment as to the debt is unfair—that we have <br />
thrown on the Federal exchequer the whole of <br />
the debts of the Maritime Provinces, but only <br />
a portion of the debt of Canada. There is not <br />
a particle of force in this objection. The <br />
whole debt of Canada is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$67,500,000,</span>
but ﬁve <br />
millions of this is due to our own people, to <br />
meet which there are certain local funds. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> if we had thrown the whole
$67,500,000 <br />
on the Federal treasury, we must also have <br />
handed over to it the local revenues, which, so <br />
far as these ﬁve millions are concerned, would <br />
have been precisely the same thing. But, as <br />
regards the public debt with which the Fede- <br />
ral Government would start, it would not have <br />
been the same thing. By <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restricting</span>
the debt <br />
of Canada to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$62,500,000,</span> we
restricted the <br />
debt of the Maritime Provinces to the same <br />
proportion, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$25</span> per head of
their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popula-</span><br />
tion; but had we thrown our whole debt of <br />
sixty-seven and a half millions on the Confed- <br />
eration, the proportion of debt for the several <br />
Maritime Provinces must have been increased, <br />
and the whole debt very greatly augmented. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear.)</span> But in throwing these ﬁve
millions on <br />
the local governments of Upper and Lower <br />
Canada, do we impose a burden on them they <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">are unable to bear? Quite the contrary—for<br />
with the debt, we give them the corresponding <br />
sources of revenue from which to meet it. The <br />
local governments of Upper and Lower Canada<br />
will severally not only have funds from the sub- <br />
sidy and other sources, to meet all expenditure, <br />
but a large surplus besides. But, Mr. SPEAKER, <br />
I am told that this Federation scheme may be all <br />
very right—it may be just and the very <br />
thing the country needs—but this Government <br />
had no authority from Parliament to negotiate <br />
it. The honorable member for Cornwall (Hon. <br />
JOHN S. MACDONALD) particularly pressed <br />
this objection, and I am sorry he is not in his <br />
seat. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—It is quite true. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CARTIER—No, the reverse is <br />
true. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—I am astonished to <br />
hear such a statement repeated. No one knows <br />
better than the honorable member for Chateau- <br />
guay and the honorable member for Cornwall <br />
that in the Ministerial explanations brought <br />
down to this House, at the time of the forma- <br />
tion of this Government, it was distinctly <br />
declared that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> it
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> <br />
the initial purpose of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maturing</span> a scheme of<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span> union, and that it would
take means, <br />
during the recess, for opening negotiations <br />
with the Maritime Provinces, to bring about <br />
such a union. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—But not to conclude <br />
them. <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—What we have done <br />
is entirely subject to the approval of Parlia- <br />
ment. The honorable member for Cornwall <br />
is the very last man who should have raised <br />
such an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objection,</span> for he
attended a canons of <br />
the liberal members of the Assembly, heard <br />
the whole plans of the Government explained, <br />
precisely as they have been carried out,
and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> was the very person who moved
that I <br />
should go into the Government to give them <br />
effect. (Hear hear.) <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DUNKIN—And</span>
I heard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span> <br />
more said—that nothing should be done which <br />
did not leave the House perfectly free. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—I can assure my <br />
honorable friend that, as far as that goes, he <br />
never was more free in his life than now. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span> We do not pretend to
say that <br />
anything we have done binds this House; any <br />
member may object if he pleases; but I do <br />
say we received the approval of the House for <br />
opening negotiations, and it is a miserable <br />
pretence to say anything to the contrary. <br />
(Hear, hear.) We did no more than has <br />
been done by every Government, under the <br />
