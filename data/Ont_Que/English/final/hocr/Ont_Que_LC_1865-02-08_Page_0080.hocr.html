<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In 1849 and 1852 there were passed acts
of <br />
our Provincial Parliament to give some kind of <br />
guarantee for the construction of this (the Inter- <br />
colonial) Railway. As a member of the Canadian <br />
Legislature, I pledge my best support to help <br />
this enterprise, and as to the Canadian nationality, <br />
distinct from the English or French nationality, <br />
composed of the best qualities of both, to which <br />
allusion has been made, I share in this sentiment, <br />
and I hope to see growing a Canadian Empire in <br />
North America, formed by a Federal Union of all <br />
the colonies connected and linked together by <br />
this Intercolonial Railway, that may hold a posi- <br />
tion able to counterbalance the grasping power <br />
of the United States on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>
continent. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I refer to this able speech to show the
en- <br />
lightened views which that honorable member <br />
held on the subject, in common with many <br />
other distinguished public men. I have now <br />
done with the speech of the honorable member <br />
for Niagara, and will only say further that I hope <br />
the important subject before the House will <br />
be fully and completely discussed, so that the <br />
ﬁne merits of the scheme may be thoroughly <br />
understood. I know it will be discussed <br />
calmly, with mutual forbearance and kindness, <br />
and with the excellent dispositions which hon- <br />
orable gentlemen usually bring to the consi- <br />
deration of the matters submitted for their <br />
judgment. (Hear, hear, and applause.) I <br />
feel satisfied that after such discussion the <br />
House will complete its share of this great <br />
work by assenting to the resolutions submitted <br />
for its approval. (Hear, hear.) <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ALEXANDER said—I am sure <br />
that the members of the Government desire <br />
that this great question should be freely and <br />
fully discussed—I am sure they will be glad <br />
to see any members of this House frankly <br />
state wherein they conceived any of its details <br />
to be defective—I am sure that the suggestions <br />
by the honorable gentlemen who represent the <br />
divisions of Victoria and Wellington will be <br />
duly weighed by the present Administration, <br />
as any other suggestions made in the spirit to <br />
accomplish good. But some members in both <br />
branches of the Legislature appear to be op- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posed</span> to the Confederation scheme
in toto.— <br />
They hold that the constitutional changes pro- <br />
posed are unwise, and are fraught with great <br />
evil. The honorable member or Niagara Di- <br />
vision (Hon. Mr. CURRIE) appears to be of <br />
that number, from the very strong appeal <br />
which he has made to this House against the <br />
whole measure, and I desire to reply to some <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of the arguments which he pressed, no
doubt <br />
with very great force and ability, upon our <br />
attention. He objects to the whole manner in <br />
which the Convention was formed; he has no <br />
faith whatever in the result of their delibera- <br />
tions. He maintains, in the boldest manner, <br />
that the proposed union will be found disad- <br />
vantageous and burdensome to all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span>
<br />
uniting. He produced ﬁgures, prepared be- <br />
forehand, to show that our burdens will be <br />
increased to the extent of at least <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,000,000</span>
<br />
per annum—an increase which will be found <br />
oppressive to the industry of the province of <br />Canada. I cannot understand from what <br />
source he has obtained his figures to arrive at <br />
such a conclusion. There is no difficulty in <br />
our being able to form a reliable idea as to <br />
the future financial position of the proposed <br />
federal and local governments. If we make <br />
an estimate of the whole revenue of those <br />
provinces from their financial returns, taking <br />
the basis of 1863, we find that there will be a <br />
net revenue, available for the purposes of the <br />
General Government, after paying the subsidy <br />
of eighty cents per head to the local govern- <br />
ments, amounting to the sum of $9,643,108, <br />
while we are justified in assuming that the <br />
ordinary expenditure of the General Govern- <br />
ment will not exceed $9,000,000. But, of <br />
course, there are always certain grants which <br />
are not classed under ordinary expenditure, <br />
and we shall have to provide for the Intercol- <br />
onial Railway, and the widening and deepen- <br />
ing of the St. Lawrence canals; and suppose <br />
that we allow the very liberal item of $25,000,- <br />
000 for those great objects, it will be admit- <br />
ted on all sides that we shall be enabled to <br />
obtain this amount under the Imperial Guar- <br />
antee at four per cent., thus throwmg upon the <br />
federal treasury the additional annual burden <br />
or charge of $1,000,000, which we may, with <br />
perfect right, say will be met in the following <br />
manner. It can be clearly shewn that it rests <br />
entirely with ourselves, whether we cannot <br />
meet all the claims of ordinary expenditure <br />
and interest on the federal debt with the <br />
amount, already named, of $9,643,108; while <br />
I am sure that most commercial men will allow <br />
that, with the power which we shall have of <br />
imposing uniform tariff and excise duties <br />
throughout the whole united territory of these <br />
united provinces, we shall raise sufficient ad- <br />
ditional revenue to meet this large item. But <br />
as I have, on a former occasion, said, we must <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inaugurate</span> the dawn of our infant
national ca- <br />
reer with the utmost care and prudence. All <br />
jobbery and lavish expenditure must be care- <br />
fully avoided; and if we do so, I venture to <br />
