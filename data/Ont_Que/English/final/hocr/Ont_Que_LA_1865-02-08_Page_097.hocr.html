<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> measure, I regard it as the crowning
advan- <br />
tage of the whole scheme. (Continued cheer- <br />
ing.) Sir, I make no pretension to having <br />
been in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">past</span> years an advocate
of the imme- <br />
diate union of the British American Colon- <br />
ies. I always felt and always said that no <br />
statesman could doubt that such was the best <br />
and almost the certain future destiny of these <br />
colonies; but I doubted greatly whether the <br />
right time for the movement had yet arrived. <br />
I knew little of the Maritime Provinces or <br />
the feelings of their people ; the negotiations <br />
for a union were likely to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficult</span>
and long <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protracted,</span> and I was unwilling
to accept the <br />
hope of a measure so remote and so
uncertain <br />
in lieu of the practical remedy for practical <br />
evils in Canada which we were earnestly seeking <br />
to obtain, and which our own Legislature had <br />
the power immediately to grant. But of late, <br />
sir, all this has been changed. The circum- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stances</span> are entirely altered. A
revolution <br />
has occurred in Great Britain on the subject <br />
of colonial relations to the parent state—the <br />
Government of the United States has become <br />
a great warlike power—our commercial rela- <br />
tions with the republic are seriously threatened <br />
—and every man in British America has now <br />
placed before him for solution the practical <br />
question, what shall be done in view of the <br />
changed relations on which we are about to <br />
enter? Shall we continue to struggle along <br />
as isolated communities, or shall we unite <br />
cordially together to extend our commerce, to <br />
develope the resources of our country and to <br />
defend our soil? But more than this—many <br />
of us have learned, since we last met here, far <br />
more of the Maritime Provinces than we ever <br />
did before. We have visited the Maritime <br />
Provinces—we have seen the country—we <br />
have met the people and marked their intelli- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gence</span> and their industry and
their frugality— <br />
we have investigated their public affairs and <br />
found them satisfactory—we have discussed <br />
terms of union with their statesmen and found <br />
that no insuperable obstacle to union exists, <br />
and no necessity for long delay. We come <br />
to the consideration of the question to-day in <br />
a totally different position from what we ever <br />
did before—and if the House will grant me <br />
its indulgence, I think I can present un- <br />
answerable arguments to show that this union <br />
of all British America should be heartily and <br />
promptly accepted by all the provinces. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> Mr. SPEAKER, I am m <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of a <br />
union of the British American Colonies, ﬁrst, <br />
because it will raise us from the attitude of a <br />
number of inconsiderable colonies into a great <br />
and powerful people. (Cheers.) The united <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span>
of Canada, Nova Scotia, New <br />
Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince Edward <br />
Island, is at this moment very close on four <br />
millions of souls. Now, there are in Europe <br />
forty-eight Sovereign States, and out of that <br />
number there are only eleven having a greater <br />
population than these colonies united—(hear, <br />
hear)—while three of the eleven are so little <br />
ahead of us, that before the next census is <br />
taken, in 1871, we shall stand equal in popu- <br />
lation to the ninth Sovereign State of Europe. <br />
(Hear.) Then, sir, the public revenues <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<br />
the united provinces for 1864 were $13,260,- <br />
000, and their expenditures summed up to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$12,-</span>
<br />
507,000. And, large as these sums may <br />
appear, it is satisfactory to know that the tax- <br />
ation of British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America—were</span>
there no re- <br />
duction from present burdens, which I am <br />
sure there will be—will be one-third less per <br />
head than the taxation of England or <br />
France. There are only ﬁve or six countries <br />
in Europe in which the taxation is less than <br />
ours will be—and these, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moreover,</span>
are either <br />
petty principalities or states which do not <br />
enjoy a very high degree of civilization. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear.)</span> Then, sir, as regards the
Imports <br />
and Exports of the united provinces, they <br />
summed up in 1863, to the following dimen- <br />
sions:— <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 1837 2990 3021 3272">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> lmports ................ $70,600, 963 <br />
Exports ................ 66,846,604 <br />
Total trade .......... <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$137,447,567</span>
<br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 1700 3286 3174 5268">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, sir, I should like honorable
gentlemen <br />
to notice this fact, that in 1793—long after <br />
the United States had achieved their inde- <br />
pendence and established a settled Govern- <br />
ment—their exports and imports did not <br />
amount to one-third what ours do at this <br />
moment. (Cheers) There are few states in <br />
Europe, and those with a vastly greater popula- <br />
tion than ours, that can boast of anything like <br />
the extent of foreign <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commerce</span>
that now passes <br />
through our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hands.</span> (Hear.) Then,
sir, as <br />
to our agricultural resources, I ﬁnd that <br />
45,638,854 acres have passed from the gov- <br />
ernments of these colonies into private hands, <br />
of which only 13,128,229 are yet tilled, and <br />
32,510,625 acres have still to be brought into <br />
cultivation. The whole of these forty-ﬁve mil- <br />
lions are picked lands—most of them selected <br />
by the early settlers in this country; and if <br />
our annual agricultural products are so great <br />
now, what will they be when the thirty-two <br />
millions yet to pass under the plough have <br />
been brought into cultivation?—and what will <br />
they not be when the vast tracts still held by <br />
Government are peopled with hardy settlers? <br />
