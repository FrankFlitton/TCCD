<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> amount of annual interest from the
federal <br />
chest, and that money is to be applied to the <br />
reduction of the sixty-three thousand extra <br />
grant. (Hear, hear.) And this, moreover, <br />
is not to be forgotten as regards New Bruns- <br />
wick, that she brings into the union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exten-</span>
<br />
sive railways now in profitable operation, the <br />
revenues from which are to go into the federal <br />
chest. (Hear.) A similar arrangement was <br />
found necessary as regards the Island of <br />
Newfoundland—it, too, being a vast country <br />
with a sparse population. It was found ab- <br />
solutely essential that an additional grant <br />
beyond eighty cents per head should be made <br />
to enable her Local Government to be properly <br />
carried on. But, in consideration of this <br />
extra allowance, Newfoundland is to cede to <br />
the Federal Government her Crown lands and <br />
minerals—and assuredly , if the reports of geo- <br />
logists are well founded, this arrangement will <br />
be as advantageous to us as it will be to the <br />
inhabitants of Newfoundland. I am per- <br />
suaded then, Mr. SPEAKER, that the House <br />
will feel with me that we in Canada have very <br />
little to complain of in regard to the subsidies <br />
for local government. But if a doubt yet <br />
remains on the mind of any honorable member, <br />
let him examine the Trade Returns of the <br />
several provinces, and he will see that, from <br />
the large quantity of dutiable goods consumed <br />
in the Maritime Provinces, they have received <br />
no undue advantage under the arrangement. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Let</span> this too ever be kept in mind
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,630,000</span> to be
distributed to the local gov- <br />
ernments from the federal chest is to be in <br />
full and final extinguishment of all claims <br />
hereafter for local purposes; and that if this <br />
from any cause does not suffice, the local <br />
governments must supply all deficiencies from <br />
direct tax on their own localities. (Hear, <br />
hear.) And let honorable members from <br />
Upper Canada who carp at this annual sub- <br />
sidy, remember for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> moment what
we pay <br />
now, and they will cease their grumbling. <br />
Of all the money raised by the General Gov- <br />
ernment for local purposes in Canada, the <br />
tax-payers of Upper Canada now pay more <br />
than three-fourths; but far from getting back <br />
in proportion to what they contribute, or even <br />
in proportion to their population, they do not <br />
get one-half of the money spent for local <br />
purposes. But how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> will
it be under <br />
Federation! Nine hundred thousand people <br />
will come into the union, who will contribute <br />
to the revenue quite as much, man for man, <br />
as the Upper Canadians, and in the distribu- <br />
tion of the local subsidy we will receive our <br />
share on the basis of population. A very <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> different arrangement from that we now
endure. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I confess to you, sir, that one <br />
of the strongest arguments in my mind for <br />
Confederation is the economical ideas of the <br />
people of these Maritime Provinces, and the con- <br />
viction that the inﬂuence of their public men in <br />
our legislative halls will be most salutary in all <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">financial</span>
matters. A more economical people it <br />
would be difficult to ﬁnd; their prime
min- <br />
isters and their chief justices get but £600 <br />
a year, Halifax currency, and the rest of their <br />
civil list is in much the same proportion. <br />
(Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, there is <br />
another great evil in our existing system that <br />
this scheme remedies; it secures to the people <br />
of each province full control over the adminis- <br />
tration of their own internal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs.</span>
We in <br />
Upper Canada have complained that the <br />
minority of our representatives, the party de- <br />
feated at the polls of Upper Canada, have <br />
been, year after year, kept in office by Lower <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> votes, and that all the
local patron- <br />
age of our section has been dispensed by <br />
those who did not possess the confidence <br />
of the people. Well, sir, this scheme remedies <br />
that. The local patronage will be under local <br />
control, and the wishes of the majority in <br />
each section will be carried out in all local <br />
matters. (Hear, hear.) We have complained <br />
that the land system was not according to the <br />
views of our western people; that free lands <br />
for actual settlers was the right policy for us <br />
—that the price of a piece of land squeezed <br />
out of an immigrant was no consideration <br />
in comparison with the settlement among us <br />
of a hardy and industrious family; and that <br />
the colonization road system was far from <br />
satisfactory. Well, sir, this scheme remedies <br />
that. Each province is to have control of its <br />
own crown lands, crown timber and crown <br />
minerals,—and will be free to take such steps <br />
for developing them as each deems best.— <br />
(Hear, hear.) We have complained that local <br />
works of various kinds—roads, bridges and <br />
landing piers, court houses, gaols and other <br />
structures—have been erected in an inequitable <br />
and improvident manner. Well, sir, this <br />
scheme remedies that; all local works are to <br />
be constructed by the localities and defrayed <br />
from local funds. And so on through the whole <br />
extensive details of internal local administra- <br />
tion will this reform extend. The people of <br />
Upper Canada will have the entire control of <br />
their local matters, and will no longer have to <br />
betake themselves to Quebec for leave to open <br />
a road, to select a county town, or appoint a <br />
coroner. But I am told that to this general <br />
principle of placing all local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters</span>
under <br />
