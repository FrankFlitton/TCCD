<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> on several occasions. In the <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span>
<br />
of these provinces are to be found elements <br />
which give promise, nay, contain the germ <br />
of a power which will one day take its place <br />
among the nations of the world. And in <br />
considering this Confederation of the British <br />
North American Provinces, I am reminded <br />
of the fable of the bundle of sticks, which I <br />
learned in my childhood, and which so ex- <br />
actly applies to the present circumstances. <br />
This fable tells us that the sticks when <br />
bound together were strong enough to resist <br />
all the efforts made to break them, but <br />
that when separated they were broken one <br />
by one with but little effort. It seems to <br />
me that the <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">lesson</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">afforded </span>by
this fable <br />
may be well applied to the question of Con- <br />
federation—separated we are weak, united <br />
we shall be strong. Commerce, population, <br />
manufactures, progress, in a word, all the <br />
elements requisite to constitute a powerful <br />
nation are contained in the united colonies ; <br />
but these become of little consequence if <br />
allowed to be utilized by each separate <br />
colony. And not only would the union of <br />
these elements constitute the Confederation <br />
a great power amongst the other nations of <br />
the world, but there would be found amongst <br />
its population a number of sturdy arms, <br />
sufficient, with the aid of Great Britain, to <br />
repel foreign aggression. I do not belong <br />
to that school which pretends that in case <br />
of invasion on the part of the United States, <br />
the best thing we could do would be to re- <br />
main passive with folded arms. That is not <br />
my idea. Such actions may ﬂatter the <br />
opinions and desires of those who have <br />
republican leanings, of annexationists and <br />
of anti-Canadians, who are nothing less than <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">enemies</span>
of the monarchical system in this <br />
country. I have no sympathy with those <br />
who place themselves at the head of the <br />
republican and annexationist school, for I <br />
see in them none of those national aspira- <br />
tions of which every man is always proud. <br />
With these few remarks to shew the neces-<br />
sity of Confederation, and that its ﬁrst result <br />
will be the production of a new and power- <br />
ful people, I propose to consider the terms <br />
and conditions of the scheme, and whether <br />
Lower Canada will ﬁnd in them the protec- <br />
tion its interests demand. The ﬁrst point <br />
to which I directed my attention was to <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">as-</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
certain what guarantees Lower Canada would <br />
ﬁnd in Confederation for its laws, its religion <br />
and its autonomy. I ﬁnd the guarantee of <br />
all these things in that article of the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></span></p>

local affairs </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;">in Lower Canada, under the

<span style="background-color: white;">which have been urged, and prove
that it is </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
