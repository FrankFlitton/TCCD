from <br />
enforcing it? Suppose we had a conservative <br />
majority here, and a reform majority above— <br />
or a conservative majority above an a reform <br />
majority here—all elected under party obliga- <br />
tions,—what is to prevent a dead-lock between <br />
the chambers? It may be called unconstitu- <br />
tional—but what is to prevent the Councillors <br />
(especially if they feel that in the dispute of <br />
the hour they have the country at their <br />
back) from practically exercising all the pow- <br />
ers that belong to us? They might amend <br />
our money bills, they might throw out all our <br />
bills if they liked, and bring to a stop the <br />
whole machinery of government. And what <br />
could we do to prevent them? But, even <br />
supposing this were not the case, and that the <br />
elective Upper House continued to be guided <br />
by that discretion which has heretofore actu- <br />
ated its proceedings,—still, I think, we must <br />
all feel that the election of members for such <br />
enormous districts as form the constituencies <br />
of the Upper House has become a great prac- <br />
tical inconvenience. I say this from personal <br />
experience, having long taken an active inter- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">est</span> in the electoral contests in
Upper Canada. <br />
We have found greater difficulty in inducing <br />
candidates to offer for seats in the Upper <br />
House, than in getting ten times the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">number</span>
<br />
for the Lower House. The constituencies are <br />
so vast, that it is difficult to find gentlemen <br />
who have the will to incur the labor of such <br />
a contest, who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufficiently</span>
known and <br />
popular enough throughout districts so wide, <br />
and who have money enough—(hear)— to <br />
pay the enormous bills, not incurred in any <br />
corrupt way,—do not fancy that I mean that <br />
for a moment—but the bills that are sent in <br />
after the contest is over, and which the candi- <br />
dates are compelled to pay if they ever hope <br />
to present themselves for re-election. (Hear, <br />
hear.) But honorable gentlemen say—“This <br />
is all very well, but you are taking an impor- <br />
tant power out of the hands of the people, <br />
which they now possess." Now this is a <br />
mistake. We do not propose to do anything <br />
of the sort. What we propose is, that the <br />
Upper House shall be appointed from the best <br />
men of the country by those holding the con- <br />
fidence of the representatives of the people in <br />
this Chamber. It is proposed that the Govern- <br />
ment of the day, which only lives by the ap- <br />
proval of this Chamber, shall make the ap- <br />
pointments, and be responsible to the people <br />
for the selections they shall make. (Hear, <br />
hear.) Not a single appointment could be made, with regard to which the
Government<br />
would not be open to censure, and which the<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives</span>
of the people, in this House, <br />
would not have an opportunity of condemning. <br />
For myself, I have maintained the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed</span>
<br />
principle, as in opposition to the elective, ever <br />
since came into public life, and have never <br />
hesitated, when before the people, to state my <br />
opinions in the broadest manner; and yet not <br />
in a single instance have I ever found a con- <br />
stituency in Upper Canada, or a public meet- <br />
ing declaring its disapproval of appointment <br />
by the Crown and its desire for election by the <br />
people at large. When the change was made <br />in 1855 there was not a single petition from <br />
the people asking for it—it was in a manner <br />
forced on the Legislature. The real reason <br />
for the change was, that before Responsible <br />
Government was introduced into this country, <br />
while the old oligarchical system existed, the <br />
Upper House continuously and systemati- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cally</span> was at war with the popular
branch, and <br />
threw out every measure of a liberal ten- <br />
dency. The result was, that in the famous <br />
ninety-two resolutions the introduction of the <br />
elective principle into the Upper House was <br />
declared to be indispensable. So long as Mr. <br />
ROBERT BALDWIN remained in public life, <br />
the thing could not be done; but when he <br />
left, the deed was consummated. But it is <br />
said, that if the members are to be appointed <br />
for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">life,</span> the number should be
unlimited— <br />
that, in the event of a dead lock arising be- <br />
tween that chamber and this, there should be <br />
power to overcome the difficulty by the ap- <br />
pointment of more members. Well, under <br />
the British system, in the case of a legislative <br />
union, that might be a legitimate provision. <br />
But honorable gentlemen must see that the <br />
limitation of the numbers in the Upper House <br />
lies at the base of the whole compact on <br />
which this scheme rests. (Hear, hear.) It <br />
is perfectly clear, as was contended by those <br />
who represented Lower Canada in the Con- <br />
ference, that if the number of the Legis- <br />
lative Councillors was made capable of in- <br />
crease, you would thereby sweep away the <br />
whole protection they had from the Upper <br />
Chamber. But it has been said that, though <br />
you may not give the power to the Executive <br />
to increase the numbers of the Upper House, <br />
in the event of a dead-lock, you might limit <br />
the term for which the members are appointed. <br />
I was myself in favor of that proposition. I <br />
thought it would be well to provide for a <br />
more frequent change in the composition of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper House,</span> and lessen the
danger of the <br />
chamber being largely composed of gentlemen <br />
whose advanced years might forbid the
punc- <br />
tual and vigorous discharge of their public <br />
