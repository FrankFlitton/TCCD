<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I have never heretofore ventured to make
this <br />
assertion, for I know well what a serious task it <br />
is to change, in one day, the commercial rela- <br />
tions of such a country as this. When the traffic <br />
of a country has passed for a lengthened <br />
period through a particular channel, any <br />
serious change of that channel tends, for a time, <br />
to the embarrassment of business men, and <br />
causes serious injury to individuals, if not to <br />
the whole community. Such a change we in <br />
Canada had in 1847. But as it was in 1847, so <br />
it will be in 1866, if the Reciprocity Treaty is <br />
abolished. Our agricultural interest had been <br />
built up on the protective legislation of Great <br />
Britain, and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1847</span> it was
suddenly brought <br />
to an end. We suffered severely, in conse- <br />
quence, for some years; but, by degrees, new <br />
channels for our trade opened up—the Reci- <br />
rocity Treaty was negotiated—and we have <br />
more prosperous since 1847 than we ever <br />
were before. And so, I have not a doubt, will <br />
it be in the event of the Reciprocity Treaty <br />
being abolished. Proﬁtable as that treaty has <br />
unquestionably been to us—and it has been <br />
more proﬁtable to the Americans—still, were <br />
it brought to an end to-morrow, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">though</span>
we <br />
would suffer a while from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change, l</span>
am <br />
convinced the ultimate result would be that <br />
other foreign markets would be opened to us, <br />
quite as proﬁtable, and that we would speedily <br />
build up our trade on a sounder basis than at <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present.</span> A close examination of
the working of <br />
the Reciprocity Treaty discloses facts of Vital <br />
importance to the merits of the question, to <br />
which you never hear the slightest allusion <br />
made by American speakers or writers. Our <br />
neighbours, in speaking of the treaty, keep <br />
constantly telling us of the Canadian trade— <br />
what they take from Canada and what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cana-</span>
<br />
da <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">takes</span> from them. Their whole
story is <br />
about the buying and selling of commodities <br />
in Canada. Not a whisper do you ever hear <br />
from them about their buying and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selling</span>
<br />
with the Maritime Provinces—not a word <br />
about the enormous carrying trade for all the <br />
provinces which the monopolize—not a word <br />
of the large sums <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drawn</span> from us
for our vast <br />
traffic over their railways and canals—and not <br />
a whisper as to their immense proﬁts from <br />
ﬁshing in our waters, secured to them by the <br />
treaty. (Hear, hear.) No, sir, all we hear <br />
of is the exports and imports of Canada—all <br />
is silence as to other parts of the treaty. But <br />
it must not be forgotten that if the treaty is <br />
abolished and this union is accomplished, an <br />
abolition of reciprocity with Canada means <br />
abolition of reciprocity with all the British <br />
American Provinces—means bringing to an <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> end the right of the Americans to ﬁsh in
our <br />
waters; their right to use our canals; their <br />
right to the navigation of the St. Lawrence; <br />
and that it also implies the taking out of their <br />
hands the vast and lucrative carrying trade <br />
they now have from us. (Hear, hear.) It <br />
must be always kept in mind that though the <br />
United States purchase from Canada a large <br />
amount of agricultural products, a great por- <br />
tion of what they purchase does not go into <br />
consumption in the States, but is merely pur- <br />
chased for transmission to Great Britain and <br />
the West India markets. (Hear, hear.) They <br />
merely act as commission agents and carriers <br />
in such transactions, and splendid proﬁts they <br />
make out of the business. But beyond this, <br />
another large portion of these produce pur- <br />
chases, for which they take so much credit to <br />
themselves, they buy in the same manner for <br />
export to the Maritime Provinces of British <br />
America, reaping all the benefit of the sea- <br />
going as well as the inland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freight—charges</span>
<br />
and commissions. (Hear, hear.) The com- <br />
mercial returns of the Lower Provinces show <br />
not only that the Americans send a large <br />
quantity of their own farm products to those <br />
provinces, but a considerable amount of what <br />
they (the Americans) receive from us, thereby <br />
gaining the double advantage of the carrying <br />
trade through the United States to the sea- <br />
board, and then by sea to the Lower Provinces. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I hold in my hand a return <br />
of the articles purchased by the Maritime <br />
Provinces from the United States in 1863, <br />
which Canada could have supplied. I will <br />
not detain the House by reading it, but any <br />
member who desires can have it or examina- <br />
tion. I may state, however, in brief, that in <br />
that year the breadstuffs alone bought by the <br />
Lower Provinces amounted to no less than <br />
$4,447,207—that the import of meats, <br />
fresh and cured, amounted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$659,917</span>—
<br />
and that the total value of products which the <br />
Lower Provinces might have bought more <br />
advantageously from us, summed up to over <br />
seven millions of dollars. (Hear, hear.) The <br />
Americans must, therefore, bear in mind, that <br />
if they abolish the Reciprocity Treaty, they <br />
will not only lose that seven millions which <br />
they now receive for their products, but the <br />
carrying trade which goes with it. But on the <br />
other hand, when we have this union, these <br />
products will, as they naturally should, go <br />
down the St. Lawrence, not only for the ad- <br />
vantage of our farmers—but swelling the <br />
volume of our own shipping interests. (Hear, <br />
hear.) The Americans, hitherto, have had a <br />
large portion of our carrying trade; they have <br />
