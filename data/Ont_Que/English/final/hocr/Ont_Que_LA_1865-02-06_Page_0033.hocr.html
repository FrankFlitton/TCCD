<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> shall have as the
head of the executive pow- <br />
er, the Sovereign of Great Britain. &nbsp; (Hear, <br />
hear.) &nbsp; No one can look into futurity and <br />
say what will be the destiny of this country. <br />
Changes come over nations and peoples in <br />
the course of ages. &nbsp; But, so far as we can <br />
legislate, we provide that, for all time to <br />
come, the Sovereign of Great Britain shall <br />
be the Sovereign of British North America. <br />
By adhering to the monarchical principle, <br />
we avoid one defect inherent in the Con- <br />
stitution of the United States. &nbsp; By the <br />
election of the President by a majority and <br />
for a short period, he never is the sovereign <br />
and chief <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
the nation. He is never looked <br />
up to by the whole people as the head and <br />
front of the nation. &nbsp; He is at best but the <br />
successful leader of a party. &nbsp; This defect is <br />
all the greater on account of the practice of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-election.</span>
&nbsp; During his ﬁrst term of ofﬁce, <br />
he is employed in taking steps to secure his <br />
own re-election, and for his party a continu- <br />
ance of power. &nbsp; We avoid this by adhering <br />
to the monarchical principle—the Sovereign <br />
whom you respect and love. &nbsp; I believe that <br />
it is of the utmost importance to have that <br />
principle recognized, so that we shall have <br />
a Sovereign who is placed above the region <br />
of party—to whom all parties look up—who <br />
is not elevated by the action of one <br />
party nor depressed by the action of an- <br />
other, who is the common head and sover- <br />
eign of all. &nbsp; (Hear, hear and cheers.) <br />
In the Constitution we propose to continue <br />
the system of Responsible Government,which <br />
has existed in this province since 1841; and <br />
which has long obtained in the Mother <br />
Country. &nbsp; This is a feature of our Constitu- <br />
tion as we have it now, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span>
we shall have <br />
it in the Federation, in which, I think, we <br />
avoid one of the great defects in the Consti- <br />
tution of the United States. &nbsp; There the Pre- <br />
sident, during his term of ofﬁce, is in a great <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure</span> a
despot, a one-man power, with the <br />
command of the naval and military forces— <br />
with an immense amount of patronage as <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head</span> of the
Executive, and with the veto <br />
power as a branch of the legislature, perfect- <br />
ly uncontrolled by responsible advisers, his <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cabinet</span> being
departmental ofﬁcers merely, <br />
whom he is not obliged by the Constitution <br />
to consult with, unless he chooses to do so. <br />
With us the Sovereign, or in this country the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Representative</span>
of the Sovereign,can act only <br />
on the advice of his ministers, those ministers <br />
being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span>
to the people through Par- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liament.</span> Prior

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ican Union, as we all
know, the different <br />
states which entered into it were separate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">col-</span> <br />
onies. They had no connection with each <br />
other further than that of having a common <br />
sovereign, just as with us at present. &nbsp; Their <br />
constitutions and their laws were different. <br />
They might and did legislate against each <br />
other, and when they revolted against the <br />
Mother Country they acted as separate sove- <br />
reignties, and carried on the war by a kind <br />
of treaty of alliance against the common ene- <br />
my. &nbsp; Ever since the union was formed the <br />
difﬁculty of what is called “State
Rights” <br />
has existed, and this had much to do in <br />
bringing on the present unhappy war in the <br />
United States. &nbsp; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span>
commenced, in fact, at <br />
the wrong end. &nbsp; They declared by their Con- <br />
stitution that each state was a sovereignty in <br />
itself, and that all the powers incident to a <br />
sovereignty belonged to each state, except <br />
those powers which, by the Constitution, <br />
were conferred upon the General Govern- <br />
ment and Congress. &nbsp; Here we have adopted <br />
a different system. &nbsp; We have strengthened <br />
the General Government. &nbsp; We have given <br />
the General Legislature all the great subjects <br />
of legislation. &nbsp; We have conferred on them, <br />
not only speciﬁcally and in detail, all the <br />
powers which are incident to sovereignty, but <br />
we have expressly declared that all subjects of <br />
general interest not distinctly and exclusively <br />
conferred upon the local governments and <br />
local legislatures, shall be conferred upon the <br />
General Government and Legislature.—We <br />
have thus avoided that great source of weak- <br />
ness which has been the cause of the disrup- <br />
tion of the United States.&nbsp; We have avoided <br />
all conﬂict of jurisdiction and authority, and <br />
if this Constitution is carried out, as it will <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in full</span>
detail in the Imperial Act to be <br />
passed if the colonies adopt the scheme, we <br />
will have in fact, as I said before, all the ad- <br />
vantages of a legislative union under one ad- <br />
ministration, with, at the same time the guar— <br />
antees for local institutions and for local laws, <br />
which are insisted upon by so many in the <br />
provinces now, I hope, to be united. I think <br />
it is well that, in framing our Constitution— <br />
although my honorable friend the member <br />
for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. DORION) sneered <br />
at it the other day, in the discussion on the <br />
Address in reply to the speech from the <br />
Throne—our ﬁrst act should have been to <br />
recognize the sovereignty of Her Majesty. <br />
(Hear, hear.) &nbsp; I believe that, while England <br />
has no desire to lose her colonies, but wishes <br />
to retain them, while I am satisﬁed that the <br />
