<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Order of the Day for resuming the <br />
debate on the Resolution for a Union of the <br />
British North American Colonies, having been <br />
read,— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. GEORGE BROWN rose and said: <br />
Mr. SPEAKER, it is with no ordinary gratifi- <br />
cation I rise to address the House on <br />
this occasion. I cannot help feeling that <br />
the struggle of half a life-time for constitu- <br />
tional reform—the agitations in the country, <br />
and the fierce <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contests</span> in this
chamber—the <br />
strife and the discord and the abuse of many <br />
years,—arc all compensated by the great scheme <br />
of reform which is now in your hands. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span> The Attorney General
for Upper <br />
Canada, as well as the Attorney General for <br />
Lower Canada, in addressing the House last <br />
night, were anxious to have it understood that <br />
this scheme for uniting British America <br />
under one government, is something <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
<br />
from “representation by population,” — is <br />
something <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from “joint
authority," <br />
—but is in fact the very scheme of the <br />
Government of which they were members in <br />
1858. Now, sir, it is all very well that my <br />
honorable friends should receive credit for the <br />
large share they have contributed towards <br />
maturing the measure before the House; <br />
but I could not help reﬂecting while they <br />
spoke, that if this was their very scheme in <br />
1858, they succeeded wonderfully in bottling <br />
it up from all the world except themselves— <br />
(hear, hear)—and I could not help regretting <br />
that we had to wait till 1864 until this <br />
mysterious plant of 1858 was forced to fruition. <br />
(Hear, hear, and laughter.) For myself, sir, I <br />
care not who gets the credit of this scheme, <br />
—I believe it contains the best features of all <br />
the suggestions that have been made in the <br />
last ten years for the settlement of our troubles; <br />
and the whole feeling in my mind now is <br />
one of joy and thankfulness that there were <br />
found men of position and inﬂuence in Canada <br />
who, at a moment of serious crisis, had nerve <br />
and patriotism enough to cast aside political <br />
partisanship, to banish personal considera- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tions, and unite for the
accomplishment of a <br />
measure so fraught with advantage to their <br />
common country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span> It was
a bold <br />
step in the then existing state of public feeling <br />
for many members of the House to vote for <br />
the Constitutional Committee moved for by me <br />
last session—it was a very bold step for many <br />
of the members of that committee to speak <br />
</span></p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 1886 628 3377 1570">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and vote candidly upon it—it was a still <br />
bolder thing for many to place their names to <br />
the report that emanated from that committee, <br />
—but it was an inﬁnitely bolder step for the gen- <br />
tlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who now</span> occupy these
treasury benches<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> <br />
to brave the misconceptions and suspicions that <br />
would certainly attach to the act, and enter <br />
the same Government. And it is not to be <br />
denied that such a Coalition demanded no <br />
ordinary justification. But who does not feel <br />
that every one of us has to-day ample justifi- <br />
cation and reward for all we did in the docu- <br />
ment now under discussion? (Cheers) But <br />
seven short months have passed away since
the <br />
Coalition Government was formed, yet already <br />
are we submitting a scheme well-weighed and <br />
matured, for the erection of a future empire, <br />
—a scheme which has been received at home <br />
and abroad with almost universal approval. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—(Ironieally) hear! <br />
hear!!<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—My hon. friend dis- <br />
sents from that, but is it possible truthfully to <br />
deny it? Has it not been approved and en- <br />
dorsed by the governments of five separate <br />
colonies ?—Has it not received the all but <br />
unanimous approval of the press of Canada?— <br />
Has it not been heartily and unequivocally <br />
endorsed by the electors of Canada ? (Cries of <br />
hear, hear, and no, no.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">My</span>
honorable friend <br />
opposite cries “no, no,” but I say “yes, yes.” <br />
Since the Coalition was formed, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">policy</span> <br />
of Federal union announced, there have been <br />
no fewer than twenty-five parliamentary elect- <br />
ions—fourteen for members of the Upper <br />
House, and eleven for members of the Lower <br />
House. At the fourteen Upper House con- <br />
tests, but three candidates dared to show <br />
themselves before the people in opposition to <br />
the Government scheme; and of these, two <br />
were rejected, and one—only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one—succeeded</span>
<br />
in finding a seat. (Hear, hear.) At the eleven <br />
contests for the Lower House, but one candi- <br />
date on either side of politics ventured to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">op-</span> <br />
pose the scheme, and I hope that even he will <br />
yet cast his vote in favor of Confederation. <br />
(Hear, hear.) Of these twenty-five electoral <br />
contests, fourteen were in Upper Canada, but <br />
not at one of them did a candidate appear in <br />
opposition to our scheme. And let it be ob- <br />
served how large a portion of the country <br />
these twenty-five electoral districts embraced. <br />
It is true that the eleven Lower House elec- <br />
tions only included that number of counties, <br />
but the fourteen Upper House elections em- <br />
braced no fewer than forty counties. (Hear, <br />
hear.) Of the 130 constituencies, therefore, <br />
into which Canada is divided for representa- <br />
