<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> should, if possible, be brought about
without <br />
further loss of time. No one who had watched <br />
the course of public opinion in Great Britain <br />
in reference to the colonies, as expressed during <br />
the last few years, either in Parliament or in <br />
the public press, could doubt that the feeling <br />
had been gaining ground there that the time <br />
had come for us to assume a larger share than <br />
we had hitherto assumed of those respon- <br />
sibilities which attach to every country <br />
aspiring to any sort of national existence or <br />
political standing. He need scarcely any that <br />
he alluded to the question of defence. This <br />
was a question which would have been forced <br />
upon us sooner or later under any circumstan- <br />
ces, because it was neither reasonable nor just <br />
that we should expect that Great Britain <br />
would continue to give us the protection of <br />
her ﬂeets and armies, unless we showed that <br />
we were willing to hear our share of the bur- <br />
den, and were ready to contribute our quota <br />
of men and means towards the defence of our <br />
own hearths and homes should war unhappily <br />
threaten us. Under any circumstances, then, <br />
the consideration of this question must neces- <br />
sarily have occupied a large share of the at- <br />
tention of the Government and the Legislature, <br />
but no one would deny that it had acquired <br />
tenfold importance in view of our present re- <br />
lations with the United States, and that what <br />
might safely have been left to the unaided re- <br />
sources of Canada alone, had peace and harmony <br />
continued to prevail on our borders, would now <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">require all the assistance, all the
material aid <br />
and moral support, which a close and cordial <br />
union with nearly a million of our British <br />
fellow-subjects could alone give to us. Feel- <br />
ing then as he did upon these points, he could <br />
not help asking himself the question, what <br />
would be the result, as regards the well-being <br />
and prosperity of Canada, if this Confedera- <br />
tion scheme should fall through? Should we <br />
not suffer most seriously in all our relations <br />
both at home and abroad? Would not the <br />
effect on our credit in England be most dis- <br />
asterous? Would they not say that our own <br />
folly and want of patriotism had condemned <br />
us to a state of isolation and weakness, when <br />
union with our sister provinces would have <br />
made us strong, powerful and prosperous? <br />
Some honorable gentlemen had such strong <br />
objections to some of the details of the meas- <br />
ure—the alteration in the constitution of this <br />
House, for instance—that rather than bring <br />
themselves to vote for it, they were willing to <br />
run the risk of imperiling the whole scheme. <br />
For his own part, he thought it would ill be- <br />
come an elected member like himself to say <br />

</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> to this House<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span>
although he earnestly believed <br />
that the majority of his own constituents were <br />
in favor of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> Council
appointed <br />
by the Crown. As for the objection which <br />
had been urged that between an Upper House <br />
composed exclusively of life members, and an <br />
elective Lower House, there might be the <br />
danger of a direct collision in the event of <br />
one rejecting an important measure which the <br />
other had passed, he did not think there was <br />
much danger of such a contingency. Indeed <br />
he would remind honorable members that the <br />
only instance of anything like a dead-lock be- <br />
tween the two Houses, which had occurred <br />
within late years, at all events, was since the <br />
introduction of the elective principle, when the <br />
Council in 1859 refused to pass the Supply <br />
Bill on account of certain items contained in <br />
it, providing for the expense of the removal <br />
of the Government to Quebec. The Govern- <br />
ment on that occasion were left in a minority <br />
in this House although they had a majority <br />
in the Assembly, and it was only after an
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad-</span> <br />
journment of some days and upon a recon- <br />
sideration of the question, after bringing up <br />
some life members from Lower Canada, that <br />
the Government carried the vote be a majority <br />
of two or three. Upon the whole, however, <br />
he thought that the life members of the <br />
Council would admit that the elective mem- <br />
bers had so far, at all events, comported <br />
themselves in such a way as to maintain <br />
the character of the House as a conserva- <br />
tive body, free from all violent party feeling, <br />
and exercising a wholesome check against all <br />
ill-considered or hasty legislation. The real <br />
danger, he thought, was that if the House in <br />
process of time were to become a purely elec- <br />
tive body, and party lines became more closely <br />
drawn, the same partisan spirit which too <br />
often swayed the proceedings of the popular <br />
branch of the Legislature, might find its way <br />
into their chamber, larger powers, such as <br />
originating money bills, might be claimed, and <br />
a collision between the two Houses might then <br />
occur at any time. Another objection raised <br />
by some honorable gentlemen, was, that this <br />
measure was being urged upon the Parliament <br />
and people of this country with undue haste, <br />
and from the language of some honorable <br />
gentlemen it was quite clear that they did not <br />
think that our situation was by any means <br />
such a critical one as to call for an immediate <br />
change. For his own part, he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did</span>
not under- <br />
stand how any one could look abroad at what <br />
was passing on our borders and not take into <br />
consideration the fact that our communica- <br />
