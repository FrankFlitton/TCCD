<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, sir, in 1861—the year preceding the <br />
outbreak of the civil war—all the vessels <br />
built in the United States, with their vast <br />
seaboard and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thirty</span> millions of
people, were <br />
in the aggregate but 233,193 tons—only <br />
three thousand tons in excess of the British <br />
American Provinces. (Hear, hear.) And I <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hesitate not to affirm that if the
people of <br />
British America unite cordially together in <br />
utilizing the singular facilities we unitedly <br />
possess for the extension of the shipping and <br />
ship-building interests, many years will not <br />
elapse before we greatly surpass our neighbors <br />
in this lucrative branch of industry. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BOLTON—How much of the <br />
shipping built in that year do we own now? <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. BROWN—How much of what <br />
the Americans built in 1861 do they own <br />
now? Why is my honorable friend so anxious <br />
to decry the industry of his country? If we <br />
have not the ships it is because we sold them, <br />
and the money is in our pockets, and we are <br />
ready to build more. In 1863 we sold ships <br />
built by our mechanics to the large amount <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$9,000,000</span> in gold. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> But if my <br />
honorable friend from Chateauguay will permit <br />
me, I am going on to indoctrinate him upon <br />
the point of the ownership of vessels— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—Ah! my honorable <br />

will he tell us how many tons of shipping are <br />
now owned by British America? <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—I am aware that <br />
most of the vessels my honorable friend speaks <br />
of, and the building of which he cites as a <br />
proof that we will be a great maritime power, <br />
were sold abroad. Building ships is a good <br />
thing, and selling them is a better, but that <br />

cannot eat his cake and have it too. If we <br />
got <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$9,000,000</span> for a portion of
the ships we <br />
built in 1863, it is clear we cannot own them <br />
also. It did not require a man of great wis- <br />
dom to ﬁnd out that. (Laughter.) But I <br />
was going on to show the amount of shipping <br />
that was owned in these provinces. <br />
hold in my hand a statement of the vessels
<br />
owned an registered in British America, <br />
made up to the latest dates, and I ﬁnd <br />
that the provinces unitedly own not fewer <br />
than 8,530 vessels, with an aggregate tonnage <br />
of not less than 932,246 tons. <br />

depreciate? Is it then so deplorable a thing <br />
to own inland vessels? None knows better <br />
than my honorable friend when to buy and <br />
when to sell—and yet, I greatly mistake if <br />
there was not a time when my honorable <br />
friend thought it not so bad a thing to be the <br />
owner of ships and steamers on our inland <br />
seas. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Am I <br />
wrong in believing that my honorable friend <br />
laid the foundation of his well-merited fortune <br />
in the carrying trade of the lakes?—and is it <br />
for him, from momentary partisanship, to <br />
depreciate such an important branch of <br />
national industry? What matters where <br />
the ship ﬂoats, if she is a good and a sound <br />
ship ?—and the inland tonnage includes so <br />
many steamers, that in value it will compare <br />
