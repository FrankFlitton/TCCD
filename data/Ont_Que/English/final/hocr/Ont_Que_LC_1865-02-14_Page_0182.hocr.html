<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Well, honorable gentlemen, if the
honorable <br />
member from Wellington has not received <br />
authority to change the Constitution of this <br />
country, certainly he has not the right to <br />
make the amendment which he proposes, an <br />
amendment which is full of contradiction. <br />
The honorable gentleman says that he has <br />
no objection to vote for Confederation after <br />
having consulted his electors. Well, although <br />
he may not have much faith in the maxim <br />
Vox populi, vox Dei, the honorable member <br />
has declared that the rule of his conduct <br />
has always been, Salus populi suprema lex. <br />
I have no doubt, however, that he would <br />
say, Salus meus suprema lex est, if he were <br />
appointed a life member, and that he would <br />
have no scruple as regards amending the <br />
Constitution. The same argument has been <br />
urged by the honorable member for Lanau- <br />
dière (Hon. Mr. OLIVIER). Well, I think <br />
that that honorable gentleman will not, <br />
without difﬁculty, extricate himself from <br />
the dilemma in which I am about to place <br />
him. He has also stated that he had receiv- <br />
ed no authority from his constituents to <br />
alter the Constitution. If he has not re- <br />
ceived this authority, he ought to vote <br />
against the amendment which is now pro- <br />
posed, the object of which is to alter the <br />
Constitution. If this objection were a serious <br />
one, why do not members who are desirous <br />
of consulting their electors resign their <br />
seats, and <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">seek</span> re-election on this question, <br />
instead of setting the whole country in a <br />
blaze by a dissolution? But no, they fold <br />
their arms and say that a dissolution does <br />
not affect them, the Council would not be <br />
affected by it. They are not, then, serious in <br />
asking for an appeal to the people. The hon. <br />
member for Grandville (Hon. Mr. LETELLIER <br />
DE ST. JUST<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">)</span><span style="background-color: white;">
</span>has also read something to the <br />
same purpose. I call upon him, then, to <br />
resign his seat and to consult his constitu- <br />
ents ; but as he has already tried the experi- <br />
ment lately in two important places in his <br />
division, he knows that the ground trembles <br />
under his feet. I do not think he would <br />
care to make the trial, as the result might <br />
be very far from gratifying. <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SIR N. F. BELLEAU—I will not <br />
go myself, but others will, and I venture to <br />
predict that you will be left at home. I <br />
trust, then, that we shall hear no more about <br />
this want of authority to alter the Constitu- <br />
tion, for it is only a roundabout way of <br />
defeating the scheme of Confederation, out <br />
of pure party feeling. It has also been said <br />
that the electors were taken by surprise, <br />
and that they did not know what was being <br />
done—that they did not know what the plan <br />
of Confederation was until it was discussed <br />
here ; but those who have taken part in pub- <br />
lic affairs since 1858 cannot say this, for the <br />
question has been laid before the country <br />
for discussion several times since that period, <br />
and always by ofﬁcial acts. No one has <br />
forgotten the celebrated speech made by the <br />
Hon. Mr. GALT, in 1858, when he join- <br />
ed the <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">CARTIER-MACDONALD</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>Ministry, in <br />
which he declared himself to be in favor <br />
of a Confederation of the provinces. It has <br />
not been forgotten that Hon. Messrs. GALT, <br />
CARTIER and Ross then made a voyage to <br />
England to lay before the Minister for the <br />
Colonies their views on the subject of Con- <br />
federation. It is true that from that period <br />
up to last year, but little was said about it, <br />
because there had been a change in the <br />
English Government, and it was necessary <br />
to recommence all that had been done ; but <br />
if the question was not talked about in Eng- <br />
land, it was not allowed to sleep here. No one <br />
has forgotten the Speech from the Throne, <br />
delivered in Toronto in 1858, by Sir <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">EDMUND</span>
<br />
HEAD, in which he spoke of the necessity <br />
of enquiring into the matter, and laying it <br />
before the country. Most certainly no better <br />
means of submitting it to the people could <br />
have been adopted. Subsequently the ques- <br />
tion was mooted again and again in the <br />
House of Assembly up to the time when, <br />
governments succeeding each other like <br />
ﬂashes of lighting, it became necessary to <br />
have recourse to a coalition, in order to put <br />
an end to the anarchy which prevailed in <br />
the political affairs of the country. The <br />
coalition in question was based on the prin- <br />
ciple of Confederation. The members of <br />
that Government, by a happy and unusual <br />
concurrence of circumstances, had an oppor- <br />
tunity of meeting at the Charlottetown <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con-</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
ference to discuss the question, and enter <br />
slightly upon the subject of a general Con- <br />
federation. They again met at Quebec, <br />
