<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> friend would drive us.  He would give the
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ministry</span> the power “to deluge
this House <br />
with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party </span>tools.” He then went
on and <br />
proved too much with regard to the trade <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">between</span> the provinces. He said
New Bruns- <br />
wick and Nova Scotia would take our manu- <br />
factures, that already we had large manu- <br />
factures of boots and shoes, and that the <br />
Lower Provinces would take these and other <br />
manufactures from us. And then he told us <br />
that they had coal in Nova Scotia, and that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where there is coal, manufactures will
spring up. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON. MR.</span> RYAN—Coal is not used in
the <br />
manufacture of boots and shoes. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON. MR.</span>
REESOR—But coal makes a <br />
manufacturing country, and there is no reason <br />
why Nova Scotia, as a manufacturing country, <br />
should not manufacture boots and shoes as <br />
cheaply as they can be manufactured at <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Montreal.</span>
I have lately learned from good <br />
authority that the very articles to which my <br />
honorable friend refers (boots and shoes) are <br />
now being largely manufactured in the city of <br />
St. John. Labor is quite as cheap in New <br />
Brunswick as in Canada, and there is no <br />
reason why they could not supply themselves <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> the articles named, and with
many others, <br />
even cheaper than they can be supplied from <br />
Canada. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. RYAN—As regards Mr. MILLS’ <br />
opinions, the extract I read was this :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That</span>
there should be in every polity a centre <br />
of resistance to the predominant power in the <br />
Constitution—and in a democratic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution,</span>
<br />
therefore, a nucleus of resistance to the demo- <br />
cracy—I have already maintained; and I regard <br />
it as a fundamental maxim of government. If <br />
any people who possess a democratic representa- <br />
tion are, from their historical antecedents, more <br />
willing to tolerate such a centre of resistance in <br />
the form of a Second Chamber or House of <br />
Lords, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> in any other shape,
this constitutes a <br />
strong reason for having it in that shape. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He admits that a check can be used, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">properly</span> used, by a House of
Lords or a <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Legislative Council. Then he goes on to
say <br />
that he does not think this the best check, <br />
and prescribes a plan of his own; but his <br />
statement on this point is too long to enter <br />
upon now. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—I wish to ask the <br />
Hon. Commissioner of Crown Lands a ques- <br />
tion with reference to the meaning of the 5th <br />
sub-section of the 29th clause, which com- <br />
mits to the General Parliament “ the raising <br />
of money by all or any other modes or sys-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tems of taxation.” Am I to understand that <br />
the General Government are to have the pow- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> er-of imposing local taxation upon the
lands <br />
of the provinces?<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—The general <br />
national power of taxation is to be in the <br />
General Government. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—The 34th sub-sec- <br />
tion of the same clause commits to the Gen- <br />
eral Government “the establishment of a <br />
general Court of Appeal for the Federated pro- <br />
vinces.” Is that to be in lieu of the Courts <br />
of Appeal we now have? Is it intended to <br />
do away with the present Court of Appeal <br />
and to establish a new one? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—I do not think <br />
my honorable friend has caught the meaning <br />
of what is intended. It does not say the <br />
general Court of Appeal shall be established, <br />
but that the power to establish it shall be in <br />
the General Government. <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />HON. MR. CURRIE—New Courts of Ap- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> peal?<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
HON. MR. CAMPBELL—If a statute of <br />
the Parliament of the United Provinces shall <br />
be passed creating a Court of Appeal, it will <br />
state whether it is in lieu of, or in addition <br />
to, the present Courts of Appeal. I should <br />
suppose it would be in addition. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—I think that point <br />
is one which we ought to understand before <br />
giving a ﬁnal vote; and I do not think the <br />
Hon. Commissioner of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Crown</span>
Lands, with <br />
reference to it, has fulfilled his promise to <br />
give an explicit answer to any question which <br />
might be put, to elicit further information <br />
about the scheme. Then the 43rd clause <br />
gives the Nova Scotia Legislature power to <br />
make laws respecting export duties on coal. <br />
What is the meaning of that ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—I thought I <br />
had explained that the export duty there <br />
was almost synonymous with our royalty. It <br />
is levied in lieu of a royalty at the mine; <br />
and we therefore permit the Nova Scotia <br />
Government to exact it on coal coming to <br />
this country. <br />
</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—The honorable gen- <br />
tleman must see it cannot be a royalty, be- <br />
cause the royalty must apply to all coal con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />sumed in the Province of Nova
Scotia, while <br />
the export duty only applies to coal exported <br />
from that province. The 9th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub-section</span>
<br />
of that clause imposes on the local govern- <br />
ments, “ the establishment, maintenance and <br />
management of penitentiaries, and of public <br />
and reformatory prisons.” There is but one <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">penitentiary</span>
in Canada, which is situated in&nbsp;<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">U</span>pper Canada.&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> Does this clause impose on <br />
