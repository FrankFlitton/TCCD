proposed to <br />
introduce into ours, the probability is the <br />
States would have remained united. (Hear, <br />
hear.) But the hon. member said further <br />
that the scheme has taken the country by sur- <br />
prise. Now, I really beg to ask <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span>
there <br />
is any foundation for such a statement? I <br />
most deliberately say that there is not. It <br />
must be well known to hon. members that the <br />
late Chief Justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SEWELL,</span> who
enjoyed the <br />
friendship of the Duke of KENT, the father of <br />
Her Majesty the Queen, so far back as 1814, <br />
addressed a letter to the noble Duke, recom- <br />
mending an union, for this fact is adverted to <br />
in Lord DURHAM'S report on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span>
of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British North American Provinces.
Some <br />
ten or twelve years before even that, the Hon. <br />
Mr. UNIACKE, of Nova Scotia, had made a <br />
similar suggestion, and from time to time, <br />
since then, the importance and desirability of <br />
the project has been openly advocated by lead- <br />
ing public men in all the colonies. Amongst <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others,</span> I may mention Archdeacon
STRACHAN, <br />
the present venerable and Right Reverend <br />
Bishop of Toronto, whose enlightened opin-<br />
ions upon great public questions, have always <br />
commanded the utmost respect, and who, <br />
writing to Mr. CHARLES BULWER, the able <br />
Secretary of Lord DURHAM, in 1838 ex- <br />
pressed himself as follows:—<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

Provinces, and with various leading individuals <br />
and public bodies in both the Canadas. <br />

the great advantage of an united government, and <br />
I was gratified by ﬁnding the leading minds of the <br />

something like a national existence. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Lord DURHAM, after expressing his 'opinion <br />
in the report as on the whole in favor of the <br />
Legislative Union, and referring to the inﬂu- <br />
ence of the United States as surrounding us <br />
on every side, goes on to say :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If we wish to prevent the extension of
this in- <br />
ﬂuence, it can only be done by raising up for the <br />
North American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonist</span> some
nationality of his <br />
own, by elevating these small and unimportant <br />
communities into a society having some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span>s
<br />
of a national importance, and by thus giving their <br />
inhabitants a country which they will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unwilling</span>
<br />
to see absorbed even into one more powerful. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> An union for common defence against
foreign <br />
enemies is the natural bond of connection that <br />
holds together the great communities of the <br />
world, and between no parts of any kingdom or <br />
state is the necessity for such an union more <br />
obvious than between the whole of these colonies. <br />

remarkable <br />
report on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject</span> of an union
of the <br />
British American Provinces should be read <br />
by every man in the several provinces, the <br />
arguments in its favor are so able and so <br />
unanswerable. (Hear, hear.) I will honestly <br />
say, as many others have said before me, that <br />
if it could have been attained, I would have <br />
preferred a Legislative Union, but it is well <br />
understood that Lower Canada would never <br />

in the Conference, presiding over its delibera- <br />

ascertaining the opinions of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
