<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Government presents this measure to the <br />
House. We do not present it as free from <br />
fault, but we do present it as a measure so <br />
advantageous to the people of Canada, that <br />
all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blemishes,</span> real or
imaginary, averred <br />
against it, sink into utter insignificance in <br />
presence of its merits. (Hear, hear.) We pre- <br />
sent it, not in the precise shape we in Canada <br />
would desire it, but as in the best shape the ﬁve <br />
colonies to be united could agree upon it. We <br />
present it in the form in which the ﬁve gov- <br />
ernments have severally adopted it—in the <br />
form the Imperial Government has endorsed it <br />
—and in the form in which we believe all the <br />
legislatures of the provinces will accept it. <br />
(Hear, hear.) We ask the House to pass it <br />
in the exact form in which we have presented <br />
it, for we know not how alterations may affect <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> safety in other places, and
the process of <br />
alteration once commenced in four different le- <br />
gislatures—who can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tell where</span>
that would end? <br />
Every member of this House is free as air to <br />
criticise it if he so wills, and amend it if he is <br />
able—but we warn him of the danger of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment,</span> and throw on him all
the respon- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sibility</span> of the consequences.
(Hear, hear.) <br />
We feel conﬁdent of carrying this scheme as it <br />
stands—but we cannot tell what we can do if <br />
it be amended. (Hear, hear.) Let not hon-<br />
orable gentlemen approach this measure as a <br />
sharp critic deals with an abstract question, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">striving</span> to point out blemishes
and display <br />
his ingenuity; but let us approach it as men <br />
having but one consideration before us—the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establishment</span> of the future peace
and pros- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> perity of our country. (Hear, hear.) Let
us <br />
look at it in the light of a few months back— <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> the light of the evils and
injustice to which <br />
it applies a remedy—in the light of the years <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> discord and strife we have
spent in seeking <br />
for that remedy—in the light with which the <br />
people of Canada would regard this measure <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> it to be lost, and all the
evils of past <br />
years to be brought back upon us again. <br />
(Hear, hear.) Let honorable gentlemen look <br />
at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> in this view—and
what one of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> will take the responsibility
of casting his <br />
vote against the measure? Sir, the future <br />
destiny of these great provinces may be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affected</span> by the decision we are
about to give <br />
to an extent which at this moment we may be <br />
unable to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimate—but</span> assuredly
the welfare <br />
for many years of four millions of people <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hangs</span> on our decision. (Hear,
hear.) Shall <br />
we then rise equal to the occasion ?—shall we <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approach</span> this discussion without
partisanship, <br />
and free from every rsonal feeling but the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">earnest</span> resolution to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discharge</span> conscientiously <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the duty which an over-ruling Providence
has <br />
placed upon us? Sir, it may be that some <br />
among us will live to see the day when, as the <br />
result of this measure, a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
powerful <br />
people may have grown up in these lands— <br />
when the boundless forests all around us shall <br />
have given way to smiling ﬁelds and thriving <br />
towns— and when one united government, <br />
under the British ﬂag, shall extend from <br />
shore to shore:—but who would desire to <br />
see that day if he could not recall with sat- <br />
isfaction the part he took in this discussion? <br />
Mr. SPEAKER I have done. I leave the sub- <br />
ject to the conscientious judgment of the <br />
House, in the conﬁdent expectation and be- <br />
lief that the decision it will render will be <br />
worthy of the Parliament of Canada. (The <br />
honorable gentleman resumed his seat amid <br />
loud and continued applause.) <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ALLAN said, that if he acqui- <br />
esced, or thought that the House acquiesced, <br />
in the opinion expressed by the honorable gen- <br />
tleman who spoke at the close of the debate <br />
last evening, that under the circumstances in <br />
which the resolutions now before them were <br />
presented for their consideration, it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use-</span> <br />less to discuss their merits or express any <br />
opinion upon them; he would not now ven- <br />
ture to trespass on the time of the House with <br />
any remarks of his on the great scheme which <br />
had been submitted for their approval. But <br />
believing, as he did, that the Government had <br />
not invited them to express their opinion as a <br />
mere matter of form, but they were really <br />
asked in good faith to examine and discuss <br />
the measure, and then to express their ap- <br />
proval or disapproval of it as a whole, he <br />
would venture to occupy their attention for a <br />
few moments, while he stated to the House <br />
the reasons which induced him to give it his <br />
hearty concurrence and support. He would <br />
ﬁrst, however, premise that he could not see <br />
the force of an objection which had also been <br />
made, that as they were precluded from mak- <br />
ing any alteration in the details of the scheme, <br />
they would be betraying their trust and vio- <br />
lating their duty to their constituents if they <br />
