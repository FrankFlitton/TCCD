<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
MB. AIKINS—The hon. Commis- <br />
sioner of Crown Lands cries “ Hear, hear !” <br />
But, after the life members of the <br />
House have afﬁrmed by their votes that <br />
they do not desire that the elective principle <br />
should obtain, I do not think they can ﬁnd <br />
fault with me, an elective member, for affirm- <br />
ing that it should prevail. And it does <br />
appear to me, hon. gentlemen, that this <br />
House, if constituted as foreshadowed by <br />
these resolutions, would be one of the most <br />
independent and irresponsible bodies that <br />
could possibly be created, the Crown possess- <br />
ing no power whatever over it. There is no<br />
power of dissolution; the Crown has no <br />
power to add to the number; and whatever <br />
difficulties might possibly occur under the <br />
elective system, when the opportunity is <br />
afforded to the people of correcting those diffi- <br />
culties, it will be found that these difficulties <br />
will be largely increased under the proposed <br />
system. It has been stated by some hon. mem- <br />
bers that a dead-lock might occur. That was <br />
the impression which prevailed when the elect- <br />
ive principle was introduced ; but few have <br />
thought proper to use such an argument <br />
during the present debate, because it has <br />
not been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proved</span> by the result.
But if it <br />
were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible</span> for a dead-lock to
occur under <br />
the elective system, it is far more probable <br />
under the system proposed in the resolutions. <br />
If a feeling had been manifested by this <br />
Chamber since the elective principle was <br />
introduced—if we had attempted in any one <br />
respect to usurp the exclusive privileges of <br />
the Legislative Assembly—it might then with <br />
truth be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afﬁrmed</span> that the
introduction of <br />
the elective principle in this Chamber was a <br />
dangerous one. But such has not been the <br />
case. I think that the elective principle <br />
has worked well, and that so far as the danger <br />
of a conﬂict is concerned, it is as far removed <br />
under the present system as under the <br />
nominative system. Holding these views, I <br />
have thought it proper to place my amend- <br />
ment before the House, and I trust that the <br />
question will be discussed fairly on its merits. <br />
I beg now to move, seconded by Hon. Mr. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bureau,—</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The ground may be taken by many hon. <br />
gentlemen who are strongly in favor of this <br />
scheme, that there is much more symmetry <br />
in the scheme presented by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolutions,</span>
<br />
and which this motion, if carried, would mar. <br />
But really there is very little harmony in <br />
them. Under them the appointed council- <br />
lors will, in Lower Canada, be required to <br />
reside in certain divisions or to hold their <br />
property there. In Upper Canada the same <br />
property <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qualiﬁcation</span> applies,
but as to <br />
residence there is no restriction ; whilst in <br />
one of the Maritime Provinces (Prince Ed- <br />
ward) qualiﬁcation is based on personal <br />
preperty only. Hence there is in reality <br />
very little symmetry about the scheme. <br />
(Hear hear.) <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. Sir. N. F. BELLEAU raised the <br />
point of order that the amendment had in <br />
substance been already disposed of by the vote <br />
on the amendment of Hon. Mr. SANBORN. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Hon. The SPEAKER—The ques- <br />
tion of order raised by the hon. gentleman is <br />
whether the amendment now proposed is not <br />
substantially the same as the one voted on by <br />
the House and brought forward by the Hon. <br />
Mr. SANBORN, and if it is, whether it is in <br />
order? Before giving my decision, I wish that <br />
the mover of the amendment should himself <br />
explain the difference between his motion <br />
and that already decided by the House, if <br />
he thinks proper to do so. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. AIKINS—I contend that it is <br />
not the same, in effect, as the motion brought <br />
forward by the hon. member for Welling- <br />
ton. It is true that the elective principle is <br />
aﬂirmed in both; but then the motion of <br />
the Hon. Mr. SANBORN went further and <br />
applied the elective principle to the Maritime <br />
Provinces, and was favorable to the retention <br />
of the life members, and it also extended <br />
the life principle to the Maritime Provinces, <br />
and contemplated the addition of ten life <br />
members to this Chamber from these pro- <br />
vinces. My motion simply aﬂirms the elec- <br />
tive principle so far as Canada is concerned, <br />
and between the two I think there is a <br />
material difference. <br />
