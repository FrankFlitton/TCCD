<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> projected by the present Administration
for <br />
the protection of the South Side Railway <br />
are completed, the north side road will not <br />
be required. The hon. member has also <br />
said that he is desirous of giving the inhabi- <br />
tants of the country time to reﬂect on and <br />
study the scheme of Confederation, and that <br />
he does not see why we should wish to urge <br />
on the passing of the measure so strenuously. <br />
I have already observed that a plan was <br />
submitted to the Mother Country some years <br />
ago, but that a change of ministers then had <br />
rendered the scheme abortive. The same <br />
thing may happen again ; and if we consider <br />
the age of the Premier of England, and the <br />
uncertain position in which his Cabinet <br />
would stand if he should die, it will be plain <br />
that we have no time to lose. This is a <br />
very sufﬁcient reason for urging on the <br />
measure in the minds of those who hold that <br />
it is destined to save the country. One more <br />
remark and I have done. The hon. member <br />
(Hon. Mr. OLIVIER) has adjured us not <br />
to wound the susceptible feelings of our <br />
neighbors,—not to give umbrage to their <br />
sensitiveness,—by entering into a Confed- <br />
ration which might give them a pretext <br />
for carrying out the Monroe doctrine. <br />
This is, I think, the most paltry reason <br />
that could be alleged in discussing the <br />
most important question of legislation <br />
which has ever arisen on this conti- <br />
nent, so far as the fate of Canada is con- <br />
cerned. I think that the measure is in <br />
every respect suitable and advantageous to <br />
Canada. Any attempt to obstruct it by <br />
such considerations, is a proof of pusillani- <br />
mity, and I almost feel ashamed to hear the <br />
expression of them from the lips of a French <br />
Canadian. (Cheers.) <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. LETELLIER DE ST. JUST <br />
—Honorable Gentlemen, after the speech <br />
which we have just heard, I hope a few <br />
words will be allowed to me, for I have <br />
been, I must say, perfectly astonished to <br />
hear such statements fall from the lips of <br />
the hon. member who has just resumed his <br />
seat; and if my object was to reply to him, <br />
I might satisfy myself with saying :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">ORLANDO,</span> in his frenzy, I saw, <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Expend all his strength and toil, <br />
From the hold of their mother earth to draw, <br />
Trees that clave not to the soil. <br />
It is most certainly my right, I consider, <br />
when I see an honorable member rise in his <br />
place, and say that we, the councillors elect- <br />
ed by the people, are nobody because our <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> pouches are not so well lined as those <br />
of certain honorable members, to express <br />
my astonishment at the use of such lan- <br />
guage; for we should be permitted to hold <br />
the opinion, that the value of the man is not <br />
to be measured by the amount of money <br />
which he may happen to possess. There is <br />
such a thing as a nobility of education and <br />
of intellect, as well as a moneyed aristocracy, <br />
and for my part, I consider that the former is <br />
quite equal to <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>latter. In all countries <br />
in the world education has produced a feel- <br />
ing of devotion to the country, while riches <br />
alone have often produced but sordid avarice. <br />
The hon. member pretends that if the elec- <br />
tive principle continues to be applied to the <br />
Legislative Council, the result will very soon <br />
be <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">that
</span><span style="background-color: white;">a</span>ll those
adventurers who seek to <br />
live in political life and by political life, will <br />
drive from our midst all men of merit, and <br />
will then control the affairs of the country. <br />
For my part, I by no means stand in dread <br />
of such a result, for I know that there is too <br />
much good sense among the peeplc to make <br />
it possible that they will ever consent to <br />
serve as a stepping-stone to political adven- <br />
turers in pursuit of the advancement of their <br />
own personal prospects and fortune in public <br />
life. I am well aware that some political ad- <br />
venturers do occasionally succeed in imposing <br />
upon the people by means of ﬁne promises <br />
and a hypocritical exterior ; but the political <br />
life of such individuals has never been of <br />
long duration, and the results of the election <br />
of legislative councillors by the people <br />
remain to prove the complete absence of <br />
foundation for the fears expressed by the <br />
honorable member. I think, moreover, that <br />
the results which have hitherto obtained <br />
from the application of the elective principle <br />
to this House, and from the election of the <br />
members who now sit in it, are satisfactory <br />
and do no dishonor to this honorable House. <br />
At any rate I never yet heard such a thing <br />
asserted. The hon. member maintains that <br />
it is not necessary that the Legislative Coun- <br />
cil should be elective, because that body is <br />
intended, or has for its mission, to act as a <br />
counterpoise between the Executive and the <br />
Lower House. But that state of <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
exists at the present day,—and when all <br />
acknowledge it,—when none complain of the <br />
present system—we are told that this privilege <br />
is to be taken away from the people in order <br />
that it may be restored to the Crown ! Now, <br />
I say that such a proceeding is a step in a <br />
backward direction. and a retrogression from <br />
