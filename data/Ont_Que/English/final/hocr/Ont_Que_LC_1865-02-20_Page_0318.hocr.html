<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Wellington embraced all that this
contains, <br />
and a great deal more. So that if in the <br />
motion that was disposed of the other day, <br />
there was embraced what this motion con- <br />
tains, the present motion is out of order, <br />
containing as it does a principle which has <br />
already been pronounced upon by this House. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">THE </span>HON.
THE SPEAKER—There may <br />
be some difficulty in deciding on a matter of <br />
this kind, because the two motions, although <br />
not exactly identical, are very nearly so in one <br />
particular. The argument that the motion <br />
of Hon. Mr. SANBORN contained more than <br />
is embraced in this motion does not apply. <br />
The question is, does this affirm what was <br />
contained in the motion already voted upon ? <br />
That in deciding on this particular matter, <br />
we have decided on other things connected <br />
with it, does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> the
position. Rules <br />
on questions of this kind have been made to <br />
prevent Parliament deciding one day con- <br />
trary to another, and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avoid</span>
also surprises, <br />
by questions being introduced a second time <br />
in the absence of members who may have <br />
previously voted on them. Were this motion <br />
to carry, it would affirm a principle which <br />
was negatived when the motion of the Hon. <br />
Mr. SANBORN was before the House. It is <br />
not necessary that the two motions should be <br />
exactly the same; it is sufficient if they are <br />
substantially alike. I will quote a few words <br />
on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this point</span> from MAY :— <br />
It is a rule in both Houses not to permit any <br />
question or bill to be offered which is substan- <br />
tially the same as one on which their judgment has <br />
already been pronounced during the same session. <br />
This is necessary to avoid different decisions being <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given,</span> and to prevent surprises
by a question <br />
being resolved first in the aﬁirmatlve and next <br />
in the negative. <br />
Should we pass this motion now before the <br />
House, we should be doing what MAY says <br />
the rule of Parliament has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">framed</span>
to <br />
avoid, for it would be afﬁrming a principle <br />
on one day, and in another day the contrary. <br />
I am bound to say that in my opinion the <br />
resolution is substantially contained in the <br />
resolution already decided upon, and that <br />
therefore it is out of order. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. AIKINS—I must confess that <br />
1 would like to have had the opinion of the <br />
House on the motion; but I am quite willing <br />
to abide by the decision of the Speaker. <br />
(Hear, hear.) </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> THE <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span>

cision I have given may be well understood- <br />
to remove all apprehension on the score of a <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> motion once negatived not being supposed
to <br />
be ﬁnally disposed of, I may say that we ﬁnd <br />
this in the rules of the Imperial Parliament: <br />
“ A question once carried or negatived can- <br />
not be brought forward again.” <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. FLINT said—Honorable gen- <br />
tlemen, I deeply regret that the amendment <br />
of my honorable friend could not have been <br />
placed before the House, in order to a more <br />
direct vote being elicited on the principle <br />
therein contained, that of the application of <br />
the elective principle to this House. It is <br />
true that the honorable member for Welling- <br />
ton embodied the same principle in the <br />
resolution which he brought before the <br />
House, and which was negatived. I confess <br />
I hardly expected, when I saw this amend— <br />
ment on the notice paper, that it would be <br />
allowed to be proceeded with. Still I was <br />
in hopes that the House would have borne <br />
with the honorable gentleman, and would <br />
have allowed his motion to be placed on the <br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Journals</span> of the House. Having
been sent <br />
here by a constituency which embraces about <br />
75,000 souls, upon the elective principle, I <br />
feel that I should but ill discharge my duty <br />
to that constituency, without having received <br />
from them their direct and positive instruc- <br />
tions to the contrary, were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I to</span>
stand up on <br />
the ﬂoor of this House and advocate the <br />
taking away from them of the privilege of <br />
the elective franchise which has been con- <br />
ceded to them by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament.</span> If
this prin- <br />
ciple had not been granted, the position <br />
would be altogether changed; but having <br />
once granted to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> the
right of saying <br />
whom they will have to represent them in <br />
this Chamber, they ought also to be asked, <br />
before we are called upon to vote, whether <br />
they desire to give back the privilege into <br />
the hands of the Government. I would not <br />
for a moment think of placing them in so <br />
false a position. I cannot, therefore, look <br />
with favor upon that portion of the resolu- <br />
tions which goes to take away from the people <br />
the right to nominate and select members to <br />
this Honorable House. So much has been <br />
said on this subject that it would be hardly <br />
worth while for me to consume the time of <br />
the House in going over the ground which <br />
so many others have gone over already. I <br />
have not heard, however, in all the speeches <br />
which have been made in advocacy of this <br />
measure, anything to cause me to swerve for <br />
a moment from the views I have always en- <br />
tertained after reading this portion of the <br />
resolutions. I may say that when I was <br />
