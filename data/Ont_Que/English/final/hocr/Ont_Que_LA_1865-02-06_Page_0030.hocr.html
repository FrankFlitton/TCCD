<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pense</span> of an

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I will not enter at
any length into that sub- <br />
ject, because my honorable friends, the Fi- <br />
nance Minister and the President of the <br />
Council, who are inﬁnitely more competent <br />
than myself to deal with matters of this kind— <br />
matters of account—will, I think,be able to <br />
show that the expenses under a Federal Union <br />
will not be greater than those under the exist- <br />
ing system of separate governments and legis- <br />
latures. Here,where we have a joint legislature <br />
for Upper and Lower Canada, which deals not <br />
only with subjects of a general interest com- <br />
mon to all Canada, but with all matters of pri- <br />
vate right and of sectional interest, and with <br />
that class of measures known as “private bills,” <br />
we ﬁnd that one of the greatest sources <br />
of expense to the country is the cost <br />
of legislation. We ﬁnd, from the admix- <br />
ture of subjects of a general, with those <br />
of a private character in legislation, that <br />
they mutually interfere with each other ; <br />
whereas,if the attention of the Legislature <br />
was conﬁned to measures of one kind or the <br />
other alone, the session of Parliament would <br />
not be so protracted and therefore not so <br />
expensive as at present. &nbsp; In the proposed <br />
Constitution all matters of general interest <br />
are to be dealt with by the General Le- <br />
gislature ; while the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures</span>
will <br />
deal with matters of local interest, which <br />
do not affect the Confederation as a whole, <br />
but are of the greatest importance to their <br />
particular sections. By such a division <br />
of labor the sittings of the General Le- <br />
gislature would not be so protracted as <br />
even those of Canada alone. And so with the <br />
local legislatures, their attention being con- <br />
ﬁned to subjects pertaining to their own <br />
sections, their sessions would be shorter and <br />
less expensive. &nbsp; Then, when we consider <br />
the enormous saving that will be effected <br />
in the administration of affairs by one General <br />
Government&nbsp;— when we reﬂect that each <br />
of the ﬁve colonies have a government <br />
of its own with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complete</span>
establishment <br />
of public depart<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ments</span>
and all the machinery <br />
required for the transaction of the busi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ness</span> of the
country—that each have a separ- <br />
ate executive, judicial and militia system—<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> each
province has a separate min- <br />
istry, including a Minister of Militia, with <br />
a complete Adjutant General’s Department— <br />
that each have a Finance Minister with a <br />
full Customs and Excise staff—that each <br />
Colony has as large and complete an adminis- <br />

We,</span> in Canada, <br />
already know something of the advantages <br />
and disadvantages of a Federal Union. <br />
Although we have nominally a Legislative <br />
Union in Canada—although we sit in one <br />
Parliament, supposed constitutionally to re- <br />
present the people without regard to sections <br />
or localities, yet we know, as a matter of fact, <br />
that since the union in 1841, we have had a <br />
Federal Union ; that in matters affecting <br />
Upper Canada solely, members from that <br />
section claimed and generally exercised the <br />
right of exclusive legislation, while mem- <br />
bers from Lower Canada legislated in mat- <br />
ters affecting only their own section. We <br />
have had a Federal Union in fact, though <br />
a Legislative Union in name ; and in the <br />
hot contests of late years, if on any <br />
occasion a measure affecting any one sec- <br />
tion were interfered with by the members <br />
from the other—if, for instance, a mea- <br />
sure locally affecting Upper Canada were <br />
carried or defeated against the wishes <br />
of its majority, by one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
Lower <br />
Canada,—my honorable friend the Pres- <br />
ident of the Council, and his friends <br />
denounced with all their energy and ability <br />
such legislation as an infringement of the <br />
rights of the Upper Province. &nbsp; (Hear, <br />
hear, and cheers). &nbsp; Just in the same way, if <br />
any act concerning Lower Canada were <br />
pressed into law against the wishes of the <br />
majority of her representatives, by those from <br />
Upper Canada, the Lower Canadians would <br />
rise as one man and protest against such a <br />
violation of their peculiar rights. (Hear, <br />
hear.) &nbsp; The relations between England and <br />
Scotland are very similar to that which ob- <br />
tains between the Canadas. &nbsp; The union be- <br />
tween them, in matters of legislation, is of a <br />
federal character, because the Act of Union <br />
between the two countries provides that the <br />
Scottish law cannot be altered, except for the <br />
manifest advantage of the people of Scotland. <br />
This stipulation has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">held</span>
to be so <br />
obligatory on the Legislature of Great Bri- <br />
tain, that no measure affecting the law of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotland</span> is
passed unless it receives the <br />
sanction of a majority of the Scottish mem- <br />
bers in Parliament. No <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matt</span>e<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">r</span> how import- <br />
ant it may be for the interests of the empire <br />
as a whole to alter the laws of Scotland—no <br />
