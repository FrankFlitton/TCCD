<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> assets of the Lower Provinces, and he
asked <br />
very emphatically what they had to bring into <br />
the partnership. He said we had our valuable <br />
canals, but what had they? Well, they have <br />
their own railways, built with provincial money. <br />
New Brunswick has 200 miles, equal in value <br />
to eight millions of dollars; and Nova Scotia <br />
150 miles or thereabouts, equal to about six <br />
millions of dollars—though I am not sure of <br />
the exact extent. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—What do they pay? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BOSS—What do our canals <br />
pay? That, however, is not the question; our <br />
canals are assets and valuable assets too, even <br />
though they do not pay much directly, for they <br />
cheapen transport to an extraordinary extent. <br />
I remember the time when the freight of a <br />
barrel of ﬂour from Toronto to Montreal cost <br />
one dollar, and now it is 10d; and one cwt. of <br />
merchandize brought back also cost one dollar <br />
then, but now only 1s. It is in this way that <br />
great public works are valuable to a country. <br />
As to the earnings of the Lower Province <br />
railways, the net proﬁts—not the gross receipts <br />
—are stated, I believe, at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$140,000</span>
; $70,000 <br />
in New Brunswick, and $70,000 in Nova Sco- <br />
tia, which, at any rate, is something. The <br />
Welland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canal,</span> of which the
honorable gen- <br />
tleman spoke so much, did not pay even the <br />
interest on its cost; and if the canal on the <br />
American side of the Niagara is constructed, <br />
as we learn from the American press it is to <br />
be, the chief source of its revenue will be cut <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off,</span> and so far from being the
best of the canals <br />
in a paying point of view, it will be the worst <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> those connected with the
St. Lawrence <br />
navigation. Let me not be understood, how- <br />
ever, as depreciating the value of the Welland <br />
Canal. None is more ready than I am to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admit</span> that its construction was
wise, and that <br />
it has proved and will continue to prove bene- <br />
ficial in the highest degree. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear.)</span>
The <br />
honorable member, living as he does on the <br />
very banks of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Welland</span> Canal,
very natur- <br />
all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked how the</span> canals are to
be enlarged? <br />
Well, they will be the property of the General <br />
Government, and when the trade requires it, <br />
that Government will, no doubt, appropriate <br />
money for the work. (Hear.) As to local <br />
taxation, all the provinces will put upon the <br />
same footing, and nothing can be fairer. If <br />
Upper Canada, which it is asserted is so <br />
much wealthier than the other portions of <br />
the Confederation, requires<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
eighty cents per head allowed to all the <br />
provinces,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater</span> wealth will cause it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feel the taxation</span> so much the
less. (Hear.) <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> posed constitution of the Legislative
Council, <br />
and insisted not only that it should have re- <br />
mained elective, but that the principle of <br />
representation according to population should <br />
also have prevailed. But who ever heard that <br />
in a Federal Constitution the Upper House <br />
should be arranged on that principle? If <br />
that view be the sound one, the better way <br />
would be to have but one House, for the only <br />
effect of having two Houses, both elected on the <br />
basis of population, would be that one would <br />
constantly be combating the other, and the <br />
wheels of government would unavoidably be <br />
brought to a stand-still. In such a case the <br />
more powerful members of the Confederacy <br />
would be wholly unrestrained, and would com- <br />pletely overwhelm the weaker. This was <br />fully considered on the adoption of a Constitu- <br />
tion for the United States, according to which <br />
it is well known that the smaller states are <br />
represented in the Senate by the same number <br />
of senators as the larger ones—there being two <br />
members for each. The same principle has <br />
been adopted in arranging the terms of this <br />
proposed union, and for the same reason; viz., <br />
to protect the weaker parties to the compact. <br />
(Hear.) The next point referred to by the <br />
honorable member related to the Common <br />
Schools and the fund proposed to be created <br />
by the Act of 1849, but as the honorable <br />
member has been informed, one of its pro- <br />
visions, that relating to this fund. has never <br />
been carried out; with respect to the other, <br />
my honorable friend the Commissioner of <br />
Crown Lands has already explained that <br />
the million of acres have been set apart and <br />
a fund year by year created, while Parlia- <br />
ment has annually set apart about $100,000 <br />
for the support of the schools. Upper Canada <br />
then has suffered no injustice in this. (Hear.) <br />
The honorable member at last concluded his <br />
remarks by drawing a sorry picture of the <br />
condition of Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">According</span>
to him, it <br />
was about bankrupt when a number of self- <br />
appointed delegates met and devised this <br />
scheme for its further embarrassment. So <br />
far from this being the case, it is a matter <br />
of history that the Government was formed <br />
expressly for the purpose of considering and <br />
framing this very scheme, and getting rid of <br />
the dead-locks which have so injuriously affected <br />
the legislation of the country. It appeared <br />
that by the time the honorable member came <br />
to this part of his speech he became so excited <br />
that he hardly knew what he was saying. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I will conclude by reading<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
an <br />
extract from a remarkable speech delivered by <br />
His Honor the Speaker (the Honorable U.J.<br />
