               A second point is with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reffeîence</span> to taxes on

               the property of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incorporated</span> companies. As 
               <br />
               it is now, such taxes go in a manner which

               is not considered satisfactory to the minority 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada. WhatI desire to ascertain 
               <br />
               is whether some equitable provision will be 
               <br />
               made, enabling the taxes on such property 
               <br />
               to be distributed in some way more satisfac- 
               <br />
               tory to the owners-—perhaps ln the same way 
               <br />
               that the Government mone is. Some have 
               <br />
               urged that it should be le t to the directors 
               <br />
               of such companies to indicate the schools to 
               <br />
               which such taxes should be given, while 
               <br />
               others think that each individual shareholder 
               <br />
               should have the power to say how the taxes 
               <br />
               on his property should be applied. I am 
               <br />
               inclined to think the latter metnod would be

               <br />
               an extreme view, and I do not think we 
               <br />
               could expect that. But I do think there 
               <br />
               ought to be some more equitable way of 
               <br />
               a propriating the taxes on such property.
