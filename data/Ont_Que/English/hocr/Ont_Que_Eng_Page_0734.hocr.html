               that if the Honorable President of the Council

               had been in opposition just now, we would

               have heard the course that is now adopted by 
               <br />
               the Government called the grossest tyranny

               we have heard such language on the ﬂoor of

               we should have had it sent throughout the

               a man who voted for it who would not have 
               <br />
               been held up as the greatest foe to the rights 
               <br />
               and liberties of the people that could be 
               <br />
               imagined. (Hear, hear.) And now we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman endeavoring to stiﬂe, not 
               <br />
               exactly the discussion of the question, for we 
               <br />
               cannot be deprived of the right of s eh, but 
               <br />
               to stiﬂe the expression of the opinion of the 
               <br />
               House with reference to the merits of this 
               <br />
               scheme in the only way it could be effective 
               <br />
               and valuable, and in a proper parliamentary 
               <br />
               manner. The motion now made prevents our 
               <br />
               taking the sense of the House as to whether 
               <br />
               _ some modiﬁcation of the scheme might not 
               <br />
               be adopted, or some other plan of union agreed 
               <br />
               upon that would prove more advantageous. 
               <br />
               I have iven notice of an amendment that I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intended</span> proposing in favor of a legislative 
               <br />
               union of the provinces, with provisions that 
               <br />
               the laws, the language, and the religion of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada should not be interfered with; 
               <br />
               that no legislation should take place for that 
               <br />
               section, unless that legislation was originated 
               <br />
               by a member from Lower Canada, and should 
               <br />
               not become law unless carried by a majority 
               <br />
               of the representatives from that section of the 
               <br />
               country. I propose those provisions in order 
               <br />
               that the rights of Lower Canadians might 
               <br />
               be fully protected, and that their institu- 
               <br />
               ' tions should not be in danger of destruc- 
               <br />
               tion, and that they might have no opportunity 
               <br />
               of saying that a change of this kind was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desired</span> for their injury rather than for their

               <br />
               provinces at large. I had intended to take 
               <br />

               The commissioners who were sent out to 
               <br />
               Canada by the Imperial Government to 
               <br />
               ascertain what defences were required, and 
               <br />
               what they would cost, reported that £1,300,-

               <br />

               if the expenses of these local governments 
               <br />
               were saved to the country, they would amOunt 
               <br />
               to a suﬂicient sum to construct all the defences 
               <br />
               that are said to be necessary for the protection 
               <br />
               of the country against attack from any 
               <br />
               quarter. But we are not to have the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity, it seems, of takin the sense of this 
               <br />
               House as to whether that would be better 
               <br />
               than the scheme submitted for our adoption. 
               <br />
               And we are also prevented from ascertaining 
               <br />
               whether the peeple of Canada approve of the 
               <br />
               scheme or not. It would seem that the 
               <br />
               Honorable Attorney General West, for whose 
               <br />
               ability I entertain a very high degree of 
               <br />
               respect, has forgotten the conservative cha- 
               <br />
               racter that he has heretofore so nobly main- 
               <br />
               tained upon the ﬂoor of this House, and in 
               <br />
               forgetting that character, that he has also 
               <br />
               forgotten the rights and liberties of the people. 
               <br />
               I am not surprised that those rights and 
               <br />
               liberties should have been forgotten and 
               <br />
               trampled upon by the Honorable President 
               <br />
               of the Council and the Honorable Provincial 
               <br />
               Secretary. They have been too loud-mouthed 
               <br />
               in their pretended championship of those 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">r'ghts</span> in times past to render them above 
               <br />
               suspicion of forsaking them nov.; but I am 
               <br />
               surprised that the Honorable Attorney General 
               <br />
               West should go with them in stiﬂing the 
               <br />
               voice of the people. (Hear, hear.) And 
               <br />
               I am very sorry to hear it stated that members 
               <br />
               of the Government are to go to England, 
               <br />
               there to appear carrying as it were from 
               <br />
               the people of this country to the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government, opinions favorable to Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. Now in truth they will not do so. 
               <br />
               They cannot do so in point of fact, because 
               <br />
               they have not taken the sense of the peeple, 
               <br />
               and have refused even to allow Parliament to 
               <br />
               say whether or not the scheme shall be referred 
               <br />
               to the people, or whether some other scheme 
               <br />
               would not be more acceptable, and much 
               <br />
               better in every way, than the one now under 
               <br />
               consideration. They ﬁnd that the people of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces are strongly opposed to 
               <br />
               the scheme, and yet they propose to go home 
               <br />
               and ask the Imperial Government to carry out 
               <br />
               the measure, though they well know it cannot
