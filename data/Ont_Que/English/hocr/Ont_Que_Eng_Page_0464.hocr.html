               this great scheme is not one which ought to 
               <br />
               be factiously met. For if ever there was a 
               <br />
               plan submitted to any legislature which 
               <br />
               deserved tobe treated with an avoidance of 
               <br />
               party feeling, it is this. (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               is evident that in the House there are a 
               <br />
               large majority in favor of the plan, and while 
               <br />
               it is their duty to concede to the minority— 
               <br />
               what is the right of the minority—the 
               <br />
               opportunity of stating their objections to it, 
               <br />
               it is, on the other hand, an evidence of the 
               <br />
               strongest kind that the majority, in support- 
               <br />
               ing‘tbis measure, believe they are doing the 
               <br />
               best for their country, and that it is a measure 
               <br />
               which meets the popular sanction and ap- 
               <br />
               proval, when they avow by their own act 
               <br />
               their readiness to return to the people 
               <br />
               for their approval of the steps they have 
               <br />
               thought proper to take. (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               is the duty of those who are in favor 
               <br />
               of the scheme—and I believe there are 
               <br />
               a very large majority who see in it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> of the most substantial kind—I 
               <br />
               am ﬁrmly persuaded that it is a duty they 
               <br />
               owe to those who sent them to th’s House, 
               <br />
               it is a duty they owe to the country, it is a 
               <br />
               duty they owe to the great empire of which 
               <br />
               we form a part, to bring this scheme to a 
               <br />
               speedy consummation. I am glad, sir, in 
               <br />
               taking a retrospect of the three eventful 
               <br />
               years during which I have had a seat in this 
               <br />
               House, to reﬂect that on the ﬁrst occasion 
               <br />
               I had the honor of addressing the House, in 
               <br />
               1861, I declared myself in favor of an analo- 
               <br />
               gous scheme to that we are new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussing;</span> 
               <br />
               that I then expressed myself in favor of a 
               <br />
               general government of the British North 
               <br />
               American Provinces, with separate local 
               <br />

               might be that that measure would be one which
