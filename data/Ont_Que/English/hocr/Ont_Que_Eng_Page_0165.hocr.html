               the measure agreed upon here in the last 
               <br />
               week of October. We are bound to carry itto 
               <br />
               the foot of the Throne, and ask there from 
               <br />
               Her Majesty, according to the ﬁrst resolution 
               <br />
               of the Address, that She will be graciously 
               <br />
               pleased to direct legislation to be had on this 
               <br />
               subject. We go to the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, the common arbiter of us all, in our 
               <br />
               true Federal metropolis—we go there to ask 
               <br />
               for our fundamental Charter. We hope, by 
               <br />
               having that Charter that can only be amended 
               <br />
               by the authority that made it, that we will 
               <br />
               lay the basis of permanency for our future 
               <br />
               government. The two great things that all 
               <br />
               men aim at in any free government, are 
               <br />
               liberty and rmanency. We have had 
               <br />
               liberty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enougE-e—too</span> much perhaps in some 
               <br />
               respects—but at all events, liberty to our 
               <br />
               heart’s content. There is not on the face of 
               <br />
               the earth a freer people than the inhabitants 
               <br />
               of these colonies. But it is necessary there 
               <br />
               should bc respect for the law, a high central 
               <br />
               authority, the virtue of civil obedience, 
               <br />
               obeying the law for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lthe</span> law’s sake; even 
               <br />
               when a man's private conscience may con- 
               <br />
               vince him suﬂiciently that the law in some 
               <br />
               cases may be wrong, he is not to set <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upxhis</span> 
               <br />
               individual will against the will of the country 
               <br />
               expressed through its recognised constitu- 
               <br />
               tional organs. We need in these provinces, 
               <br />
               we can bear, a large infusion of authority. 
               <br />
               I am not at all afraid this Constitution errs 
               <br />
               on the side of too great conservatism. If it 
               <br />
               be found too conservative now, the down- 
               <br />
               ward tendency in political ideas which 
               <br />
               characterizes this democratic age, is a sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient guarantee for amendment. That is the 
               <br />
               principle on which this instrument is strong 
               <br />
               and worthy of the support of every colouist, 
               <br />
               and through which it will secure the warm 
               <br />
               a probation of the Imperial authorities.

               <br />
               pretension because it is new; because classes

               here naturally. We have no aristocracy

               aristocracy, and is the old and true meaning 
               <br />
               of the term. (Hear, hear.) There is a class 
               <br />

               many respects to others with whom they

               to see is—that fair representatives of the

               Canadian and Acadian aristocracy, should be 
               <br />
               sent to the foot of the Throne with that 
               <br />
               scheme, to obtain for it the royal sanction— 
               <br />
               a scheme not suggested by others, or imposed 
               <br />
               upon us, but one the work of ourselves, the 
               <br />
               creation of our own intellect and of our own 
               <br />
               free, unbiassed and untrammelled will. I 
               <br />
               should like to see our best men go there, 
               <br />
               and endeavor to have this measure carried 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> the Imperial Parliament—going

               manner, if not actually by their speech, 
               <br />
               saying—“ During Your Majesty’s reign we 
               <br />
               have had Responsible Government conceded 
               <br />
               to us ; we have administered it for nearly a 
               <br />
               quarter of a century, during which we have 
               <br />
               under it doubled our population and more 
               <br />
               than quadrupled our trade. The small colon-

               ies which your ancestors could scarcely see 
               <br />
               on the map have grown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> great communi- 
               <br />
               ties. A great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">danger</span> has arisen in our near 
               <br />
               neighborhood. Over our homes a cloud 
               <br />
               hangs, dark and heavy. We do not know 
               <br />
               when it may burst. With our own strength 
               <br />
               we are not able to combat against the storm, 
               <br />
               what we can do, we will do cheerfully and 
               <br />
               loyally. But we want time to grow—we 
               <br />
               want more people to ﬁll our country, more 
               <br />
               industrious families of men to deve10pe our 
               <br />
               resources—we want to increase our prosper- 
               <br />
               ity—we want more extended trade and com- 
               <br />
               merce—we want more land tilled—more men 
               <br />
               established through our wastes and wilder- 
               <br />
               nesses. We of the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces want to be joined together, that 
               <br />
               if danger comes, we can support each other 
               <br />
               in the day of trial. We come to Your Ma— 
               <br />
               jesty, who have given us liberty, to give us 
               <br />
               unity, that we may preserve and perpetuate 
               <br />
               our freedom; and whatsoever Charter, in the
