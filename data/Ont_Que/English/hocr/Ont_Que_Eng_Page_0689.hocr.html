               <br />
               that we in Canada especially have peculiar 
               <br />
               reasons for desiring Confederation. If united, 
               <br />
               with the assistance of Great Britain, and 
               <br />
               true to ourselves, not calling on Jupiter 
               <br />
               without putting our shoulders to the wheel, 
               <br />
               we need fear no foe, and if the day should 
               <br />
               come when it shall be necessary for us to 
               <br />
               stand among the nations of the earth, we 
               <br />
               shall do so under far more favorable cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances than should we remain till then 
               <br />
               separate provinces. (Hear, hear.) I forbear 
               <br />
               to criticize the details of the scheme; in 
               <br />
               the nature of things one portion or another 
               <br />
               must be displeasing to each of us ; but I am 
               <br />
               ready to accept the lesser evil for the geater 
               <br />
               good. I know, too, when worked out the 
               <br />
               united Parliament will alter and amend as 
               <br />
               the evils become serious. Holding these 
               <br />
               opinions, it is needless for me to say that I 
               <br />
               shall vote for the Address and the resolutions 
               <br />
               unchanged. On Friday night I heard an 
               <br />
               hon. member (Col. HAULTAIN) declare that 
               <br />
               the Protestant minority of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               entertained apprehensions with regard to 
               <br />
               their religious liberty, and that hon. 
               <br />
               member expressed grave doubts as to the 
               <br />
               toleration of Catholics in matters of religion. 
               <br />
               While I give the hon. gentleman full credit 
               <br />
               for his sincerity and the temperate manner 
               <br />
               in which he expressed himself, I think it 
               <br />
               would have been far better had that portion 
               <br />
               of his speech been omitted. It would cer- 
               <br />
               tainly have had much greater weight with 
               <br />
               the country without that portion than with 
               <br />
               it. I do not believe the Protestants of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada fear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persecution,</span> and there are those 
               <br />
               in this House, their natural representatives, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yielding</span> to none here in talent and know- 
               <br />
               edge, well able to speak for them. But, 
               <br />
               sir, had the hon. gentleman read history 
               <br />
               as carefully as he seems to have studied 
               <br />
               polemies and theology, he would not have 
               <br />
               fallen into the error into which he has. 
               <br />
               He would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have"</span> found that all sects of 
               <br />
               Christians have had reason to blush for the 
               <br />
               persecutions of their fellow-men, and that 
               <br />
               the best course we can pursue is to allow 
               <br />
               the veil to fall over the errors of the past.

               Catholic Parliament, the Diet of Hungary,

               in which he stated his propositions to the 
               <br />
               House was all that could be expected or 
               <br />
               desired from an hon. gentleman of his 
               <br />
               position, and I should be very sorry to 
               <br />
               say anything that would be considered offen- 
               <br />

               went to church. In reply I would say 
               <br />
               that I only go when I can be sure the 
               <br />
               preacher is a properly admitted clergy- 
               <br />
               man. Had the hon. gentleman travelled in 
               <br />

               <br />

               brother, on the ground that he may have a 
               <br />
               family to support. In Lower Canada a 
               <br />
