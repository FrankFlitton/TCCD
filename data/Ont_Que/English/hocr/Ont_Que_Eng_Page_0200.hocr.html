               on several occasions. In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> 
               <br />
               of these provinces are to be found elements 
               <br />
               which give promise, nay, contain the germ 
               <br />
               of a power which will one day take its place 
               <br />
               among the nations of the world. And in 
               <br />
               considering this Confederation of the British 
               <br />
               North American Provinces, I am reminded 
               <br />
               of the fable of the bundle of sticks, which I 
               <br />
               learned in my childhood, and which so ex- 
               <br />
               actly applies to the resent circumstances. 
               <br />
               This fable tells us that the sticks when 
               <br />
               bound together were strong enough to resist 
               <br />
               all the efforts made to break them, but 
               <br />
               that when separated they were broken one 
               <br />
               by one with but little eﬁ'ort. It seems to 
               <br />
               me that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lesson</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘orded</span> by this fable 
               <br />
               may be well applied to the question of Con- 
               <br />
               federation—separated we are weak, united 
               <br />
               we shall be strong. Commerce, population, 
               <br />
               manufactures, progress, in a word, all the 
               <br />
               elements requisite to constitute a powerful 
               <br />
               nation are contained in the united colonies ; 
               <br />
               but these become of little consequence if 
               <br />
               allowed to be utilized by each separate 
               <br />
               colony. And not only would the union of 
               <br />
               these elements constitute the Confederation 
               <br />
               a great power amongst the other nations of 
               <br />
               the world, but there wo be found amongst 
               <br />
               its population a number of sturdy arms, 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient, with the aid of Great Britain, to 
               <br />
               repel foreign aggression. I do not belong 
               <br />
               to that school which pretends that in case 
               <br />
               of invasion on the part of the United States, 
               <br />
               the best thing we could do would be to re- 
               <br />
               main passive with folded arms. That is not 
               <br />
               my idea. Such actions may ﬂatter the 
               <br />
               opinions and desires of those who have 
               <br />
               republican leanings, of annexationists and 
               <br />
               of anti-Canadians, who are nothing less than 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enemies</span> of the monarchical system in this 
               <br />
               country. I have no sympathy with those 
               <br />
               who place themselves at the head of the 
               <br />
               republican and annexationist school, for I 
               <br />
               see in them none of those national aspira- 
               <br />
               tions of which every man is always proud. 
               <br />
               With these few remarks to shew the neces— 
               <br />
               sity of Confederation, and that its ﬁrst result 
               <br />
               will be the production of a new and power- 
               <br />
               ful people, I prepose to consider the terms 
               <br />
               and conditions of the scheme, and whether 
               <br />
               Lower Canada will ﬁnd in them the protec- 
               <br />
               tion its interests demand. The ﬁrst point 
               <br />
               to which I directed my attention was to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as.</span> 
               <br />
               certain what guarantees Lower Canada would 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in Confederation for its laws, its religion 
               <br />
               and its autonomy. I ﬁnd the guarantee of

               make some few sacriﬁces to see an end put

               to those struggles which have been con- 
               <br />
               stantly recurring during the last few years, to 
               <br />
               the imminent peril of Lower Canada and of 
               <br />

               parent were the friends who have sustained

               the combat to grow weary, or to give way 
               <br />
               and leave theﬁeld to their adversaries? If we 
               <br />
               persist in striving to obtain too much, if we 
               <br />
               are unwillin to make any sacriﬁce, we may 
               <br />
               lose the who result of these struggles and 
               <br />
               the advantages now offered for our accep-

               tance. For my part the consideration that 
               <br />
               we shall have the control of our local aﬁairs 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada, under the Confederation, 
               <br />
               is a suﬂicient inducement to vote in favor 
               <br />
               of the scheme now submitted to us, even 
               <br />
               although it oﬁ'ered us no other advantage. 
               <br />
               But, without entering into the details, I 
               <br />
               now propose to reply to certain objections 
               <br />
               which have been urged, and prove that it is 
               <br />
               for our interest to adopt this plan. One of 
               <br />
               the very ﬁrst objections raised has been 
               <br />
               offered by the honorable member for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wellington</span> Divison (Hon. Mr. SANBOBN). 
               <br />
               He has stated that he could not vote for 
               <br />
               Conlederation because he had not received 
               <br />
               the sanction of his constituents to change 
               <br />
               the Constitution of his country. Whilst, 
               <br />
               however, he makes this statement, the same 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman proposes, nevertheless, 
               <br />
               to change the Constitution which he declares 
               <br />
               his electors have not given him authority 
               <br />
               to change in any particular. This is the
