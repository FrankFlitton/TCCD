               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Duty,</span> says this singular apostle, comes from 
               <br />
               men. and attraction comes from God. Now, 
               <br />
               attraction is the free tendency of our passions. 
               <br />
               Every attraction is a thing natural, legitimate, 
               <br />
               and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wuich</span> it is impious to resist. To yield to 
               <br />
               one’s attractions is true wisdom, for the passions 
               <br />
               are like a lixed compass which God has placed 
               <br />
               within us. 
               <br />
