               sideration, and it was for them to discuss its 
               <br />
               merits. We, on this side of the House—

               the members of the Government and their

               Federation was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirable</span> and necessary; and 
               <br />

               <br />
               men on the other side who necessarily, from

               position, stating what in their opinion would 
               <br />
               be suﬁcient in order <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to'maintain</span> ourselves as 
               <br />
               a British colony on this side of the Atlantic, 
               <br />
               and to increase in wealth and power. He was 
               <br />
               aware that some members of the House, and a 
               <br />
               number of people in Upper Canada, in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada and in the Lower Provinces, were of 
               <br />
               opinion that a Legislative Union 0 ht to 
               <br />
               have taken place instead of a Federal nion. 
               <br />
               He would say, however, at the outset, that it 
               <br />
               was impossible to have one Government to 
               <br />
               deal with all the private and local interests 
               <br />
               of the several sections of the several provinces 
               <br />
               forming the combined whole. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The next <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> to be considered, therefore, 
               <br />
               by those who had set to work to discover a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soluu‘on</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂiculties</span> under which we had 
               <br />
               labored, was—what was the best and most 
               <br />
               practicable mode of bringing the provinces 
               <br />
               together, so that particular rights and interests 
               <br />
               should be properly guarded and rotected? 
               <br />
               No other scheme presented itse but the 
               <br />
               Federation system, and that was the project 
               <br />
               which now recommended itself to the Par- 
               <br />
               liament of Canada. Some parties—through 
               <br />
               the press and by other modes— retended that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> it was impossible to carry out ‘ederation, on 
               <br />
               account of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> of races and religions. 
               <br />
               Those who took this view of the question 
               <br />
               were in error. It was just the reverse. It 
               <br />
               was precisely on account of the variety of 
               <br />
               races, local interests, &amp;c., that the Federation 
               <br />
               system ought to be resorted to, and would be 
               <br />
               found to work well. (Hear, hear.) We 
               <br />
               were in the habit of seeing in some public 
               <br />
               journals, and hearing from some public men, 
               <br />

               he (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) desired on this point to

               <br />
               British supremacy in trying times. We were 
               <br />
               all conversant with the histo of the circum-

               tion of any British colony in North America at 
               <br />
               that time. The accession of Lower Canada was 
               <br />
               of course an object of envy to the other Amer- 
               <br />
               ican colonies, and strenuous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts</span> were made 
               <br />
               by those who had resolved to overthrow British 
               <br />
               power on this continent to induce Canada 
               <br />
               to ally herself to their cause. As early as 
               <br />
               17 7 5, the French Canadians were solemnly 
               <br />
               addressed in a proclamation by General Wasn- 
               <br />
               INGTON, who called upon them to abandon the 
               <br />
               ﬂag of their new masters, inasmuch as th 
               <br />
               could not expect anything from those who ' - 
               <br />
               fered from them in language, in religion, in 
               <br />
               race, and in sympathies. But what was the 
               <br />
               conduct of the French Canadian people under 
               <br />
               these circumstances—what was the attitude of 
               <br />
               the clergy and the seigniors? It was right in 
               <br />
               treating this chapter of our history, to render 
               <br />
               justice to whom justice was due, and it was 
               <br />
               truth to sa that the seigniors, formin , as they 
               <br />
               did, the e ucated class of our pu ation at 
               <br />
               that early epoch, had fully un erstood that 
               <br />
               the object and aim of those who appealed to 
               <br />
               them was the downfall of the monarchical sys- 
               <br />
               tem in America. (Hear, hear.) A few years 
               <br />
               only had elapsed at that time since the trans- 
               <br />
               fer of the country and its population from the 
               <br />
               Crown of France to the Crown of Great Bri- 
               <br />
               tain; but even within that brief interval of 
               <br />
               time, they were enabled to appreciate the ad- 
               <br />
               vantages of their new position, notwrthstandl 
               <br />
               the fact that they were still struggling an 
               <br />
               complaining. The people, as well as the clergy 
               <br />
               and aristocracy, had understood that it was 
               <br />
               better for them to remain under the English 
               <br />
               and Protestant Crown of England, rather than 
               <br />
               to become republicans. (Hear, hear.) They 
               <br />
               were proof against the insidious oﬂ'ers of 
               <br />
