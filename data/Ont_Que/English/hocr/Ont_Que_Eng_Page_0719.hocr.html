               mented, like JEREMIAH, over the thought

               of the disasters which were overwhelming it. 
               <br />
               And at last, in 1858, enlightened by the in- 
               <br />
               telligence of his luminous friend the member 
               <br />
               for Chateauguay, he thought he had dis- 
               <br />
               covered in direct taxation the remedy for the 
               <br />
               evils which were bringing it to its grave. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> he rejects a 
               <br />
               scheme which may save the country without 
               <br />
               its being necessary to have recourse to this 
               <br />
               extreme and objectionable remedy. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) If the scheme becomes law, not 
               <br />
               only shall we have a suﬂicient revenue 
               <br />
               to meet our local expenditure, but we 
               <br />
               shall also have a surplus with which, 
               <br />
               if we practise wise economy, to pay off 
               <br />
               by degrees the residue of the debt which 
               <br />
               will remain to us. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Hoehelaga tells us that Lower Canada will 
               <br />
               be burthened with a local debt of more than 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,500,000;</span> but we have clear and palpable 
               <br />
               proof that the debt of Canada, deducting the 
               <br />
               part of the Sinking Fund which has been 
               <br />
               paid, amounts to only $67,500,000. Now 
               <br />
               our share of the Federal debt is established 
               <br />
               at $62,500,000. There will consequently 
               <br />
               remain less than $5,000,000 to be divided 
               <br />
               between the two Canadas, and all the argu- 
               <br />
               ments of the hon. member will not change 
               <br />
               so incontestable a fact as this. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We do not get these ﬁgures from the Hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance. They are given to us 
               <br />
               by a man who is perfectly independent of all 
               <br />
               Ministers and of all parties—a man whom I 
               <br />
               mysell formerly reproached with being too 
               <br />
               much so; I allude to Mr. LANG'I‘ON, the 
               <br />
               Auditor of Accounts. (Hear, hear.) We 
               <br />
               do not yet know, it is true, how this debt of 
               <br />
               four millions and some hundred thousand 
               <br />
               dollars will be divided between the two 
               <br />
               Canadas, but we do know, without any possi— 
               <br />
               bility ofdoubt, that the local revenues will 
               <br />
               belong to the local governments, and 
               <br />
               that they will amply suﬁice for all their 
               <br />
               requirements. (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga complains that Upper 
               <br />
               Canada retains her public lands and what is 
               <br />
               owing to Government on those lands, and he 
               <br />
               maintains that Lower Canada ought to have 
               <br />
               her share of what those lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produce.</span> But 
               <br />
               did those lands beleng to us before the 
               <br />
               union, and have we not our own public 
               <br />
               lands, together with the revenue accruing 
               <br />
               from them? Have we not more lands to 
               <br />
               settle than Upper Canada? Since the 
               <br />
               discovery of our gold and copper mines the 
               <br />

               lands has increased ﬁvefold, whilst Upper 
               <br />
               Canada has hardly any land left to sell. Let 
               <br />
               our mines be opened, and we shall ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               we have no reason to envy Upper Canada. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Everything is well adjusted; 
               <br />
               for if we have a less considerable revenue 
               <br />
               than Upper Canada, our population is alsoless 
               <br />
               numerous. Upper Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possesses</span> a more 
               <br />
               considerable revenue, but one which must 
               <br />
               diminish with the decrease of the quantity of 
               <br />
               land to be sold, whilst we have a revenue 
               <br />
               which is gradually increasing. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The hon. member would no doubt handover 
               <br />
               the public lands to the Confederation so as 
               <br />
               to be in accordance with his plan of 1859, 
               <br />
               as set forth in the Montreal manifesto; but 
               <br />
               I am certain that Lower Canada does not 
               <br />
               share his opinion. He talked to us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abo</span> of 
               <br />
               marriage and divorce. He said: “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span>

               <br />
               member for Hochelaga would accept it 
               <br />
               sooner than-l would. But if no mention 
               <br />
               was made of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">divorce</span> in the Constitution, 
               <br />
               if it was not assigned to the Federal Parlia-

               ment, it would of necessity belong to the 
               <br />
               local parliaments as it belongs to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legis—</span> 
               <br />
               lature now, although there is not one word 
               <br />
               respecting it in the Union Act. For my 
               <br />
               part, I would rather see that power removed 
               <br />
               to a distance from us, since it must exist 
               <br />
               somewhere in spite of ns. (Hear, hear.)

               These reasonings on the question of marriage 
               <br />
               are extraordinary to a degree, coming from 
               <br />
               a man holding a position at the bar. They 
               <br />
               are so extraordinary, and so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inconsiﬁent</span> 
               <br />
               with all logic and all law, that I shall not 
               <br />
               take the trouble of controverting them. The 
               <br />
               explanations of the Government have satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed me on that point. The legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> 
               <br />
               of the Federal Parliament in relation to 
               <br />
               marriage will only be that which is conferred 
               <br />
               by the Constitution, notwithstanding the
