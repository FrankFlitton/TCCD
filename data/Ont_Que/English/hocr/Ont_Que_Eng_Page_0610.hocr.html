               annual increase in that section is the result 
               <br />
               of emigration. From 90,000, which was the 
               <br />
               total amount during the single year 1847, 
               <br />
               immigration gradually fell to 10,000 in the 
               <br />
               year 1860. But there is another important 
               <br />
               fact which it would be well to bear in mind; 
               <br />
               it is that Lower Canada, which increased 
               <br />
               slowly at ﬁrst, because her material and moral 
               <br />
               development was impeded by the political 
               <br />
               inatitutions under which she was governed, 
               <br />
               and because she had no colonization roads 
               <br />
               through her forests, still beheld her sturdy 
               <br />
               children emigrating from their native soil 
               <br />
               to the United States in search of daily bread 
               <br />
               and liberty. The increase in the population 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada was slow and small then ; 
               <br />
               but as railways were built and highways 
               <br />
               were opened, the population was found to 
               <br />
               increase in nearly the same proportion as 
               <br />
               the diminution was observed to be going on, 
               <br />
               in respect of annual increase, in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. I maintain further, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               that the census of 1861 is no basis from 
               <br />
               which to estimate exactly the total popula- 
               <br />
               tion of the two sections; that census is 
               <br />
               merely a tissue of errors of a serious nature, 
               <br />
               which demonstrate the inaccuracy of the 
               <br />
               whole. Thus when we ﬁnd it stated that at 
               <br />
               Three Rivers there is not a single Catholic 
               <br />
               church; that at Hamilton there is but one ; 
               <br />
               that in the year 1861 there were but three 
               <br />
               vessels built in Lower Canada, while we know 
               <br />
               that at Quebec alone more than sixty were 
               <br />
               constructed, we may with perfect safety assert 
               <br />
               that similar inaccuracies must needs have 
               <br />
               occurred in the totals of the populations of 
               <br />
               the two sections. We know that in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada the true total of the population has 
               <br />
               been greatly exaggerated. Did not all their 
               <br />
               journals declare that the census of 1861 
               <br />
               must indicate a very large total population 
               <br />
               in favor of Upper Canada over Lower 
               <br />
               Canada? And, accordingly, the result shewed 
               <br />
               a majority of nearly 300,000 souls in 
               <br />
               favor of that province. To such an extent 
               <br />
               was the number of the living increased, and 
               <br />
               the number of the dead diminished, that the 
               <br />
               totalnumber ofliving children under one year 
               <br />
               old was 8,000 more than the total number 
               <br />
               of births in the year. (Hear, hear.) I am 
               <br />
               quite willing to admit that the climate of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada is most salubrious and high] 
               <br />
               favorable to the development of that part of

               understanding how it is that in twelve

               When I observe such results accruing from 
               <br />
               our ofﬁcial census, I am compelled to believe 
               <br />
               that it is inaccurate, and that it may be 
               <br />
               quite as erroneous in respect of the general 
               <br />
               population. But if in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> census the 
               <br />
               population of Upper Canada was exagger- 
               <br />
               ated, in the case of Lower Canada, on the 
               <br />
               contrary, it has been considerably diminished. 
               <br />
               Here our farmers have always stood in dread 
               <br />
               of the census, because they have a suspicion 
               <br />
               that it is taken with the sole object of im- 
               <br />
               posing some tax, or of making some draft of 
               <br />
               men for the defence of the country. Under 
               <br />
               these circumstances, I consider that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between the totals of the popula-

               well proved as it is wished to have us believe 
               <br />
               that it is. I maintain that it is less in reality 
               <br />
               than it is in appearance, and that the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               of the census are not suﬂiciently accurate to 
               <br />
               allow of our taking them as the basis of a 
               <br />
               demand for constitutional changes of so im— 
               <br />
               portanta character. But if we study the 
               <br />
               increase of the French-Canadian population 
               <br />
               in America, we shall ﬁnd the increaée of the 
               <br />
               French-Canadians to have been 1,700,000 
               <br />
               between the years 1760 and 1860, the total 
               <br />
               having increased tenfold two and a half times 
               <br />
               in that period, and this is equivalent to 3.40 
               <br />
               per cent. per annum, or a donbling of the 
               <br />
               population in twenty-one years; otherwise 
               <br />
               an increase of twenty-ﬁve times their num- 
               <br />

               ‘1860, having been 3.60 per cent. in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, these ﬁgures shew that the natural 
               <br />
               increase in the Lower Canadian population 
               <br />
               is greater than it is anywhere else. In 
               <br />
               Upper Canada the average of births has 
               <br />
               been 3.40 per cent. per annum, and in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada it has been 4.10 per cent. 
               <br />
               per annum; this is equivalent to a greater 
               <br />
               relative increase of 20 per cent. in favor 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada over Upper Canada.
