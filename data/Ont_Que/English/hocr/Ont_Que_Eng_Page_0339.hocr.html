               with reference to the elective principle, I 
               <br />
               desire now to speak about one or two other 
               <br />
               things in connection with these resolutions. 
               <br />
               And one thing in particular, I ﬁnd, has not 
               <br />
               been spoken of by any member on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House. I refer now to the sixth 
               <br />
               clause, with reference to education. Now, 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, it strikes me it was decidedly 
               <br />
               wrong on the part of the delegates to place 
               <br />
               anything in reference to the education of 
               <br />
               the people of Upper and Lower Canada in 
               <br />
               this scheme. I will give my reasons for 
               <br />
               it, and I think those reasons are good. I 
               <br />
               think it should be left fully and entirely to 
               <br />
               the people of Upper and Lower Canada to 
               <br />
               decide what is best with reference to this 
               <br />
               matter. We see already that both in Upper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada both parties are actively 
               <br />
               engaged endeavoring to press upon the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of both Houses of Parliament the neces- 
               <br />
               sity of granting them greater privileges than 
               <br />
               they already enjoy. They seem to be deter- 
               <br />
               mined to have nothing less for their Catholic 
               <br />
               education than a full staff of oﬁicers, together 
               <br />
               with model and normal schools, and all the 
               <br />
               paraphernalia which attach to the present 
               <br />
               common school system. That which in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada was regarded as a ﬁnality in 
               <br />
               school matters is now scouted at, and the advo- 
               <br />
               cates of separate schools go so far as toinsist 
               <br />
               upon having a college; and the object is no 
               <br />
               doubt to place themselves in a position to 
               <br />
               be wholly independent of the proposed local 
               <br />
               government of Upper Canada. So far as I 
               <br />
               am individually concerned in reference to 
               <br />
               schools, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> far rather that the school 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> was worked out in both provinces on 
               <br />
               t e principle of the common schools. I see 
               <br />
               no reason why in any neighborhood aportion 
               <br />
               of the children should be sent to one de- 
               <br />
               scription of school, and a portion of the 
               <br />
               children sent to another description of 
               <br />
               school. I believe it is wrong in principle, 
               <br />
               and that the children of our common country 
               <br />
               should grow up together and be educated 
               <br />
               together. In our public schools there should 
               <br />
               be nothing taught which would have the 
               <br />
               effect of preventing any person from sending 
               <br />
               their children to them. These are my views 
               <br />
               in reference to schools. Ibelieve that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of giving exclusive rights and rivi- 
               <br />
               leges to certain parties has had a ten ency 
               <br />
               to weaken the good feeling which should 
               <br />
               subsist between all classes of the community, 
               <br />
               and which is now seen in the demand from 
               <br />
               both sections for different systems of educa- 
               <br />
               tion. (Hear, hear.) The next thing to

               House is that of the Intereolonial Railway. 
               <br />
               I am opposed in tote to that great road. I 
               <br />
               am opposed to it for the best of all reasons. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place, I am not satisﬁed with it, 
               <br />
               because I do not know what it is going to 
               <br />
               cost. There is nothin in these resolutions 
               <br />
               to indicate what is to e the expense; nor 
               <br />
               have I been able to discover from what has 
               <br />
               taken place on the ﬂoor of the House, any 
               <br />
               data on the subject. Consequently, I do 
               <br />
               not feel that it would be my duty to vote 
               <br />
               for a measure which is going to entail upon 
               <br />
               Upper Canada a large amount of_ debt, with- 
               <br />
               out ﬁrst knowing what that debtis to he. 
               <br />
               So far from this being regarded as acom- 
               <br />
               mercial undertaking, I cannot for the life of 
               <br />
               me see how it is pessible that it can be 
               <br />
               worked commercially. The hon. member 
               <br />
               from Montreal (Hon. Mr. Fsaarsa), who 
               <br />
               spoke in his place the other evening, never 
               <br />
               touched upon this subject. All he told us 
               <br />
               in reference to this great scheme was simply 
               <br />
               this: that there were 100 odd cars lyingat 
               <br />
               Montreal laden with produce, and that they 
               <br />
               could not go forward because on the other 
               <br />
               side of the lines they had so much to do that 
               <br />
               they could not send the cars through. But 
               <br />
               this was no argument at all in favor of the 
               <br />
               Intereolonial Railway. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> supposing the 
               <br />
               road were built, do hon. gentlemen believe

               for a moment that it would pay runnin

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               expenses? There is no doubt in my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mind</span> 
               <br />
               that to keep it cpen a subsidy would be 
               <br />
               required, like that which is paid to the ocean 
               <br />
               steamers. It was stated the other day by 
               <br />
               the hon. member from Montreal that two 
               <br />
               cents per ten per mile was a very small rate 
               <br />
               for railway carriage. But taking it at that 
               <br />
               ﬁgure, what do we ﬁnd? From Toronto to 
               <br />
               the seaboard, over the Intereolonial Railway, 
               <br />
               the distance may be estimated at 939 miles, 
               <br />
               and to send a barrel of ﬂour that distance by 
               <br />
               railway, at a cost of two cents per mile per 
               <br />
               ton, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.charges</span> on the ﬂour would be not 
               <br />
               less than $3.08. But supposing one-half 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬂ‘</span> were charged—one cent per ten 
               <br />
               per mile—and we are told that at such a 
               <br />
               rate the road would be run at a loss, the 
               <br />
               cost would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1.04</span> ; and by the time the 
               <br />
               barrel of ﬂour was laid down in Liverpool, 
               <br />
               there would be charges on it for carriage of 
               <br />
               eight or ten cents per each bushel of wheat 
               <br />
               over what was formerly paid. These ﬁgures 
               <br />
               are based on the authority of hen. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite. “Oh! but,” say they, “the farmer 
               <br />
               gets the beneﬁt of his money during the 
               <br />
               winter.” I do not see that this is any 
               <br />
               argument at all in a commercial point of 
               <br />
