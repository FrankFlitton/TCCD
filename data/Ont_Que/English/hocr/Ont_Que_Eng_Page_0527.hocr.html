               only—that “is to say, provided those pro-

               vinces consent to it, but by inference it can- 
               <br />
               not extend this uniformity to Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               not even if she should wish it. Supposing, 
               <br />
               even, that the other provinces were to desire 
               <br />
               to adopt our Lower Canadian system, accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the letter of this Constitution, one 
               <br />
               would say they cannot do it. They may 
               <br />
               become uniform among themselves, but 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, even though her people were 
               <br />
               to wish it, must not be uniform with them. 
               <br />
               Again, as to education, exceptions of some 
               <br />
               sort are to be made in Lower Canada, and 
               <br />
               indeed in Upper Canada too, though no one 
               <br />
               can tell to what extent these exceptions are 
               <br />
               or are not to be Carried. Thus, in one way 
               <br />
               and another, Lower Canada is to be placed 
               <br />
               on a separate and distinct footing from the 
               <br />
               other provinces, so that her interests 
               <br />
               and institutions may not be meddled 
               <br />
               with. I say this system, as a whole, 
               <br />
               and these peculiarities and exceptions in 
               <br />
               regard to Lower Canada, are adopted with a 
               <br />
               special view to remedy our Canadian diﬂieul- 
               <br />
               ties of race and creed. But,sir, this is no way 
               <br />
               at all of avoiding or lessening trouble from 
               <br />
               this cause. It is idle to pretend that by this 
               <br />
               system collision is going to be prevented. 
               <br />
               Under the legislative union of the Canadas, 
               <br />
               eVen worked as it has been, the tendency of 
               <br />
               the minorities in Upper and Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               respectively, has been towards the mainten- 
               <br />
               ance of the union—towards the avoidance 
               <br />
               of all intemperate language and prejudiced 
               <br />
               feelings—towards the pulling down of the 
               <br />
               feuds that before divided them and the 
               <br />
               respective majorities. And the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">result</span> has 
               <br />
               been, that while just before the union 
               <br />
               the feud between the races in Lower Canada 
               <br />
               was at its highest and bitterest point, it has 
               <br />
               since then all but disappeared. The com- 
               <br />
               plaint of Upper Canadian politicians has been 
               <br />
               that they could not set the British and 
               <br />
               French races in Lower Canada by the ears, 
               <br />
               that they could not get the former, either as 
               <br />
               British or as Protestants, to join with them 
               <br />
               in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crusade</span> against the Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               majority.

               form, but certainly in that spirit. The 
               <br />
               British of Lower Canada have been again 
               <br />
               and again told they were worse than their 
               <br />
               French neighbors, for not casting in their lot 
               <br />
               with the peeple of Upper Canada. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Well, Mr. SPEAKER, undoubtedly, 
               <br />
               before the union, Lower Canada, as I have 
               <br />
               said, was the place where the war of races 
               <br />
               was at its height; and that war of races did 
               <br />
               not nearly cease for a number of years after. 
               <br />
               But the strife did very gradually lessen, and 
               <br />
               a better and more friendly feeling has for 
               <br />
               some time prevailed, in both camps. Indeed, 
               <br />
               there has been a more tolerant state of feel- 
               <br />
               ing in both camps, than in any other 
               <br />
               community so divided as to race and creed. 
               <br />
               that I know of. But the moment you tell 
               <br />
               Lower Canada that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largesounding</span> 
               <br />
               powers of your General Government are 
               <br />
               going to be handed over to a British- 
               <br />
               American majority, decidedly not of the 
               <br />
               race and faith of her majority, that moment 
               <br />
               you wake up the old jealousies and hostility 
               <br />
               in their strongest form. By the very 
               <br />
               provisions you talk of for the protection of 
               <br />
               the non-French and non-Catholic interests, 
               <br />
               you unfortunately countenance the idea that 
               <br />
               the French are going to be more unfair than 
               <br />
               I believe they wish to be. For that matter, 
               <br />
               what else can they well be? They will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               themselves a minority in the' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legis—</span> 
               <br />
               lature, and their power in the General 
               <br />
               Government will depend upon their power 
               <br />
               within their own province and over their 
               <br />
               provincial delegations in the Federal Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. They will thus be compelled to be 
               <br />
               practically aggressive, to secure and retain 
               <br />
               that power. They may not, perhaps, wish 
               <br />
               to be ; they may not, perhaps, be aggressive 
               <br />
               in the worst sense of the term.—I do not say 
               <br />
               that they certainly will be; but whether 
               <br />
               they are or not, there will certainly be in 
               <br />
               this system the very strongest tendencies to 
               <br />
               make them practically aggressive upon the 
               <br />
               rights of the minority in language and faith, 
               <br />
               and at the same time to make the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minority</span> 
               <br />
               most suspicious and resentful of aggression. 
               <br />
               The same sort of alienation, as between the 
               <br />
               two faiths, will be going on in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper</span> Canada. 
               <br />
               Note of warning is already given by this 
               <br />
               scheme, to both parties, that they prepare 
               <br />
               for ﬁght; and the indications, I regret <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.</span> 
               <br />
               say, are that such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’note</span> of warning is not to 
               <br />
               be given in vain. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               prejudices of the two camps are once more 
               <br />
               stirred to their depths ; and if. this scheme 
               <br />
               goes into Operation, they will separate more
