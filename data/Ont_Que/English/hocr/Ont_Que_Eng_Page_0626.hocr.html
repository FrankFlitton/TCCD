               ation which is proposed to us. Had it not

               been for the courage and energy displayed by 
               <br />
               the men of those days, the French element 
               <br />
               would have lost ground, and its importance 
               <br />
               would have diminished, so that at last it would 
               <br />
               have been assimilated by the English element. 
               <br />
               At that time, our public men already wished 
               <br />
               for responsible government, and we shall see 
               <br />
               that the struggle which they carried on for 
               <br />
               half a century in order to obtain it, was pro- 
               <br />
               ductive of no important result, until they had 
               <br />
               recourse to rebellion; and it is since that

               most sacred political rights after passing 
               <br />
               through a century of persecution and through 
               <br />

               away with our inﬂuence as a race in this 
               <br />
               country ? Has not the French majority, for 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen years, always carried its point in the

               sectional equality in the representation ? 
               <br />
               Why should we then relinquish the advan-

               The important question of the voting of the 
               <br />
               supplies was also the subject of the most

               constantly refused by the English minorit in 
               <br />

               favor of the voting of the supplies by the

               representatives of the people. In the divi-

               <br />

               rights are left to the British subject if that of 
               <br />

               has not the control of the funds levied from 
               <br />

               most important of the privileges which are 
               <br />
               secured by constitutional government? In

               this great injustice to be consummated? 
               <br />
               Shall the most precious of their rights be

               Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, there will be no shrinking 
               <br />
               from this infamous proceeding. Our most

               <br />

               <br />
               liberties, were the ﬁrst to be accused of treason 
               <br />
               for having made such a demand, and then 
               <br />

               the capitulation of Montreal, which guaran-

               teed to us the rights and liberties of British

               subjects. That proposal to vote our public

               expenditure, which now appears to us so
