               changes undergone by our own Legislative 
               <br />
               Council, so that I need not recur to that sub- 
               <br />
               ject. The Hon. Commissioner of Crown 
               <br />
               Lands has asserted that we are justiﬁed in 
               <br />
               voting on the proposed reversal of the Con- 
               <br />
               stitution without an appeal to the people. 
               <br />
               I beg to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ</span> from that opinion. [know 
               <br />
               the nature of a trust, whether civil or 
               <br />
               political; they both entail very much the 
               <br />
               same duties. Well, what is the charge en- 
               <br />
               trusted to us by our constituents? That of 
               <br />
               ,workin g out the present Constitution to the 
               <br />
               best of our understanding and of our judg- 
               <br />
               ment. Such is the power entrusted to us; 
               <br />
               but never have our electors authorized us, 
               <br />
               as it is now proposed to do, to destroy the 
               <br />
               Constitution itself and to enter into a political 
               <br />
               alliance with the other British provinces of 
               <br />
               this continent. An instance of a similar 
               <br />
               constitutional subversion, without the 
               <br />
               authorization of the people, is nct to be 
               <br />
               found in the pages of history. It has been 
               <br />
               stated in this House that the project of Con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federation</span> was known to a portion of the 
               <br />
               people, and that there was nothing to pre- 
               <br />
               vent its adoption being pressed. Here again, 
               <br />
               I beg to diﬁ'er with the hon. members who 
               <br />
               express that opinion. I think that even 
               <br />
               though the project were, as stated, known 
               <br />
               by a portion of the people, that would not 
               <br />
               be a reason for precipitating its adoption, 
               <br />
               for the plan interests the whole country 
               <br />
               generally, and it is not suﬂicient that it 
               <br />
               should be acceptable to a certain portion of 
               <br />
               the inhabitants, but to the great mass of the 
               <br />
               people. Moreover, if the public meetings 
               <br />
               already held in Lower Canada serve to in- 
               <br />
               dicate the popular Opinion relative to this 
               <br />
               question, in this section of the country 
               <br />
               at all events, it may fearlessly be said 
               <br />
               that the project has been condemned 
               <br />
               in ﬁfteen counties. Will any one ven- 
               <br />
               ture to pretend that Lower Canada is to 
               <br />
               be of no account in the Confederation, 
               <br />
               and that Upper Canada alone has a 
               <br />
               right to make its voice heard ; that only its 
               <br />
               approval or disapproval of the scheme can 
               <br />
               entail the adoption or rejection of that 
               <br />
               scheme? Most assuredly, I do not believe 
               <br />
               that any one would ever venture to enunciate 
               <br />
               such a pretension. I know of but one single 
               <br />
               county in Lower Canada which authorized 
               <br />
               its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> to vote on the scheme in 
               <br />
               question as he should think ﬁt. I therefore 
               <br />
               consider that I am justiﬁed in saying, that 
               <br />
               the reason which induces the Government to 
               <br />
               cause this measure to be adopted without 
               <br />
               submitting all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> details, is that it fears to

               HON. Mu. OLIVIER—It is perfectly 
               <br />
               true that the county of Richelieu never 
               <br />
               condemned the details of the measure, and 
               <br />
               for a very simple reason: the Government 
               <br />
               had never, allowed them to be known, and 
               <br />
               still persists at this present time in keeping 
               <br />
               the country in ignorance of them. But the

               honorable gentleman admits that the county 
               <br />
               of Richelieu directed its representative to 
               <br />
               demand an appeal to the people. To say 
               <br />
               that Lower Canada is favorable to the scheme 
               <br />
               of Confederation, is to make an assertion to 
               <br />
               which the public meetings which have been 
               <br />
               held within the last month or two give the 
               <br />
               lie in the most formal manner. I know what 
               <br />
               to think of the expression of public Opinion 
               <br />
               in the district of Montreal; as to the district
