               position to act more freely. It may be re- 
               <br />
               marked, in passing, that in the proposed Con- 
               <br />
               stitution there is an article which provides 
               <br />
               that the judges of the courts of Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada shall be appointed from the members of 
               <br />
               the bar of that section. This exception was 
               <br />
               only made in favor of Lower Canada, and it 
               <br />
               is a substantial guarantee for those who fear 
               <br />
               the proposed s stem. Besides, the honorable 
               <br />
               member for ochelaga, who fancies that he 
               <br />
               sees danger in the powers given to the Central 
               <br />
               Government, knows by experience, as having 
               <br />
               himself been a minister of the Crown, that in 
               <br />

               <br />
               section in which the appointment is to be 
               <br />
               made, and accepts their choice. The same 
               <br />
               practice would necessarily be followed by the 
               <br />
               Central Government, who would be forced to 
               <br />
               respect it, because behind the ministers from 
               <br />
               each section would be found the members from 
               <br />
               that section, and behind our ministers for 
               <br />
               Lower Canada will be found the sixty-ﬁve 
               <br />
               members whom we shall have sent to repre- 
               <br />
               sent and protect our interests in the Federal 
               <br />
               Parliament. It is then advantageous, and 
               <br />
               there could be no danger in the provision that 
               <br />
               the judges should be appointed by the Central 
               <br />
               Government; indeed, it is for our interest, 
               <br />
               and the interest of all, that it should be so. 
               <br />
               And although it may be looked upon as a 
               <br />
               secondary consideration, yet it may as well be 
               <br />
               mentioned now, that by leaving the appoint- 
               <br />
               ment of our judges to the Central Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, we are the gainers by one hundred 
               <br />
               thousand dollars, which will have to be paid 
               <br />
               for their services by the central power. This 
               <br />
               consideration will rhaps have some weight 
               <br />
               with the honorab e member for Hoehelaga, 
               <br />
               who makes such an outcry to alarm the peo- 
               <br />
               ple that we shall be obliged to have recourse 
               <br />
               to direct taxation to defray the expenses of 
               <br />
               our Local Legislature. Notwithstanding the 
               <br />
               advanced hour of the evening, I cannot pass

               over in silence another observation made by

               now it was of the highest importance

               that it should be so under the proposed sys-

               tem, and therefore the members from Lower 
               <br />

               <br />
               obtain the reservation to the Local Govern- 
               <br />
