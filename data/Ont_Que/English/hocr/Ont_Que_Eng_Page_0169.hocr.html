               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conant)</span> said our ex enditure would 
               <br />
               be greatly increased. I sai that would de- 
               <br />
               pend upon ourselves, for we should continue 
               <br />
               to have the management of our own aﬁairs, 
               <br />
               and the economy with which they are con- 
               <br />
               ducted will depend upon those who admin- 
               <br />
               ister them. If great improvements are car- 
               <br />
               ried out—if the Intercolonial Railway is 
               <br />
               built, and our canals enlarged—if harbors are 
               <br />
               constructed on Lake Huron, as they must be— 
               <br />
               and if further aid should be granted to ex- 
               <br />
               tend a railwa to those harbors —if all this 
               <br />
               is done, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wiﬁ</span> be impossible to eﬂect it and 
               <br />
               not increase our present expenditure—but 
               <br />
               these improvements will be amongst our- 
               <br />
               selves in Canada, and we shall enjoy the bene- 
               <br />
               ﬁts they will confer; and Canada, it should 
               <br />
               be remembered, will have a just voice in the 
               <br />
               Confederate Legislature. I myself hope 
               <br />
               these great improvements will be carried 
               <br />
               on in the west, simultaneously with the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway, although this is the 
               <br />
               only one speciﬁcally referred to in the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions—the enlargement of the canals being 
               <br />
               only spoken of generally. The Intercolonial 
               <br />
               Railway, hon. gentlemen, must be construct- 
               <br />
               ed if we have Confederation ; but I hope 
               <br />
               western improvements will be carried on at 
               <br />
               the same time. (Hear, hear.) I think, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, we should be governed 
               <br />
               in our votes by the consideration of the effect 
               <br />
               of this measure upon the prosperity of the 
               <br />
               provinces. If it is to do us good, we should 
               <br />
               adopt it without unnecessary delay. What 
               <br />
               is it that we expect? Have we not reason 
               <br />
               to believe that it will settle the sectional 
               <br />
               diﬁeulties which have so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long</span> agitated and 
               <br />
               distracted the country? Wil it not be the 
               <br />
               means of extending our inﬂuence over a 
               <br />
               large and most valuable territory? Will it 
               <br />
               not open the way for us to two of the ﬁnest 
               <br />
               harbors on the Atlantic—St. John and Hali- 
               <br />
               fax? Will it not give us access to the ocean 
               <br />
               at all seasons of the year? Will it not open 
               <br />
               to us the coal ﬁelds of the Lower Provinces? 
               <br />
               Will it not add nearly another million to our 
               <br />
               present pc ulation, and place under one gov- 
               <br />

               But if the measure fails, what will our posi-

               tion be? I believe that our position in Up-

               more, hon. gentlemen, you all know the in-

               ﬂuence that the agreement arrived at in the 
               <br />
               Conference had upon our credit in England ; 
               <br />
               that it had the effect of raising the price 
               <br />
               of our securities 15 to 17 per cent. But 
               <br />
               if we fail to agree upon the measure here 
               <br />
               in Parliament, what will be the eﬁ'ect in 
               <br />
               Britain? Would there not be a feeling 
               <br />
               of disappointmcnt——would not our friends 
               <br />
               there almost despair of our ever placing our- 
               <br />
               selves in a position to carry on our aﬁ'airs 
               <br />
               with credit, and acting for ourselves in a 
               <br />
               statesmanlikc way? Some hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               speak of dreading to take the responsibility 
               <br />
               0 a vote on a question which is to make a 
               <br />
               change in the constitution of this House, 
               <br />
               without consulting the peeple. Why! what 
               <br />
               are we here for if it is not to take responsi- 
               <br />
               bility? The people send us here for that 
               <br />
               purpose, to act as we think best upon all 
               <br />
               measures that may be presentedtous. But 
               <br />
               under existing circumstances, I think the 
               <br />
               responsibility of postponing the adoption of 
               <br />
               the scheme, of putting Confederation oﬁ', is 
               <br />
               very much greater than the responsibility of 
               <br />
               sanctioning it. (Hear, hear.) I cannot help 
               <br />
               thinking that if we postpone the measure— 
               <br />
               and to adopt any amendment would have 
               <br />
               the effect of postponing it, and perhaps, of 
               <br />
               losing Confederation for ever—our conduct 
               <br />
               will be considered extremely factions and 
               <br />
               unpatriotic. A good deal has been said 
               <br />
               about a possible dead-lock between this 
               <br />
               House and the other House, but there has 
               <br />
               been little of that in ast times, and nothing 
               <br />
               of a serious nature. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{f,</span> however, the amend- 
               <br />
               ment passes, I can imagine adead-loek which 
               <br />
               might be extremely prejudicial to this House 
               <br />
               —prejudicial to its inﬂuence in the country; 
               <br />
               nay, almost destructive of it. Suppose these 
               <br />
               resolutions to be carried in the other House 
               <br />
               by a large majority, which I have little doubt 
               <br />
               will be the case, and we carry anamendment 
               <br />
               here—suppose all the legislatures of the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces adopt the resolutions, and 
               <br />
               this House stands alone in rejecting them— 
               <br />
               do you believe the British Parliament will 
               <br />
               be turned aside from what it believes to 
               <br />
               be the best interests of British America 
               <br />
               by the action of this House? I can 
               <br />
               imagine a dead-lock occurring then, and 
               <br />
               one in consequence of which the opin- 
               <br />
               ion of this House might be set aside 
               <br />
               and its vote disregarded. Until this mea- 
               <br />
               sure is carried out it is impossible the
