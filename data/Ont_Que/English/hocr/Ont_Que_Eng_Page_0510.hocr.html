               discussion, and underwent long and pains- 
               <br />
               taking revision of all sorts, in all quarters, 
               <br />
               before it was ﬁnally adopted. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Yet we are called upon to admit now, and to 
               <br />
               admit it without examination, that this work 
               <br />
               of thirty-three gentlemen, done in seventeen 
               <br />
               days, is a much better work than that; and 
               <br />
               not only so, but that it is even better for 
               <br />
               our people and situation, than the time- 
               <br />
               honored Constitution of our Mother Land; 
               <br />
               that it combines essentially the advantages 
               <br />
               of both, with the disadvantages of neither. 
               <br />
               Ido not think so. The Constitution of the 
               <br />
               United States, it must be borne in mind, at 
               <br />
               least lasted seventy years without fracture. 
               <br />
               It has stood a good deal of straining, from 
               <br />
               events beyond the possible foresight or con- 
               <br />
               trol of those who framed it; and it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may"</span> yet 
               <br />
               stand many more years, notwithstanding 
               <br />
               this late strain upon it. If, indeed, Louisiana 
               <br />
               had not been purchased, if the cotton-gin 
               <br />
               had not been invented—the two unforeseen 
               <br />
               events which so encouraged the growth 
               <br />
               of cotton and therefore of slavery—if it 
               <br />
               had not been for these, what I may call 
               <br />
               extraneous events, which could not be 
               <br />
               expected to enter into the minds of the 
               <br />
               framers of that Constitution, it probably 
               <br />
               would not have received the shock that 
               <br />
               it has received ; but we do not know yet 
               <br />
               that that shock will have a fatal effect, 
               <br />
               or that it will break up the wonderful fabric 
               <br />
               which they created. Perhaps it may change 
               <br />
               that fabric more or less in some of its parts; 
               <br />
               and after it shall have passed away, the fabric 
               <br />
               itself may not improbably endure for a very 
               <br />
               long time to come. But as to this proposed 
               <br />
               Constitution of ours, should it become the 
               <br />
               organic law of the land, how long will it last ? 
               <br />
               How will it work, if it does last? And to 
               <br />
               or towards what, while working, will it tend? 
               <br />
               To these questions, I have now to call the 
               <br />
               earnest attention of this House. I begin, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, with the future House of 
               <br />
               Commons—falsely so called. I shall not take 
               <br />
               up the different resolutions one after another, 
               <br />
               and criticise them in that manner; but I 
               <br />
               will take up the diﬂ'erent leading features of 
               <br />
               the scheme consecutively, and endeavor not 
               <br />
               to misrepresent them. If I should do so, 
               <br />
               or at all misstate their character or probable 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effects,</span> I give honorable gentlemen opposite

               the leading feature of this project; and 
               <br />
               I take it up ﬁrst, comparing it with the 
               <br />
               House of Representatives of the United 
               <br />

               <br />
               powers as of its composition. I cannot, in 
               <br />
               this view, compare it with the Imperial 
               <br />
               House of Commons, because the principle of 
               <br />
               its construction is so entirely different. In 
               <br />
               that respect, it is simply copied from what I 
               <br />
               think the wrong model; and the copied 
               <br />
               parts correspond most faithfully and exactly 
               <br />
               with what I venture to call the least desirable 
               <br />
               features of the Constitution of the United 
               <br />
               States House of Representatives. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The copy is not, I repeat, of a thing 
               <br />
               absolutely good, but only of a thing as good 
               <br />
               as the framers of the Constitution of the 
               <br />
               United States, circumstanced as they were, 
               <br />
               could make it ; but the peculiarity of their 
               <br />
               system that I object to, was not at all neces- 
               <br />
               sary to ours. I think it was absolutely 
               <br />
               unnecessary; I think it even very much of . 
               <br />
               an excrcscence. It can hardly be denied, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, that there is a good deal of 
               <br />
               practical objection to the plan of shifting 
               <br />
               representation districts, which is what this 
               <br />
               system adOpts, and what the system of the 
               <br />
               United States adopted. Every ten years the 
               <br />
               representation from each province in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons is to be changed or 
               <br />
               readjusted by a rule which, for all practical 
               <br />
               purposes, is essential] the same as that of 
               <br />
               the United States. i course we have not 
               <br />
               the little addition of the al‘owance for the 
               <br />
               three-ﬁfths of the slave p0pulation which 
               <br />
               they have ; but decennially we are to take 
               <br />
               the population of the several provinces, and 
               <br />
               by a rule in all essentials common to the 
               <br />
               two systems, we are to declare how many 
               <br />
               representation districts are to be allowed to 
               <br />
               each province. Now, the result of that 
               <br />
               system must be that we can have no lasting 
               <br />
               constituencies for the future House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons. These representation districts cannot 
               <br />
               be kept to correspond with our municipal, 
               <br />
               business or registration districts, or with our 
               <br />
               districts for representation in our provincial 
               <br />
               legislatures. We are to have sect of special, 
               <br />
               shifting districts for the mere purpose of 
               <br />
               electing our Federal House of Commons. I 
               <br />
               must say that this principle is not, from a Brit- 
               <br />
