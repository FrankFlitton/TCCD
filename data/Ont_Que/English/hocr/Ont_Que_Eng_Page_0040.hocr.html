               men only could such a scheme have been

               certain that the whole thing would miscarry,

               no agreement could be expected, for as he had

               already said, the delegates from the other

               parn'eular point, so of a hundred others, until 
               <br />
               it would be utterly impossible ' to arrive

               <br />

               m that House, e Confederation would be 
               <br />
               divided into two sections, vis. : Upper Canada,

               Lower Canada, and the Maritime Provinces, 
               <br />
               and each of these sections would send twenty- 
               <br />
               four members to the House. In Upper Ca- 
               <br />
               nada, as had been stated lately by an honor- 
               <br />
               able member, the population has increased 
               <br />
               very rapidly, and would probably go on in- 
               <br />
               creasing in a much larger ratio than that of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada or the other provinces, and if 
               <br />
               the Legislative Council were elective, the time 
               <br />
               might come when the people of that section 
               <br />
               would fancy themselve entitled to an increased 
               <br />
               representation in the Council, and commerce 
               <br />
               to agitate for it. The might object to the

               ﬁshing bounties id t e Lower Province, to 
               <br />

               <br />
               to something else, and claim a representation 
               <br />
               in the Council, more in accordance with their 
               <br />
               population to enforce their views; and in view 
               <br />
               of such contingencies the delegates from those 
               <br />
               provinces conceived it would not be safe to 
               <br />
               trust their rights to an elective House. It 
               <br />
               was then determined that in one branch 
               <br />
               there would be a ﬁxed number of members 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nominawd</span> by the Crown, to enable it to 
               <br />
               act as a counterpoise to the branch in 
               <br />
               which the principle of representation accord- 
               <br />
               ing to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">æpulation</span> would be recognized. It 
               <br />
               might said that the principle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">limite»</span> 
               <br />
               tion of numbers could have been adopted, and 
               <br />
               that of election preserved. Well, he did not 
               <br />
               say the scheme was perfect, but it was the 
               <br />
               best that could be devised, and as the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces felt the danger from their inferiority 
               <br />
               of numbers, bein only 800,000 ag <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tinst</span> double

               that number in pper Canada alone, it was

               essential that the security which a ﬁxed repre-
