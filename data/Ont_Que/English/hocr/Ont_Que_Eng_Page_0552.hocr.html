               is this: “ Her Majesty has had great satis-

               faction in giving Her sanction ”—to what? 
               <br />
               —“to the meeting of a conference of dele- 
               <br />

               they assembled without Her Majesty’s sanc- 
               <br />
               tion, but they got her sanction afterwards to 
               <br />

               <br />
               the despatch of the Colonial Secretary. If 
               <br />
               it is a declaration that this thing is a treaty,

               <br />
               the Speech from the Throne, we had, the

               Now, I cannot read this sentence with- 
               <br />
               out asking what analogy there is between 
               <br />
               this project and the declaration of inde- 
               <br />
               pendence. Why should these resolutions 
               <br />
               suggest to any one’s mind the declara- 
               <br />
               tion of independence? Did the gentlemen 
               <br />
               who signed these resolutions in order to 
               <br />
               authenticate them—pledge their lives and 
               <br />
               fortunes, and I don’t know what besides, to 
               <br />
               anything, or risk anything, by appending 
               <br />
               their signatures to the document? Was it a 
               <br />
               great exercise of political heroism? Why, 
               <br />
               the men who signed the declaration of 
               <br />
               independence qualiﬁed themselves in the 
               <br />
               eyes of the Imperial Government for the 
               <br />
               pleasant operations of heading and hanging. 
               <br />
               They knew what they were about. They 
               <br />
               were issuing a rebel declaration of war. But 
               <br />
               this is a piece of machinery, on the face of it 
               <br />
               at least, to perpetuate our connection with the 
               <br />
               Mother Country 1 Why then does it suggest 
               <br />
               the idea that so great a scheme of self-gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, or one shadowing forth so many 
               <br />
               similar and possible changes, “ hardly ever 
               <br />
               before occurred?” It is because there is, 
               <br />
               underlying the speaker’s thought, just that 
               <br />
               idea of the anti-colonial school in England, 
               <br />
               that we are going to slip away from our con- 
               <br />
               nection with the Mother Country; and in this 
               <br />
               respect, therefore, it seems to him that it is like 
               <br />
               the declaration of independence. The re- 
               <br />
               maining sentence indicates a curious misap- 
               <br />
               prehension as to the present posture of this 
               <br />
               question. “ If the delegates of these several 
               <br />
               colonies ﬁnally agree to the resolutions. 
               <br />
               framed by their committee, and it these 
               <br />
               resolutions be approved by the several legis- 
               <br />
               latures of the several colonies, Parliament 
               <br />
               will be asked to consider and complete this 
               <br />
               federation of our Northern American pos- 
               <br />
               sessions.” The noble lord, the mover of the 
               <br />
               Address, seems to take the resolutions for a 
               <br />
               mere report of a committee which (on their 
               <br />
               way here) had yet to be submitted to the 
               <br />
               consideration of the delegates! Next, I turn 
               <br />
               to the language of Lord HOUGHTON, the 
               <br />
               seconder of the Address <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;'</span> and from his lips 
               <br />
               too, we have an almost distinct utterance of 
               <br />
               the idea of our coming independence. He
