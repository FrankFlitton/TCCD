               <br />
               this vital question. Bleus and Rouges, Mr.

               SPEAKER, have united as one man to pre-

               present Administration has conceded to him, 
               <br />
               by the Quebec Conference. What was the 
               <br />
               reason given by the Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               for Upper Canada, during the session of 
               <br />
               1863, to the member for South Oxford, who 
               <br />
               reproached him for having governed Upper 
               <br />
               Canada by a Lower Canadian majority? He 
               <br />
               replied—and his words are still ringing in 
               <br />
               my ears—“ Never,” said he, “has Upper 
               <br />
               Canada had to complain of anything which 
               <br />
               my Government has imposed on Upper 
               <br />
               Canada by means of a Lower Canadian ma- 
               <br />
               jority. You have no grounds of complaint, 
               <br />
               and you will never obtain your extreme de- 
               <br />
               mands.” This was the language used at 
               <br />
               that time. But things are changed, and 
               <br />
               unfortunately autre temps autre chose. 
               <br />
               0 temporal 0 mores! And afterwards, 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Montreal East 
               <br />
               added expressions more or less ironical, 
               <br />
               more or less founded, comparing the Grits

               of Upper Canada to so many eodﬁsh in 
               <br />
               the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It was then, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, that the honorable member 
               <br />
               for South Oxford took an activepart in the 
               <br />

               have found themselves in a minority in this 
               <br />

               to retain oﬂiee—never before. Now, all this

               has not tended to inspire me with any conﬁ- 
               <br />
               dence in the plan of Confederation, and has 
               <br />
               indeed made me resolve to vote against the 
               <br />
               whole, because this scheme is to be accepted 
               <br />
               in toto or not at all. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               Government tells us, Mr. SPEAKE <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,</span> that

               these resolutions cannot'be amended in any

               particular; the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seventy-two</span> resolutions, they 
               <br />
               say, must be voted all together, so as to give 
               <br />
               no ground for complaint on the part of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces. It is a treaty from 
               <br />
               which no deviation can be allowed. But 
               <br />
               how is it that the Honorable Mr. TILLEY, 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick, offered to allow the 
               <br />
               Opposition in that province to amend this 
               <br />
               treaty? And did not the Government 
               <br />
               declare, at the end of the last session, that 
               <br />
               they intended to propose an amendment of 
               <br />
               some kind to the Constitutional Act, and 
               <br />
               that they would submit it to the people for 
               <br />
               their consideration before seeking its adop- 
               <br />
               tion ? And now they refuse to do this. Ah l 
               <br />
               I repeat, all this is very far from inspiring 
               <br />
               me with the least conﬁdence in the scheme 
               <br />
               of Confederation, and in the present Admin-

               istration. You must swallow the whole 
               <br />
               scheme without hesitation, without power to 
               <br />
