               what was the ﬁrst concession? The ﬁrst

               <br />
               this House will have the control of the

               <br />
               not entitled to it? Then there is another

               point in connection with the Lower Pro— 
               <br />
               vinces, which I will here notice. The

               <br />

               amount. This is another matter which 
               <br />
               should have been attended to. It is not 
               <br />
               right that members should be sent to the

               history of concessions, and all on one side.

               The arrangement of the public debt at a

               rate per head, instead of according to re-

               HON. Mn. SEYMOUR—My honorable 
               <br />
               friend says he adopts one plan for the past 
               <br />
               and another for the future. What justice 
               <br />
               is there in that? We have only to look at 
               <br />
               the roposed system to see the effect it has. 
               <br />
               If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blew</span> Brunswick, with a million revenue, 
               <br />
               be allowed to put her debt of seven millions 
               <br />
               upon the Confederation, then, upon the same 
               <br />
               rule, Canada should enter into the Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion with all her debt and more. The esti- 
               <br />
               mated revenue of Canada in eleven millions. 
               <br />
               Any one could ﬁgure that out and see that 
               <br />
               Canada should have had no debt left for the 
               <br />
               local governments to pay; but on this prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of concession, why, of course, Canada 
               <br />
               must suﬁ'er. Now, to shew the working of 
               <br />
               the system, look at the eﬁ'ect of the rate of 
               <br />
               80 cents a head. Upper Canada will pay 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">81,540,000</span> to the General Government, and 
               <br />
               receive back <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,120,000</span> for the Local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern-</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment—that</span> is, supposing Upper Canada 
               <br />
               contributes two-thirds of the revenue of the 
               <br />
               united provinces. That has been admitted 
               <br />
               by one who now holds a hi h position in the 
               <br />
               Government. This is the ne scheme which 
               <br />
               my honorable friend from Saugeen lauds. 
               <br />
               You pay according to wealth, and the dif- 
               <br />
               ference against Upper Canada is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$420,000,</span> 
               <br />
               or in other words, Upper Canada pays 
               <br />
               81,540,000 out of one pocket and receives 
               <br />
               back <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,120,000</span> in the other. This is the 
               <br />
               working of the system which has been car- 
               <br />
               ried out, very much against the interests of 
               <br />
               not only Upper Canada but all Canada. The 
               <br />
               third concession is the amount to be 'd to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, as a set-oﬁ' against or not 
               <br />
               being indebted. There may be, I admit, a 
               <br />
               show of fairness in this, but the sum is a great 
               <br />
               deal too large. Canada will go on increasing, 
               <br />
               whereas from Newfoundland we can expect 
               <br />
               very little. The fourth matteris that of the 80 
               <br />
               cents a head. to which I have just alluded, 
               <br />
               and I have shown the working of that, and 
               <br />
               it is decidedly against it. Then comes 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">863,000</span> a year to New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               for ten years. I was vc glad to hear 
               <br />
               my honorable friend from Saugeen (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mscpnmsorz)</span> disapprove of that. I 
               <br />
               am glad to ﬁnd him, so strong a supporter of 
               <br />
               this scheme, admit that that was wron .

               have made my calculation in an p er 
               <br />
               Canada point of view. So long as the union 
               <br />
               was maintained, however, my voice was never 
               <br />
               raised by way of comparison. I desire to 
               <br />
               maintain that union. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been)</span> But
