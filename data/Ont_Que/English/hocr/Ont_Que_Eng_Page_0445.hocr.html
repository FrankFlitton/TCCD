               It is a remarkable fact that there is only one 
               <br />
               other government in Eur0pe which has a 
               <br />
               system similar to Great Britain, and that is 
               <br />
               Sweden. There is another class, represented 
               <br />
               by a number of the German nations. There 
               <br />
               are Wurtemburg, Hesse Darmstadt, Prussia, 
               <br />
               Saxony, Hanover, Baden and Bavaria, with 
               <br />
               an aggregate population of about 30,000,000, 
               <br />
               whose Upper Chambers are partly hereditary, 
               <br />
               partly nominative, and partly ex-oﬂicz'o. The 
               <br />
               purely hereditar principle, as found in 
               <br />
               Great Britain an Sweden, obtains among a 
               <br />
               population of some 32,000,000. Then there 
               <br />
               is another class nominated by the Crown for 
               <br />
               life from a list chosen by intermediate 
               <br />
               bodies. The councils choose three lists and 
               <br />
               the Sovereign nominates therefrom. In‘this

               <br />
               There is another class where the members of 
               <br />
               the Senate are nominated for life, where the 
               <br />
               number is limited, and where some few 
               <br />
               members of the royal family have the privi- 
               <br />
               lege of sitting as members. Italy, with a 
               <br />
               population of 21,777,334 ; Portugal, 3,584, 
               <br />
               677; Servia, 1,098,281 ; Austria, 34,000,000. 
               <br />
               This class represents altogether a population 
               <br />
               of 61,460,292. Then there is another class 
               <br />
               where the members are elected for a term of 
               <br />
               years, and it is a remarkable fact in this con-

               <br />
               although a monarchy, is well known to be
