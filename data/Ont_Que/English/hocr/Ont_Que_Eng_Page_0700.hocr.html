               <br />
               The hon. member for M ontmoren’cy has spoken 
               <br />
               of the contradictions which he has imagined to 
               <br />
               exist between the opinions which I expressed 
               <br />
               in 1856, 1858 and 1860, and those which I 
               <br />
               entertain at the present time on the 
               <br />
               subj ect of the Confederation of the provinces. 
               <br />
               But these contradictions do not really exist. 
               <br />
               I have never expressed an opinion in favor 
               <br />
               of a Confederation of all the provinces, but of 
               <br />
               the two Canadas only, and that Confederation 
               <br />
               to which I would have agreed as a remedy 
               <br />
               for the diﬁiculties created by the question of 
               <br />
               the representation, had no resemblance what- 
               <br />
               ever to that which is now pro osed to us. 
               <br />
               By that plan Lower Canada we d have had 
               <br />
               complete control of all her local affairs ; 
               <br />
               under the present scheme her control is 
               <br />
               surrounded by so many restrictions, that in 
               <br />
               fact it is the central government which has 
               <br />
               the control, not on ly of what relates to all 
               <br />
               the provinces, but also of what may relate 
               <br />
               to one of the provinces only. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Before speaking of contradictions, the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Montmorency ought to bear in 
               <br />
               mind that he is more vulnerable on this 
               <br />
               head than any one else. He ought to 
               <br />
               remember his two pamphlets—one published 
               <br />
               in 1858, and the other in 1865; one going 
               <br />
               to prove the absurdity of a Confederation of 
               <br />
               all the British North American Provinces, 
               <br />
               and the other pointing out the advantages 
               <br />
               we should derive tram such a Confederation. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst of these pamphlets the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber, after having proposed 27 questions with a 
               <br />
               view to examine under all its diﬁ'erent aspects 
               <br />
               the question of a Federal union of the two 
               <br />
               Canadas and that of a Federal or Legislative 
               <br />
               union of all the provinces, rejects alike both 
               <br />
               these projects, because he only saw in them 
               <br />
               the annihilation of Lower Canada. The hon. 
               <br />
               member was so thoroughly convinced of 
               <br />
               that, that of all the propositions he gave the 
               <br />
               preference to a legislative union, because it 
               <br />
               would come to an end all the sooner. He 
               <br />
               found it more logical, looking at the imme- 
               <br />
               diate results of the union. “In fact, if we 
               <br />
               must have a union of some kind of all the 
               <br />
               provinces, and if Lower Canada is destined 
               <br />
               to lose the little inﬂuence which she yet exer- 
               <br />
               cises on legislation under the existing union, 
               <br />
               it would be better to attain our object by a 
               <br />
               machinery more sim le, less complicated 
               <br />
               and less costly.” An a little further on he 
               <br />
               adds, “ As far as we are concerned, we are
