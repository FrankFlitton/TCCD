               <br />
               Great Britain should get into a war with the

               United States from circumstances over which 
               <br />
               we had no control, still our destinies were 
               <br />
               linked in with those of the great empire of 
               <br />
               which we form a part, and it is our duty, 
               <br />
               _ under all circumstances, todo something more 
               <br />
               than we have yet done, to prepare for events 
               <br />
               that may happen from one cause or another. 
               <br />
               But suppose that during the past summer 
               <br />
               armed forces from the United States had en- 
               <br />
               tered Canada in pursuit of raiders escaping

               into this province from the other side of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               DIX’B order been withdrawn; and had we 
               <br />
               found that our integrity as a member of the 
               <br />
               t Empire was not respected, and Great 
               <br />
               ritain had coincided with the views of our 
               <br />
               Government and declared war against the 
               <br />
               United States, because that country had exer-

               cised liberties in one of her provinces to which 
               <br />
               no foreign power was entitled, where then 
               <br />
               would have been the cause of the war ? It 
               <br />
               would have lain in the assertion of the right 
               <br />
               of the people of this province to maintain the 
               <br />

               <br />
               with that nation to have been elsewhere, still 
               <br />
               we must partake with the Empire in upholding 
               <br />
               its integrit , and must stand or fall with that 
               <br />
               Empire. hall we say that we will contribute 
               <br />
               nothing towards our defence except to keep 
               <br />
               up the volunteers, and depend entirely upon 
               <br />
               what the Mother Country, for prudential 
               <br />
               reasons, may do for us? Is that a feeling 
               <br />
               that any honorable member of this House 
               <br />
               ought to be actuated by in relation to 
               <br />
               this or any other question ? I am sure no

               honorable gentleman would be willing to sit 
               <br />
               down and fold his arms under the protection 
               <br />
               which the money and arms of Great Britain 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> us; and I am sure my honorable friend

               a view plainly expressed. Still, my honorable

               friend thinks these resolutions ought not to

               ass this House, but ought to be postponed 
               <br />

               <br />
               condition in which they now are. I believe,

               on the contrary, that the interests and destiny 
               <br />
               of this country are bound up in the union now

               contemplated taking place. Suppose, as

               many believe, the end of that unfortunate 
               <br />
               fratnicidal strife in the United States is at

               <br />

               <br />
               is no knowing when circumstances will allow 
               <br />
               of its being brought to this forward 8 
               <br />
               again. Those of you who know what diﬁcul-

               ties and objections were met with—the selﬁsh 
               <br />
               interests of the various sections of this and of 
               <br />
               the other provinces, which we had to over- 
               <br />
               come—must feel that a very great advance 
               <br />
               was made when the measure was brought to 
               <br />
               the present forward stage. When again will 
               <br />
               it be likely to happen that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reprwentatives</span> 
               <br />
               of the various provinces will be brought 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Œtber</span> to consider the question ? When 
               <br />
               ' it again happen that the governments of 
               <br />
               the several provinces concerned will be able 
               <br />
               to lay upon the table of their respective legis- 
               <br />
               latures a scheme so complete in all its details 
               <br />
               as this is ? It is impossible to say when that 
               <br />
               happy coincidence of circumstances will ain 
               <br />
               occur. Then my honorable friend from i ia- 
               <br />
               gara sa s, “ You have not given us the scheme 
               <br />
               in detail. You have not given the whole of it. 
               <br />
               The House has not before it the reposed 
               <br />
               Constitution under which Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> Lower 
               <br />
               Canada are hereafter to meet. You have not 
               <br />
               told us what are to be the rights and the 
               <br />
               powers of the local legislatures.” Well, hon- 
               <br />
               orable gentlemen, all I can say is, that it would 
               <br />
               be impossible, and not only impossible, it would 
               <br />
               be useless for the Government to have brought 
               <br />
               down this scheme at the same time that they 
               <br />
               submitted the scheme now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the House. 
               <br />
               Until this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme.</span> passes, until it shall be 
               <br />
               adopted in the other provinces, until we know 
               <br />
               whether of not we are to form portions of a 
               <br />
               Confederate Government, there is no occasion 
               <br />
               for introducing the scheme relating to the 
               <br />
               local 1 'slatures. But, honorable ntlemen, 
               <br />
               is it li ely or can it be possible or such a 
               <br />
               scheme to be adopted without the sanction of 
               <br />
               both branches of the Legislature? The plan, 
               <br />
               whatever it may be, for the constitution of 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada, is it a matter 
               <br />
