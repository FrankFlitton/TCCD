               SPEAKER, if we are threatened in this way, 
               <br />
               the hon. member f <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:r</span> South Leeds ought not

               to be surprised that as a Lower Canadian I

               have something to say against the Opinions 
               <br />
               expressed by Lord DURHAM in his report. 
               <br />
               'I can perfectly understand that he could 
               <br />
               not possibly have the feelings of a Lower

               countrymen. (Hear, hear.) But neither, 
               <br />
               on the other hand, does he feel as I do that 
               <br />
               the plan of Confederation will bring the 
               <br />
               French-Canadian race to the social condition 
               <br />
               conceived and predicted by the noble lord 
               <br />
               whose report I have just cited. That hon.

               member, as an Englishman anda Protestant, 
               <br />
               is in favor of a legislative union, in 
               <br />
               preference to any other system of govern- 
               <br />
               ment. [Ie would behold with pleasure but

               <br />
               do not blame him for these sentiments, 
               <br />
               which are perfectly justiﬁable when held by 
               <br />
               an Englishman; but, on the other hand, I 
               <br />
               am thoroughly convinced that he will not 
               <br />
               deem it a strange thing that a French-
