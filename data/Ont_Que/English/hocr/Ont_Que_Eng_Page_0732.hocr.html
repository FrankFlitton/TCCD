               the hon. member for the county of Quebec,

               <br />
               ted to the House, is to despatch it to England 
               <br />
               in order that the Imperial Parliament may 
               <br />
               merely sanction the letter of the measure. 
               <br />
               The Government never had a thought of 
               <br />
               taking the House and the people by surprise. 
               <br />
               If we were to go to England and pray for a 
               <br />
               Constitution different from that which is 
               <br />
               mentioned in the Address, we should be 
               <br />
               branded with disgrace, and deservedly so, 
               <br />
               and should render ourselves unworthy of the 
               <br />
               position which we now ﬁll. These reasons 
               <br />
               are snﬁicient, I think, to shew that there is 
               <br />
               not so much difference between the opinion 
               <br />
               of the Government and that of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for the county of Quebec, as that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman supposes. We are agreed 
               <br />
               on the point to which he takes exception; 
               <br />
               and as he has declared that he would vote in 
               <br />

               have reason to trust that he Will do so, as the

               regret, Mr. SPEAKER, that the leader of

               myself a friend of the Administration, and 
               <br />

               their course in relation to this question, in 
               <br />

               would have advised or been inclined to 
               <br />

               <br />
               from that mode they have de arted. I did 
               <br />
               feel that when, as between t e Opposition 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Government, there was something

               in the nature of a compact, that compact

               should be carried out. (Hear, hear.) I

               interests of the public. I do not hesitate 
               <br />
               to say it had my approbation, as far as my 
               <br />
               individual opinion was concerned. But, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding that it had my approbation, 
               <br />

               <br />
               and the advantage of the public, I did not 
               <br />
               feel that the Government were justiﬁed, so 
               <br />
               long as the Opposition were dissentin 
               <br />
               parties, in departing from the originzil 
               <br />
               understanding. That was my ﬁrst ground 
               <br />
               of objection; and I think, in the present 
               <br />
               instance, the Government are taking a still 
               <br />
               more extraordinary course. I do not know 
               <br />
               whether a case can be found in the records 
               <br />

               MR.. POWELL—I do not know if such a 
               <br />
               thing is usual, or if a precedent can be cited 
               <br />
               for it. All I can say is, that if a precedent 
               <br />
               can be cited, I regret extremely that such a 
               <br />
               course should be adopted on the present 
               <br />
               occasion. We are here engaged in the 
               <br />
               discussion of a great constitutional question, 
               <br />
               with regard to which the Administration 
               <br />
               have submitted to us the resolutions of the 
               <br />
               Conference—I do not say of self-constituted 
               <br />
               delegates, or that they acted without the 
               <br />
               sanction of the people—but certainly 
               <br />
               they have taken upon themselves a great 
               <br />
               responsibility, which I readily admit they 
               <br />
               have .well fulﬁlled, and I am quite prepared 
               <br />
               to endorse their course, in the framing of 
               <br />
               this scheme, from beginning to end. They 
               <br />
               ﬁrst of all adopt those resolutions at the 
               <br />
               Conference, and they then come down to 
               <br />
               this House and say: “ Accept them in their 
               <br />
               entirety, without amendment, without vari- 
               <br />
               ation, or the scheme falls to the ground.” 
               <br />
               That may be all very well. It may be all 
               <br />
               very well to deny the right of an appeal to 
               <br />
               to the people. It may be all very well for 
               <br />
               us as a Legislature to arrogate to ourselves 
               <br />
               the right to change our whole constitutional 
               <br />
               system. That may be all very well. But,
