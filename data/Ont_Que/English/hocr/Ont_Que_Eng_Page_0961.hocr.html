               extended by the House, I have to say that I 
               <br />
               do not rise to make a long speech, but that 
               <br />
               I shall content myself with giving a silent 
               <br />
               vote. However, before recording my vote 
               <br />
               upon the measure which is submitted to us, 
               <br />
               I wish to put a question to the Government. 
               <br />
               I acknowledge that if I conﬁned myself to 
               <br />
               consulting my own ideas, I should not put 
               <br />
               this question ; but I do so in order to meet 
               <br />
               the wishes of several of my friends, both 
               <br />
               within this House and beyond its precincts. 
               <br />
               Those friends have expressed alarm in rela- 
               <br />
               tion to one of the clauses of the resolutions, 
               <br />
               and have requested me to ask an explanation 
               <br />
               from the Hon. Attorney General for Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, as to the interpretation of that 
               <br />
               clause. I have therefore to ask him whether 
               <br />
               article 46 of the resolutions, which states 
               <br />
               that “ both the English and French lan- 
               <br />
               es may be employed in the General 
               <br />
               arliament and in its proceedings, and in 
               <br />
               the Local Legislature of Lower Canada,” is 
               <br />
               to be interpreted as placing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'</span> use of the 
               <br />
               two langua es on an equal footing in the 
               <br />
               Federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pagiament?</span> In stating the appre- 
               <br />
               hensions entertained by certain persons on 
               <br />
               this subject—and I consider that it is a 
               <br />
               mark of patriotism on their part, and that 
               <br />
               their apprehensions may be legitimate—I 
               <br />
               hope the Government will not impute to me 
               <br />
               any hostile intention nd will perceive that 
               <br />
               the course I adopt is in their interest, as it 
               <br />
               will give them an opportunity of dissipating 
               <br />
               the apprehensions in question (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               HON. Arrr. GEN. MACDONALD—I 
               <br />
               have very great pleasure in answering the 
               <br />
               question put to me by my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               the county of Quebec. I may state that the 
               <br />
               meaning of one of the resolutions adopted 
               <br />
               by the Conference is this, that the rights of 
               <br />
               the French-Canadian members as to the 
               <br />
               status of their language in the Federal 
               <br />
               Legislature shall be precisely the same as 
               <br />
               they now are in the present Legislature of 
               <br />
               Canada in every possible respect. I have 
               <br />
               still further pleasure in stating that the 
               <br />
               moment this was mentioned in Conference, 
               <br />
               the members of the deputation from the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces unanimously stated that it 
               <br />
               was right and just, and without one dis- 
               <br />
               sentient voice gave their adhesion to the 
               <br />
               reasonableness of the proposition that the 
               <br />
               status of the French language, as regards 
               <br />
               the procedure in Parliament, the printing of 
               <br />
               measures, and everything of that kind, should 
               <br />

               word in reply to the explanation given by 
               <br />
               the Hon. Attorney General West to the ques- 
               <br />
               tion put by the hon. member for the county

               <br />
               gard to the use of the French language. The 
               <br />
               Hon. Attorney General West stated that the 
               <br />
               intention of delegates at the Quebec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confer-</span> 
               <br />
               ence was to give the same guarantees for the 
               <br />
               use of the French language in the Federal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature,”</span> now existed under the present 
               <br />
               union. I conceive, air, that this is no guarantee 
               <br />
               whatsoever, for in the Union Act it was pro- 
               <br />
               vided that the English language alone should 
               <br />
               be used in Parliament, and the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage was entirely prohibited ; but this pro- 
               <br />
               vision was subsequently repealed by the 11th 
               <br />
               and 12th Victoria, and the matter left to the 
               <br />
               discretion of the Legislature. So that if, 
               <br />
               to-morrow, this Legislature choose to vote 
               <br />
               that no other but the English language 
               <br />
               should be used in our proceedings, it might 
               <br />
               do _so, and thereby forbid the use of the 
               <br />
               French language. There is, therefore, no 
               <br />
               guarantee for the continuance of the use of 
               <br />
               the language of the majority of the people 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada, but the will and the 
               <br />
               forbearance of the majority. And as the 
               <br />
               number of French members in the General 
               <br />
               Legislature, under the proposed Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, will be proportionately much smaller 
               <br />
               than it is in the present Legislature, this 
               <br />
               ought to make hon. members consider what 
               <br />
               little chance there is for the continued use 
               <br />
               of their language in the Federal Legislature. 
               <br />
               This is the only observation I have to make

               HON. Ar'rr. GEN. MACDONALD—I

               desire to say that I agree with my hon.

               friend that as it stands just now the majority

               <br />
               agreed at the Conference to embody the pro-

               vision in the Imperial Act. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               This was proposed by the Canadian Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, for fear an accident might arise 
               <br />
               subsequently, and it was assented to by the 
               <br />
               deputation from each province that the use 
               <br />
               of the French language should form one of 
               <br />
               the principles on upon which the Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation should be established, and that its use, 
               <br />
               as at present, should be guaranteed by the 
               <br />
               Imperial Act. (Hear hear.)
