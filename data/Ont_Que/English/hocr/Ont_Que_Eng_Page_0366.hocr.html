               attempting to predict the fate of our future

               <br />
               then begin to build with safety. As has 
               <br />
               been said by one of the great professors of 
               <br />
               political science : “ The wisdom of a states- 
               <br />
               man is the result of experience and not of 
               <br />
               theory.” I am by no means astonished, 
               <br />
               however, at the rcpugnance evinced by the 
               <br />
               advocates of Confederation to make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allusion</span>
