               the important interests committed to their

               charge. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKIR,</span> no one thing has 
               <br />
               done so much to attract emi ation to the

               United States as the great pub '0 works that 
               <br />
               have been constantly going on in that coun- 
               <br />
               try for the last ﬁve and twenty years. We 
               <br />
               hear much said about the superiority of 
               <br />
               their climate and the other advantages which, 
               <br />
               it is alleged, they enjoy in a greater degree 
               <br />
               than we do; but I can assure the House 
               <br />
               that those advant es have been greatly 
               <br />
               overestimated, and t at such considerations 
               <br />
               have had but little weight in the minds of 
               <br />
               emigrants, compared with the knowledge of 
               <br />
               the more important fact, that in that country 
               <br />
               the demand for labor was always greater 
               <br />
               than the supply, and that the emigrant ar- 
               <br />
               riving without a shilling in his pocket need 
               <br />
               be under no apprehension about the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of his family, knowing that he could 
               <br />
               always ﬁnd employment at rates of com-

               <br />
               in a few years not only to secure a home 
               <br />
               of his own, but to surround himself with 
               <br />

               <br />
               yond his reach in his own country. Sir, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               public work that should be undertaken is 
               <br />
               the improvement of the navigation of the 
               <br />

               power which would thus be secured along 
               <br />
               the main line of communication between 
               <br />
               the west and the commerce of Europe, it 
               <br />
               is not too much to expect that that power 
               <br />
               would attract the attention of men of 
               <br />
               capital and enterprise, and that a succession

               whole line, which would afford employment 
               <br />
               for a numerous, industrious and valuable 
               <br />
               population. And then, sir, there is that still 
               <br />
               more important and magniﬁcent project, the 
               <br />
               Atlantic and Paciﬁc Railway. All the best

               <br />
               British than through United States territory. 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, it would be impossible to 
               <br />
               over-estimate the advantages which any 
               <br />
               country must derive from bein possessed 
               <br />
               of a line of communication estined to 
               <br />
               become the highway from Europe to Asia. 
               <br />
               Sir, the acquisition of this advantage alone 
               <br />
               would be suﬂicient to justify us in advocating 
               <br />
               this measure ; but when we reﬂect upon the 
               <br />
               almost boundless extent of fertile agricul- 
               <br />
               tural territory through which this line must 
               <br />
               pass, the millions upon millions of human 
               <br />
               beings which that territory is capable of 
               <br />
               supporting—when we bear in mind that 
               <br />
               by means of this union we shall not only 
               <br />
               secure the control of a larger portion of the 
               <br />
               world than is now under the sway of 
               <br />
               any power on earth, but that, by the 
               <br />
               adoption of such a policy as I have 
               <br />
               suggested, our population may be more 
               <br />
               than doubled within ten years, and that 
               <br />
               though our liabilities will have increas- 
               <br />
               ed, those liabilities will fall upon the 
               <br />
               shoulders of so greatly augmented a popu- 
               <br />
               lation, that the burden to be borne by each 
               <br />
               individual will be more likely to be deminish- 
               <br />
               ed than increased—when we remember, sir, 
               <br />
               that it will be in our power so to shape the 
               <br />
