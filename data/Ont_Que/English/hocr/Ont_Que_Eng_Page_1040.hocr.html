               <br />
               did require some courage to undertake to vote 
               <br />
               against the last amendment—a resolution 
               <br />
               which seems fair enough on the face of it. 
               <br />
               At ﬁrst I was almost disposed to accept it, 
               <br />
               and it was not until I discovered its real 
               <br />
               bearing that I determined to vote against it. 
               <br />
               Honorable gentlemen will remember that, 
               <br />
               before the adoption of the resolutions, I was 
               <br />
               desirous that an appeal should be had to the 
               <br />
               people prior to the consummation of the vast 
               <br />
               scheme which they announce ; and with that 
               <br />
               object in view, my vote is recorded against 
               <br />
               your ruling, Mr. SPEAKER, on the appeal from 
               <br />
               your decision at the time an amendment was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁ‘ered</span> prior to their passage. This House 
               <br />
               having sustained you in the opinion you pro- 
               <br />
               nounced, nothing was then left for me, as one 
               <br />
               of the representatives of the peeplc, but to 
               <br />
               decide whether we should adopt the policy of 
               <br />
               Confederation or ignore it. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The latter I was not disposed to do, and the 
               <br />
               Government received my support on the ﬁnal 
               <br />
               vote taken, declaring a union of the British 
               <br />
               American Provinces to be advisable. These 
               <br />
               resolutions having been passed, we are now 
               <br />
               called upon to pass an Address to Her Ma- 
               <br />
               jesty founded upon them. To this Address, 
               <br />
               and not to the resolutions, the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Peel offered his amendment, and to 
               <br />
               support that would have been the ignoring of 
               <br />
               my former vote, the declaring an Address 
               <br />
               different from the very resolutions upon which 
               <br />
               that Address is to be founded, the sacriﬁcing 
               <br />
               of a great political scheme for the support of 
               <br />
               what might unexplained be considered a 
               <br />
               popular and legitimate motion, but which was 
               <br />
               in fact a motion subversive of the resolutions, 
               <br />
               and valueless, save as a means unfairly to be 
               <br />
               used as a weapon on a hustings. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               If the honorable member for Peel desired this

               amendment, and honorable members of this

               House, as one conversant with its rules and 
               <br />
               its usages, submit it for our consideration 
               <br />
               prior to the Honorable Attorney General 
               <br />
               moving the “previous question,” and at a 
               <br />
               time when, by your ruling, Mr. SPEAKER, it 
               <br />
               would have been admissible. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Had he done so then, members could have 
               <br />
               voted upon the merits of the amendment. N ow

               about the present Coalition, it was necessary 
               <br />
               that some alteration and some amendment

               have taken an interest in public affairs, I have

               always felt disposed to support, as tending to

               the declaration we made by our votes a few

               minutes ago, namely, that these resolutions

               not now prepared to submit to any alterations, 
               <br />

               Address, founded upon them, would virtually 
               <br />

               chaos from which we have just emerged, I
