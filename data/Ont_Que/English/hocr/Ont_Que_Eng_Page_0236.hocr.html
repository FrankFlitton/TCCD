               to the American mode of revising their 
               <br />
               constitutions. The honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               very correctly stated the manner in which 
               <br />
               the Federal Constitution may be amend- 
               <br />

               in which state constitutions may be revised.

               <br />
               the State of New York. The modus operandi 
               <br />
               on that occasion was as follows :—-An act was 
               <br />
               in the State Legislature authorizing 
               <br />

               Toronto convention and the Lower Canadian

               <br />
               which he took the other day, and which is 
               <br />
               precisely as I stated it. He thinks it would 
               <br />
               have been to the public advantage if this 
               <br />
               question had been taken up and discussed 
               <br />
               by a party. In this, in my judgment, he is 
               <br />
               entirely wrong; and I say he can ﬁnd no in-

               <br />
