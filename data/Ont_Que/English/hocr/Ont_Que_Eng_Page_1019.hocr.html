               with that righteous indignation which he

               narrowly to it. (Hear, hear.) The hon.

               <br />
               guardian of my political reputation. He

               has, on two or three occasions, warned me

               that of a practical man—that of one who 
               <br />
               desired merely to keep oﬂiee and become 
               <br />
               famous for political aeuteness—yet it would 
               <br />
               never secure for me the fame of being a

               to conﬁne myself to practical things—to the

               securing of such practical measures as the 
               <br />

               in a legislative union, but always utopian 
               <br />
               and never practical. I am satisﬁed to

               of his little, numerous, by the by speeches, 
               <br />
               that in taking the course I have done 
               <br />
               on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question—that</span> of advocating a

               Federal instead of a Legislative union— 
               <br />
               I violated all the principles of my former 
               <br />
               life having a bearing on this subject. 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, it is quite true that after a 
               <br />
               careful examination of the Constitution of 
               <br />
               the United States, in connection with its 
               <br />
               practical working, and the civil war that has 
               <br />
               grown out of it, I saw many weaknesses in 
               <br />
               connection with the Feueral system, as 
               <br />
               operated in that country, and I was as 
               <br />
               desirous as any man could be in taking part 
               <br />
               in the Conference relating to union between 
               <br />
               the Provinces of British North America, 
               <br />
               that as much as the legislative form of 
               <br />
               government as possible, and as few of the 
               <br />
               weaknesses which experience had shown to 
               <br />
               exist in the American Constitution, should 
               <br />
               be incorporated in ours. [ do not like

               lamentable state of things which they now

               it was, perhaps, unavoidable from the state of the 
               <br />

               <br />
