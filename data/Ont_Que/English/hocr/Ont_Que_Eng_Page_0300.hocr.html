               tlemen speak of the imports from the Mari- 
               <br />
               time Provinces. But take the import of 
               <br />
               coal from Nova Scotia, and we ﬁnd that in 
               <br />
               1863, its whole value amounted to 867,000. 
               <br />
               Then they refer to the ﬁsh trade. But why 
               <br />
               need we go there for ﬁsh, when in our own 
               <br />
               waters we can have for the catching as ﬁne 
               <br />
               ﬁsh as the world produces ? But Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion will give us no privileges over the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ùhcries</span> which w.. do not at present enjoy. 
               <br />
               Canadian ﬁshermen can as well go, and have 
               <br />
               as much the right to go, and ﬁsh in the 
               <br />
               waters below before as after Confederation. 
               <br />
               We will continue to go there if we desire it, 
               <br />
               not because we are members of the Confede- 
               <br />
               racy, but because we are British subjects. 
               <br />
               But I was going to speak of the trade of 
               <br />
               these countries. We derive new little or no 
               <br />
               duty from the trade of the Lower Provinces, 
               <br />
               atthe same time much of the revenues of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces is derived from exports 
               <br />
               from those provinces to each other, all of 
               <br />
               which will be lost to the General Government, 
               <br />
               as the Confederation will only be entitled to 
               <br />
               collect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duties</span> on goods imported from foreign 
               <br />
               countries. We are told, too, that our tariff <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> 
               <br />
               to be greatly reduced under Confederation. 
               <br />
               I am sorry to hear that statement, because 
               <br />
               itis impossible that it can be correct, and 
               <br />
               there is too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,much</span> reason to fear that it was 
               <br />
               done with a view of inﬂuencing legislation 
               <br />
               elsewhere, by holding out the hope in N ew- 
               <br />
               foundland and in the other provinces, that 
               <br />
               if they joined us, the tariff would be less 
               <br />
               burdensome than it is at present. But if 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tarif</span> is reduced, the people of Canada 
               <br />
               may rest assured that they will have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,000,000</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">85,000,000</span> to raise in some 
               <br />
               other way; so that if you take it oﬁ' the 
               <br />
               tariﬂ', you must put it on the land. I wish 
               <br />
               now, however, to speak of the unfair appor- 
               <br />
               tionment of the debt. I have always taken 
               <br />
               the ground that revenue is the true gauge 
               <br />
               by which you can measure a nation’s abi- 
               <br />
               lity to pay debt. Well, taking the tables of 
               <br />
               the Finance Minister, we ﬁnd that New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, with a revenue of 81,000.000, 
               <br />
               goes into the Confederation with a debt of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">87,000,000,</span> while Canada, with arevenue of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$11,500,000,</span> is only entitled to go into the 
               <br />
               Confederation with a debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$62,500,000.</span> 
               <br />
               Is this fair <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Y—is</span> it right ?—is it honest? 
               <br />
               Take the revenue as the basis of ability 
               <br />
               to pay—and it is the only true basis—and 
               <br />
               instead of Canada going into the Con- 
               <br />
               federation with a debt only 862,500,000, 
               <br />
