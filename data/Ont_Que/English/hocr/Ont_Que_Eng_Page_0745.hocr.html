               HON. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD—No ; 
               <br />
               we told the House that we had the previous 
               <br />
               sanction of Her Majesty and of Her Majesty’s 
               <br />
               representative to our meeting. The Confer- 
               <br />
               ence met and sat under this authority, and 
               <br />
               we worked out a scheme for the Constitution 
               <br />
               of the provinces. That scheme may be a 
               <br />
               good or it may be a bad one; but whether it 
               <br />
               be good or bad, we have a right to ask this 
               <br />
               House to approve or disapprove of it, to accept 
               <br />
               or reject it. We had the sanction of Her 
               <br />
               Majesty and the Imperial Government to our 
               <br />
               meeting—because this House knows that the 
               <br />
               union of these colonies is a matter of great 
               <br />
               Im 'al as well as of great local interest— 
               <br />
               an under that sanction we have worked out 
               <br />
               a Constitution and made a bargain with the 
               <br />
               other provinces. We have pledged ourselves 
               <br />
               as a Government to come down to the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Parliament and aay—-—“ Here is a Con- 
               <br />
               stitution which we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agreSd</span> upon for the 
               <br />
               future government of these provinces. We 
               <br />
               have agreed to submit it to this House, just 
               <br />
               as the governments of the other provinces 
               <br />
               have agreed to submit it to their respective 
               <br />
               legislatures. We have a right to ask the 
               <br />
               members of this House whether in their judg— 
               <br />
               ment it is a scheme that, with all the faults 
               <br />
               and imperfections it may have, ought to be 
               <br />
               entered into by the Parliament of this coun- 
               <br />
               try. We exercise this right, and ask you to 
               <br />
               declare by your votes, yes or no, whether we 
               <br />
               were right in framing this measure, and 
               <br />
               whether it is such an one as ought to be 
               <br />
               adopted by this House.” (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear</span> .) This, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, is the position of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment; and what though amendments should 
               <br />
               be carried—what though the amendment of 
               <br />
               which the honorable member for North On- 
               <br />
               tario has given notice should succeed, and the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> should declare in favor of a Legislative 
               <br />
               Instead of a Federal union (supposing the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman did present and carry 
               <br />
               such a motion)—-what good could it possibly 
               <br />
               do ? The contract that we entered into with 
               <br />
               the other provinces would be broken; this 
               <br />
               Legislature would be violating the solemn 
               <br />
               engagement under which we are to the other 
               <br />
               colonies, and we would have a Constitution 
               <br />
               drawn up which none of the other provinces 
               <br />
               would adopt. We know that they would 
               <br />
               reject it-—we know that Lower Canada would 
               <br />
               go as one man against it. (Hear, hear.)
