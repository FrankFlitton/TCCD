               <br />
               let us remember the year 1775. These Canadians, 
               <br />
               who spoke nothing but French, showed their at- 
               <br />
               tachment to their sovereign in a manner which 
               <br />
               admitted of no doubt being cast upon it. They 
               <br />
               assisted in the defence of the province. This 
               <br />
               city, these walls, this very House in which I have 
               <br />
               the honor to raise my voice, were, in part, saved 
               <br />
               by their zeal and their courage. We saw them 
               <br />
               units with the faithful subjects of His Majesty 
               <br />
               and repulse the attacks made by peOple who 
               <br />
               spoke very good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English,</span> Upon this town. It is 
               <br />
               not uniformity of language, therefore, Mr.

               <br />
               of this, let us glance at France at this moment 
               <br />
               and at all the kingdoms of Europe. No, I re-

               <br />
               this our people are at present perfectly convinced.

               Mr. SPEAKER, I was quoting a passage from

               M. DE Lommmsn’s speech on the sub- 
               <br />
               ject of the opposition offered to the publica- 
               <br />
               tion of the proceedings of the House of As- 
               <br />
               sembly in 1791 in French, in order to demon- 
               <br />
               strate the spirit of exclusiveness which animat- 
               <br />
               ed the English element from the commence- 
               <br />
               ment of our parliamentary system, notwith- 
               <br />
               standing the insigniﬁcant minority inwhich 
               <br />
               they were at the time. But that barefsced 
               <br />
               attempt was unsuccessful, and the amendment 
               <br />
               proposed, having for its object the pros- 
               <br />
               cription of the French language, was refused 
               <br />
               by two-thirds of the House. It was ﬁnally 
               <br />
               resolved that the minutes of the proceedings 
               <br />
               of the House should be in both languages, and 
               <br />
               that the English or the French version should 
               <br />
               be the text of the Legislative acts according 
               <br />
               as they related to the English or the French 
               <br />
               laws. Thus opposition to the French element 
               <br />
               manifested itself from the commencement of 
               <br />
               our parliamentary system in this country, by 
               <br />

               <br />
               ance, the use of that language has always been
