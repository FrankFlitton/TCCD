               He had looked at it in this wa . The time 
               <br />
               had been when the people of pper Canada 
               <br />
               imagined that the Lower Canadians were afraid

               There was one element, however, which always 
               <br />
               entered largely into the discussion of all our na— 
               <br />
               tional questions, and that was that the French 
               <br />
               peOple were a pe0ple entirely diﬂ‘erent from our- 
               <br />
               selves in origin, and largely in feeling. We all 
               <br />
               had a certain pride in our native country, and 
               <br />
               gloried in the deeds of our ancestors. The French 
               <br />
               people had that feelin uite as strongly as any 
               <br />

               <br />
               down. He (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mammals)</span> felt for one that 
               <br />
               more repmentation by opulation, under such

               than Lower Canada, it would be an easy thing 
               <br />
               for the ﬁfty or ﬁfty-ﬁve members representing 
               <br />
               French constituencies to unite with a minority

               honorable, to attempt to do so. When

               <br />
               learn that they have any such fear. The 
               <br />
               Attoney General East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER), 
               <br />
               in his speech, a few evenings ago, adverted 
               <br />
               to the position taken by the French inhabi- 
               <br />
               tants of Lower Canada at the time of the 
               <br />
               French revolution, and claimed credit for 
               <br />
               them, because they remained lo al to the 
               <br />
               British Crown, when all the otier North 
               <br />
               American Colonies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">threw_oﬁ</span> the British 
               <br />
               sway. The honorable gentleman’s claim 
               <br />
               was perfectly just. But I believe that they 
               <br />
               were actuated by another feeling beyond the 
               <br />
               feeling of loyalty—that they felt their only 
               <br />
               safeguard as a distinct peeple— the only 
               <br />
               way to preserve their nationality, was to 
               <br />
               remain attached to Great Britain. Their 
               <br />
               existence for twenty years as a French colony 
               <br />
               under British rule, was not perhaps sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               to give that attachment which they have 
               <br />
               now to the British Government. But it 
               <br />
               was perfectly clear to them that, if they 
               <br />
               entered the American Union, they would be 
               <br />
               absorbed and lost, just as the French colony 
               <br />
               of Louisiana has since been. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I have been charged, and others with me, 
               <br />
               who have held the same political views,with 
               <br />
               deserting our party, because we have ceased 
               <br />
               to act with the gentlemen from Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada with whom we formerly acted. I think 
               <br />
               there is no fair ground for such a charge. 
               <br />
               For what, after all, is party ? It is but an 
               <br />
               association of individuals holding opinions 
               <br />
               in common on some grounds of public policy, 
               <br />
               or some measures which they may believe 
               <br />
               to be necessary for the conduct of the 
               <br />
               government of the country to which they 
               <br />
               belong. Looking at the matter in that light, 
               <br />
               there is no part ot our party politics in the 
               <br />
               west, that we have insisted upon so strongly 
               <br />
               as that which concerns the representation of 
               <br />
               the people in Parliament. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span>
