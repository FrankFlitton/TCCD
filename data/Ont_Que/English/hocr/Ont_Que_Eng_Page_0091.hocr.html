               that the sober sense of the House willcondemn

               <br />
               the hon. member for Niagara, but when falling 
               <br />
               from any other hon. member. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The hon. member commenced his attacks upon 
               <br />
               the public men of the provinces by quoting 
               <br />
               from a s eech of Mr. LYNCH, recently deliv- 
               <br />
               ered at alifax, and did his best to turn it 
               <br />
               into ridicule, aswell as to excite contemptuous 
               <br />
               laughter at the expense of that gentleman. 
               <br />
               Now the statements Mr. LYNCH made are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts,</span> not foolish inventions, as the hon. mem-

               <br />
               the book, and relied for his information upon 
               <br />
               the oﬁicial report of one of our public depart- 
               <br />
               ments, and if the hon. member will turn to 
               <br />

               while that of the latter increased 48 per cent.,
