               son, without giving him three distinct 
               <br />
               warnings. Well, the honorable gentleman in 
               <br />
               question—I dare say he was honorable, and 
               <br />
               a member of some House,—he, like all the 
               <br />
               rest of us expected to outlive everybody. 
               <br />
               But in process of years he fell lame, then 
               <br />
               afterwards, he became deaf, and at last he 
               <br />
               grew blind: then Death’s hour had come 
               <br />
               and in s ite of some admirable pleading on 
               <br />
               behalf 0 the defendant in the case, he had 
               <br />
               his “ three warnings” like a Parisian editor, 
               <br />
               his case was closed, his form was locked up, 
               <br />
               and his impression was struck <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the face of 
               <br />
               the earth, and Death claimed and had his 
               <br />
               own. (Laughter.) Now, sir, we have had 
               <br />
               three warnings, and if we do not take heed 
               <br />
               of them and prepare for the possible future 
               <br />
               condition into which we may be plunged, 
               <br />
               woe to us if we are found unprepared when 
               <br />
               the hour of destiny strikes! (Cheers.) 
               <br />
               We have submitted a plan preparing us 
               <br />
               for such a contingency, and the Attorneys 
               <br />
               General East and West have analysed its 
               <br />
               constitutional character, while the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance and the President of the Council 
               <br />
               have treated it in its ﬁnancial aspects. There 
               <br />
               are some objections taken to the plan, I 
               <br />
               understand, but I do not believe that any 
               <br />
               member will get up in this House, and dc- 
               <br />
               clare that he is an anti-unionist, that he is 
               <br />
               opposed to all union, and that he considers 
               <br />
               union unnecessary and inexpedient. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I do not know that there is one man 
               <br />
               out of the one hundred and thirty who com- 
               <br />
               pose this House, in view of the circumstances 
               <br />
               in which we are placed, who will declare 
               <br />
               that he is Opposed to any sort of union with 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces. One may say that he 
               <br />
               does not like this or the other clause—that 
               <br />
               he does not like this or that feature of the 
               <br />
               proposed scheme; but still all admit that 
               <br />
               union of some kind would increase our pro- 
               <br />
               tection and be a source of strength. Some 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, while admitting that we 
               <br />
               have entered, within the present decade, on 
               <br />
               a period of political transition, have contend- 
               <br />
               ed that we might have bridged the abyss 
               <br />
               with that Prussian pontoon, called a Zoll- 
               <br />
               verein. But if any one for a moment will 
               <br />
               remember that the trade of the whole front 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick and N ova Scotia gravi- 
               <br />
               tates at present along-shore to Portland and 
               <br />
               Boston, while the trade of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               west of Kingston, has long gravitated across 
               <br />
               the lakes to New York, he will see, I think, 
               <br />
               that a mere Zollverein treaty without a 
               <br />
               strong political end to serve, and some poli— 
               <br />
               tical power at its back, would be, in our new

               circumstances, merely waste per. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The charge that we ave not gone 
               <br />
               far enough—that we have not struck out 
               <br />
               boldly for a consolidated union, instead of a 
               <br />
               union with reserved local jurisdictions, is 
               <br />
               another charge which deserves some notice. 
               <br />
               To this I answer that, if we had had, as was 
               <br />
               proposed, an Intercolonial Railway twenty 
               <br />
               years ago, we might by this time have been, 
               <br />
               perhaps, and only perhaps, in a condition to 
               <br />
               unite into one consolidated Government; 
               <br />
               but certain politicians and capitalists having 
               <br />
               defeated that project twenty years ago, 
               <br />
               special interests took the place great general 
               <br />
               interests might by this time have occupied ; 
               <br />
               vested rights and local ambitions arose and 
               <br />
               were recognized; and all these had to be 
               <br />
               admitted as existing in a pretty advanced 
               <br />
               stage of development, when our Conferences 
               <br />
               were called together. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               lesson to be learned from this squandering 
               <br />
               of quarter centuries by British Americans is 
               <br />
               this, that if we lose the present propitious 
               <br />
               opportunity, we may ﬁnd it as hard a few 
               <br />
               years hence to get an audience, even for any 
               <br />
               kind of union (except American union) as 
               <br />
               we should have found it to get a hearing 
               <br />
               last year for a Legislative union, from the 
               <br />
               long period of estrangement and non-inter- 
               <br />
               course which had existed between these 
               <br />
               rovinces, and the special interests which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> grown up in the meantime in each of 
               <br />
               them. (Cheers.) Another motive to union, 
               <br />
               or rather a phase of the last motive spoken 
               <br />
               of, is this, that the policy of our neighbors 
               <br />
               to the south of us has always been aggressive. 
               <br />
               There has always been a desire amongst 
               <br />
               them for the acquisition of new territory, 
               <br />
               and the inexorable law of democratic exist- 
               <br />
               encc seems to be its absorption. They 
               <br />
               coveted Florida, and seized it; they coveted 
               <br />
               Louisiana, and purchased it; they coveted 
               <br />
               Texas, and stole it; and then they picked 
               <br />
               a quarrel with Mexico, which ended by their 
               <br />
               getting California. (Hear, hear.) They 
               <br />
               sometimes pretend to despise these colonies 
               <br />
               as prizes beneath their ambition; but had 
               <br />
               we not had the strong arm of England over 
               <br />
               us, we should not now have had a separate 
               <br />
               existence. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> The acquisition of 
               <br />
               Canada was the ﬁrst ambition of the Ameri- 
               <br />
               can Confederacy, and never ceased to be so, 
               <br />
               when her troops were a handful and her 
               <br />
               navy scarce a squadron. Is it likely to be 
               <br />
               stopped now, when she counts her guns

               <br />
               dreds of thousands? On this motive, a
