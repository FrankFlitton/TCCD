               is, that it is peri'ectly clear that the House will 
               <br />
               not be called upon to pronounce upon the 
               <br />

               <br />
               into the resolutions on which we are now 
               <br />
               called upon to vote. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               Hon. Atty. Gen. East cannot say that the 
               <br />
               Government will submit to the House the 
               <br />
               result of the advice which they may receive 
               <br />
               from the Imperial Government. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear. All that we can understand from 
               <br />
               the overnment is, that they will press the 
               <br />
               adoption (f the measure by this House, 
               <br />
               and that, if they can pass it, they will 
               <br />
               ask the Imperial Government to give us a 
               <br />
               Constitution based on these resolutions, and 
               <br />
               that this Constitution will be imposed on 
               <br />
               the country without either the House or 
               <br />
               the people being called upon to ratify it, 
               <br />
               even although it be altogether diﬂ'erent from 
               <br />
               the resolutions now submitted to us. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) As in 1856 we saw the clause of 
               <br />
               the Union Act, which required the concurrence 
               <br />
               of two-thirds of the members of the House to 
               <br />
               authorize a change in the basis of the repre-

               sentation, repealed without any application on 
               <br />
               our part for its repeal, so we shall perhaps see 
               <br />
               in this new Constitution which is to be given 
               <br />
               to us, that the principle of Confederation 
               <br />
               will have been sacriﬁced in order that a legisla-
