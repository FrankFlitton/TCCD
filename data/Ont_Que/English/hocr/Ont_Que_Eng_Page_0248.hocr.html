               HON. Mn. MOORE—It will be conceded 
               <br />
               that the question of the veto power was very 
               <br />
               ably discussed, at one time, in the United 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Stats</span> Congress, and that discussion led to a 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcation of the veto power in the Consti- 
               <br />
               tution of the United States, so that now any 
               <br />
               bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pamd</span> by both Houses may be vetoed by 
               <br />
               the President within ten days thereafter, by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asigning</span> reasons for doing so. Both Houses 
               <br />
               may then, however, again take up the measure, 
               <br />
               and if they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pas</span> it by a two-third vote, it 
               <br />
               becomes the law of the land, independent of 
               <br />
               the President's will. Now, I would have the 
               <br />
               veto power applied in a similar way in our 
               <br />
               new Constitution. Exercising it in an arbi- 
               <br />
               trary manner, as the Federal power is privileged 
               <br />
               to do, it must, from the very nature of things, 
               <br />
               create dissatisfaction and diﬂiculty between 
               <br />
               the two governments. Again, honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, it is said that by this union we are to 
               <br />
               strengthen our defensive capacity. I really 
               <br />
               cannot see the force of this argument, unless 
               <br />
               it were poœible that in uniting with the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces their pulation was to be brought 
               <br />
               nearer to us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I?</span> nature were to make the 
               <br />
               necessary effort and move their territory up 
               <br />
               alongside of us, and thus make acompact mass 
               <br />
               of people, I would at once agree that it would 
               <br />
               strengthen us in a military point of view. But 
               <br />
               the fact is, the union will give an extension of 
               <br />
               territory far greater in proportion to the num- 
               <br />
               bers of the population than now exists in 
               <br />
               Canada. From that circumstance, I argue 
               <br />
               that it will weaken instead of strengthen us. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Unfortunately, if awar should 
               <br />
               take place between the United States and 
               <br />
               Great Britain, the Lower Provinces have a 
               <br />
               thousand miles of sea coast open to attack, 
               <br />
               and I apprehend they would be very 'ealous 
               <br />
               about having their militiamen sent to anada 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> our defence from border incursions. And 
               <br />
               It would be very natural for them to desire 
               <br />
               that all their own force should be kept at home 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               for their protection; and the same with regard 
               <br />
               to Canada. If a considerable portion of the 
               <br />
               militia of Canada were ordered to proceed to 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces, it would most certainly 
               <br />
               weaken and cause dissatisfaction in Can- 
               <br />
               ada. But, setting that aside, does it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increœe</span> 
               <br />
               our numbers and our means of defence? Have 
               <br />
               we not the same territory exposed ? We shall 
               <br />
               have no additional men by the union for the 
               <br />
               defence of Canada. Perhaps, after the union 
               <br />
               takes place, emigration will ﬂow into the 
               <br />
               country, but I do not know that there would be 
               <br />
               any very great inducement, after a union, 
               <br />
               above the inducements that now exist. It

               appears to me that that question and fact

               <br />
               to point out some of the objections to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               me. We have all a common interest in this

               my cheerful support. But I do wish to have 
               <br />
               some things respecting it made more clear to 
               <br />
               my comprehension than they are at present, 
               <br />
               and it is for these reasons that I have taken

               up the time of the House in making these

               the honorable member for Wellington. When 
               <br />
               the Confederation of the provinces was ﬁrst 
               <br />
               proposed, 1, although favorable to the princi- 
               <br />
               ple of the scheme, entertained grave doubts 
               <br />
               as to whether, if carried, it would be of any 
               <br />
               real beneﬁt to that section of the country in 
               <br />
               which I am more immediately interested. 
               <br />
               Much, however, depended upon the details, 
               <br />
               and after giving them a good deal of consid- 
               <br />
               eration, I have been unable to come to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the scheme, as a whole, will 
               <br />
               be a remedy for all the evils complained of

               (Hear, hear.) This, I believe will go far to 
               <br />
               neutralize some of the advantages which 
               <br />
               would have resulted from the scheme had the 
               <br />
