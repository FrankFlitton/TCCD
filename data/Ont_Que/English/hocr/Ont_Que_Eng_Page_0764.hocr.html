               entire change in the Constitution of this

               country, I regard as of greater importance 
               <br />
               than any question that has been debated 
               <br />
               before this House since the union. So 
               <br />
               sweeping a change seldom takes place except 
               <br />
               after war or insurrection. (Hear, hear.)

               season of peace and quietness, and at no

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">poeui.</span> I believe this scheme to have been 
               <br />
               undertaken mainly because the leaders of 
               <br />
               theme political parties saw that they had 
               <br />
               no hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">left</span> of continuing in oﬁce on the

               while they fought against each other. I 
               <br />
               have heard it asserted in this House and

               the gravity of the occasion required that 
               <br />
               men of all parties should unite to ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               solution of existing difﬁculties. I hope this 
               <br />
               was not a mere pretence, put forward by 
               <br />
               men in oﬁce to continue in oﬁce, and by men 
               <br />
               out of oﬂice to get into oﬁce. “It is a fact 
               <br />
               well known, that so long as either party 
               <br />
               could govern without the assistance of the 
               <br />
               other, no advance was made toward a union 
               <br />
               between the leaders. The changing of two 
               <br />
               or three votes in this House would have 
               <br />
               indeﬁnitely postponed the scheme now under 
               <br />
               consideration. That there was no necessity 
               <br />
               occasioned by a dead-lock in carrying on the 
               <br />
               Government must be apparent, when we con-

               <br />
               ance, would have avoided the dead-lock. 
               <br />
               Surely, if parties could unite as they did in 
               <br />
               June last, they could have united to prevent

               tween the Cauadas took place in 1840; 
               <br />
               for some time afterwards each section was 
               <br />
               represented in the united Legislature by 
               <br />
               forty-two members. Upper Canada at the 
               <br />
               time of the union had a population of 
               <br />
               486,000, and Lower Canada 661,000. After 
               <br />
               the union took place, from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18”:</span> to 1848, 
               <br />
               the majority of the Government was a very 
               <br />
               narrow one. The Government was kept in 
               <br />
               power by two or three votes; yet during 
               <br />
               these years there was not a suggestion in 
               <br />
               favor of a change of Constitution for the 
               <br />
               purpose of increasing the majority. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The same number of members con- 
               <br />
               tinued to represent each section of the 
               <br />
               province until <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1854,</span> when the number from 
               <br />
               each section was increased to sixty-ﬁve, and 
               <br />
               has continued so to the present time. From 
               <br />
               the year 185-1 until the present time, there 
               <br />
               has existed among the people of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada a strong agitation in favor of repre- 
               <br />
               sentation according to pepulation. That 
               <br />
               principle was agitated by the Reform party 
               <br />
               at every election. It was the principal 
               <br />
               political topic, and members were required 
               <br />
               to pledge themselves to maintain it under 
               <br />
               all circumstances upon the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House. And not only was the Reform party 
               <br />
               committed to that principle, but many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Con-</span> 
               <br />
               servatives were forced to declare themselves 
               <br />
               in favor of it. In 1858 some of the meni- 
               <br />
               bers of the Government sent an ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               letter to England, in which the diﬁculties 
               <br />
               of the country were graphically referred to, 
               <br />
               and the agitation was characterized as bein

               <br />
               1859, and in November of the same year 
               <br />
               the Toronto Convention met, where the 
               <br />
               Reform party was represented by about 570 
               <br />

               <br />
               Upper Canada. At that meeting t e griev-

               nnces of which Upper Canada complained

               men fully acquainted with them, and capable 
               <br />
               of setting them forth. Although the project
