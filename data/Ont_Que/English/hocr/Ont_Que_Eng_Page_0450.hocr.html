               It is represented to be very much of the 
               <br />
               nature of the country through which the 
               <br />
               Great Western runs westward of Hamilton 
               <br />
               over a great portion of the line. The best 
               <br />
               portion of the line is equal to the worst por- 
               <br />
               tions of the Great Western. Even at the cost 
               <br />
               of £7,000 per mile the expense of constructing 
               <br />
               the entire road would be a little over ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               millions of dollars. The proportion of that 
               <br />
               payable by Canada would be about nine mil- 
               <br />
               lions. I think it is extremely probable that 
               <br />
               when we obtain the report of the engineers 
               <br />
               sent out by our Government, it will be found 
               <br />
               that a very large portion can be constructed 
               <br />
               for much less than £7,000 per mile. But, 
               <br />
               whatever the sum may amount to, it is per- 
               <br />
               fectly clear that without the road there can 
               <br />
               be no union of the provinces. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It is equally clear that on that road there is a 
               <br />
               very large proportion of the country that is 
               <br />
               exceedingly desirable for settlement, and that 
               <br />
               only awaits the opening up of some means of 
               <br />
               communication with the markets. Major 
               <br />
               ROBINSON reports that on one portion of it— 
               <br />
               and I confess that I was not aware of the fact 
               <br />
               until I examined the report more closely to- 
               <br />
               day—that there is _a tract of country along 
               <br />
               the New Brunswick portion of the line not 
               <br />
               excelled for timber or land in any part of the 
               <br />
               world that he ever saw. (Hear, hear.) I do 
               <br />
               not propose taking up the time of the House 
               <br />
               by reading from this valuable report, but 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimates</span> are given showin the amount of 
               <br />
               population that these districts will support 
               <br />
               when properly settled. He shows that the 
               <br />
               country, if the road is once carried through, 
               <br />
               will be settled very rapidly. I do not, how- 
               <br />
               ever, expect that that road <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> possibly pay 
               <br />
               as a commercial enterprise for a long time to 
               <br />
               come, and I do not desire to deceive myself 
               <br />
               or deceive any other person on that point. 
               <br />
               That it will be of importance more as a mili- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tary</span> work than for any other purpose, nobody 
               <br />
               can deny. In 1862, when I opposed the pro- 
               <br />
               position to construct the road, then felt that 
               <br />
               this was an argument that could fairly be used 
               <br />
               in its favor. Military authorities are still 
               <br />
               unanimously of opinion that its construction 
               <br />
               would be of great importance as a means of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection</span> in case of hostilities. The most 
               <br />
               important reason, however, why it should be 
               <br />
               constructed, in addition to the military reason, 
               <br />
               is, that without its construction there can be 
               <br />
               no union of the provinces, and without a 
               <br />
               Federal union of the provinces we cannot hope 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> obtain a settlement of our sectional diﬂicul— 
               <br />
               ties. The one is dependent upon the other, 
               <br />

               cessarily leads us to engage in the construction 
               <br />
               of that road. (Hear, hear.) I do not propose 
               <br />
               to-night to indulge much in ﬁgures relative to 
               <br />
               what our condition will be, ﬁnancially, after 
               <br />
               this measure iscarried out; but the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga made some statements 
               <br />
               that I can scarcely allow to pass. He was 
               <br />
               understood to say that Lower Canada came 
               <br />
               into the union without any debt, and was to 
               <br />
               go out with thirty millions of dollars of debt, 
               <br />
               while only some twelve millions of dollars were 
               <br />
               expended in that section of the province. 
               <br />
               Now, sir, there has been spent al ther on 
               <br />
               the canals of Canada $20,813,304.03; on 
               <br />
               roads and bridges in Canada West, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$562,866,</span> 
               <br />
               and on roads and bridges in Canada East, 
               <br />
               $1,163,829.34; on the government buildings 
               <br />
               at Ottawa there have already been paid over 
               <br />
               $1,513,412.56; and on railroads there have 
               <br />
               been spent altogether $29,910,825J6, or 
               <br />
               altogether about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,964,236.79.</span> Now, I 
               <br />
               think that one-half of this enormous amount 
               <br />
               is fairly chargeable to Lower Canada. One- 
               <br />
               half or a little more than that of the works 
               <br />
               on which the money was spent are situated in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, and, if we include the Victoria 
               <br />
               Brid , it is considerably more than one-half. 
               <br />
               Besi es these, however, there are quite a num- 
               <br />
               ber of other items which I do not take into 
               <br />
               account. There is the Quebec Fire Loan, 
               <br />
               and a deﬁciency in a number of special funds 
               <br />
               that I will not take any notice of at this 
               <br />
               time. Then take it from another point of 
               <br />
               view. From areturn made to Parliament, we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the entire cost of improving the 
               <br />
               navigation in Upper Canada, including the 
               <br />
               cost of light-houses, canals, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dec.,</span> altogether 
               <br />
               amounted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$7,022,665.61</span> ; that the revenue 
               <br />
               derived from Upper Canada harbors and 
               <br />
               canals has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,887,291.73</span> ; leaving a 
               <br />
               balance against Upper Canada of 82,145,- 
               <br />
               373.88. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Lower</span> Canada, during the same 
               <br />
               period, the expenditure has been' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34,484,-</span> 
               <br />
               566.52, while there was a revenue of 
               <br />
               87 08,086.80, leaving a balance against Lower 
               <br />
               Canada of $4,176,479.72. I give these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures simply to prove that the position taken 
               <br />
               by the honorable member for Hochelaga was 
               <br />
               entirely incorrect; but it would be superﬂuous 
               <br />
               to do that if I were to allude to one item 
               <br />
               which he gave when he was comparing the 
               <br />
               amount of debt that we would have to pay 
               <br />
               per head of our population, compared with 
               <br />
               that of Great Britain. The amount per head 
               <br />
               with us is about $25, and he gravely told the 
               <br />
               House that the amount per head in Great 
               <br />
               Britain was only 837. when every person
