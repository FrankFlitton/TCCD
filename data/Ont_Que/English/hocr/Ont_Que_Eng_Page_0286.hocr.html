               disappointed, if, after this portion of the scheme 
               <br />
               18 passed, the local constitutions proposed 
               <br />
               were quite unsatisfactory. I contend that 
               <br />
               the local constitutions are as much an essential 
               <br />
               part of the whole as the general Constitution, 
               <br />
               and that they both should have been laid at 
               <br />
               the same time before the House. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) We ought, besides, to have a clear 
               <br />
               statement of what are the liabilities specially 
               <br />
               assigned to Upper and Lower Canada. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hour.) It is well that Upper Canada should 
               <br />
               know if she has to pay the indebtedness 
               <br />
               of Port Hope, Cobourg, Brockville, Nia- 
               <br />
               gara, and other municipalities which have 
               <br />
               borrowed from the municipal loan fund, 
               <br />
               and what these liabilities are; and it is 
               <br />
               important for Lower Canada to be told 
               <br />
               what are the amounts they will be re uired 
               <br />
               to tax themselves for. We ought, besi es, to 
               <br />
               obtain some kind of information upon the 
               <br />
               subject of the Intercolonial Railway, what is 
               <br />
               the proposed cost, and what route is to be 
               <br />
               followed; and before these facts are before the 
               <br />
               House, we ought not to take it u n ourselves 
               <br />
               to legislate on the subject. Sti further, the 
               <br />
               people of the country do not understand the 
               <br />
               scheme. (Hear, hear.) Many members of 
               <br />
               this House, before hearing the explanations 
               <br />
               which have been oﬂ'ered, were, and others are 
               <br />
               still, in doubt as to the bearin of many of 
               <br />
               these resolutions. In the Upper ouse doubts 
               <br />
               were expressed as to who should recommend 
               <br />
               the appointment of the members composing 
               <br />
               the Legislative Council. It was thought in 
               <br />
               many quarters that the appointment of these 
               <br />
               members was to be made by the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments after the scheme should come into 
               <br />
               ration. But this it seems is a mistake. 
               <br />
               here are many other matters with which we 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“acquainted,</span> particularly as regards the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nets</span> an liabilities. There is a provision 
               <br />
               that the nomination of the judges of the 
               <br />
               superior courts shall be vested in the General 
               <br />
               Government, but it would seem that the con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the courts is to be left to the 
               <br />
               local governments; and I ut the question, 
               <br />
               What does this mean? o you mean that 
               <br />
               the local governments are to establish as many 
               <br />
               courts as they please, declare of how many 
               <br />
               judges they will be composed, and that the 
               <br />
               General Government will have to pay for 
               <br />
               them? Is a local governmenttc say, here is a 
               <br />
               court with three judges; we want ﬁve, and those 
               <br />
               ﬁve must be appointed and paid by the Gen- 
               <br />
               eral Government ? I have received no answer 
               <br />
               to this and to several other questions. I can

               <br />
               Will all these questions be left to the General 
               <br />
               Government? If so, it will have the power 
               <br />
               to upset one of the most important portions 
               <br />
               of our civil code, and one affecting more 
               <br />
               than any other all classes of society. The 
               <br />
               adoption, for instance, of the English rule, 
               <br />
               whereby females at the age of twelve, and 
               <br />
               males at the age of fourteen, can contract a 
               <br />
               valid marriage without the consent of parents, 
               <br />
               tutors or guardians, would be looked to by the 
               <br />
               mass of the people of Lower Canada as a most 
               <br />
               objectionable innovation in our laws, as would 
               <br />
               also any provision to allow such marriages to 
               <br />
               take place before any common magistrate 
               <br />
               Without any formality whatsoever. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Yet is there no danger that such 
               <br />
               measures might be carried, when you see the 
               <br />
               different feelings existing on these questions 
               <br />
               among the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ'erent</span> provinces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;,</span> 
               <br />
               There is another question to which I must 
               <br />
               refer before closing. It is said that the 
               <br />
               division of the debt is a fair one. We have 
               <br />
               given, say the Government, 825 of debt to 
               <br />
               each inhabitant—that is, in those provinces 
               <br />
               where it was less, they have increased it to 
               <br />
               that amount, charging it to the Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, and thereb they have made a present to 
               <br />
               the several provmces of the difference between 
               <br />
               their present indebtedness and the 825 per 
               <br />
               head. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter)</span> This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">825</span> per head, 
               <br />
               when compared to the debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Encland,</span> is a 
               <br />
               heavier burthen upon our own pe0p e than the 
               <br />
               Imperial debt upon the people of England, 
               <br />
               taking into consideration the greater wealth 
               <br />
               per individual in England and the fact that 
               <br />
               the greater part of that debt bears three per 
               <br />
               cent. interest. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) There is an- 
               <br />
               other aspect in which this question of debt is 
               <br />
               to be considered. To equalize it, the Con- 
               <br />
               fercnce have increased it on the basis of the 
               <br />
               present pulation for the several provinces. 
               <br />
               I‘his is air enough at present, supposing that 
               <br />
               each province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contribute</span> the same proportion 
               <br />
               to the general revenue, and would continue to 
               <br />
               be so if their fpopulation progressed in the 
               <br />
               same ratio o increase; but, from the
