               religious prejudices; I made an appeal to

               <br />
               ber has stated. I shall now state the manner 
               <br />
               in which I explained the passage from Lord 
               <br />
               Dvmn’s report. I said it was impossible 
               <br />
               that both races should long continue to live 
               <br />
               in peace; that some day or other the two 
               <br />
               nationalities would come into collision; that 
               <br />
               judgment would be given by the Federal 
               <br />
               Parliament, in which the English were to 
               <br />
               have the majority, and from which the 
               <br />
               French-Canadians could not hope to obtain 
               <br />
               justice. I did not state that the French- 
               <br />
               Canadians would act unjustly towards the 
               <br />
               British; but I said that the latter might 
               <br />
               com lain, and that the Federal Legislature 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">woufd</span> be called upon to decide as to whether 
               <br />
               injustice had been done; and that its sympa- 
               <br />
               thies must be distrusted. I added that the 
               <br />
               Federal Parliament being composed of a ma- 
               <br />
               jority of English members, would be inclined 
               <br />
               to give ear to the English of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               rather than to the French-Canadians. I then 
               <br />
               noted Lord DURHAM’S report to rove that 
               <br />
               'nglish-Canadians would never willingly sub- 
               <br />
               mit to the majority in Lower Canada. And 
               <br />
               in citing the two extracts from Lord DUB- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hsn’s</span> report, I ﬁrst read them in English 
               <br />
               and then translated them into French. How 
               <br />
               can it be asserted, therefore, that I made use 
               <br />
               of the English language in order to make an 
               <br />
               a peal to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prejudices</span> of the An lO-Cana-

               ns? The c arge is absurd. ar from 
               <br />
               desiring to inﬂuence them in that sense, I 
               <br />
               read the with hesitation, because I 
               <br />
               felt that the British ought to blush for them. 
               <br />
