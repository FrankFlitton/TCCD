               that now is the time for taking such steps if 
               <br />
               ever they are to be taken. If ever there was 
               <br />
               an occasion when it was necessary to remove 
               <br />
               the hostility existing between Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, and cement their friendships 
               <br />
               --if ever there was a time when it was 
               <br />
               prudent to strengthen ourselves by a union 
               <br />
               with the other provinces, and place ourselves 
               <br />
               in a position of defence, it is the present, and 
               <br />
               I speak, 1 think, the sentiments of all Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, certainly of all that section of it 
               <br />
               where I reside, whem I say that there is but 
               <br />
               one feeling there in reference to this matter, 
               <br />
               and it is favorable to this proposed arrange- 
               <br />
               ment, favorable to this plan for the union of 
               <br />
               the provinces. (Hear, hear.) Besides, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, though some of the details are ob- 
               <br />
               jectionable, I am not prepared to risk the loss 
               <br />
               of the principle which is admitted in these 
               <br />
               resolutions, which is one that gives to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada what she has demanded for years, 
               <br />
               and gives it whether the other provinces 
               <br />
               accede to it or not; it is the recognition by 
               <br />
               Lower Canada of Upper Canada’s rights to 
               <br />
               an increased representation; it is the ac- 
               <br />
               ceding of that which Lower Canada has 
               <br />
               ever heretofore refused to grant, and I 
               <br />
               cannot, in cavelling at these details, which 
               <br />
               may hereafter be modiﬁed, jeopardise the

               hear.) Again, notwithstanding the declara-

               tion of my honorable friend from South Has-

               West, I think, on the contrary, that it adds 
               <br />
               to the prospect of opening u that vast terri-

               all the sooner if this measure be adopted,

               <br />
               fertile and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">productive</span> as our own province, 
               <br />
               and its domain as wide. To the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">north-west</span> 
               <br />
               there lies beneath British sway, but as yet all 
               <br />
               unreclaimed, a vast and varied territory, the 
               <br />
               mineral and agricultural wealth of which no 
               <br />
               man can estimate, and the future products of 
               <br />
               which none can conceive—a territory oﬁ'ering 
               <br />
               the emigrant the choice of its fertile plains, 
               <br />
               and the miner the wealth of its hidden riches. 
               <br />
               Here, then, is the policy which tends to the 
               <br />
               settlement of this vast territory, the develop- 
               <br />
               ment of its immense resources, the opening 
               <br />
               up of its inexhaustible mines, and with it the 
               <br />
               creation of a new people, the establishment of 
               <br />
               increased revenues, and the extension of 
               <br />
               British inﬂuences and British power on this 
               <br />
               continent. And while developing our re— 
               <br />
               sources in the west, it gives an additional 
               <br />
               outlet for the roducts of that living mine of 
               <br />
               teeming wealt in the east—our ﬁsheries— 
               <br />
               the protection and encouragement of which is 
               <br />
               as necessary as their wealth to us is inestim- 
               <br />
               able. (Hear, hear.) Believing, too, that 
               <br />
               this scheme will tend alike to our internal 
               <br />
               reform and improvement as Canadians, and 
               <br />
               the quieting of our political hostilities; that it 
               <br />
               will give us a larger ﬁeld for our labors and 
               <br />
               an additional market for our products; that 
               <br />
               the connections in trade which it will procure 
               <br />
               will eﬂ'ect for as enhanced revenues and in- 
               <br />
               creased commerce, I, as a Canadian, am 
               <br />
               willing to adopt it even in this local and selﬁsh 
               <br />
               sense; but I also see in it a broader policy 
               <br />
               with a wider ﬁeld open for our energies and 
               <br />
               our capital—it is the ﬁrst step towards es- 
               <br />
               tablishmg on British territory a highway 
               <br />
               from the Paciﬁc to the Atlantic, and thus 
               <br />
               procurin for us the carry' trade of Asia 
               <br />
               and the ‘ast with all the enriching revenues 
               <br />
               which it will insure and the labor it will 
               <br />
               employ. In short, Mr. SPEAKER, it is the 
               <br />
               policy of a great colonial combination, effec- 
               <br />
               tive alike in civil pursuits and military de- 
               <br />
               fence, adding strength to the Empire and in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuencing the destinies of this great continent. 
               <br />
               For these reasons I voted against the last 
               <br />
               amendment, and for the same reasons I am 
               <br />
               prepared to vote against this one also. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Bean)</span>
