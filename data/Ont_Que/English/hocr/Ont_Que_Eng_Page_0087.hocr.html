               <br />
               the case of anada it will be remembered 
               <br />
               that the sum of nearly ﬁve millions of the 
               <br />
               public debt has to be borne by Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. It will hereafter be for the 
               <br />
               House to decide how this sum shall be appor- 
               <br />
               tioned, but the probability is that the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment will recommend that it shall be divided 
               <br />
               on the basis of population. (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               must be remembered that Canada will have 
               <br />
               at its disposal a large amount of the local 
               <br />
               assets, including especially the sums due to 
               <br />
               the municipal loan fund, which will reduce 
               <br />
               an income for the support of their coal in- 
               <br />
               stitutions. As a matter of account between 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada and the General 
               <br />
               Government, they will be charged with the 
               <br />
               interest on their respective r0portions of the 
               <br />
               ﬁve millions against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subsidy</span> which it is 
               <br />
               proposed shall be given to them, while they 
               <br />
               themselves will collect from the municipalities 
               <br />
               and other local sources all the revenue and 
               <br />
               amounts which now enter into the general 
               <br />
               revenue of the Province of Canada. The 
               <br />
               question of the sub-division of the local assets 
               <br />
               of Canada is not, however, before the House. 
               <br />
               What we have now to consider is whether the 
               <br />
               bargain as between Canada as a whole and 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces ought to be assented to. 
               <br />
               If it be assented to the question will arise, 
               <br />
               how shall we deal with the local matters be— 
               <br />
               tween Upper and Lower Canada ? and a pro- 
               <br />
               position will be brought down which I hope 
               <br />
               and believe will satisfy both sections, and do 
               <br />
               them substantial justice.

               the Municipal Loan Fund, instead of being

               light of assets, because we are considering now 
               <br />
               the sums received as assets by Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               The Municipal Loan Fund being one of them, 
               <br />
               the sums due to it under the existing provin- 
               <br />
               cial arrangements will become payable as an 
               <br />
               asset to that section of the province. (Hear.) 
               <br />
               It will be observed that in the plan proposed 
               <br />
               there are certain sources of local revenue re- 
               <br />
               served to the Local Governments, aris' from 
               <br />
               territorial domain, lands, mines, &amp;c. the 
               <br />
               case of Canada, a large sum will be received 
               <br />
               from these resources, but it may be that some 
               <br />
               of them, such as the Municipal Loan Fund, 
               <br />
               will become exhausted in course of time. We 
               <br />
               may, however, place just conﬁdence in the 
               <br />
               development of our resources, and repose in 
               <br />
               the belief that we shall ﬁnd in our ter- 
               <br />
               ritorial domain, our valuable mines and our 
               <br />
               fertile lands, additional sources of revenue 
               <br />
               far beyond the re uirements of the public 
               <br />
               service. If, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nevertheless,</span> the local revenues 
               <br />
               become inadequate, it will be necessary for 
               <br />
               the local governments to have resort to di- 
               <br />
               rect taxation ; and I do not hesitate to say that 
               <br />
               one of the wisest provisions in the proposed 
               <br />

               <br />
               interest in their own aﬁairs and see that no 
               <br />
               extravagance is committed by those placed in 
               <br />
               power over them, is to be found in the fact 
               <br />
               that those who are called upon to administer 
               <br />
               ublic aﬁ'airs will feel, when they resort to 
               <br />
               irect taxation, that a solemn responsibility 
               <br />
               rests upon them, and that that responsibility 
               <br />
               will be exacted by the people in the most per- 
               <br />
               emptory manner. (Hear, hear.) If the men 
               <br />
               in power ﬁnd that they are required, by means 
               <br />
               of direct taxation, to procure the funds neces- 
               <br />
               sary to administer the local affairs, for which 
               <br />
               abundant provision is made in the scheme, 
               <br />
               they will pause before the enter upon any

               <br />
               hesitate to say, that if the public men of these 
               <br />
               provinces were sufﬁciently educated to under- 
               <br />
               stand their own interests in the true light of 
               <br />
               the principles of political economy, it would 
               <br />
               be found better now to substitute direct tax-
