               struggle undertaken in order to secure 
               <br />
               responsible government, which had, up to 
               <br />
               that time, been refused, and which was then 
               <br />
               accorded us as the reward of the struggle. 
               <br />
               At that period Lower Canada was united as 
               <br />
               one man; she had forwarded to England 
               <br />
               petitions, bearing 60,000 signatures, asking 
               <br />
               for responsible government. We then had 
               <br />
               in our ranks men who did not shrink from 
               <br />
               the struggle, men accustomed to resist 
               <br />
               oppression, men who had grown up in the 
               <br />
               midst of a strife with an arrogant minority, 
               <br />
               which sought to overrule the majority; and 
               <br />
               these were the great men who secured the 
               <br />
               triumph of our nationality, and upheld the 
               <br />
               rights of Lower Canada, by securing respon- 
               <br />
               sible government at the same time that the 
               <br />
               union was forced upon us. Let us now see 
               <br />
               the result of their labors. Is it true that 
               <br />
               we have progressed both socially and ma— 
               <br />
               terially since that period? Any one who 
               <br />
               reﬂects on what Canada was in 1840, and 
               <br />
               what it is in 1865, cannot but admit that we 
               <br />
               have progressed in a degree almost unpre- 
               <br />
               cedented in the history of the prosperity of 
               <br />
               nations ; that we have immensely extended 
               <br />
               our territory, by clearing away the forest; 
               <br />
               that our population has increased in a 
               <br />
               wonderful manner, that that population is 
               <br />
               prosperous and contented, and that we have 
               <br />
               progressed materially and socially in a 
               <br />
               manner heretoforce unprecedented under the 
               <br />
               colonial system. In the social order, let us 
               <br />
               examine, ﬁrst, our legislation and system in 
               <br />
               municipal matters. Can a more perfect 
               <br />
               system be found anywhere? Has not every 
               <br />
               locality ill the powers necessary for effecting 
               <br />
               all improvements of real necessity? It is 
               <br />
               since the union that we have perfected this 
               <br />
               system, and that we have endowed our rural 
               <br />
               districts with the means of effecting all im— 
               <br />
               provements they may desire, and particularly 
               <br />
               asregards road matters and the making of 
               <br />
               new roads, in order to facilitate the transport 
               <br />
               of farm produce to market. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But I need not dwell on the progress we 
               <br />
               have made and the reforms we have carried 
               <br />
               out, as regards legislation. That which 
               <br />
               had chieﬂy contributed, from the ﬁrst estab- 
               <br />
               lishment of English rule, to arrest our pro- 
               <br />
               gress in this respect was the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council of the former Legislature, and that 
               <br />
               which existed from the union up to 1856. 
               <br />
               Since that period have we not obtained an 
               <br />
               elective Legislative Council, and must not 
               <br />
               our greatest reforms be considered the con- 
               <br />
               sequence? With the union and responsible 
               <br />
               government, did we not also secure the right 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               cil? And since then have we not enjoyed 
               <br />
               all the advantage of a system of government 
               <br />
               under which the people can, not only ex- 
               <br />
               press their wants, but enforce their wishes? 
               <br />
               These are reforms of the highest importance, 
               <br />
               but we have obtained yet more. When, in 
               <br />
               1840, the union of the Canadas took place, 
               <br />
               landed property in Lower Canada was sub- 
               <br />
               jected to the feudal system, which had been 
               <br />
               introduced with all its features derogatory 
               <br />
               to the dignity of man, with all its charges 
               <br />
               upon property, and all its vexations for the 
               <br />
               censz‘taz’re. Under that system no property 
               <br />
               whatever could change hands without being 
               <br />
               submitted to a heavy charge in the form of 
               <br />
               lads et ventes for the beneﬁt of the seignior, 
               <br />
               and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mns</span> et rentes which considerahly 
               <br />
               reduced its value. With the political rights 
               <br />
               conferred on us by the union, the seigniorial 
               <br />
               system of necessity disappeared, giving us 
               <br />
               prOperty in freehold, the same as in the 
               <br />
               neighbouring States and in all civilized 
               <br />
               nations. It is also since the union that we 
               <br />
               have consolidated our laws; that we have 
               <br />
               created a system of public instruction 
               <br />
               which imparts the blessings of education 
               <br />
               to the most remote parts of the province. 
               <br />
               At the present moment we have a school 
               <br />
               system which does honor to the country, and 
               <br />
               the intelligent, however poor they may be, 
               <br />
               can, almost without charge, acquire an edu- 
               <br />
               cation. Now, each village, each concession 
               <br />
               has its school, and the child of the back- 
               <br />
               woodsman dwelling in the midst of the forest, 
               <br />
               can there obtain a degree of elementary 
               <br />
               instruction sufﬁcient to enable him to enter 
               <br />
               upon a career of honor and fortune, should 
               <br />

               <br />
               him for playing a part in politics, in the 
               <br />
               sciences, in the arts or in the ranks of the 
               <br />
               clergy of his country. It is a remarkable 
               <br />
               fact, Mr. SPEAKER, and one which I deem 
               <br />
               it right to mention, that the majority of the 
               <br />
               notable men who have attained seats on the 
               <br />
               judicial bench, in the Ministry and even in 
               <br />
               the Episcopal chair, came forth from our 
               <br />
               humble country homes, and qualiﬁed them- 
               <br />
               selves in our educational institutions, where 
               <br />
               instruction is afforded all but gratuitously, by 
               <br />
               dint of talent, perseverance, study and indus- 
               <br />
               try. It was the pressure of want in the 
               <br />
               family homestead that in many cases created 
               <br />
               in the-breasts of our most eminent public 
               <br />
               men, the eager desire of attaining a high 
               <br />
               position by means of stud and labor. Since
