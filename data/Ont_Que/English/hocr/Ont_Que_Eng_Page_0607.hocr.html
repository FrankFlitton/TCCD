               proposed, were he not forced to it by Upper 
               <br />

               some of our franchises and our rights in

               encroachment and domination manifested by 
               <br />
               the Engl sh race. Hon. members who 
               <br />
               support the measure will tell you that they 
               <br />
               are giving up a part of our rights, in order 
               <br />
               that what remains may be saved from destruc- 
               <br />

               enjoy, before any lengthened period shall 
               <br />
               have elapsed. But was this clamor in favor 
               <br />
               of representation based upon population 
               <br />
               sincere on the part of those who used it as 
               <br />
               a means of attacking us? Was it in reality 
               <br />
               a remedy for the evils of which they 
               <br />
               complained? No, Mr. SPEAKER,I do not 
               <br />
               think it was. It was simply an electoral plat- 
               <br />
               form,by which to attain power and consum- 
               <br />
               mate the encroachment upon our rights con- 
               <br />
               templated by the leaders ofthe movement. I do 
               <br />
               not deem it necessary to repeat here all the 
               <br />
               arguments brought to bear against the de- 
               <br />
               mand for representation by pOpulation, in 
               <br />
               eighty speeches delivered in 1860, during 
               <br />
               the discussion of that exciting question; 
               <br />
               but I remember that debate with all the 
               <br />
               more pleasure, that the French-Canadians 
               <br />
               showed that they retained some vestiges of 
               <br />
               ﬁrmness in the day of battle, and of perse- 
               <br />
               verance in the maintenance of our rights, 
               <br />
               which our fathers had so often manifested. 
               <br />
               On that occasion the Hon. Attorn :y General 
               <br />
               East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) deserved the 
               <br />
               approbation of his country for the resistance 
               <br />
               he made to that unjust demand on the part 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada, with that energy and 
               <br />
               tenacity he is so well known to display ; he 
               <br />
               was the champion of our rights. Why, 
               <br />
               then, does he to-day come down and propose 
               <br />
               a compromise with his Opponents of those 
               <br />
               days? Is it just at the moment when the 
               <br />
               leaders of the Upper Canadian Opposition 
               <br />
               had, by entering the MACDONALD-SICOTTE 
               <br />
               Government, absolutely rejected the principle 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> based upon population, 
               <br />
               that he should abandon the struggle ? Is it 
               <br />
               at the moment the MACDONALD-SICOTTE 
               <br />
               Government had obtained separate schools 
               <br />
               for the Catholics of Upper Canada, that the 
               <br />
               party led by the honorable member for South 
               <br />
               Oxford was to be dreaded? Is it at the

               moment when the law providing separate

               <br />

               tration make a close question of repre- 
               <br />

               members of that Government bound to oppose 
               <br />
               it? Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, the Hon. Attcrney- 
               <br />
               General East was guilty of a grievous wrong, 
               <br />
               when he defeated that Government by a 
               <br />
               hostile majority composed of French-Cana- 
               <br />
               dians. It was after that hostile vote that 
               <br />
               Upper Canada insisted on her right to renew 
               <br />
               her claims to representation based on popu- 
               <br />
               lation, and that we are compelled to-day to 
               <br />
               make concessions. For my part, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I have never been convinced of 
               <br />
               the sincerity of those who made use of the 
               <br />
               cry for representation based on population, 
               <br />
               for I have never seen any other means 
               <br />
               employed to obtain the aid of the western 
               <br />
               farmers in securing more easily the reins of 
               <br />
               power. Has the principle of representation 
               <br />
               based on population ever served as the basis 
               <br />
               of a government having monarchical ideas, 
               <br />
               like those which actuate the existing Govern- 
               <br />
               ment? N ow we are seeking for a Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation for which there is no precedent—not a 
               <br />
               Confederation like those to be found in other 
               <br />
               countries which have adopted that form of 
               <br />
               government, but a monarchical Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. (Hear, hear.) It is sought to retain 
               <br />
               the English Constitution. and yet it is assert- 
               <br />
               ed that representation by pOpulation is a 
               <br />
               just principle, and that it must be extended 
               <br />
               to Upper Canada. Does not the Honorable 
               <br />
               Attorney General East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) 
               <br />
               remember the arguments he urged in 1860 
               <br />
               against this principle? Did he not then declare 
               <br />
               with the view of showing that the principle 
               <br />
               was neither a just one nor one recognized 
               <br />
               in the British Constitution, that if it were 
               <br />
               applied to the British Parliament the city 
               <br />
               of London alone would have thirty members 
               <br />
               instead of sixteen, and that Scotland would 
               <br />
               send many more members to Parliament 
               <br />
               than she does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now?</span> Did he not assert that 
               <br />
               rotten boroughs, containing only a few hun- 
               <br />
               dred inhabitants, had one representative, 
               <br />
               and that counties containing 100,000 in. 
               <br />
               habitants had no more? Have these argu-
