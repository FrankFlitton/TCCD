               ﬂiing that is to come upon us, one may say, 
               <br />
               at once; I allude to the ex nditure for 
               <br />
               our defences—the Intercolonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gailway—the</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gpaning</span> of communication with the North- 
               <br />
               est—and the enlargement of our canals. 
               <br />
               There is no doubt that all these new sources 
               <br />
               of outlay are immediately contemplated. 
               <br />
               Their cost is not given us; it could not be 
               <br />
               givm with any safety to the scheme. I do 
               <br />
               not pretend to say, sir, but that some of these 
               <br />
               expmditures are necessary; and this I am 
               <br />
               even prepared to say as to one of them — 
               <br />
               the outlay for defences—that every province 
               <br />
               of the empire is bound to do its full share 
               <br />
               towards its own defence. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               never gave a vote or expressed an opinion in 
               <br />
               any other sense. I was always ready with 
               <br />
               my vote for that p (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But looking at the great outlay, I may say 
               <br />
               the enormous outlay here understood to be 
               <br />
               contemplated, I confess I cannot approach the 
               <br />
               subject in this connection without a feeling of 
               <br />
               miegiving. I can uite understand our going 
               <br />
               to the full limit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oll</span> our means for all the ex- 
               <br />
               pense that is nwessary for the thorough main- 
               <br />
               tenance of our militia on an eﬂicient footing 
               <br />
               as to instruction and otherwise; but'when we 
               <br />
               hear of Imperial engineers, with Imperial 
               <br />
               ideas as to cost, laying out grand rmanent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">works</span> of defence, then I' confess am much 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incl'med</span> to think that we had need try to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practice</span> what economy we can in that direc- 
               <br />
               tion. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gHear,</span> hear.) Then, as regards the 
               <br />
               Interco onial Railway, we have in these reso- 
               <br />
               lutions a very blind tale indeed. “ The Gen- 
               <br />
               eral Government shall secure, without delay, 
               <br />
               the completion of the Intercolonial Railway 
               <br />
               from Rivière du Lou , through New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, to Truro in ova Scotia”——and this 
               <br />
               quite irrespectively of the expense. The 
               <br />
               vague pledge is, that the General Government 
               <br />
               at any cost secure the immediate com- 
               <br />
               pletion of this work. As to its commercial or 
               <br />
               military advantages, I have not a great idea of 
               <br />
               them. I believe there has been much exagger- 
               <br />
               ation as to both. Unless with a strong force to 
               <br />
               defend it, in a military point of view, it 
               <br />
               would be of just no use at all. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               For my own part, as I have often said, I 
               <br />
               heartily wish to see the road built; but un- 
               <br />
               less we can get it done upon terms within our 
               <br />
               means, we had better do without it a little 
               <br />
               longer, and developo what other means of 
               <br />
               communication are at our command. While 
               <br />
               I want to see the thing done, I am not pre- 
               <br />

               cal aspects, the work is as much an Imperial

               have a right to look for aid from the Empire.

               I know it is said the Empire is going to aid 
               <br />
               us. Well, for a long time we held this lan-

               guage: if the Imperial Government and the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces between them will combine 
               <br />
               to do the rest, we are ready with lands and 
               <br />
               subsidies, in a certain proportion and to a 
               <br />
               certain limited amount. It is unfortunate, 
               <br />

               MR. DUNKIN—I know it is, but those 
               <br />
               since made have left it out of sight. In 1862 
               <br />
               the start was made to a larger and not limited 
               <br />
               outlay—ﬁvetwelfths of an unstated whole— 
               <br />
               Great Britain to reduce the cost by endorsing 
               <br />
               for us to a stated ﬁgure. I regretted that 
               <br />
               scheme; but still it was better for us than 
               <br />
               what is now being forced upon us. By this 
               <br />
               last scheme, Canada will have to bear some 
               <br />
               nine-twelfths—it has been said ten-twelfths— 
               <br />
               but some nine-twelfths, at any rate. In fact, 
               <br />
               the bulk of the burden is to fall on us; and 
               <br />
               it is signiﬁcant, though I dare say that the 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen who drew up this resolu- 
               <br />
               tion did not mean it, that it seems to let the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁ'</span> from its guarantee. 
               <br />
               This is no mere criticism of mine ; my atten- 
               <br />
               tion was drawn to the point by the article in 
               <br />
               the‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Edinburgh</span> Review from which I was 
               <br />
               quoting last night. That writer—who is not 
               <br />
               a nobody, you may depend upon it—remarks, 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> that from the wording of this reso- 
               <br />
               lution, the honorable gentlemen of the Confer- 
               <br />
               ence do not seem to be holdingto the Imperial 
               <br />
               guarantee. Should it not be given, the cost 
               <br />
               to us will be frightfully increased. And this 
               <br />
               it had not need be. For the honorable gem 
               <br />
               tlemen who are running us into it might do well 
               <br />
               to remember the past. We had the Grand 
               <br />
               Trunk railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁ‘ered</span> us for what was called 
               <br />
               next to nothing. The guarantee we were to 
               <br />
               give was not for much ; and it was well 
               <br />
               secured ; and we were assured it was not’ 
               <br />
               meant to be made use of—was more a form 
               <br />
               than a reality. Yet the guarantee was used and 
               <br />
               extended, and made a gift of ; every estimate 
               <br />
               failed ; the cry ever since has been for more, 
               <br />
               more; and the whole concern is now in such 
               <br />
               a state as to be threatening us day by day 
               <br />
