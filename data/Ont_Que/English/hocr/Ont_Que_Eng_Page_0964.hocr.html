               MR. DE N IVERVILLE—Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               as the junior member of this honorable House, 
               <br />
               it was proper that I should be the last to 
               <br />
               speak on the question which now engages our 
               <br />
               attention. A very few days before the com- 
               <br />
               mencement of the present session, I did not 
               <br />
               know that I should ﬁll the seat which I now 
               <br />
               occupy in this chamber, and should be called 
               <br />
               on to vote on the question of Confederation, 
               <br />
               and take art in the debate upon it. Ac— 
               <br />
               cordingly, have not had time, as most of the 
               <br />
               honorable members who have spoken on the 
               <br />
               scheme submitted to the House have had, to 
               <br />
               prepare myself to treat it in apolitical and dip— 
               <br />
               lomatic sense, and to examine the basis on which 
               <br />
               it rests. If, on the other hand, I had had the 
               <br />
               time necessary to make myself thoroughly ac- 
               <br />
               quainted with it in all its bearings, I should 
               <br />
               have acted not otherwise than I shall now act. 
               <br />
               I should have left, as now, to other members 
               <br />
