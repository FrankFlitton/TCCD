               motion for the previous question was sprung 
               <br />
               upon the House, the Hon. Attorney General

               W est rather rated the honorable member for

               Carleton, because that honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               chose to express an independent view on 
               <br />
               the matter, and then he stated that the fol- 
               <br />
               lower ought always to obey the leader, 
               <br />
               because it was to be supposed the latter

               would not take any particular action without 
               <br />

               sent to this House by the people to follow 
               <br />
               the leaders of a party, but to represent the

               <br />
               required to give up that right of judgment
