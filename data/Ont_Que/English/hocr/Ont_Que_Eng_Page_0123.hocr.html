               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d‘</span> my honorable friends from Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               During the discussion on the question for some 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> back I had occasion to dip deep in N orth- 
               <br />
               Ve‘st lore—into those singularly interesting 
               <br />
               narratives of life and travels in the North-West 
               <br />
               in the olden time, and into the history of the 
               <br />
               struggles for commercial domainancy in the 
               <br />
               great fur—bearing regions,—and it has always 
               <br />
               struck me that the French Canadian pe0ple 
               <br />
               have cause to look back with pride to the bold 
               <br />
               and successful part they played in the adven- 
               <br />
               tures of those days. Nothing perhaps has 
               <br />
               tended more to create their present national 
               <br />
               character than the vigorous habits, the power 
               <br />
               of endurance, the aptitude for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outdoor</span> life, 
               <br />
               uired in their prosecution of the North- 
               <br />
               West fur-trade. (Hear, hear.) Well may 
               <br />
               they look forward with anxiety to the 
               <br />
               realization of this part of our scheme, in 
               <br />
               conﬁdent hope that the great north-western 
               <br />
               traﬂie shall be once more opened up to the 
               <br />
               hardy French Canadian traders and voyageurs. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Last year furs to the value of 
               <br />
               £280,000 stg. ($1,400,000) were carried from 
               <br />
               that territory by the Hudson’s Bay Company 
               <br />
               —smuggled oﬂ' through the ice-bound regions 
               <br />
               of James’ Bay, that the pretence of the bar- 
               <br />
               renness of the country and the diﬁculty of 
               <br />
               conveying merchandise by the natural route 
               <br />
               of the St. Lawrence may be kept up a little 
               <br />
               longer. . Sir, the carrying of merchandise into 
               <br />
               that country, and bringing down the bales of 
               <br />
               pelts ought to be ours, and must ere long be 
               <br />
               ours, as in the days of yore—(hear, hear — 
               <br />
               and when the fertile plains of that great ‘as- 
               <br />
               katchewan territory are opened up for settle- 
               <br />
               ment and cultivation, I am conﬁdent that it will 
               <br />
               not only add immensely to our annual agricul- 
               <br />
               tural products, but bring us sources of mineral 
               <br />
               and other wealth on which at present we do 
               <br />
               not reckon. (Hear, hear.) While speaking on 
               <br />
               this question of immigration, I would remind 
               <br />
               the House, and it is impossible to urge it 
               <br />
               too strongly, that these provinces are now 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presented</span> to the world in a very disadvantage- 
               <br />
               ous aspect, as diﬁ'erent communities. When a 
               <br />
               party in EurOpe thinks of emigrating here, he 
               <br />
               has to ascertain separately all about New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, and Upper and Lower Canada; 
               <br />
               and if by chance he meets a party from some one 
               <br />
               of these provinces, he has to listen to a picture 
               <br />
               ofthe merits of that one section in high contrast 
               <br />
               to the demerits of all the rest, and the result 
               <br />
               is the poor man’s ideas about us become a mass 
               <br />
               of confusion. On the other hand, if he seeks 
               <br />
               to know the inducements for emigration to 
               <br />
               New South Wales, or New Zealand, he gets it

               in one picture—in an oﬁcial form—and the 
               <br />
               oﬂ'er is made to pay his passage to these lands 
               <br />
               of hope. A large amount of emigration, and 
               <br />
               of money which the emigrant takes with him, 
               <br />
               are thus carried off to a much more distant land 
               <br />
               than this, and one that does not oﬂ'er equal 
               <br />
               inducements to the settler. But how different 
               <br />
               will all this be when these provinces stand 
               <br />
               united, and present to emigrants a combination 
               <br />
               of so many branches of proﬁtable industry ? 
               <br />
               In turning over some United States statistics 
               <br />
               I recently fell upon a very curious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁcial</span> cal— 
               <br />
               culation made by the United States Govern— 
               <br />
               ment, as to the value of immigration. By the 
               <br />
               census of 1861 the population of the United 
               <br />
               States was over thirty millions; and this cal- 
               <br />
               culation was to ascertain what the population 
               <br />
               would have been had there been no ' ' 
               <br />
               tion into the country, but had the population 
               <br />
               been left to advance solely by its own natural 
               <br />
               increase. And what do you think, sir, was 
               <br />
               the result ? Why, it is shewn that if the 
               <br />
               United States had received all the immigrants 
               <br />
               that came to them up to 1820, and then stopped 
               <br />
               receiving them—the population, at this moment, 
               <br />
               instead of thirty millions, would have been but 
               <br />
               14,601,485. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(gear,</span> hear. ) It is shewn that. 
               <br />
               if immigration ad gone on until 1810 and 
               <br />
               stopped then, the population now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would4</span> have 
               <br />
               been only 12,678,562. Had it stepped in 
               <br />
               1800, the population now would have been 
               <br />
               10,462,944; and had it stopped in 1790, 
               <br />
               the population now, instead of thirty millions, 
               <br />
               would have been but 8,789,969. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               These, sir, are most valuable facts, which 
               <br />
               should be impressed on the mind of eve 
               <br />
               public man in British America. If we wis 
               <br />
               our country to progress, we should not leave 
               <br />
               a single stone unturned to attract the tide 
               <br />
               of emigration in this direction; and I know 
               <br />
               no better method of securing that result, than 
               <br />
               the gathering into one of these ﬁve provinces, 
               <br />
               and presenting ourselves to the world in the 
               <br />
               advantageous light which, when united, we 
               <br />
               would occu y. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> But, ﬁfthly, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, am in favor of a union of these 
               <br />
               provinces, because it will enable us to meet, 
               <br />
               without alarm, the abrogation of the American 
               <br />
               Reciprocity Treaty, in case the United States 
               <br />
               should insist on its abolition. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I do not believe that the American Government 
               <br />
               is so insane as to repeal that treaty. But 
               <br />
               it is always well to be prepared for contingen- 
               <br />
               cies—and I have no hesitation in saying that if 
               <br />
               they do repeal it, should this union of British 
               <br />
               America go on, a fresh ‘outlet for our com- 
               <br />
               merce will be opened up to us quite as advan- 
               <br />
               tageous as the American trade has ever been.
