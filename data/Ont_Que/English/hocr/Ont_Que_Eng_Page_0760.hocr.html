               (Hear, hear.) It is evident, Mr. SPEAKER,

               that the Government is afraid of amendments 
               <br />

               <br />
               imposing and signiﬁcant movement which is 
               <br />
               now going on in Lower Canada alarms the 
               <br />
               Ministry, and that if the Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               representatives obey the popular voice, and do 
               <br />
               not disregard it as some 0 them appear dis- 
               <br />
               posed to do, they will vote against the motion 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> by the Honorable Attorney General

               or Upper Canada; for if those honorable 
               <br />
               members support this motion, they will simply 
               <br />
               declare that they do not wish for amendments 
               <br />
               to the scheme, that they are opposed to an 
               <br />

               <br />
               whatever of the scheme. The other night 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Montmerency de- 
               <br />
               clared in this House that this signiﬁed nothing; 
               <br />
               that a representative was not bound to respect 
               <br />
               the wishes of his constituents, and that we 
               <br />
               were at perfect liberty to vote as we might 
               <br />
               think ﬁt on any measure whatsoever, and espe- 
               <br />
               cially on the scheme of Confederation. At all 
               <br />
               even ts, Mr. SPEAKER, I shall venture to hold 
               <br />
               a different opinion from that of the honorable 
               <br />
               member, and I say that every man who shews 
               <br />
               a proper respect for his position in this House 
               <br />
               cannot vote contrary to the expressed wishes 
               <br />
               of his constituents; it is a doctrine which was 
               <br />
               never called in question until the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Montmorency considered that he 
               <br />
               ,might cast a doubt upon the eorrectness of it. 
               <br />
               Well, afact that none will venture to deny is, 
               <br />
               that several members promised their consti- 
               <br />
               tuents that they would vote in favor of an 
               <br />
               appeal to the people; and, by compelling them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> to accept the motion of the Honorable 
               <br />
               Attorney General for Upper Canada, eVery 
               <br />
               chance of their doing so is taken away. 
               <br />
               Placed as the are in this dilemma, the mem- 
               <br />
               bers who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> that promise, and who at the 
               <br />
               same time are in favor of the Government, 
               <br />
               ought not to hesitate as to the course to be 
               <br />
               pursued ; they ought to throw out this motion, 
               <br />
               for, if it should be adopted, Confederation will 
               <br />
               at once become an accomplished fact, and the 
               <br />
               appeal to the people will have to be given up.
