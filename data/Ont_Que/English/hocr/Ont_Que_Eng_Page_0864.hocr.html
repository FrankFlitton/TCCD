               carried on without their consent; whereas, 
               <br />
               under the new Constitution, the General 
               <br />
               Legislature will be composed of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">191</span> mem- 
               <br />
               bers, Lower Canada having 65, of whom

               14 at least will' be English and Protest-

               <br />
               51 members act together as one man, 
               <br />
               they will have to struggle against 143 
               <br />
               members of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> origin and a dif—

               ferent faith from themselves. Thus, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEA KER, I am convinced that the guaran- 
               <br />
               tees we enjoy under our present Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion—guarantees which are assured to us as 
               <br />
               long as we do not change our system of 
               <br />
               government—are inﬁnitely superior to those 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁered</span> to us by the new Constitution which 
               <br />
               it is sought to force upon the people. But 
               <br />
               we are told that the Federal Government 
               <br />
               will have the Catholic minority to deal with, 
               <br />
               and that the assistance of the latter will be 
               <br />
               absolutely necessary to carrying it on. Well, 
               <br />
               I ask, Mr. SPEAKER, what can a minority 
               <br />
               composed of 51 members do against a ma- 
               <br />
               jority of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">143;</span> and what protection can it 
               <br />
               oﬁ'er to our laws, our institutions and our 
               <br />
               language ? No; it is evident that all these 
               <br />
               things which we hold so dear may, under 
               <br />
               the Federal system, disappear and be anni- 
               <br />
               hilated at any moment; they will be con- 
               <br />
               stantly at the mercy of our natural enemies. 
               <br />
               In order to secure COnfederation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> have 
               <br />
               granted to Upper Canada representation 
               <br />
               based on population—a principle against 
               <br />
               which the peeple of Lower Canada have 
               <br />
               always voted as one man, and you have also 
               <br />
               granted everything that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ur</span> per Canadian 
               <br />
               delegates desired to obtain for themselves 
               <br />
               and their co-religionists. It is quite natural 
               <br />
               that the English members in Lower Canada 
               <br />
               should be nearly all in favor of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme,</span> 
               <br />
               since they have a sure guarantee in the veto 
               <br />
               power of the Federal Legislature. Thus 
               <br />
               the Local Legislature of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               cannot pass a single law without submitting 
               <br />
               it to the sanction ot the Federal Legislature, 
               <br />
               which can, by its veto, amend, change or 
               <br />
               completely annul, if it thinks proper, any 
               <br />
               law or any measure so submitted to it. But 
               <br />
               what guarantee will the Federal Legislature 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂ'er</span> to the French-Canadian majority of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, and to the Catholic minority 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada? None whatever. How 
               <br />

               by two members only, the hon. members for

               DONALD and Mr. DONALD A. MCDONALD). 
               <br />
               The great Conservative party, which styles 
               <br />
               itself the protector of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholicism,</span> has 
               <br />
               simply handed over the Catholic minorit of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada to the tender mercies of t eir 
               <br />
               enemies. And to give an idea of the kind 
               <br />
               of protection they will enjoy under the new 
               <br />
               system, it is sufﬁcient to state that a few 
               <br />
               days ago, Bishop LYNCH, of Toronto, was 
               <br />
               forced to address himself publicly, through 
               <br />
               the press, to the citizens of Toronto, to 
               <br />
               protest againsa the insults oﬂ'ercd in broad 
               <br />
               daylight, in the public streets of that city 
               <br />
               and elsewhere, to revered Sisters of 
               <br />
               Charity, and to ask protection for the vener- 
               <br />
               able ladies of that community; and then 
               <br />
               look at thefanatieal and intolerant writings, 
               <br />
               such as these I read to this Honorable llouse 
               <br />
               before the recess, from an article in the 
               <br />
               Globe of the 6th March—a paper which 
               <br />
               represents the Opinions of the present 
               <br />
               Government, and which is the organ and 
               <br />
               preperty of the Hon. President of the 
               <br />
               Executive Council (Hon. Mr. BROWN). 
               <br />
               Can it be said that we have nothing to fear, 
               <br />
               that the religious institutions of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada will be perfectly safe under the 
               <br />
               system sought to be introduced into the 
               <br />
               country? Does not the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency admit, in his famous pamphlet 
               <br />
               of 1865, that our religious institutions have 
               <br />
               many a time been insulted in this House? 
               <br />
               And has not the Bishop of Toronto just 
               <br />
               complained that Sisters of Charity have been 
               <br />
               insulted in the streets of the capital .of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, and that they have been 
               <br />
               turned into ridicule at masquerades and 
               <br />
               masked balls, frequented by the best society 
               <br />
               of that locality? And in order that every 
               <br />
               one may be convinced of the fact, I take 
               <br />
