               might have been able to form some opinion 
               <br />
               in regard to its cost. They might have 
               <br />
               called upon the engineer who surveyed 
               <br />
               the mute to make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sime</span> approximation 
               <br />
               of the probable outlay. When, in the 
               <br />
               absence of such information, I rise in my 
               <br />
               place and say that according to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bat</span> 
               <br />
               data at my command, it will cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">89.0.00",-</span> 
               <br />
               000, I am met by the Hon. President of the 
               <br />
               Council protesting against my making such 
               <br />
               a statement. But when I ask my honorable 
               <br />
               friend if he has not stated that it will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cost</span> 
               <br />
               $16,000,000 or $18,000,000, he replies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               he might have said it would cost $15,000,000. 
               <br />
               80 that, according to my hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himself.</span> 
               <br />
               it is safe to assume that for the Intercolonul 
               <br />
               Railway, the debt will be increased by 
               <br />
               $15,000,000. This,- then, is one of the ne' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>

               debts the new Government will be called

               upon immediately to contract. Then another
