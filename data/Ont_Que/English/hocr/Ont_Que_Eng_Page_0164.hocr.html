               the United States has failed. I, sir, have 
               <br />
               never said it. The Attorney General West

               <br />
               sider it a failure; and I remember that in 
               <br />
               1861, when in this House I remarked the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nine</span> thing, the only man who then applauded 
               <br />
               the statement was the Attorney General 
               <br />
               West-so that it is pretty plain he did not 
               <br />
               simply borrow the argument for use the 
               <br />
               the other night, when he was advocating a

               cales this ma seem, and yet not a failure 
               <br />

               <br />
               of it, and having discovered its defects, may 
               <br />
               apply a remedy and go on with it eighty
