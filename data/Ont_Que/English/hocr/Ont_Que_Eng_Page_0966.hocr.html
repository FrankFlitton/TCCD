               —the time of the union of the two provinces— 
               <br />

               religious rights from danger—I appeal, to 
               <br />
               prove it, to those men who ap lied all their 
               <br />
               energy, their abilities, and their patriotism 
               <br />
               to prevent the union; to those men who, 
               <br />
               endowed with a singleness of mind at least 
               <br />
               equal to that which animates the opponents of 
               <br />
               Confederation, procured numerous petitions to 
               <br />
               be signed against the union of Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada ; to those men, in short, who 
               <br />
               predicted that in ten years’ time there would 
               <br />
               not be a single French-Canadian left—these 
               <br />
               men I summon to the bar of public opinion, 
               <br />
               and I ask them—“ Gentlemen, did you predict 
               <br />
               truly? What has become of that French- 
               <br />
               Canadian nationality which was to be swal- 
               <br />
               lowed up by the union ? Has it disappeared, 
               <br />
               as you said it would ? See and judge for 
               <br />
               yourselves.” That nation, which was doomed 
               <br />
               to be annihilated, has built up Montreal, the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst commercial city in the two Canadas— 
               <br />
               Montreal, on which the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Richelieu (Mr. PERRAULT) pronounced such 
               <br />
               a pompous eulogy in his speech the other 
               <br />
               evening—an eulogy that be extended to 
               <br />
               the country generally—praising its immense 
               <br />
               resources and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">growinar</span> prosperity. It was 
               <br />
               under the union and through the union that 
               <br />
               the splendid Victoria Bridge was erected, the 
               <br />
               most magniﬁcent work of the kind in the 
               <br />
               world. Under its auspices, also, we con- 
               <br />
               structed those immense canals which have re- 
               <br />
               ceived honorable mention from the lips of the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Richelieu; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every.</span>

               eminently qualiﬁed to pronounce a judgment 
               <br />
               on such matters, having seen and examined 
               <br />
               the canals constructed in Europe. Accor- 
               <br />
               dingly we are justiﬁed in saying that our 
               <br />
               canals are immeasurably superior to the canals 
               <br />
               of Europe, as he tells us in respect to several 
               <br />
               of our canals, that a boy in the smallest of 
               <br />
               skiﬁs could touch the revêtement walls with 
               <br />
               his two tin ears. I must say that I do not 
               <br />
               accept the interpretation put on that part of 
               <br />

               able member for Montcalm (Mr. JOSEPH 
               <br />
               DUPBEBNE), in which he said that there were

               <br />

               French-Canadians—who are 'as eminent for
