               Aﬁer the four speeches that have already 
               <br />
               been delivered from this quarter of the 
               <br />
               House, it may very well be supposed that 
               <br />
               little of essential importance remains to be 
               <br />
               said. On Monday the Attorney General 
               <br />
               West, in exposing the case for the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, in moving this Address to Her 
               <br />
               Majesty, went very fully through all the 
               <br />
               items of the resolutions agreed upon at the 
               <br />
               Quebec Conference, and gave us a full 
               <br />
               analysis of the whole project with his own 
               <br />
               constitutional commentaries upon the pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings of that body. On the next evening, 
               <br />
               the Attorney General East gave us his views 
               <br />
               also, treating chieﬂy of the diﬁculties in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. The same night, my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, the Minister of Finance, gave us a 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial view of the whole subject; and last 
               <br />
               evening the Hon. President of the Council 
               <br />
               gave us another extended ﬁnancial and 
               <br />
               political address, with some arguments from 
               <br />
               “ the Upper Canadian point of view,” as the
