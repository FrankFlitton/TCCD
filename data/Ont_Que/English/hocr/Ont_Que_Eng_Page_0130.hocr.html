               <br />
               sidered such a proposition, I think it directly 
               <br />
               in point to prove the contrary by my honor—

               The next step in the constitutional itation 
               <br />
               of the country was the formation of the HOWN-

               DOBION Administration. That was in 1858—- 
               <br />
               and to show how serious my honorable friend
