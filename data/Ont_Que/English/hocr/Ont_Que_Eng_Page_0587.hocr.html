               HON. MB. DORION—In the course of my 
               <br />
               observations the other night, I did not 
               <br />
               examine the question from the point of 
               <br />
               view from which the honorable member 
               <br />
               from Quebec is now looking at it. That 
               <br />
               honorable member, if I have understood 
               <br />
               him rightly, afﬁrms that in the proposed con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the Federal Legislative Council 
               <br />
               there is no conserVativc principle to guaran- 
               <br />
               tee that the provinces will be represented in 
               <br />
               that Council, and he does so with justice. If 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Montmorenci will 
               <br />
               examine it attentively, he will see that the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               nominations are to be made by the existing 
               <br />
               governments. Thus the Government of Ca- 
               <br />
               nada, that of New Brunswick and that of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia will appoint legislative council- 
               <br />
               lors, but afterwards the Federal Government 
               <br />
               will make the appointments. The honorable 
               <br />
               member for Quebec can, with reason, draw 
               <br />
               the conclusion that there is no guarantee that 
               <br />
               the views of the provinces will be respected. 
               <br />
               I for my part have investigated the matter. 
               <br />
               more in connection with the power that will 
               <br />
               be vested in the legislative councillors. I 
               <br />
               asserted that by appointing them for life and 
               <br />
               limitiri their number, an absolute authority 
               <br />
