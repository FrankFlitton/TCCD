               Honorable Solicitor General East, for it is a 
               <br />
               principle of international law perfectly under- 
               <br />
               stood in every country of the civilized Wurld,

               the Constitution. I say, then, that not only 
               <br />
               will the Federal Government have this power, 
               <br />
               but they will also be able to change the civil

               <br />

               remove from the local legislatures the right of

               at which marriage is to be allowed, the degree 
               <br />
               of relationship Whit'h shall be an impediment to 
               <br />

               further, and I say that the leaving of this
