               <br />
               members opposed the motion for an appeal to 
               <br />

               question was one that ought not to have been 
               <br />
               brought before them, it being of a purely poli- 
               <br />
               tical character, and they rejected it without 
               <br />
               expressing my Opinion upon its real merits. 
               <br />
               Then, combined with them were the gentlemen

               who really oppose the appeal to the people, 
               <br />

               ha made a good case. I have anxiously

               waited to hear his reasons and explanations, 
               <br />
               for I wanted better reasons for adapting the

               resolutions than any I was acquainted with. 
               <br />
               I am anxious to have them carefully analyzed 
               <br />
               and scrutinized, and desire that they may be 
               <br />
               found in the interest of Canada. If the 
               <br />
               Government, in bringing them down, had 
               <br />

               <br />
               accepted the declaration with satisfaction and 
               <br />

               <br />
               we cannot proceed any further. They are

               opening S h from the Throne, an amend-

               of conﬁdence, and I can see no great use in 
               <br />
               discussing them at all. I desire, however, 
               <br />
               prior to the taking of the vote, to know how 
               <br />
               much the Intercolonial Railway will cost. 
               <br />
               Only a short time ago public Opinion in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada was adverse to this enterprise, but if 
               <br />
               new light has dawned upon the subject, I 
               <br />
               would be glad to share in it. I would like to 
               <br />
               know also what the route will be, and how 
               <br />
               many millions it will cost; and if it should be 
               <br />
               shown that its construction will be a real 
               <br />
               advantage to the country, I will be prepared 
               <br />
               to go for it. There are other points upon 
               <br />
               which I desire information, and one is as to 
               <br />
               the pro rtion of the debt which Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower anada will be called upon respectively 
               <br />
               to bear. If the Sixty—two and a-half millions 
               <br />
               of debt the Confederation is to assume is to 
               <br />
               be divided according to the extent of the 
               <br />
               two populations, will Lower Canada, over and 
               <br />
               above Its share, assume the amount paid for 
               <br />
               the abolition of the Seigniorial Tenure? These 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(prestions,</span> in my opinion, need answers before
