               repeat, that among the many curious results

               of the free exercise of their franchise by the

               that the Protestant champion of Lower

               <br />
               he promised this session, but now postpones 
               <br />
               till another session, when all the circum- 
               <br />
               stances may be changed. (Hear, hear.)

               HON. MR. GALT.—I think the interest

               <br />
               in this matter is somewhat remarkable. I 
               <br />
               feel grateful indeed to him for the kind soli-

               <br />
               which to a certain extent looks to me. Still
