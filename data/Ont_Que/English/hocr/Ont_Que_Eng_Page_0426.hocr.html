               of these points is as to whether such

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> such safeguards will be provided for

               Upon these points some apprehensions

               appear to exist in the minds of the English

               <br />
               my fear of injustice at the hands of the

               minority, to put some questions to my hon.

               friends in the Government. I wish to know 
               <br />
               what share of representation the En glish-

               Itwill be in the same proportion as their 
               <br />
               representation in this Parliament? This is 
               <br />
               one point in which I think the English in-

               HON. Mn. ROSE—Tho 23rd resolution

               <br />
               boundaries of each of them.” Then the 
               <br />
               24th resolution provides that “ the Local 
               <br />
               Legislature may from time to time alter the 
               <br />
