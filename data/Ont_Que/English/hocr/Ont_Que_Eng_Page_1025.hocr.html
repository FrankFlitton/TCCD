               <br />
               I was not so fortunate as to be in Parliament 
               <br />
               in 1861, and I have never happened to read 
               <br />
               the speech from which he quoted. I should 
               <br />
               be very sorry to misrepresent him, and per- 
               <br />
               haps I would have misrepresented him in 
               <br />
               making the statement I did, if I had read 
               <br />
               that speech. But I think he will hear me 
               <br />
               out in this, that at the British American 
               <br />
               League, some ﬁfteen years ago, he did vote 
               <br />
               and speak in favor of a legislative union.

               HON. MR. BOLTON—That body, at all 
               <br />
               events, did pass certain resolutions in favor 
               <br />
               of a legislative union. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               was a member of that body, and either voted 
               <br />
               for or against those resolutions—he can 
               <br />
               say which. My impression is that he sup- 
               <br />
               ported them. At all events, he will not 
               <br />
               deny that last session, in the debate on 
               <br />
               the Address, or on the motion of the hon— 
               <br />
               orable member for South Oxford, he did 
               <br />
               express an Opinion in favor of a Legislative 
               <br />
               union, as distinguished from a Federal union. 
               <br />
               It was shortly before the change of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and there was some difference between 
               <br />
               the two honorable gentlemen—the Hon. At- 
               <br />
               torney General East and the Hon. Attor- 
               <br />
               ney General West—who were then sitting 
               <br />
               on this side. And in the committee, formed 
               <br />
               on the motion of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               South Oxford, the Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               - West voted against the Federative system, 
               <br />
               and declared himself in favor of the Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive system in contradistinction to the other, 
               <br />
               and my impression was that he had uniformly 
               <br />
               held that ground. It now appears that in his 
               <br />
               speech of 1861 he shows that at that time he 
               <br />
               contemplated the possibility of a modiﬁed sort 
               <br />
               of Federation—a Federation very different, 
               <br />
               however, from the joint authority of the hon- 
               <br />
               orable member for South Oxford, who argues 
               <br />
               that this is the very measure of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion of 1859.
