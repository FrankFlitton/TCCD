               HON. MB. CAMPBELL—J am very glad

               to hear my hon. friend say so. I would

               <br />
               HON. MR. VIDAL—That question will 
               <br />
               be full answered when I come to touch 
               <br />
               upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> point. But I may state, that 
               <br />
               instead of oﬂ'ering a factions opposition by 
               <br />
               the course I intend taking, it is my loyalty 
               <br />
               to our Sovereign and country which induces 
               <br />
               me to support the amendment now before 
               <br />
               the House, not with the object of defeating 
               <br />
               this measure, but for securing its adoption 
               <br />
               on a broader and more permanent basis. 
               <br />
               How singular are the different views which 
               <br />
               are taken of our position and powers accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the manner in which we may vote 
               <br />
               upon this question ! In one breath we are 
               <br />
               told that we are the representatives of the 
               <br />
               people, and we have a perfect right- to vote 
               <br />
               upon it as we may see ﬁt; and in a few minutes 
               <br />
               afterwards, we are informed that if we do not 
               <br />
               vote upon it in a certain manner, we do not 
               <br />
               represent the people. I cannot possibly 
               <br />
               reconcile the two statements. It is alsosaid 
               <br />
               ——and it is the only ar ment I have heard 
               <br />
               on the point-—if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indeeguit</span> can be called an 
               <br />
               argument at all—that if the present oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of securing the union of the provinces 
               <br />
               is allowed to pass unimproved, it will be a 
               <br />
               lon time before we may look for another. 
               <br />
               I a mit that the opportunity is one which 
               <br />
               has been long desired, and one which it will 
               <br />
               be wise policy to improve ; and it will be my 
               <br />
               humble endeavor to seek to do so to the best 
               <br />
               advantage. But if the measure is in reality 
               <br />
               fraught with the beneﬁts which have been 
               <br />
               claimed for it, I cannot see how it will be 
               <br />
               jeopardized by a little delay; because the 
               <br />
               more its beneﬁts are looked into, the better, 
               <br />
               it is reasonable to suppose, the people will 
               <br />
               be satisﬁed with them. I cannot see how 
               <br />
               the measure will be endangered by giving 
               <br />
               both the people and their representatives a 
               <br />
               little longer time to become acquainted with 
               <br />
               its principles and its details. Since the 
               <br />
               commencement of the debate in this House, 
               <br />
               much light has been thrown on the scheme, 
               <br />
               and we .have had the advantage of the 
               <br />
               explanations in the other Chamber, and I 
               <br />
               am sure that the minds of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               must now be much better informed on parti-

               cular points of the scheme than they were 
               <br />
               bel'ore we came here. For my own part, 
               <br />
               after having had my mind frequently direct- 
               <br />
               ed to it, and after having listened attentively 
               <br />
               to the arguments of all the speakers, I am 
               <br />
               more and more impressed with the magni- 
               <br />
               tude and importance of the various interests 
               <br />
               on which our action is invited in thi. mat-

               ter, and I think we should proceed cautiously 
               <br />
               and slowly in takin the step before us—a 
               <br />
               change so great as t at contemplated by the 
               <br />
               framers of these resolutions—-a chAnge 
               <br />
               amounting to nothing less than, as I before 
               <br />
               observed, a revolution in the whole system of 
               <br />
               governing the country. This is a step which, 
               <br />
               in order to be permanently successful, must 
               <br />
               rest on the principles of truth and justice, 
               <br />
               and these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principles</span> must be intelligently 
               <br />
               apprehended by the eople to be governed. 
               <br />
               Notwithstanding all t at h.s been advanced 
               <br />
               in this chamber—all the assertions which 
               <br />
               have been made—in reference to the inform — 
               <br />

               <br />
               this country relative to this measure, I must 
               <br />
               sa that I do not coincide in that opinion. 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> that the people of the country, as 
               <br />
               a whole, are not acquainted with the details. 
               <br />
               What new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">light</span> has there been thrown 
               <br />
               on the resolutions since we assembled here ? 
               <br />
               Have we not had our attention <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">directed</span> to 
               <br />
               the fact that even some who assisted in 
               <br />
               framing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> resolutions, did not themselves 
               <br />
               know precisely what some of them meant? 
               <br />
               Moreover, is it not the fact that the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the country has not to any great ex- 
               <br />
               tent been called to any arguments against the 
               <br />
               scheme? Now, in order to a right apprecia- 
               <br />
               tion of the value aud importance of the 
               <br />
               proposed Confederation, it is right that the 
               <br />
               people should know and understand both 
               <br />
               sides of the question. They should not be 
               <br />
               carried away with the pleasing prospect held 
               <br />
               out to them of the advantages to be derived 
               <br />
               from torming part of a great Confederation, 
               <br />
               without being told at the same time of the 
               <br />
               cost at which these advantages are to he 
               <br />
               purchased. And this is all the more necessary 
               <br />
               because the movement did not originate with 
               <br />
               the people. All great constitutional changes 
               <br />
               ought to and usually do originate with 
               <br />
               the people. But this is an anomaly. Here 
               <br />
               we have a proposed Constitution framed by 
               <br />
               a self-elected body—I do not use the term 
               <br />
               reproachfully, because I hold that these hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen did perfectly right in so meetin
