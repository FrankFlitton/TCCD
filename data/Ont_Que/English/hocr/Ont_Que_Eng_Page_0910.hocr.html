               MR. SPEAKER decided as follows:— 
               <br />
               “The original motion, made by the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General for Upper Canada, is that 
               <br />
               the House should concur in certain resolu-

               <br />
               the Hon. Attorney General for Upper Ca-

               nada moves, not in amendment in my Opinion, 
               <br />
               ‘ that that question be now put.’ The sub— 
               <br />
               stance of . an amendment is to alter the ori— 
               <br />
               ginal question. Does this motion alter the 
               <br />
               original question? So far from that, it is a 
               <br />
               proposal to bring that question before the 
               <br />
               House for immediate decision. The autho-

               rities cited to show that this motion is an 
               <br />
               amendment sustain the contrary view ii. my 
               <br />
               judgment, because they only state that the

               previous questim is ‘in the nature of an 
               <br />

               it would be stated that it was in fact an

               the original proposition, if carried. ence 
               <br />
               I conclude that ‘ The previous question’ is 
               <br />
               not an amendment. The objection that the

               Hon. Attorney General for Upper Canada 
               <br />

               <br />
               posed the original motion, in my opinion is 
               <br />
               not valid.”

               <br />
               rise at this late period of the debate to oﬁ'er

               British North American Provinces; and my 
               <br />
               hesitation is the greater that I am under the 
               <br />
               necessity, not only of speaking on a question 
               <br />

               <br />
               cussed, that it would appear almost impos-

               sible to say anything which may interest hon.

               <br />
               after long and deliberate consideration—after 
               <br />
               carefully weighing the gist and tendency of 
               <br />
               these resolutions, and tracing out the effects 
               <br />
               which cannot fail, I believe, to result from 
               <br />
               the measure of which they are the exponents— 
               <br />
               I feel myself bound, Mr. SPEAKER, to aban-

               those questions on which those party feelings

               not conceive how, in considering a question 
               <br />
               which, in my opinion, imperils all that we 
               <br />
               hold most dear, and opens to us, if it is

               carried, the prospect of a future, dark with 
               <br />
               clouds, portending evil not only to us Lower

               and lay aside my fears and the sense of duty 
               <br />
               which binds me here, to yield blind obedience
