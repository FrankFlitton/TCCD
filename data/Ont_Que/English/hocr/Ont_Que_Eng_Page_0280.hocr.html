               HON. Ma. DORION—I mean to say that 
               <br />
               the inhabitants of the city of Montreal pay a 
               <br />
               great deal more than the inhabitants of any 
               <br />
               similar portion of any of the provinces, and 
               <br />
               that the district of Montreal consumes as much 
               <br />
               as any other section of the same extent and 
               <br />
