               HON. Mn. CAMERON—Then, I will 
               <br />
               proceed to oﬁ'er to the House the obser- 
               <br />
               vations which I think it necessary to make, 
               <br />
               as well on the general subject as on the 
               <br />
               particular matter embraced in this motion. 
               <br />
               And as the House is aware that I very 
               <br />
               rarely trouble it with a speech on any mat- 
               <br />
               ter, unless I consider it to be one of impor— 
               <br />
               tance, and that when I do I seldom detain 
               <br />
               hon. members at any considerable length, I 
               <br />
               trust they will bear with me in those ob- 
               <br />
               servations. Considering the length of time 
               <br />
               that the subject has been discussed, and the 
               <br />
               great desire that exists in the mind of every 
               <br />
               one to have this subject brought to a con- 
               <br />
               clusion as rapidly as possible, I promise on 
               <br />
               this occasion to be brief. I have already, so 
               <br />
               far as my own individual vote in this House 
               <br />
               is concerned, done exactly what I would have 
               <br />
               done if I had only been an elector called upon 
               <br />
               for his vote. We have pronounced upon the 
               <br />
               resolutions submitted to the House, and I 
               <br />
               have shewu my own conviction of their pro— 
               <br />
               priety by having voted in their favor; and 
               <br />
               if I were to exercise my franchise as an 
               <br />
               elector, I would do outside the House what 
               <br />
               I have done inside the House, and declare 
               <br />
               in favor of these resolutions, though not 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that the scheme for the Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation of the provinces would be so advan- 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               tageous as the larger scheme of a legislative 
               <br />
               union. But I have always felt that if you 
               <br />
               desire to obtain something which you believe 
               <br />
               for the beneﬁt of the country, you should 
               <br />
               not insist upon that which is impossible-— 
               <br />
               that which cannot be carried, but should 
               <br />
               endeavor to obtain that which you can fairly 
               <br />
               reach, and by and by you may get that 
               <br />
               which, at a far distance, seems impossible. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I believe the Confederation 
               <br />
               of the colonies will lead hereafter to a legis- 
               <br />
               lative union. The only diﬂiculty I have felt 
               <br />
               'is, that I believe it would have been inﬁn-

               itely better if all the powers given to local 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> Government, so that when the time 
               <br />
               came—when all those smaller stars should 
               <br />
               fall from the ﬁrmament—the General Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment would possess all those powers, and 
               <br />
               there would be no necessity then for framing 
               <br />
               a new Constitution. This subject, I think, 
               <br />
               may be fairly considered under three aspects. 
               <br />
               First, as regards the necessity of a change in 
               <br />
               the Constitution at all. Secondly, as regards 
               <br />
               the nature of the change proposed, and how 
               <br />
               it will affect the interests involved in it. 
               <br />
               And, thirdly, as regards the propriety of the 
               <br />
               measure being submitted to the people, 
               <br />
               before it is ﬁnally enacted by the Imperial 
               <br />
               Legislature. As to the ﬁrst point—the 
               <br />
               necessity of a change—I believe there are 
               <br />
               very few peeple in the country, in whatever 
               <br />
               part of it they ma be found, who will be 
               <br />
               prepared to say t at some change <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ii</span> the 
               <br />
               Constitution of the country has not become 
               <br />
               necessary. I believe we are all satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               things cannot go on as they are now. I 
               <br />
               believe we are all satisﬁed that the people 
               <br />
               are looking out for some alteration, by which 
               <br />
               they hepe a greater amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘of</span> prosperity 
               <br />
               may come to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> than that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> 
               <br />
               has been around it and about it for some 
               <br />
               years past. I am ﬁrmly convinced in my 
               <br />
               own mind—a ainst the opinions of one or 
               <br />
               two hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gengemen,</span> who stood up here the 
               <br />
               other night—that there has not been, since 
               <br />
               the union of these provinces, a greater 
               <br />
               amount of depression, a greater want of 
               <br />
               feeling of prosperity throughout the whole 
               <br />
               western portion of Canada, than exists 
               <br />
               there at this moment. I believe that into 
               <br />
               whatever of the country you go, you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd t at a succession of bad crops, and 
               <br />
               the diﬁculties which have arisen from large 
               <br />
               sums of money having been borrowed at 
               <br />
               high interest, and the necessity of large 
               <br />
               remittances to England—that all these have 
               <br />
               pressed heavily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on,</span> the energies of the 
               <br />
               peeple, and tended to paralyse them; and 
               <br />
               they are looking out, therefore, in every 
               <br />
               direction, with the best hopes they can 
               <br />
               conjure up, for some change or alteration, 
               <br />
               such as they believe will place them on a 
               <br />
               better footing than that which they have 
               <br />
               hitherto occupied. (Hear, hear.) The Hon.
