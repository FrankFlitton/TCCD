               of British North America. They have come 
               <br />
               to an understanding with the sister provinces, 
               <br />
               and now lay before you their scheme of a 
               <br />
               Confederation. We are not now to inquire 
               <br />
               whether all the details of the scheme per- 
               <br />
               fectly agree in every point with our particu- 
               <br />
               lar ideas, but whether the change is neces- 
               <br />
               sary, whether the proposed scheme is good 
               <br />
               and ﬁt to be accepted as a whole; for, as 
               <br />
               the scheme is a compromise between differ- 
               <br />
               ent parties, whose interests are at variance 
               <br />
               with each other, the Government who now 
               <br />
               move its adoption must be held to be respon— 
               <br />
               sible for all its details. Any amendment of 
               <br />
               the plan passed by this House would really 
               <br />
               be a vote of want of conﬁdence in the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and on must therefore either 
               <br />
               ‘ adopt the plan as laid before you, or pass a vote 
               <br />
               of want of conﬁdence in the present Adminis- 
               <br />
               tration. Now, I for my part am not prepared 
               <br />
               to vote a want of conﬁdence in the men now 
               <br />
               in power. To induce me to do that, I _must 
               <br />
               see in their opponents a better security for 
               <br />
               good government, and its advantages to the 
               <br />
               country, than they are able to show; I 
               <br />
               must hope to ﬁnd in the latter something 
               <br />
               better than what I ﬁnd in those whose 
               <br />
               measures they withstand. So far, I do 
               <br />
               not ﬁnd that they have offered, nor do 
               <br />
               Iﬁnd that they now offer, such security 
               <br />
               or such hope. Far from it; if we are to 
               <br />
               judge them by their former acts, we must 
               <br />
               confess that we cannot give them our con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdeuce, that they have displayed great want 
               <br />
               of capacity for the government and manage- 
               <br />
               ment of the affairs of the country. When 
               <br />
               they were in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power,</span> they had no decided 
               <br />
               policy, they were incapable of dealing with 
               <br />
               any important question: they 'lived from 
               <br />
               hand to mouth. Their acts in the Adminis- 
               <br />
               tration were stamped with a spirit of resent- 
               <br />
               ment and injustice towards their adversaries. 
               <br />
               They instituted commissions of inquiry, for 
               <br />
               instance, against public ofﬁcers, in order to 
               <br />
               get a pretext for dismissing them and making 
               <br />
               room for their hungry partisans. Again, 
               <br />
               have they any better plan to propose to us 
               <br />
               than that of the Government? No ! They 
               <br />
               might offer us, perhaps, representation based 
               <br />
               0!! pepulation, or annexation to the United 
               <br />
               States; but I do not think such remedies 
               <br />
               would suit our taste. In these circum- 
               <br />
               stances, I have no hesitation in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decliring</span>

               Ma. BLANCHET said—Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               as no one is disposed to take the ﬂoor just 
               <br />
               now, and it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> seem as if all who intend 
               <br />
               to discuss this question are bent on having 
               <br />
               a large audience in the galleries, I shall 
               <br />
               take upon me to say a few words. Those 
               <br />
               who moved to have the speeches of this 
               <br />
               House printed in oﬂicial form certainly did 
               <br />
               no good service to the country; for all are 
               <br />
               trying which shall make the longest speech, 
               <br />
               and I do not think it is altogether just to 
               <br />
               the public purse. Each one would speak at 
               <br />
               a particular hour, and to the ears of a cer- 
               <br />
               tain audience; but the history of the Par- 
               <br />
               liament of England shews that her great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statesmen</span> and orators did not concern them- 
               <br />
               selves about that. The greatest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and“</span> most 
               <br />
               important speeches were delivered in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons at a very late hour of 
               <br />
               the night; thus Fox delivered his great 
               <br />
               speech on the East India Bill at two o’clock 
               <br />
               in the morning; PITT his on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abolition</span> of 
               <br />
               the slave trade at four o’clock in the morn- 
               <br />
               ing; and we should lose nothing by speaking 
               <br />
               But 
               <br />
               as the honorable member for Montmorency

               <br />
               and I wish to explain my way of thinking 
               <br />
               on the question, I rise to do so. This 
               <br />
               question of Confederation is not a new one. 
               <br />
               It has already agitated men’s minds and 
               <br />
               been a subject of debate for a great many 
               <br />
               years. Now public Opin:on is completely 
               <br />
               made up concerning it. I have no occasion 
               <br />
               to enter into details respecting the schème 
               <br />
               which we have before us. It has been dis- 
               <br />
               cussed with much more of knowledge and 
               <br />
               precision than I bring to the consideration 
               <br />
               of the subject, by the members of the Gov- 
               <br />
