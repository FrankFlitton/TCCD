               we complained of, and I then, and have 
               <br />
               ever since, felt that it would be better 
               <br />
               for the two provinces to separate than 
               <br />

               <br />
               the demand for an increased representation, 
               <br />
               and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religious</span> cries associated with it. 
               <br />
               For my part, I have never, like some honor-

               presided over that kind of political organi-

               zations known as conventions, not believing

               <br />

               <br />
               labored. The effect of those conventions 
               <br />
               was to add fuel to the agitation which was 
               <br />
               already sundering the country. That such 
               <br />
               should be the result Ideeply regret, inasmuch 
               <br />
               as some of the dearest friends I have in the 
               <br />
               world are not only Lower Canadians, but 
               <br />
               adherents of a different faith. The fruit 
               <br />
               of this sectional hostility and discord we now 
               <br />
               see in the demand which has sprung up for 
               <br />
               Federation with all its concomitant burdens. 
               <br />
               I can lay no blame to my conscience for 
               <br />
               having assisted to bring about so unnatural 
               <br />
               a state of things, and whatever may be the 
               <br />
               consequences of the new condition of politi-

               cal existence towards which we are appa— 
               <br />
               rently drifting, my skirts, I rejoice to say, 
               <br />
               are clear, for I have had no hand or part in 
               <br />
               it. We are told that if this scheme is car- 
               <br />
               ried out, Upper Canada will be entitled to the 
               <br />
               great advantage of having in the House of 
               <br />

               <br />
               additional members. But what real advan- 
               <br />
               tage is thisto be to the country ? Do we desire 
               <br />
               17 additional members for the purpose of 
               <br />
               crushing Lower Canada—is that what is 
               <br />
               meant? I answer, no. But even supposing we 
               <br />
               have 17 additional members—supposing re- 
               <br />
               presentation by population is conceded in the 
               <br />
               new order of things—wLat will be the gain 
               <br />
               to Upper Canada? Will these 17 new 
               <br />
               members cure the evils of which we 
               <br />
               complain ? Will they be able to reduce the 
               <br />
               excessive expenditures under which we are 
               <br />
               now laboring, and which have been one of 
               <br />
               the causes of the agitation for constitutional 
               <br />
               changes? I do not believe a word of it. 
               <br />
               Supposing Upper Canada has a larger repre- 
               <br />
               sentation by that number than Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, you must remember that Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, with the eastern provinces, is en- 
               <br />
               titled to 112 members ; so that Upper 
               <br />
               Canada would still be in a large minority of 
               <br />

               <br />
               from which it appears that our debt amounts

               <br />
               and bankers' balances, 87,132,000, leaves 
               <br />
               a balance of 868,446,000 as the actual debt 
               <br />
               of Canada, to be borne by the people of this

               province under any scheme that can be con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the already existing debt, would make our 
               <br />
               direct debt 883,446,000. This increase in 
               <br />
               our debt will be one of the fruits of Con-
