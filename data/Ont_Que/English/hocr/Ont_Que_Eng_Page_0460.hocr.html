               have over three millions of square miles of

               British Government, and our Sovereign, with 
               <br />
               this language: “We desire, by your aid,

               with your sanction and permission, to attempt 
               <br />

               whose history will be written in her lan— 
               <br />
               guage.” That was the language of the

               Colonial Secretary, Sir BULWER <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">erron,</span> 
               <br />
               when he proposed and carried ont the setting 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">05</span> of a new colony on the Paciﬁc shore— 
               <br />
               language certainly which indicated a ﬁrm 
               <br />
               and sure reliance in the power and cﬂicacy 
               <br />
               of British institutions—that these institu-

               tions would be found capable of all the 
               <br />
               expansion requisite to meet the circumstances 
               <br />

               freeman to whom the care of these institu-

               tions maybe entrusted. (Hear, hear.) But 
               <br />
               Ifear I have been tempted to forget the 
               <br />
               excellent example of my honorable friend 
               <br />
               from Lambton. (Cries of “No, no,” “go

               on.”) I desire very brieﬂy to notice two or 
               <br />
               three immediate advantages which, in my 
               <br />
               judgment, would be derived from the 
               <br />
               consummation, under one central power 
               <br />
               with local municipal parliaments, of a union 
               <br />
               of the Canadas with the Maritime Provinces. 
               <br />
               Let us glance at what is their position, in 
               <br />
               relation to the great military power which 
               <br />
               ia rising on the other side of the lines. Let 
               <br />
               usseewhat they are thinking of us there. 
               <br />
               One of their eminent statesmen suggested 
               <br />
               some years ago, that they should cultivate 
               <br />
               our acquaintance, while we were still 
               <br />
               “incurious of our destiny.” But we have 
               <br />
               passed that state. We have become curious

               Is not that the position in which we .have

               long been ? And I believe the result of this

               union will be to do away with that state of 
               <br />
               things. (Hear, hear.) I believe that when 
               <br />
               these colonies are combined, acting in 
               <br />
               concert, and quickened and invigorated by a 
               <br />
               feeling of mutual dependence and interest, 
               <br />
               the tendency will be to increase their wealth

               and manufactures, and general strength. 
               <br />
               And, sir, I am satisﬁed one of the great 
               <br />
               advantages of this union will be found in this 
               <br />
               that we will be raised above our sectionalisms, 
               <br />
               and come to feel and to act as the citizens 
               <br />
               of a great country, with destinies committed 
               <br />
               to us such as may well evoke the energies of 
               <br />
               a great peOple. But I desire to point out 
               <br />
               another practical advantage which, I think, 
               <br />
               is of no mean or slight moment; and it 
               <br />
               is this z—Bound as we are to England, 
               <br />
               by the closest ties, and yet enjoying our own 
               <br />
               government, England is still compelled to 
               <br />
               act for us in all matters of an international 
               <br />
               nature. But, when we have for all these 
               <br />
               British provinces one General Government, 
               <br />
               able to take an oversight of the whole, and 
               <br />
               to attend to all their various interests, we 
               <br />
               will be able to represent to Britain on 
               <br />
               behalf of the whole, with a force and power 
               <br />
               we have never before been able to use, what 
               <br />
               these interests are ; we will be able to press 
               <br />
               them home on the attention of British 
               <br />
               statesmen in such a manner as will lead them 
               <br />
               to appreciate, and seek to protect those in- 
               <br />
               terests in their negotiations with foreign 
               <br />
               powers. I would allude, as an illustration 
               <br />
               of what I mean, to the Reciprocity Treaty, 
               <br />
               and I cannot refrain from reading a very 
               <br />
               striking extract from a report presented to 
               <br />
               the United States House of Representatives, 
               <br />
               in 1862, from the Committee of Commerce on 
               <br />
               the Reciprocity Treaty. I ask the attention
