               and some obj actionable features which I see in

               the scheme. I do not intend to advert in 
               <br />
               detail to these, for I feel'that I have to con- 
               <br />
               sider this question as a whole, and that 
               <br />
               unless I see objections to it, so great and 
               <br />
               numerous as to make me vote against it as a 
               <br />
               whole, it is useless to criticise that which I 
               <br />
               cannot mend. The scheme is in the nature 
               <br />
               of a treaty. It will not do to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">caril</span> at this 
               <br />
               or at that; we must either accept it or 
               <br />
               reject it. (Hear, hear.) I see the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁcul-</span> 
               <br />
               ties of the scheme, and the inequalities of 
               <br />
               it; but we must not complain if one colony 
               <br />
               gets a few thousand dollars more than 
               <br />
               another, or if one colony has to assume more 
               <br />
               of the debt than another. Unless I saw 
               <br />
               enough in the whole scheme to make me 
               <br />
               vote against it, I think it would be a mere 
               <br />
               waste of time to cavil at these small matters. 
               <br />
               Because without the consent of all the other 
               <br />
               colonies they cannot be altered, and on the 
               <br />
               whole there is no reason why the whole 
               <br />
               scheme should be rejected, and these slight 
               <br />
               inequalities will soon right themselves. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) There is one thing I would 
               <br />
               ask the House to consider —apart from the 
               <br />
               higher consideration of defence; apart from 
               <br />
               the cementing of our union with England, 
               <br />
               which I believe is involved in the adoption 
               <br />
               of this measure, and apart from the chance 
               <br />
               of our falling a prey to the United States-— 
               <br />
               and it is this: are we prepared, looking at 
               <br />
               Canada alone, to go back to the old state 
               <br />
               of things of twelve or eighteen months ago ? 
               <br />
               Are we willing to revert to the chronic state 
               <br />
               of crisis in which we constantly found our— 
               <br />
               selves for years past? (Hear, hear.) This 
               <br />
               House and the whole Government had lost 
               <br />
               the confidence of the country, and the most 
               <br />
               lamentable recriminations and diﬁculties ex- 
               <br />
               1stcd on the ﬂoor of this chamber. Indeed 
               <br />
               at the time of which I speak affairs were in 
               <br />
               such a state as to make every man with any 
               <br />
               feeling of self-respect disposed to abandon 
               <br />
               public life. I thihk we see in this alone 
               <br />
               enough to reconcile us to the change, and I 
               <br />
               believe I should see suﬁicicnt cause in this 
               <br />
               to induce me to Vote for a change in our 
               <br />
               political system. The dread of going back 
               <br />
               to the past, the apprehension lest old party 
               <br />
               cries should be' revived, and the fear lest 
               <br />
               difﬁculties in which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span> ourselves 
               <br />
               might be perpetuated, would impel me to vote 
               <br />
               for the scheme now in our ha nds. (Hear, hear.)
