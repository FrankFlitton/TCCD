               Sir, this is not the language of an enthusi-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">est</span> or a visionary, but the opinion of one

               perfectly acquainted with the subject, and 
               <br />
               eminently capable of discussing it—one, too, 
               <br />
               whose judgment was certainly not biased by 
               <br />
               national prejudice. And again, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               on a more recent occasion we ﬁnd the Pre- 
               <br />
               mier of the United States, the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               SEWABD, using the following language :— 
               <br />
               Hitherto, in common with most of my country- 
               <br />
               men, as I suppose, I have thought Canada—or to 
               <br />
               speak more accurately, British America—to be a 
               <br />
               mere strip, lying north of the United States, 
               <br />
               easil detachable from the parent state, but in- 
               <br />
               capa le of sustaining itself, and therefore ulti- 
               <br />
               mately—nay, right soon—to be taken on by the 
               <br />
               Federal union, without materially changing or 
               <br />
               affecting its own condition or develo ment. I 
               <br />
               have dropt that Opinion as a nation conceit. 
               <br />
               I see in British North America, stretching as 
               <br />
               it does across the continent from the shores of 
               <br />
               Labrador and Newfoundland to the Paciﬁc, and 
               <br />
               occupying a considerable belt of the temperate 
               <br />
               zone—traversed, equally with the United States, 
               <br />
               by the lakes, and enjoying the magniﬁcent shores 
               <br />
               of the St. Lawrence, with its thousands of islands 
               <br />
               in the river and gulf, a region grand enough for 
               <br />
               the seat of a great empire. 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, the great consideration with 
               <br />
               me is how can we best preserve for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our.</span> 
               <br />
               selves and for our children the essence of 
               <br />
               British institutions; by what means can we 
               <br />
               best prolong the connection which now so 
               <br />
               happily exists between England and our- 
               <br />
               selves, with mutual advantage and with 
               <br />
               equal satisfaction to both parties; and how 
               <br />
               can we best prepare, when the time comes, 
               <br />
               as in the natural course of events it most 
               <br />
               assuredly will, to assume the responsibility 
               <br />
               of a separate and independent nationality? 
               <br />
               Sir, by uniting the scattered and now insig-

               <br />
               consolidate and strengthen British feeling

               <br />
