               ourselves. Look at our bonds in the English 
               <br />
               market. The British public are under the 
               <br />
               apprehension that we may at any moment 
               <br />
               be invaded by the United States, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> 
               <br />
               the views of the Manchester school may 
               <br />
               prevail, and our 5 per cents stand at 80. 
               <br />
               The position of the United States along 
               <br />
               our long exposed border is such that 
               <br />
               in their present excited and ready-armed 
               <br />
               condition we might be plunged into hostili- 
               <br />
               ties at any moment, and therefore our 
               <br />
               Government ought to say to the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government that it was absolutely necessary 
               <br />
               to make arrangements for defence on a_large 
               <br />
               scale—that we are prepared to do that which 
               <br />
               we ought to do, but you cannot expect us to 
               <br />
               gotothe whole of the expense which would be 
               <br />
               entailed by the depreciation of our bonds in 
               <br />
               the market. If we are to do so, or even to go 
               <br />
               to any large expense, you must guarantee 
               <br />
               our debentures. With the knowledge that 
               <br />
               you are our security, we need not care 
               <br />
               whether the United States is going to cross 
               <br />
               our border with hostile intent or not. If 
               <br />
               our neighbors know that any requisite 
               <br />
               amount will be given us either upon your 
               <br />
               loan or upon endorsement, so that our 
               <br />
               bonds will stand on the market at par, they 
               <br />
               will have reason to think twice before attack- 
               <br />
               ing us. When the English Government are 
               <br />
               prepared to back us in that way, then I say 
               <br />
               we ought to go forward and coéperate with 
               <br />
               them in carrying out an extended system of 
               <br />
               defensive works, bearing at least the prin- 
               <br />
               cipal portion of the burden. We do not care 
               <br />
               for their spending £50,000 ayear in drib- 
               <br />
               bling up afew fortiﬁcations at Quebec, while 
               <br />
               We put another small sum out in patching 
               <br />
               up earth works in the west, just to invite 
               <br />
               the Americans over when the works are half 
               <br />
               built, forming a trap for ourselves in which 
               <br />
               we may be more effectually caught. I am 
               <br />
               sure every member of this House, and every 
               <br />
               citizen of Canada must have been surprised 
               <br />
               at the position taken by English statesmen 
               <br />
               in reference to Canadian defences, and at 
               <br />
               their speaking of there being only a few days 
               <br />
               in the year in which men could work, in this 
               <br />
               climate, in building fortiﬁcations. I read the 
               <br />
               other day, that it had been stated in England 
               <br />
               that there was only a month of the year that 
               <br />
               men could work out of doors to advantage. 
               <br />
               Although it is true that for about half the 
               <br />
               year our communication with the sea is cut 
               <br />

               branch of the work required in erecting 
               <br />
               fortiﬁcations. But so far as guarding 
               <br />
               against attack from the United States is 
               <br />
               concerned, the great thing is to let them know 
               <br />
               that, whether we spend the money im- 
               <br />
               mediately—this summer—or not, we have it 
               <br />
               to spend. It’ should be known that both 
               <br />
               the Im rial Parliament and the Pro- 
               <br />
               vincial arliament have voted the money, 
               <br />
               and that it would be put into the 
               <br />
               most approved fortiﬁcations as rapidly as it 
               <br />
               could be. The peeple of _the South soon 
               <br />
               built fortiﬁcations, behind which to ﬁght for 
               <br />
               their liberties, and we too shoul prepared 
               <br />
               to ﬁght for our liberties. It is to the money 
               <br />
               they spent in fortiﬁcations that they owe 
               <br />
               their existence as a formidable power at the 
               <br />
               present time. The idea should not go 
               <br />
               abroad that we are about to spend a little 
               <br />
               matter of ﬁfty orahundred thousand pounds 
               <br />

               <br />
               mason work there, but we should proceed 
               <br />
               as rapidly as possible to show that we are 
               <br />
               prepared to expend in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effective</span> works all 
               <br />
               the money that may be necessary to put 
               <br />
               ourselves in a condition to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resist</span> invasion, 
               <br />
               even with a handful of tr00ps, until 
               <br />
               more can be sent us. As we are at pre- 
               <br />
               sent, the Government of the United 
               <br />
               States feel that we are at their mercy, and 
               <br />
               that they can deal with us as they please. 
               <br />
               To-day they impose an obnoxious passport 
               <br />
               system upon us, and to-morrow they relieve 
               <br />
               us from that source of annoyance. To-day 
               <br />
               they threaten us with a repeal of the Reci- 
               <br />
               procity treaty, and to-morrow will, perhaps, 
               <br />
               be prepared, if we are good children, to 
               <br />
               continue its operation. To-day the bonding 
               <br />
               system is to be repealed ; to-morrow we hear 
               <br />
               no more of it. Next we hear of their inten- 
               <br />
               tion of placing a force of gunbcats on the lakes, 
               <br />
               and then we hear that the intention has been 
               <br />
               abandoned. What are all these fair pro- 
               <br />
               mises they indulge in, and good feelings they 
               <br />
               endeavor to call up, but blinds of their real 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpose?</span> Does anybody believe that it is

               not in their hearts to do all those things 
               <br />
               with which they threaten us, and is it not 
               <br />
               our duty to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂepared</span> to meet the conse-

               quences of their threats being carried into 
               <br />
               execution? They now see that we are being 
               <br />
               aroused in this country, and they begin to 
               <br />
               treat us more mildly, until they come to 
               <br />
               some settlement with the South. They be- 
               <br />
               gin to see that they have acted aggressively 
               <br />
               against this paw of the British lion a little 
               <br />
               too soon—that the British lion is in danger
