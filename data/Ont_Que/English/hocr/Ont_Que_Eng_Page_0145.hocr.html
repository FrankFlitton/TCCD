               I am quite sure that the almost forgotten 
               <br />
               publication in which it appeared was ne-

               person who delivered the speech on

               that occasion. But I will own when I saw 
               <br />
               my bantling held up to the admiration of 
               <br />
               the House in the delicate and fostering hands 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Hochelaga, I was 
               <br />
               not ashamed of it ; on the contrary, perhaps 
               <br />
               there was. some tingling of parental pride 
               <br />
               when I saw what ten years ago I pointed out 
               <br />
               as the true position for these colonies to take, 
               <br />

               think it ought to be made a matter of re-

               importance of the subject, that ten years ago 
               <br />
               I used the identical phrase employed in the 
               <br />
               Speech from the Throne. The idea itself is 
               <br />
               a good one, and it may have ﬂoated through 
               <br />
               the minds of many men and received intel- 
               <br />
               lectual hospitality even from the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga himself. One is re-

               minded by this sort of thing, of Puﬁ' in the

               <br />
               My honorable friend is in this respect, no

               ality. (Renewed laughter.) If there is any- 
               <br />
               thing in the article he has read to the House 
               <br />
               which is deserving of disapprobation, he is

               <br />
               (Renewed laughter.) Really, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               the attempt to ﬁx the parentage of this child 
               <br />

               futile. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isoalmost</span> as ridiculous as the at- 
               <br />
               tempt to ﬁx the name of this new Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, in advance of the decision of the 
               <br />
               Gracious Lady to whom the matter is to be 
               <br />
               referred. I have read in one newspaper 
               <br />
               published in a western city not less than a 
               <br />
               dozen attempts of this nature. One indi- 
               <br />
               vidual chooses Tuponia and another Hochel- 
               <br />
               aga, as a suitable name for the new national- 
               <br />
               ity. Now I would ask any hon. member of 
               <br />
               this House how he would feel if he woke up 
               <br />
               some ﬁne morning and found himself, instead 
               <br />
               of a Canadian, a Tuponian or Hochelagan-

               safely leave for the present the discussion

               <br />
               that ought not to be forgotten. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) So far back as the year 1800, the 
               <br />
               Honorable Mr. UNIAOKE, a leading politi- 
               <br />
               cian in Nova Scotia at that date, submitted 
               <br />
               a scheme of Colonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union.</span> to the Imperial 
               <br />
               authorities. In 1815, Chief Justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stm,</span> 
               <br />
               whose name will be well remembered 
               <br />
               asa leading lawyer of this city ands far- 
               <br />
               sighted politician, submitted a scheme. 
               <br />
               In 1822, Sir JOHN BEVERLEY Roms- 
               <br />
               SON, at the request of the Colonial Oﬂice, 
               <br />
               submitted a project of the same kind; 
               <br />
               and I need not refer to the report of Lord 
               <br />
               DURHAM on Colonial Union in 1839. These 
               <br />
               are all memorable, and some of them are 
               <br />
               great names. If we have dreameda dream 
               <br />
               of union (as some hon. gentlemen say), it 
               <br />
               is at least worth while remarking that a 
               <br />
               dream which has been dreamed by such wise 
               <br />
               and good men, may, for aught we know or 
               <br />
               you know, have been a sort of vision—a vision 
               <br />
               foreshadowing forthcoming natural events in 
               <br />
               a clear intelligence. A vision (I say it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with.</span> 
               <br />
               out irreverence, for the event concerns the 
               <br />
               lives of millions living, and yet to come) rc- 
               <br />
               sembling those seen by the DANIELS and 
               <br />
               J OSEPHS of old, foreshadowing the trials of 
               <br />
               the future; the fate of tribes and peoples; 
               <br />
               the rise and fall of dynasties. But the im-

               mediate history of the measure is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁciently</span> 
               <br />
               wonderful without dwelling on the remoter 
               <br />
               predictions of so many wise men. Who— 
               <br />
               ever, in 1862, or even in 1863, would have 
               <br />
               told us that we should see, even what we see 
               <br />
               in these seats by which I stand—such a re- 
               <br />
               presentation of interests acting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together:</span> 
               <br />
               would be accounted, as our Scotch friends 
               <br />
               say, “ half-daft ;”—-and whoever, in the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces about the same time, would 
               <br />
               have ventured to foretell the composition of 
               <br />
               their delegations, which sat with us under 
               <br />
               this roof last October, would probably 
               <br />
               have been considered equally. demented.

               (Laughter.) But the thing came about, and
