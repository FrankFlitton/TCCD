               that in fact we have no sort of nationality 
               <br />
               about us, but are unpleasantly cut n into a 
               <br />
               lot of struggling nationalities, as tween 
               <br />
               ourselves ? Unlike the people of the United 
               <br />
               States, we are to have no foreign relations to 
               <br />
               look after, or national aﬂ'airs of any kind; 
               <br />
               and therefore our new nationality, if we could 
               <br />
               create it, could be nothing but a name. I 
               <br />
               must say that according to my view of the 
               <br />
               change we ought to aim at, any idea of Fed- 
               <br />
               cration that we may entertain had need take 
               <br />
               an Imperial direction. Whenever changing 
               <br />
               our institutions, we had need develope and 
               <br />
               n—not merely maintain, but main- 
               <br />
               tain, develope and strengthen—the tie, not 
               <br />
               yet Federal as it ought to be, between us 
               <br />
               and the parent state. (Hear, hear.) Itis 
               <br />
               the entire Empire that should be federalized, 
               <br />
               and cemented <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">togaher</span> as one, and not any 
               <br />
               mere limited number of its dependencies here 
               <br />
               or there. A general, or so called federal 
               <br />
               government, such as we are here proposing 
               <br />
               to create, will most certainly be in a false 
               <br />
               sition. As I said just now, the Federal Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the United States was to take its 
               <br />
               place in the great family of the nations of the 
               <br />
               earth; but what place in that famil are we 
               <br />
               to occupy? Simply none. The mperial 
               <br />
               Government will be the head of the Empire as 
               <br />
               much as ever, and will alone have to attend 
               <br />
               to all foreign relations and national matters; 
               <br />
               while we shall be nothing more than we 
               <br />
               are now. Half-a-dozen colonies federated 
               <br />
               are but a federated colony after all. In- 
               <br />
               stead of being so many separate provinces 
               <br />
               with workable institutions, we are to be one 
               <br />
               province most eumbrously organised—nothing 
               <br />
               more. How many grades of government arewe 
               <br />
               going to have under this system ? The Im- 
               <br />
               perial Government, the one great head of the 
               <br />
               Empire; then this Federal Government; then 
               <br />
               our lot of provincial governments; below them 
               <br />
               again, our county municipalities, and, still 
               <br />
               below these, our township and other local mu- 
               <br />
               nicipalities. (Hear, hear.) We have thus 
               <br />
               ﬁve different sets of governmental machinery, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> of these ﬁve there is just one too many 
               <br />
               in my judgment. You might as well make 
               <br />
               six while you are about it, and interpolate be- 
               <br />

               opinion there is no use in this subdivision of 
               <br />
               work at all. You are putting this ﬁfth wheel 
               <br />
               to the coach, merely to ﬁnd out that a misﬁt- 
               <br />
               tiug odd wheel will not serve any useful pur- 
               <br />
               pose, nor so much as work smoothly with the 
               <br />
               other four. (Hear, hear.) Your Federal 
               <br />
               Government will occupy about as anomalous 
               <br />
               a position between the Imperial and provin- 
               <br />
               cial governments as I showed, last night, will 
               <br />
               be occupied by your lieutenant governors 
               <br />
               between the Federal authority and the pro— 
               <br />
               vinces. Both will be out of place, and to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               themselves in work they must give trouble. I 
               <br />
               do not see how they can do good, but I do 
               <br />
               see how they can do any quantity of harm. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The real diﬂiculty in our po- 
               <br />
               sition is one that is not met by the machinery 
               <br />
               here proposed. What is that diﬂiculty ? In 
               <br />
               the larger provinces of the empire we have 
               <br />
               the system of responsible government thor— 
               <br />
               o hly accorded by the Imperial Government, 
               <br />
               an thoroughly worked out ; and the diﬁieul- 
               <br />
               ty of the system that is now pressing, or 
               <br />
               ought to be, upon the attention of our states- 
               <br />
               men is just this—that the tie connecting us 
               <br />
               with the Empire, and which ought to be a 
               <br />
               federal tie of the strongest kind, is too slight, 
               <br />
               is not, roperly speaking, so much as a. federal 
               <br />
               tie at 1. These provinces, with local respon- 
               <br />
               sible government, are too nearly in the posi- 
               <br />
               tion of independent communities; there is not 
               <br />
               enough of connection between them and the 
               <br />
               parent state to make the relations between 
               <br />
               the two work well, or give promise of lasting 
               <br />
               long. There is in the machinery too much 
               <br />
               of what may be called the centrifugal ten- 
               <br />
