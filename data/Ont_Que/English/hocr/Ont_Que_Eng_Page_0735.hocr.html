               <br />
               have not yet had that opportunity, and I 
               <br />
               think the honorable gentlemen on the Trea-

               manner in which they are now doing, have 
               <br />
               taken a course which will redound to their 
               <br />
               own and to the country’s disadvantage. The

               people only require to be awakened to the 
               <br />
               course that is being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pursued,</span> to understand

               that these opinions and views are to be dis-

               regarded, or are of no consequence, to call forth 
               <br />
               that sentence of condemnation which will

               hurl honorable gentlemen on the Treasury

               names honored in the past, to sink into dis- 
               <br />
               honored oblivion. If the proper steps had 
               <br />
               been taken, gentlemen from Lower Canada 
               <br />
               would never have been able to say that repre-

               sentation by population could not be safely 
               <br />
               given to Upper Canada, and would have no 
               <br />
               grounds for fearing that their rights would not 
               <br />
               be protected, and that therefore they must 
               <br />
               reject it. If they refused to grant represent- 
               <br />
               ation according to population when full pro- 
               <br />
               vision is oﬁ'ered them for the protection of their 
               <br />
               institutions, it would be without other reason 
               <br />
               than that of the sulky woman or the spoiled 
               <br />
               child, and I do not believe that the representa- 
               <br />
               tives of the people of Lower Canada are made 
               <br />
               up of that kind of stuff. They only wish to be 
               <br />
               assured that their rights are not to be inter- 
               <br />
               fered with. If they desired more, let them 
               <br />
               reﬂect that the hon. member for Montmorency 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. CAUCHON) in addressingthe House 
               <br />
               the other evening, instanced the position in 
               <br />
               which the English House of Lords stood when 
               <br />
               the country was in danger of being plunged 
               <br />
               into a revolution by their resistance to a just 
               <br />
               popular demand. He gave us to understand 
               <br />
               that that body might have been swept away 
               <br />
               before the indignation of the people, if it had 
               <br />
               not yielded to the pressure and allowed the 
               <br />
               Reform Bill to pass. If that was the case in
