               remarks. He said—Honorable gentlemen, 
               <br />
               when the clock struck six, I was stating that, 
               <br />
               in one session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> another, the SPEAKER of 
               <br />
               this honorable House had day after day to 
               <br />
               declare that there was no quorum, and the 
               <br />
               Government of the da had to employ all sorts 
               <br />
               of means to induce <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honorable</span> gentlemen to 
               <br />
               attend in their places. The prestige of the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council had gone, and the mem- 
               <br />
               bers, notwithstanding the oﬁ'er to pay their 
               <br />
               expenses, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doc.,</span> remained at home, and the 
               <br />
               business of the country suﬁ'ered very much. 
               <br />
               Towards the end of the session, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we,</span> could - 
               <br />
               muster a few gentlemen. But they did not 
               <br />
               take much interest in the business of the 
               <br />
               country—in fact, they were disgusted with it, 
               <br />
               and they got through legislation at railroad 
               <br />
               speed. Under those circumstances, what had 
               <br />
               the Government to do? They were obliged 
               <br />
               to resort to some means to restore, if possible,
