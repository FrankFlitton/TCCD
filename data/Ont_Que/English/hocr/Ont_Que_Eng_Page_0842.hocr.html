               us so long; and I trust that in this most 
               <br />
               important crisis, this House will show itself 
               <br />
               not altogether unworthy to be intrusted 
               <br />
               with the destinies of three millions of their 
               <br />
               countrymen. My own years are not very 
               <br />
               many, Mr. SPEAKER, but yet even I can 
               <br />
               remember when Canada was but a petty pro- 
               <br />
               vince, an obscure dependency, scarce able to 
               <br />
               make its voice heard on the other side of 
               <br />
               the Atlantic without a rebellion; forgotten 
               <br />
               or ignored, as if, as the French Minister said 
               <br />
               when he signed the treaty for its surrender, 
               <br />
               “it mattered not what became of a few 
               <br />
               barren acres of snow !" And yet, sir, in 
               <br />
               less than thirty years I have lived to see 
               <br />
               Canada expand into a state equal in numbers, 
               <br />
               in resources and power of self-government 
               <br />
               to many an independent European kingdom 
               <br />
               —-lackiug only the will to step at once from 
               <br />
               the position of a dependency to that of an 
               <br />
               ally—a favored ally of the great country to 
               <br />
               which we belong, and to take that rank 
               <br />
               among the commonwealth of nations which' 
               <br />
               is granted to those people, and to those only, 
               <br />
               who have proved that they possess the power 
               <br />
               as well as the wish to defend their liberties. 
               <br />
               This, sir, is what I think Canada can do ; 
               <br />
               this is what I think Canada ought to do; 
               <br />
               and if, as I believe, this project of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation would contribute most powerfully to 
               <br />
               enable us to do so, there are few sacriﬁces 
               <br />
               which I would refuse to make for such an 
               <br />
               object—much more, forgive my honorable 
               <br />
               friends yonder for having in time past spoken 
               <br />
               somewhat over harshly and hastily of each 
               <br />
               other. Let them only persevere, let them 
               <br />
               only go on and complete the task which I 
               <br />
               will say they have so nobly begun, and they 
               <br />
               will have made good their claim—I do not 
               <br />
               say to the forgiveness—but to the regard, 
               <br />
               the aﬂ'ection, the esteem of every man who 
               <br />
               shall hereafter bear the name of Canadian.

               Mn. HARWOOD said—Mr. SPEAKER,

               the importance of the proposed measure; the 
               <br />
               fatal consequences which would result to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               rejected by this House; the sources of social,

               that notwithstanding the eloquent speeches 
               <br />
               delivered on the subject on both sides, and 
               <br />
               which seem to have completely exhausted

               to assist in passing it. Called, as we all are,

               inaugurate a new era in the parliamentary 
               <br />
               annals of Canada. (Hear, hear.) I have 
               <br />
               listened attentively to the opponents of the 
               <br />
               measure, and read their speeches again and 
               <br />
               again, and truly the only eﬁ'ect they have 
               <br />
               had on my mind is a stronger conviction that 
               <br />
               in the anomalous osition of the country,a 
               <br />
               Federal union of a l the Provinces of British 
               <br />
               North America is the only remedy for all 
               <br />
               the innumerable diﬂiculties which are sha- 
               <br />
               dowed forth on our political horizon. 
               <br />
               (Cheers) The opponents of the measure, 
               <br />
               not being able positively to deny the advan-

               tages of Confederation to all the ﬁve pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of British America, endeavor to get 
               <br />
               up a cry that this union would involve the 
               <br />
               loss to us French-Canadians, and Catholics,, 
               <br />
               of our nationality, our language, our laws 
               <br />
               and institutions. I, for my part, cannot look 
               <br />
               upon it in so terrible a light-—having all 
               <br />
               history before me, I cannot come to that 
               <br />
               conclusion. I shall soon shew clearly that 
               <br />
               there exists throughout the world confeder- 
               <br />

               <br />

               rights pertaining to the different classes

               of which they consist. Do we ﬁnd any

               <br />
               I'ﬁnd none; and none is proposed to us
