               And it is not surprising that we experienced 
               <br />
               the diﬁculties we did until that riod. After

               <br />

               <br />
               of the 3rd September, 1841, havin declared 
               <br />
               that no Government could be carrie on except 
               <br />
               by heads of departments having the conﬁdence 
               <br />
               of the representatives of the people in the 
               <br />
               lower branch of the Legislature. If, from 
               <br />
               that moment, bad appointments happened to 
               <br />
               be made to the Leg relative Council, then the 
               <br />
               Government for the time being was responsible 
               <br />
               to the people for those apporntments. And, 
               <br />
               when the people wanted an elective Council at 
               <br />
               that time, they did not base the demand upon 
               <br />
               constitutional principles, but were led by their 
               <br />
               passions, which had been excited by their 
               <br />
               recollections of the past. They did not reason 
               <br />
               the thing out; and, in fact, the great majority 
               <br />
               of the people here, as everywhere else, are not 
               <br />
               able to reason out constitutional points—they 
               <br />
               are led by those who are at the head of the 
               <br />
               diﬁ‘erent parties. In saying this, I have no 
               <br />
               wish to be unjust to my countrymen. For 
               <br />
               even in countries like the United States, which 
               <br />
               boast much of their education, the immense 
               <br />
               mass of the people are led by prominent men. 
               <br />
               They do not reﬂect, they do not think for 
               <br />
               themselves—and so it was with our people. 
               <br />
               The Government for the time being were thus, 
               <br />
               by the force of circumstances, obliged to bring 
               <br />
               forward the measure for altering the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of the Legislative Council. The measure 
               <br />
               was passed by a pretty large majority; and 
               <br />
               I think that until now the elective principle 
               <br />
               has worked remarkably well indeed, and that 
               <br />
               the electors have sent to this House gentlemen 
               <br />
               who would do honor to any deliberative body 
               <br />
               in the world—I care not where, whether in 
               <br />
               England, or on the continent of Europe, or in 
               <br />
               America. But difﬁculties have arisen since

               <br />
               of us might have preferred still to retain the 
               <br />
               elective principle, but then we had to meet 
               <br />
               those gentlemen from below, and we had to 
               <br />
               give and take. We could not carry every-

               tlemen from the Lower Provinces were op-

               strongly for the system of appointments by 
               <br />
               the Crown. At the same time some among 
               <br />
               ourselves were not very much enamoured 
               <br />

               before you, not as the act of the vernment 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada—:</span> hear, hear)—but as the mixed 
               <br />
               work of the elegates from all the provinces, 
               <br />
               in the form, as it were, of a treaty. I do 
               <br />
               not think, after the explanations I have given 
               <br />
               that I can be accused of a great deal of in- 
               <br />
               consistency, or of that levity which would 
               <br />
               make a man build up something to-day which 
               <br />
               he would be anxious to demolish to-morrow. 
               <br />
               No, honorable gentleman—but circumstances 
               <br />
               forced the Government in 1856 to bring on

               their measure for rendering this House elect- 
               <br />

               <br />
               1864 required that we should have recourse 
               <br />
               to some other means to put an end to the 
               <br />
               dead-lock in which the Province was placed.
