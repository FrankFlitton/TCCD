               moment, be assailed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> invaded by a people 
               <br />
               better situated in that respect than we were. 
               <br />
               Canada was, in fact, just like a farmer who 
               <br />
               might stand upon an elevated spot on his 
               <br />
               property, from which he could look around 
               <br />
               upon fertile ﬁelds, meandering streams, wood 
               <br />
               and all else that was necessary to his domestic 
               <br />
               wants, but who had no outlet to the highway. 
               <br />
               To be sure he might have an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">easy,</span> good-na- 
               <br />
               tured neighbor, who had such an outlet, and 
               <br />
               this neighbor might sa to him, “ Don't be 
               <br />
               uneasy about that, for will allow you to pass 
               <br />
               on to the ' hway, through my cross road, and 
               <br />
               we shall bo proﬁt by the arrangement." So 
               <br />
               long as this obliging neighbor was in good 
               <br />
               humor everything would go on pleasantly, but 
               <br />
               the very best natured people would sometimes 
               <br />
               get out of temper, or grow capricious, or cir— 
               <br />
               cumstanees mightarise tecause irritation. And 
               <br />
               so it might come to pass that the excellent 
               <br />
               neighbor would get dissatisﬁed. For instance, 
               <br />
               he might be involved in a tedious and expen- 
               <br />
               sive law suit with some one else ; it might be 
               <br />
               a serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁ‘air—in</span> fact, an affair of life or 
               <br />
               death, and he might come to the isolated 
               <br />
               farmer and say to him, “I understand that 
               <br />
               you and your family are all sympathising with 
               <br />
               my adversary; I don’t like it at all, and I am 
               <br />
               determined you will ﬁnd some other outlet to 
               <br />
               the highway than my cross road, for hence- 
               <br />
               forth my gate will be shut against you.” In 
               <br />
               such a case what is the farmer to do ? There 
               <br />
               is the air left, but until the aerostatic science 
               <br />
               is more practically developed, he can hardly 
               <br />
               try ballooning without the risk of breaking 
               <br />
               his neck. (Laughter.) Well, that was pre- 
               <br />
               cisely our position in reference to the United 
               <br />
               States. Since the Atlantic and St. Lawrence 
               <br />
               Railway was opened we have had a very con- 
               <br />
               venient outlet to the sea, and he, with other 
               <br />
               hon. members now present, would remember 
               <br />
               the jo ul jubilee which was held on the occa- 
               <br />
               lion 0 its opening at Boston in 1851 or ’52. 
               <br />
               For one he was perfectly delighted, as being a 
               <br />
               man of a diﬁ'erent origin, to mark how the two 
               <br />
               branches of the Anglo—Saxon race fraternised. 
               <br />
               How they did shake hands to be sure l How 
               <br />
               they did compliment each other as '

               <br />

               now? Diﬂicultics had supervened, in which 
               <br />

               the good feeling between them and this coun-

               . To be sure there had been no misunder-

               standing at all between our respective Govern- 
               <br />
               ments, but the minds of the people on both 
               <br />
               sides had been considerably aﬂ'ecwd. The

               ‘people of the Northern States believed that 
               <br />
               Canadians sympathized with the South much 
               <br />
               more than they really did, and the conse— 
               <br />
               quences of this misapprehension were: ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               that we had been threatened with the abolition 
               <br />
               of the transit system; then the Reciprocity 
               <br />
               Treaty was to be discontinued; then a 
               <br />
               port system was inaugurated, which was almost 
               <br />
               equivalent to a prohibition of intercourse, and 
               <br />
               the only thing which really remained to be 
               <br />
               done was to shut down the gate altogether and 
               <br />
               prevent passage through their territo . Would 
               <br />
               any one say that such a state of in was 
               <br />
               one desirable for Canada to be placed in ? Will 
               <br />
               a great people in embryo, as he believed we 
               <br />
               were, coolly and tranquilly cross their arms and 
               <br />
               wait for what might come next ? For his part 
               <br />
               he held that the time had now arrived when we 
               <br />
               should establish a union with the great Gulf 
               <br />
               Provinces. He called them great advisedly, 
               <br />
               for they had within themselves many of the 
               <br />
               elements which went to constitute greatness, 
               <br />
               and of some of which we were destitute.— 
               <br />
               Canada was unquestionably wanting in several 
               <br />
               of these important elements, and he had been 
               <br />
               very sorry a few days ago to hear an hon. 
               <br />
               member of this House make comparisons un- 
               <br />
               favorable to those countries. That hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber had said the Lower Provinces were poor 
               <br />
               and needy, and that like all other poor peeple 
               <br />
               they would no doubt be glad to connect them- 
               <br />
               selves with a wealthy partner. He had also 
               <br />
               said their product of wheat was very small, 
               <br />
               and that one of the inferior counties in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada yielded more than the whole of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick. Well, the allegations in respect 
               <br />
               of the produce of wheat might be true ; but 
               <br />
               that did not necessarily constitute them poor 
               <br />
               provinces. Let the honorable member look 
               <br />
               at Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island 
               <br />
               and New Hampshire, which, in respect of 
               <br />
               agricultural produce, might be said to bepoor, 
               <br />
               so poor that an American had once told him 
               <br />
               (Sir E. P. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Taonﬁ)</span> that they did not even grow
