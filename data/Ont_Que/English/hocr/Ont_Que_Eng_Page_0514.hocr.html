               <br />
               have heard it said that every government in

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> world is in a certain sense a constitutional 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">temper-ed</span> by check of some kind. The

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">despotism</span> of the Grand Turk has been said 
               <br />

               though this should be done, or though the

               set aside for no cause, much less grave than 
               <br />

               <br />
               leaving this subject, Mr. SPEAKER, let me ask 
               <br />
               the attention of the House for a few moments 
               <br />
               to the past history of Canada in respect of 
               <br />
               our Legislative Council. (Hear, hear.) Did 
               <br />
               it not happen, as matter of fact, that the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               Legislative Council of Canada, not being 
               <br />
               limited in point of numbers, being like the 
               <br />
               House of Lords in that respect—the Crown, 
               <br />
               I say, having the full choice of its members, 
               <br />
               and full control over their number—did it 
               <br />
               not happen, I say, that its members were most 
               <br />
               of them, for some time, named from one side 
               <br />
               in politics ? The gentlemen named by Lord 
               <br />
               SYDENHAM and his immediate successors, 
               <br />
               were, undoubtedly, most respectable. There 
               <br />
               was nothing out of common course that I see 
               <br />
               about these appointments; they were party,
