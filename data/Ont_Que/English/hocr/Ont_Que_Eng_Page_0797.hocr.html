               In the resolutions submitted us, the word 
               <br />
               used in the English version is “ may,” which 
               <br />
               is translated into French by the word “ pour- 
               <br />

               <br />
               French languages may be used simultaneously 
               <br />
               in the proceedings of the Federal Parliament 
               <br />

               <br />
               da, and also in the Federal courts and the 
               <br />
               courts of Lower Canada. It is easy to see, 
               <br />
               then, that the use of the French language is 
               <br />
               rendered extremely precarious, and that the 
               <br />
               majority may proscribe it in our Votes and

               spoken of the past conduct of the Upper Can-

               discussion of the scheme of Confederation 
               <br />
               been conducted in Lower Canada? In this 
               <br />
               way: in the ﬁrst place, all the Ministerial 
               <br />
               journals begged and prayed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> not to 
               <br />
               condemn the scheme before being made so- 
               <br />
               quainted with it; they proclaimed stoutly 
               <br />
               that the Government must be allowed to 
               <br />
               elaborate its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measures</span> in peace, and then, 
               <br />
               when the scheme was made public, the same 
               <br />
               journals declared that certainly the scheme 
               <br />
               must be amended in certain particulars be 
               <br />
               fore being adopted by the country, and that 
               <br />
               they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vt</span> ould be the ﬁrst to call for these changes, 
               <br />
               which, moreover, could be obtained with- 
               <br />
               out diﬁculty from the Administration; ifnot, 
               <br />
               the would oppose the scheme as dangerous 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂower</span> Canada. Even the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mew-any</span> made 
               <br />
               that statement. It was also said: “The Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment will not make a Ministerial question 
               <br />
               of the adoption of the scheme as it is; the 
               <br />
               project may be discussed, and if it isfound 
               <br />
               to involve anything dangerous for our re 
               <br />
               ligious and national institutions, that danger 
               <br />
               can be obviated by amending the resolutions.” 
               <br />
               More than that, at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opening</span> of the dis

               <br />
               as it was, and that the Government would 
               <br />
               not tolerate any amendment. Is such con- 
               <br />
               duct calculated to inspire conﬁdence in the

               <br />
               from Lower Canada, and. I ask them if they 
               <br />
               are prepared to ratify by their verdict the
