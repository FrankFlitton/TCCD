               speeches made by honorable members of the 
               <br />
               Opposition, appealing incessantly to the reli-

               <br />
               fcating the Government scheme. These hon- 
               <br />
               orable gentlemen draw pictures which are 
               <br />
               really heartrending. They tell the Protes- 
               <br />
               tants that under Confederation they will lose 
               <br />
               all their rights in Lower Canada in respect 
               <br />
               of the education of their children; and, on 
               <br />
               the other hand, they tell the Catholics that 
               <br />
               their religion is in danger, because the Fed- 
               <br />
               eral Government will have the right of veto 
               <br />
               in respect of all the measures of the Local 
               <br />
               Government. But this right of veto must of 
               <br />
               necessity exist somewhere, in order that the 
               <br />
               minority may be protected from any injustice 
               <br />
               which the majority might attempt to do them. 
               <br />
               We cannot hope to have the majority in the 
               <br />
               Federal Parliament, when we French Lower 
               <br />
               Canadians and Catholics have never had it 
               <br />
               under the existing union. And yet we cannot 
               <br />
               but congratulate ourselves upon the relations 
               <br />
               which have always existed between us and 
               <br />
               our fellow-countrymen of other ori ‘ns and re- 
               <br />
               ligions. The Benning Divorce ill aﬁ'ords 
               <br />
               a proof that we are in a minority in the present 
               <br />
               Legislature, for the Protestants all voted in 
               <br />
               favor of that measure, and the Catholics 
               <br />
               against it, and the bill was passed. The 
               <br />
               Catholics, then, are wrong when they exclaim 
               <br />
               that we ought to unite and carry out our own 
               <br />
               religious views and secure the triumph of 
               <br />
               French-Canadian nationality; doing so will 
               <br />
               only have the effect of exciting the Protestants 
               <br />
               and the British-Canadians to do the same 
               <br />
               thing, and then we should fall into a state 
               <br />
               of anarchy. One night last week, about 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Cornwall (Honorable J. S. MACDONALD) 
               <br />
               forgot his position so far as to seek to excite 
               <br />
               religious jealousies and hatreds; but I am 
               <br />
               happy to see that he has not succeeded in his 
               <br />
               attempt, and that Catholics and Protestants 
               <br />
               have treated his fanatical appeals with con-

               having heard this, can any one believe in the 
               <br />
               reality of all these anticipations of danger 
               <br />
               paraded in the newspapers, in the House, and 
               <br />
               throughout the country ? No, it is impossi— 
               <br />
               ble to believe in it, and not to perceive that 
               <br />
               it is all hypocrisy, with the view of exciting 
               <br />
               the prejudices of the people. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It has been also said that the use of our 
               <br />
               language was in danger, and that the French 
               <br />
               laws would disap when Confederation 
               <br />
               was accomplished. ut is it not a well-known 
               <br />
               fact that we owe the protection of our French 
               <br />
               laws to the Hon. Attorney General for Lower 
               <br />
               Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER), and is not the 
               <br />
               Code Civil, which he has just laid before us, 
               <br />
               a suﬂicient answer to all that can be asserted 
               <br />
               on this head? The French laws will be 
               <br />
               maintained and respected in Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               and this we owe to the Hon. Attorney Gene- 
               <br />
               ral (Hon. Mr. CARTIER). We shall have a 
               <br />
               statute to assimilate the law of evidence in 
               <br />
               commercial matters in Lower Canada; but 
               <br />
               the French laws will not be abolished. If 
               <br />
               there is a man in the whole country who pos- 
               <br />
               sesses real legal judgment, and who is per- 
               <br />
               fectly acquainted with the laws and statutes 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada, it is certainly the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General for Lower Canada, Mr. 
               <br />
               GEORGE ETIENNE CARTIER. No one will 
               <br />
               deny this, and there is not a man who can 
               <br />
               compete with him in this respect. Why 
               <br />
               come here and tell us that our language is 
               <br />
               about to disappear, and that its use is to be 
               <br />
               abolished in the Federal Legislature ? Is it 
               <br />
               because lies must be told in order to oppose 
               <br />
               the scheme of the Government, and real rea- 
               <br />
               sons for opposition cannot be found ? A 
               <br />
               drowning man catches at a straw, and that is 
               <br />
               what the Opposition are doing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> But 
               <br />
               they ought to be just, and to admit that we
