               cowards, till they had come here to attend

               <br />
               ings, expectin an easy victory. We know 
               <br />
               perfectly we , for we have proofs, that 
               <br />
               agents well paid by a political committee 
               <br />
               at Montreal, were sent to all the parishes 
               <br />
               to t up meetings against Confederation, at 
               <br />
               which they made use of the most contradic- 
               <br />
               tory arguments, varied as occasion required, 
               <br />
               to suit their object, which was to induce the 
               <br />
               people to declare against the scheme, and 
               <br />
               sign petitions accordingly. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               These petitions bear the names of children, 
               <br />
               and, in fact, of sucklings, as was proved the 
               <br />
               other day by the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Boucherville. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
               <br />
               And if that much is certain, we are justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in thinking that those agents must have done 
               <br />
               something still worse, with which we are not 
               <br />
               acquainted, for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpxqse</span> of prejudiéing 
               <br />
               the people against the vernment scheme. 
               <br />
               N ow, I say that in view of all this—in view 
               <br />
               of all this underhand trickery and hypocrisy 
               <br />
               of the Opposition — all French-Canadians 
               <br />
               should unite together in support of a just, 
               <br />
               frank and straightforward measure, such as 
               <br />
               that now submitted to this House. Was it 
               <br />
               not stated, long before the meeting of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliap</span> 
               <br />
               ment, that the measure should receive a calm 
               <br />
               and fair consideration ? And yet since the 
               <br />
               beginning of the discussion we have had 
               <br />
               nothing but appeals to prejudice made by the 
               <br />
               adversaries o the measure, in place of dis- 
               <br />
               cussing it on its merits, as they ought to have 
               <br />
               done. The honorable member for Richelieu 
               <br />
               (Mr. PERRAULT) has distinguished himself 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> way of appealing to national and re- 
               <br />
               ligious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prejudices,</span> and in order to attain his 
               <br />

               <br />
               facts he mentioned ; but why cite them as he 
               <br />
               did in such a body as this? It is neither 
               <br />
               politic nor right. Our duty as members of 
               <br />
               this House is to make laws for the well-being

               (Hear, hear.) hen, again, what was the gist

               of the speech just made by the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Drummond and Arthabaska (Mr. 
               <br />
               J. B. E. DOBION)—who certainly, I must 
               <br />
               admit, possesses oratorieal ability, as well as 
               <br />
               other gifts? It was just simply a compari- 
               <br />
               son between our Goverment and that of the 
               <br />
               United States, and of course he gave the 
               <br />
               preference to the latter. .The honorable 
               <br />
               member is never weary of looking to Wash- 
               <br />
               ington with one eye. (Hear, hear.) Why 
               <br />
               does not the honorable member tell us frank- 
               <br />
               ly at once that he desires the annexation of 
               <br />
               Canada to the United States? For, if we 
               <br />
               are to believe his statements, the American 
               <br />
               Government is an extraordinary government, 
               <br />
               a model government, a government unequalled 
               <br />
               in the world! But no; instead of giving 
               <br />
               us the beneﬁt of his real thoughts, he stops 
               <br />
               short at insinuations, and comparisons of the 
               <br />
               expenditure attending the two forms of gov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               member for Bagot (Hon.Mr.LAFRAMBOISE)— 
               <br />
               has thought proper, this evening, to join in 
               <br />
               the outcry of the Opposition on this subject. 
               <br />
               He cited an event which has just occurred at 
               <br />
               Toronto, and which everybody regrets, and 
               <br />
               used it as an argument against the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation submitted to us by the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. Why drag that fact into the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion of a great question, and at a solemn 
               <br />
               moment like this? I do think that it was 
               <br />
               hardly becoming in an honorable ex-minister 
               <br />
               of the Crown to say to this House,—“ Two 
               <br />
               sisters of charity have been insulted in the 
               <br />
               streets of Toronto; ergo, sisters of charity 
               <br />
               will not be tolerated under Confederation; 
               <br />
               the clcr will be persecuted, and religion an- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nihilate?”</span> But this style of argument is re- 
               <br />
               sorted to somewhat too tardily. These pro- 
               <br />
               testations of devotedness to religion and to 
               <br />
               the clergy come too late to be believed by the 
               <br />
               people of Lower Canada, or to make any im-
