               anti-unionist might see that the population 
               <br />
               of Canada is within a fraction of that of all 
               <br />
               New England put together, that we consume 
               <br />
               in this country as much fuel per annum as 
               <br />
               they do in all New England ; and, therefore, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> that we offer them a market under the union 
               <br />

               persuade their followers they would lose. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Sir, another cry raised by 
               <br />
               the anti-unionists below is, that they would 
               <br />
               have to ﬁght for the defence of Canada—a 
               <br />
               very specious argument. What, sir, three 
               <br />
               millions and one million unite, and the one 
               <br />
               million must do the ﬁghting for all. In pro- 
               <br />
               portion to their numbers no doubt these 
               <br />
               valiant gentlemen will have to ﬁght, if ﬁght- 
               <br />
               ing is to be done, but not one man or one 
               <br />
               shilling more than Canada, pro rata, will 
               <br />
               they have to ﬁght or spend. On the con- 
               <br />
               trary, the greater community, if she should 
               <br />
               not happen to be ﬁrst attacked, would be ob- 
               <br />
               liged to ﬁght for them, and in doing so, I 
               <br />
               do not hesitate to say, on far better authority 
               <br />
               than my own, that the man who ﬁghts for 
               <br />
               the valley and harbour of St. John, or even 
               <br />
               for Halifax, ﬁghts for Canada. I will sup- 
               <br />
               pose another not impossible case. I will 
               <br />
               suppose a hostile American army, on a ﬁsh- 
               <br />
               ery or any other war, ﬁnding it easier and 
               <br />
               cheaper to seize the lower colonies by land 
               <br />
               than by sea, by a march from a convenient 
               <br />
               rendezvous on Lake Champlain, through 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, into the upper part of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, and so downward to the sea—a 
               <br />
               march like SHERMAN’S march from Knox- 
               <br />
               ville to Savannah. While we obstructed 
               <br />
               such a march by every means in our power, 
               <br />
               from the Richelieu to Riviere du Loup, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whose</span> battles would we be ﬁghting then? 
               <br />
               Why the seaports aimed at, for our common 
               <br />
               subjugation. Hear, hear.) But the truth 
               <br />
               is, all these se h views and arrangements 
               <br />
               are remarkably short-sighted, unworthy of 
               <br />
               the subject, and unworthy even of those who 
               <br />
               use them. In a commercial, in a military, 
               <br />
               in every dpoint of view, we are all, rightly 
               <br />
               considere , dependant on each other. N ew- 
               <br />
               foundland dominates the Gulf, and none of 
               <br />
               us can afford to be separated from her. 
               <br />
               Lord CHATHAM said he would as soon aban— 
               <br />
               don Plymouth as Newfoun..land, and he is 
               <br />
               said to have understood how to govern men. 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are Siamese 
               <br />
               twins, held together by that ligature of land 
               <br />
               between Baie Verte and Cumberland Basin, 
               <br />
               and the fate of the one must follow the fate 
               <br />
               of the other. (Hear, hear.) Prince Ed-

               <br />

               <br />
               country, I cannot conceal from myself that 
               <br />
               our friends in the Lower Provinces are ﬁght- 
               <br />
               ing a battle with narrow views and vested 
               <br />
               interests, which are always most bitter in the 
               <br />
               smallest communities. There are coasting 
               <br />
               trade interests and railway interests at work ; 
               <br />
               and there are the stronginterests of honest 
               <br />
               ignorance and dishonest ingenuity. What 
               <br />
               can these men mean, who are no fools ? Do 
               <br />
               they, too, fancy they can get a vernment

               made to their own private order . Do they 
               <br />
               think they can go on on the old system ? 
               <br />
               Do they mean to give up the country to the 
               <br />
               Americans ? Why not hang up at once the 
               <br />
               sign, “these provinces for sale—terms cash l 
               <br />
               —‘ greenbacks ’ taken at full value !” I re— 
               <br />
               joice to see the unionists of the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces so resolved, so high spirited and so 
               <br />
               united—and though their victory will not be 
               <br />
               won without work, yet I feel assured it will be 
               <br />
               a victory. If the honest and misguided would 
               <br />
               but reﬂect for a moment the risks they run by 
               <br />
               defeating, or even delaying this measure, 
               <br />
               I am sure they would, even yet, retract. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) If we reject it now, is there 
               <br />
               any human probability that we shall ever see 
               <br />
               again so propitious a set of circumstances to 
               <br />
               bring about the same results? How they 
               <br />

               The strange and fortunate events that have 
               <br />
               occurred in Canada; the extraordinary con-

               cessions made by the leaders of the Govern-

               <br />
               co-representatives, Hon. Messrs. AROHIBALD 
               <br />
               and MCCULLY, two of his most determined 
               <br />
               political opponents—can we ever expect,if we 
               <br />
               reject this scheme, that the same or similar 
               <br />
               things will occur again to favor it? Can we 
               <br />
               expect to see the leader of the Up er Cana- 
               <br />
               dian conservative party and the le er of the 
               <br />
               Upper Canadian liberals sitting side by side 
               <br />
               again, if this project fails to work out, in a 
               <br />
               spirit of mutual compromise and concession, 
               <br />
               the problem of our constitutional diﬂiculties ? 
               <br />
               No, sir, it is too much to expect. Miracles
