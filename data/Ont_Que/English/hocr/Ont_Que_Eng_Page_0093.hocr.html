               will now come more closely to t e subject

               under debate, the proposed Confederation of

               <br />
               for the Niagara Division had read the debates 
               <br />
               which preceded the establishment of the Ame- 
               <br />
               rican Constitution after the United States had 
               <br />
               gained their independence. I especially advert 
               <br />
               to the debates in the Councils of Virginia, 
               <br />
               which at that time, by reason of its wealth and 
               <br />
               population, bore a similar relation to the other 
               <br />
               colonies to that which Canada now bears to the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces. If he had read the speeches 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mamsoss,</span> the MABSHALLS, the RAN-

               <br />
               would have found no passage in keeping with 
               <br />
               the sentiments he uttered yesterday. Those 
               <br />
               great patriots evidently met under a deep sense 
               <br />
               of the responsibilities of their work, and instead 
               <br />
               of bringing into the debates the small village 
               <br />
               feelings and animosities tending to embarrass 
               <br />
               and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">destroy</span> harmony, they acted like great 
               <br />
               men, true and noble men as they were, and 
               <br />

               the year 17 81, did not work well. It

               neither one thin nor another, it was neither

               <br />
               effect of the words he used. It happens, 
               <br />
               however, to be a fact, that in opposition to the

               received the approbation of some of the most

               eminent statesmen of England, as well as that

               <br />

               <br />
               With respect to the Swiss Confederation, 
               <br />
               however well it ma be considered to have 
               <br />
               worked, it is a fact t at within our own time 
               <br />
               a civil war has existed among the cantons, 
               <br />
               and that republic has been upon the brink of 
               <br />
               destruction. As regards the Dutch repub- 
               <br />
               lic, it is a matter of history how it fell. 
               <br />
               During the whole of its struggle against 
               <br />
               PHILIP II., the provinces comprising it never 
               <br />
               had that centrahzed power which is necessary 
               <br />
               to the stability of a government, especially one 
               <br />
               assailed by enemies from without, for two 
               <br />
               provinces, Guelderland and Overyssel, con- 
               <br />
               tributed nothing all that contest through—- 
               <br />
               each standing upon its state righ ts—while 
               <br />
               among the remaining ﬁve, by far the largest 
               <br />
               proportion was contributed b the one Prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Holland. The natur result was that 
               <br />
               the republic fell, and became a monarchy. 
               <br />
               The same evil lay at the root of the American 
               <br />
               Constitution of 1781, and after it had been 
               <br />
               adopted, so ill concerted and disunited were the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ‘orts</span> of the thirteen states, that the arrange- 
               <br />
               ment would not work at all, so that General

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">WASHINGTON</span> was obl' ed to ask for and actu-

               The difﬁculties between the North and the 
               <br />
               South which now prevail, arose wholly upon
