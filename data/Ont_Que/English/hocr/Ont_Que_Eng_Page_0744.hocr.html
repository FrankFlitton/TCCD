               little misapprehension as to the eﬁ'ect of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               it is as well should be removed. It has

               simply and only this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect—that</span> it does not

               views fully and freely upon the subject, but 
               <br />
               calls upon every hon gentleman to give— if

               I may use an Americanism—a straight and

               square vote upon the question, and to state

               scheme of Confederation as a whole. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) As I stated when I opened this

               debate upon my motion, and as has been 
               <br />
               over and over again stated by several of my 
               <br />
               colleagues, we agreed with the governments 
               <br />
               of the sister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proviices</span> upon a future Con-

               stitution for the whole of British North

               America, and we ask this House to approve 
               <br />
               or disapprove of that Constitution. We told 
               <br />
               the House that we had made this treaty
