               <br />
               able friend the gallant Knight, in his remarks 
               <br />
               last evening, made allusion to the burning of 
               <br />
               the Parliament buildings. I agree with him 
               <br />
               that that was athing sincerely to be regretœd. 
               <br />
               But he stated that, if the conservatives in the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council had had the prudence and 
               <br />
               good sense to exercise the amount of wisdom 
               <br />
               that they might have exercised, they would 
               <br />
               have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put-of</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rebfellicn</span> Losses Bill another

               occurrence to which he referred. Now, hon- 
               <br />
               arable gentlemen, I stand here to ask you to 
               <br />
               take the advice the honorable and gallant 
               <br />
               Knight has Igiven, and apply it to the present 
               <br />
               scheme. ( ear, hear, and laughter.) You 
               <br />
               do not know what disastrous conse uences 
               <br />
               may ensue, if this huge scheme is carried out 
               <br />
               without an appeal to the people in a constitu- 
               <br />
               tional manner. I do sincerely hope you will 
               <br />
               allow that powerful argument for delay ad- 
               <br />
               duced by the honorable and gallant Knight to 
               <br />
               bear upon this quætion. (Hear, hear.) This 
               <br />
               is nrevolution, gentlemen,not a mere payment 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> a few thousand pounds, that is proposed. 
               <br />
               A revolution may be carried out by the exer- 
               <br />
               cise of political power, as well as by physical 
               <br />
               force. If the Government of the country is 
               <br />
               subverted, it makes no diﬁ'erence how it is 
               <br />
               done. It is a revolution all the same, no mat- 
               <br />
               ter how it is brought about. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> is the 
               <br />
               same uponthe country. The proposal is to 
               <br />
               sweep our present Constitution away, and sup- 
               <br />
               ply its place with another, which may be better

               able gentlemen seem to desire it, I will make

               them without consulting them, and I hold that 
               <br />
               such a thing ought not to be done. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Baia</span> 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exaltation,</span> without their even asking for it, 
               <br />
               it is now proposed to reduce them, almost 
               <br />
               without notice, to the lowest possible position 
               <br />
               of political degradation. It is the main prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of the Government under which we live, 
               <br />
               that the people, through their representatives, 
               <br />
               shall be consulted as to the composition of 
               <br />
               their Government. As for a mutual under-

               standing between the electors and the elected, 
               <br />
               in relation to this scheme, there is none what- 
               <br />
               ever, snd I have thus urged delay because I 
               <br />
               do not think there is any nœd of hurry. 
               <br />
               There is a constitutional mode of ascertaining 
               <br />
               the views of the people, and it ought to be 
               <br />
               made use of. But honorable gentlemen say, 
               <br />
               “ Oh, don’t throw out any hint about bringing 
               <br />
               on a general election before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proper</span> period; 
               <br />
               we have had elections enough uring the 
               <br />
               past ﬁve years." Why, honorable gentlemen, 
               <br />
               what is proposed to be done .y the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pissing</span> of 
               <br />
               these resolutions? Will their adoption not 
               <br />
               bring on a new election inside of eighteen 
               <br />
               months? There is another observation I 
               <br />
               desire to make with reference to honorable 
               <br />

               <br />
