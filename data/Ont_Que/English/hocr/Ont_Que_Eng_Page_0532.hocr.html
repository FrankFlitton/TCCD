               turn now, Mr. SPEAKER, to another branch 
               <br />
               of my comparison—the ﬁnancial ; and here, 
               <br />
               I may at once give the House an assurance, 
               <br />
               which I am sure it will be glad to have, that 
               <br />
               I will not trouble it with more ﬁgures than 
               <br />
               are absolume necessary to my explanation of 
               <br />
               the views I have to present, and that I will

               not give a single ﬁgure as to which there 
               <br />
               can be the possibility of a controversy. The 
               <br />
               contrast between the ﬁnancial system as a 
               <br />
               whole, with which the framers of the United 
               <br />
               States Constitution started, and the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               system with which it is proposed we shall 
               <br />
               start, is as salient as it is possible for the 
               <br />
               human intellect to conceive ; and further the 
               <br />
               contrast between this proposed ﬁnancial sys- 
               <br />
               tem, and the ﬁnancial system of England, is 
               <br />
               justas salient too. The framers of the United 
               <br />
               States Constitution started with the principle, 
               <br />
               that between the United States and the several 
               <br />
               states there should be no ﬁnancial dealings 
               <br />
               at all. They were to have separate ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               systems, separate treasuries, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> debts 
               <br />
               —all absolutely distinct. An ever since 
               <br />
               the time when the unhappy attempt on the 
               <br />
               part of Great Britain to tax the colonies was 
               <br />
               given up, almost as absolute a line of demar- 
               <br />
               cation between the Imperial ﬁnances and 
               <br />
               treasury and the colonial ﬁnances and trea- 
               <br />
               suries, has been maintained. We have had 
               <br />
               our own separate ﬁnances and our own sepa- 
               <br />
               rate treasury, with which the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government has had nothing to do. The 
               <br />
               Imperial Government may have gone, and 
               <br />
               may still go, to some expense on provincial 
               <br />
               behalf; but the British principle is, that 
               <br />
               Imperial ﬁnance is as distinct from the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial, as in the United States Federal 
               <br />
               ﬁnance is from that of any state. Now, the sys- 
               <br />
               tem proposed here for our adoption is not this 
               <br />
               ofcntire and simple separation of the federal 
               <br />
               from the provincial treasuries, but a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> 
               <br />
               of the most entire and complex confusion 
               <br />
               between them. One has to think a good 
               <br />
               deal upon the subject, and to study it pretty 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">closely</span> to see precisely how the confusion 
               <br />
               15 going to operate ; but there it is, unmistak- 
               <br />
               ably, at every turn. I do not mean to say 
               <br />
               that under all the circumstances of the case 
               <br />
               something of this sort was not unavoidable. 
               <br />
               In the course of debate the other day, I 
               <br />
               remember a remark was thrown across the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor of the House upon this point and the 
               <br />
               Hon. Minister of Finance in effect said : 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Yes,</span> indeed, and it would have been a very 
               <br />
               pleasant thing for gentlemen opposed to the 
               <br />
               scheme, if it had thrown upon the provinces a

               necessity of resorting to direct taxation.” 
               <br />
               Of course, in the mere view of making the 
               <br />
               scheme palatable, it was clever to make 
               <br />
               the Federal treasury pay for provincial 
               <br />
               expenditure; but the system that had need 
               <br />
               be established should bear testimony, not to 
               <br />
               cleverness, but to wisdom. Is the system 
               <br />
               proposed for our acceptance as good, then, as 
               <br />
               statesmen ought to and would have made it? 
               <br />
               I think not; and the extraordinary thing is, 
               <br />
               that it is brought out with a ﬂourish of 
               <br />
               trumpets, on the ground that in some unde- 
               <br />
               scribable way it is t) work most economically! 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Well. to test it, I will take it 
               <br />
               up in three points of view—ﬁrst, as to assets ; 
               <br />
               next, as to debts and liabilities; and, lastly, 
               <br />
               as to revenues. As to the asset part of the 
               <br />
               question, the tale is soon told. The assets 
               <br />
               of these provinces, speaking generally, are of 
               <br />
               very little commercial value. They are 
               <br />
               much like the assets of an insolvent trader, 
               <br />
               with lots of bad debts upon his books; it is of 
               <br />
               small consequence to whom or how they are 
               <br />
               assigned. The general principle upon which 
               <br />
               the scheme proceeds, is to give the Federal 
               <br />
               Government the bulk of these assets. The 
               <br />
               only exceptions of any consequence—I am 
               <br />
               not going into the details of the scheme, 
               <br />
               but still I must present to the House so 
               <br />
               much of detail as to show that I am making 
               <br />
               no rash statement, not borne out by facts—the 
               <br />
               only important exceptions, I say, to this rule 
               <br />
               are those I am aboutto notice. Certain proper- 
               <br />
               ties such as penitentiaries, prisons, lunatic asy- 
               <br />
               lums, and other public charitable institutions, 
               <br />
               and other buildings and properties of the 
               <br />
               kind, which, together with those I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jut</span> 
               <br />
               mentioned, may be characterized as excep-

               tional properties, are to be assigned by the 
               <br />
               general to the provincial governments. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               lso, with the exception of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
