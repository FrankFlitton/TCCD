               my homble way, I endeavored to correct 
               <br />
               what, if not misstatements, were at least 
               <br />
               evidently incorrect statements? We have 
               <br />
               had too much of that kind of thing in this 
               <br />
               country. And since my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Toronto (Hon. Mr. Ross) has chosen to 
               <br />
               remind me of it, I must say that I think it 
               <br />
               is much to be regretted that certain state- 
               <br />
               ments have been made in this country, and 
               <br />
               sent from this country, which, instead of 
               <br />
               helping to build up our credit, have done 
               <br />
               much to injure it. (Hear, hear.) Perhaps 
               <br />
               I could not allude to anything more forcibly 
               <br />
               in point, than the ﬂaming prospectus sent to 
               <br />
               the world under the auspices of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Toronto, in which he promised
