               tleman (Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Demon)</span> has told us that 
               <br />
               the meeting of the county of Laval, which 
               <br />
               was held before the session, had been scarcely

               ut the question of Confederation on its trial. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> beg to remark, sir, that the honorable mem— 
               <br />
               ber is not candid in making this assertion, 
               <br />
               and is ignorant of what did really occur. 
               <br />
               The meeting of the county of Laval was an- 
               <br />
               nounced at the doors of the several churches 
               <br />
               in the county; afterwards an inﬂuential per- 
               <br />
               son in each parish, after mass on the feast of 
               <br />
               the Epiphany, urged the electors, one and all, 
               <br />
               to attend the important meeting at which the 
               <br />
               question of Confederation was to be taken 
               <br />
               into consideration. The opponents of the 
               <br />
               measure were invited to meet me, as I can 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁciently</span> prove in due time and place, but 
               <br />
               their hearts failed them—none came. At that 
               <br />
               meeting, composed of a majority of my eon- 
               <br />
               stituents, I stated at great length all that the 
               <br />
               Opponents of the project had to say against 
               <br />
               it, and the reasons which its friends and ad- 
               <br />
               vocates had to advance in its favor. I then 
               <br />
               asked to be informed of the views of the 
               <br />
               electors. They desired me to give my own 
               <br />
               on the subject. I declared that unless the 
               <br />
               sense of the county was opposed to the mea- 
               <br />
               sure, I was inclined to give it my support. 
               <br />
               This declaration was followed by an unani- 
               <br />
               mous vote, approving of my conduct in Par- 
               <br />
               liament, and declaring that having full conﬁ- 
               <br />
               dence in me, they left me at full liberty to 
               <br />
               vote according to my conscience on this great 
               <br />
               measure. Let the hon. member deny this if he 
               <br />
               can. The hon. member (Hen. Mr. DORION) 
               <br />
               has stated “ that it was not rightto change the 
               <br />
               Constitution without an appeal to the decision 
               <br />
               of the pee le.” As a complete answerto that 
               <br />
               assertion, shall quote the words spoken by 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman on the 2nd February, 
               <br />
               1859—“ If he (HON. Ma. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Demon)</span> had re- 
               <br />
               mained in power, he would have proposed a 
               <br />
               measure for the settlement of the representa- 
               <br />
               tion question, and would have submitted it to 
               <br />
               the decision of the House,” &amp;c., <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lite.</span> Has not 
               <br />
               the honorable member changed his opinions ? 
               <br />
               When a member of the Government in 1858, 
               <br />
               he did not admit that the people had the right 
               <br />
               to be consulted on the constitutional changes 
               <br />
               he wished to propose; but as a Leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition, in 1865, he refuses to the Legis- 
               <br />
               lature the right of eﬁecting such changes 
               <br />
               without an appeal to the people: Tempora 
               <br />

               <br />
               spirit. The honorable member for Hochelaga

               <br />
               Let us examine. On reading over the 
               <br />
               speeches cited b himself in support of his 
               <br />
               denial, what do ﬁnd ? “ A time will per- 
               <br />
               haps come when the Confederation of all the

               <br />
               aver of it at this moment.” Further on I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd: “ I trust the time will come when it 
               <br />
               will be desirable for the Canadas to unite 
               <br />
               federatively with the Lower Provinœs, but 
               <br />
               the time has not yet arrived for such a nea- 
               <br />
               sure.”-—(Speech of 3rd May, 1860.) Now 
               <br />
               what is the conclusion, the only logical con 
               <br />
               clusion to be deduced from the honorable 
               <br />
               member’s words ? None other than the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fol—</span> 
               <br />
               lowin : that in all these instances he declared 
               <br />
               hi in favor of a Confederation of all 
               <br />
               the provinces, sooner or later. The honor- 
               <br />
               able member therefore deceived his electors 
               <br />
               when he said to them in his manifesto of the 
               <br />
               7th November last: “ Every time I have had 
               <br />
               an opportunity I have invariably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressed</span> 
               <br />
               myself opposed to any union, whether Legis- 
               <br />
               lative or Federal, with the Maritime Provin- 
               <br />
               ces.” He wished, therefore, to mislead this 
               <br />
               House, when in his speech at the commence- 
               <br />
               ment of this debate he attempted to show 
               <br />
               that he had been wrongfully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seemed</span> on that 
               <br />
               point, and that the expressions he had used 
               <br />
               had been tortured into every shape in order 
               <br />
               to establish the attacks made upon him. In 
               <br />
               the political letter of the honorable member 
               <br />
               to his constituents, to which I alluded a mo- 
               <br />
               ment ago, I ﬁnd the following words: “ The 
               <br />
               proposed union appears to me to be prema- 
               <br />
               ture.” If the words have any meaning at 
               <br />
               all, do they not prove that the honorable 
               <br />
               member admitted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thef</span> necessity of such a 
               <br />
               union sooner or later? The honorable mem— 
               <br />
               ber was therefore not sincere when he wrote 
               <br />
               to his electors that he was always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">OW</span> to 
               <br />
               the Confederation of the provinces of Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North America. Hear.) The honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman stated “ that he could not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under.</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
