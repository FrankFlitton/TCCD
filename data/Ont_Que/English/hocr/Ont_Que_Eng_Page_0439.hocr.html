               but I maintain that as yet we are not in a

               in fact we are hardly in a position to consider

               the subject at all; and I do maintain that it

               is hardly fair to introduce it as an element

               into this discussion, so long as the Government 
               <br />
               withhold from us the oﬂicial information

               which may be assumed to be in their posses-

               sion on that subject. I have risen, therefore, 
               <br />
               to express the hope that the honorable gentle-

               <br />
               propriety of submitting to this House the

               fullest possible information on that subject.

               (Hear, hear.) I am sure my honorable friend

               who has just taken his seat will himself admit

               HON. J. S. MACDONALD—My honor- 
               <br />
               rable friend from Chateaugnay (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               HOLTON) has very properly called the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the Government to the necessity of 
               <br />
               having laid before this House information as 
               <br />
               to the amount we shall have to a propriate 
               <br />
               for the defences of the country. t is well 
               <br />
               known that Imperial oﬂicers were sent out 
               <br />
               some time ago to make a survey, and report 
               <br />
               on the defensive condition of this country, 
               <br />
               and the best points at which to build fortiﬁ- 
               <br />
               cations—the points d’appui, where in cases of 
               <br />
               disaster we should be obliged to take shelter, 
               <br />
               if the enemy drove us into our garrisons. The 
               <br />
               report of these ofﬁcers was made before I left 
               <br />
               oﬂice, more than a year ago. Surely during 
               <br />
               that time, with such a loyal administration as 
               <br />
               that composed of the honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               now on the Treasury benches, the secret of 
               <br />
               the amount of the appropriation that will be 
               <br />
               required at our hands has not been kept from 
               <br />
               them. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me that 
               <br />
               this is a branch of the question to which we 
               <br />
               must address ourselves, before we are in a

               <br />
               well at an early date—I mean the portion of 
               <br />
               the Government who will have to speak for 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, and who are especially respon- 
               <br />
               sible for the acts of the Administration with 
               <br />

               <br />
               give their attention to the question how far 
               <br />
               the Catholics of Upper Canada are to be 
               <br />
               placed in the position of maintaining their 
               <br />
               schools and claiming their portion of the 
               <br />
               public funds, and enjoying generally the 
               <br />
               same privileges which are to be enjoyed, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the declaration of the Honorable 
               <br />
               Attorne General East, by the Protestants of 
               <br />
               Lower anada. I express no opinion at this 
               <br />
               time as to the propriety of the demands made 
               <br />
               by the Protestants of Lower Canada, or as to 
               <br />
               what I shall be pre ared to do when that ques- 
               <br />
               tion comes up. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nbr</span> do I express now any 
               <br />
               opinion as to the propriety of giving the Ca- 
               <br />
               tholics of Upper Canada more rights than 
               <br />
               they have get. But I say the Government 
               <br />
               ought to address themselves at once to the 
               <br />
               question, whether they are to make the same 
               <br />
               provision for the Catholics of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               as for the Protestants of Lower Canada. This 
               <br />
               is a matter which comes home to the feelings 
               <br />
               of the Catholics of Upper Canada, and they 
               <br />
               have here at this moment delegates to express 
               <br />
               their opinions. No doubt, to enforce what 
               <br />
               they conceive to be their own rights, they 
               <br />
               will use as a lever the proposition to extend 
               <br />
               to the Protestants of Lower Canada the priv- 
               <br />
               ileges which they claim as their due. And 
               <br />
               depend upon it, that when the time comes for 
               <br />
               the Protestants of Lower Canada to ask what 
               <br />
               they assert to be their rights, they will be ex- 
               <br />
               pected to stand up also for the Catholics of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, and to deal out to them the 
               <br />
               same justice which they expect the Catholics 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada to extend to them.
