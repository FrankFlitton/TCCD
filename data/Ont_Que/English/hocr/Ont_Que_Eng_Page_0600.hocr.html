               As regards the sentiments of Great Britain 
               <br />
               in relation to us, the events which have taken 
               <br />
               place since the union show that they are al- 
               <br />
               together changed. In 1840 we had a Con- 
               <br />
               stitution imposed upon us against our will, and 
               <br />
               by so doing Great Britain was guilty of in- 
               <br />
               justice towards us. Now they await our decision 
               <br />
               before they act. In past days England looked 
               <br />
               upon the colonies as her own special markets, 
               <br />
               and fortiﬁed them by prohibitory duties against 
               <br />
               foreign trade. Now they are open to the 
               <br />
               whole world. Formerly we were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under,</span> a des- 
               <br />
               potio <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> oligarohical government, and since 
               <br />
               1841 we have had that British Parliamentary 
               <br />
               Government which the great economist TUR- 
               <br />
               GOT, more than sixty years before, had ad- 
               <br />
               vised England to extend to her colonies. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gHear,</span> hear.) Thus the Parliament of Great 
               <br />
               ritain, which had just proclaimed the union 
               <br />
               with Ireland, incorporated into its legislature 
               <br />

               Britain, without recourse to a dissolution 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               themselves 0 the responsibility of their functions, 
               <br />
               by submitting statutes to the will of the people, 
               <br />
               in their primary capacity. But these proceediu s 
               <br />
               have been held, and very rightly, to be entire y 
               <br />
               unconstitutional and invalid. The duties of 
               <br />
               legislation are not to be exercised by the people 
               <br />
               at large. The majority governs, but only in the 
               <br />
               prescribed form; the introduction of practices of 
               <br />
               this kind would remove all checks on hasty and 
               <br />
               improvident legislation, and greatly diminish the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts of re resentative government. So where 
               <br />
               an act to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establish</span> free schools was, by its terms, 
               <br />
               directed to be submitted to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">electors</span> of the 
               <br />
               state, to become a law only in case a majority of 
               <br />
               the votes were given in its favor, it was held, in 
               <br />
               New York, that the whole proceeding was 
               <br />
               entirely void. The Lagislature, said the Court 
               <br />
               of Appeals, have no power to make such submis- 
               <br />
               sion, nor had the people the power to bind each 
               <br />
               other by acting upon it. They voluntarily sur- 
               <br />
               rendered that power when they adopted the con- . 
               <br />
               stitution. The government of this state is 
               <br />
               democratic ; but it is arepresentative democrac , 
               <br />
               and in passing general laws, the people act on y 
               <br />
               through their representatives in the Legislature. 
               <br />
               And in Pennsylvania, in the case of an excise 
               <br />
               statute, the same stern and salutary doctrine has 
               <br />
               been applied. In some of the more recent state 
               <br />
               constitutions this rule has been made a part of the 
               <br />
               fundamental law. 80 in Indiana, the principle is 
               <br />
               now framed into a constitutional provision which 
               <br />
               vests the legislative authOrit in a Senate and 
               <br />
               House of Representatives, an declares that no 
               <br />
               act “ shall be passed, the taking effect of which 
               <br />
               shall be made to depend upon any authority 
               <br />
               except as provided in the Constitution.” And 
               <br />
               under these provisions it has been held that so 
               <br />
               much of an act as relates to its submission to the 
               <br />
               papular vote, was null and void.
