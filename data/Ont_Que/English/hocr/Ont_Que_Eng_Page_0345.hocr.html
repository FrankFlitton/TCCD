               <br />
               of the immense expenditure which it will 
               <br />
               entail upon the country, not only now, but 
               <br />
               for all time to come. I think that that 
               <br />
               expenditure will be so great that it will fall 
               <br />

               <br />
               so ve poorly able to bear the burden, and 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> road will be of very little use to the

               country. Much has been said about this 
               <br />
               scheme not being understood by the people. 
               <br />
               With regard to that, I can only speak of my 
               <br />
               own locality. Before coming here, I went 
               <br />
               through my own constituency, and conversed 
               <br />
               with a great many leading men of all political 
               <br />
               parties, and all urged me to go for Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, without a single exception. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I pointed out the objections which I 
               <br />
               had to the scheme. I told them that I dis—

               Railway—and of the increased expense of 
               <br />
               maintaining two sets of government. I pointed 
               <br />
               out all these and other objections, but not- 
               <br />
               withstanding, they said that it would be far 
               <br />
               better to take Federation, even as proposed by 
               <br />
               the resolutions, than to remain as we are. 
               <br />
               They said: “ The government of the country

               measure, and some change is therefore abso- 
               <br />
               lutely necessary.” The question then arises, 
               <br />
               What are we to do ? Now, I would ask the 
               <br />
               opponents of this scheme, if they have any 
               <br />
               other plan to propose that will relieve the 
               <br />
               country of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculties</span> under which it has 
               <br />
               been laboring? (Hear, hear.) On the other 
               <br />
               hand, we have been told by high authority 
               <br />
               that we were on the brink of ruin. We were 
               <br />
               told by the honorable and gallant Knight at 
               <br />
               the head of the Government, that we were on 
               <br />
               an “ inclined plane,” on which we were fast 
               <br />
               sliding into the republic of the United States 
               <br />
               of America. I think it is therefore my duty 
               <br />
               to vote for the resolutions as they stand, and 
               <br />
               to vote for no amendments of any kind. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) We are told that if we adopt 
               <br />
               any amendments to the resolutions, the whole 
               <br />
               scheme must fall to the ground. Are we to 
               <br />
               go back to the position we formerly occupied, 
               <br />

               that these resolutions are a ﬁnalit ? Gentle-

               men, the Constitution of the onfederation 
               <br />
               can be altered in future as easil as our 
               <br />
               present Constitution has been al . I ho 
               <br />
               this scheme will go into effect at an ear y 
               <br />
               period, and I trust it will be productive of a 
               <br />
               vast amount of good to our country. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Honorable gentlemen say it is a 
               <br />
               revolution. It may be a revolution, but 
               <br />
               certainly it is not so violent a one as was 
               <br />
               pro in 1837 and 1838. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               There has been a great deal of heavy artillery 
               <br />
               brought into play since this debate began, but 
               <br />
               I hope that the revolution will be carried out 
               <br />
               without the shedding of blood. (Hear, hear 
               <br />
               and laughter.) I am prepared to give my

               <br />

               <br />
               if I have been wron in doing so, it has been 
               <br />
               through want of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judgment.</span> I have had no 
               <br />
               other intention in so doing than to promote

               the best interests of the country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As,</span> how- 
               <br />
               ever, I observe that a large majority of this

               House entertains a diﬂ'erent opinion, I shall 
               <br />
               no longer attempt to mar the scheme, but 
               <br />
               shall give it my support when the time for 
               <br />
               voting upon it arrives. (Hear, hear, and 
               <br />
               cheers.) I never intended to mar it, but I 
               <br />
               wished to be sure that the country was satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed with it, and would appreciate it when 
               <br />
               they got it. (Hear.) I think human nature 
               <br />
               is the same now as it always was and always 
               <br />
               will be. As the hon. Premier and the hon. 
               <br />
               Commissioner of Crown Lands have used 
               <br />
               some comparisons with reference to the pro- 
               <br />
               posed union, I have also a comparison to 
               <br />
               make. They said that a union could not be 
               <br />
               effected without some sacriﬁces—a little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">givmg</span> 
               <br />
               and taking all round. I think so too, bu 
               <br />
               think there is a different way in which this 
               <br />
               proposed union must be viewed. I compare 
               <br />
               Canada to a young man who has had guar- 
               <br />
               dians appointed to take care of his estate;

               but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having.</span> arrived at that age that his guar-

               dians think it is time he should be married, 
               <br />
               they arrange a matrimonial alliance for him. 
               <br />
               He is all the time looking on, and expecting 
               <br />
               to be asked how the arrangement suits him. 
               <br />
