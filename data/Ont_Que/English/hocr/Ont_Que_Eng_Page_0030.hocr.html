               wel known that there was an anti-colonial

               <br />

               <br />
               were rejected, the eﬁ'ect would be very injuri- 
               <br />

               the reverse would be the case. Its acceptance

               would also iniprove our position in the eyes of 
               <br />
               our n'ei bore in France and other nations; 
               <br />
               indeed it would, in all probability, give us a

               national standing, without the necessity of 
               <br />
               separating from the mother country. For these 
               <br />
               reasons he had come to the conscientious con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               reject the scheme, and that it was our duty to 
               <br />
               pass it as soon as was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ponsistent</span> with a due

               consideration of what was due to' so important 
               <br />
               a subject. He did not think it necessary to 
               <br />
               express, at greater length, his reasons for giv- 
               <br />
               ing the motion‘his support, but he again de- 
               <br />
               sired it to be well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understood</span> that he spoke 
               <br />
               only for himself, and not in concert with any 
               <br />
               one else. At the same time he might say, 
               <br />
               that from what he knew personally of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               highly favorable to the measure. There might
