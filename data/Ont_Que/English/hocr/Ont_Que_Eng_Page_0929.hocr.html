               Canada, when he referred to the robable eﬁ'ect 
               <br />
               of the Pope’s encyclical on the atholic mind 
               <br />
               of the country. They think that if the 
               <br />
               principles inculcated in that letter were acted 
               <br />
               upon, their religious liberties and privileges 
               <br />
               would be in ril. But it would appear that 
               <br />
               my honorable friend had not the true key to 
               <br />
               the interpretation of that famous document. 
               <br />
               Catholic commentators ﬁnd it to be perfectly 
               <br />
               innocuous when roperly understood. 
               <br />
               that as it may, rely rather on the good 
               <br />
               sense and feeling of Catholics them- 
               <br />
               selves, and above all, on the religious liberty 
               <br />
               secured to us in this province, than on the 
               <br />
               Pope’s encyclical, for the protection of our 
               <br />
               liberties, whether civil or religious. Let us 
               <br />
               be united in object and in interest as a peo- 
               <br />
               ple, and I have no fear, however diversiﬁed 
               <br />
               our opinions may be on matters personal 
               <br />
               to ourselves, but that we shall grow up to be 
               <br />
               a great nation, and that a glorious future 
               <br />
               awaits us. (Hear, hear.) As there are yet 
               <br />
               several honorable gentlemen to address the 
               <br />
               House, I shall not trespass on its attention 
               <br />
               much longer, as I am anxious the debate 
               <br />
               should be brought to a close as soon as pos- 
               <br />
               sible, in order that the Government may be 
               <br />
               able, by its re resentatives in England, to 
               <br />
               perform those important duties which are so 
               <br />
               urgent a so necessary at the present mo- 
               <br />
               ment. ( ear, hear.) Before sitting down, 
               <br />
               however, I wish to make one or two remarks 
               <br />
               on the conﬂicting opinions entertained by 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen on the permanenc of 
               <br />
               our relations to the Mother Country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> do 
               <br />
               not believe there is any large party there who 
               <br />
               desire to separate themselves from us. On 
               <br />
               the contrary, I believe the great bulk of the 
               <br />
               British people are proud of the connection, 
               <br />
               and are prepared to maintain it if we do our part 
               <br />
               in cultivating that connection by meeting their 
               <br />
               just and reasonable demands. There can be 
               <br />
               no doubt that one cause of dissatisfaction ex- 
               <br />
               pressed in En land towards us has resulted 
               <br />
               from our policy. I shall venture no 
               <br />
               Opinion on that policy just now, whether it 
               <br />
               was wise or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">otherwise,</span> but it strikes me very 
               <br />
               forcibly that we have it now in our power to 
               <br />
               set ourselves right on that point, and to it I 
               <br />
               would respectfully invite the attention of the 
               <br />
               Government. The question of our defences 
               <br />
               is very earnestly pressed on our attention by 
               <br />
               the authorities at home; but that is undoubt- 
               <br />
               edly an Imperial as well as a provincial ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and mi ht be dealt with in this way. If

               our position, except at one or two points, is

               we are anxious to continue our relations with

               it will smooth the way for the removal of any 
               <br />

               Privileges and duties are reciprocal, and

               should be met in a cordial spirit; and let it 
               <br />
               be remembered that material interests are, of 
               <br />
               all others, the most binding upon nations in

               <br />
               me, sir, it is a matter cl extreme importance 
               <br />
               that our relations with the Mother Country 
               <br />
