               <br />
               member for Chateauguay of Resolutions upon 
               <br />
               the question of a Bill for the Government of 
               <br />
               India was not one of Resolutions for an Address, 
               <br />
               but of Resolutions sim l , containing the pro- 
               <br />
               posed principles of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gill</span> intended to be intro- 
               <br />
               duced. It is not pretended here that this House 
               <br />
               has any right to pass such a Bill, or that it is 
               <br />
               intended to present one on that subject here. The 
               <br />
               reasons why it is convenient to discuss matters in 
               <br />
               the form of a Resolution on which a Bill is after- 
               <br />
               wards to be introduced, is that Resolutions more 
               <br />
               easily admit of alteration. The Government 
               <br />
               have expressed their determination not to admit 
               <br />
               of any alterations in these Resolutions. Thus it 
               <br />
               is obvious that the same reasons for going into 
               <br />
               Committee do not hold. The member who 
               <br />
               moves an Address can force the vote on his 
               <br />
               motion in the manner he has put it, unless the 
               <br />
               form of it be changed by amendment, and this 
               <br />
               appears to be the only course open here. In 
               <br />
               truth the word ‘ Resolutions’ might very well 
               <br />
               have been omitted altogether from this motion.
