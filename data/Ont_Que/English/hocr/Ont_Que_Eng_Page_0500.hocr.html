               the honorable gentleman. Confederation is

               <br />
               able member for Lotbinierc has further told 
               <br />
               us. I am far from being of that opinion. 
               <br />
               Lower Canada has since the union beheld, for 
               <br />
               a period of twenty-four ears, her institutions 
               <br />
               at the mercy of a majority different in origin, 
               <br />
               in religion, and in language. Under Confed- 
               <br />
               eration, on the other hand, Lower Canada will 
               <br />
               have the administration of all she holds most 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dear—her</span> nationality, and I am rejoiced to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in the speech of the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Hochelaga some few words which abun- 
               <br />
               dantly prove my proposition. “It will be 
               <br />
               impossible," says that honorable gentleman, 
               <br />
               “for the Federal Government ever to inter- 
               <br />
               fere in any legislation relating to the institu- 
               <br />
               tions or laws of Lower Canada. If they at- 
               <br />
               tempted, the ﬁfty or sixty members of French 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">origin,</span> uniting as one man, would very soon 
               <br />
               put a stop to any legislation, thus compelling 
               <br />
               the majority to afford them justice.” (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Lower Canada, it is true, will be in a 
               <br />
               minority in the Central Legislature, but we 
               <br />
               must not lose sight of the fact that the inter- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ests</span> of the Lower Provinces are less identical 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With</span> the interests of Upper Canada than they 
               <br />
               are with those of Lower Canada; and, more— 
               <br />
               over, our position in the centre of the state 
               <br />
               also adds to our inﬂuence. On the other 
               <br />
               hand, responsible government is essentially a 
               <br />
               government of parties; the national French- 
               <br />
               Canadiau representation will have all that 
               <br />
               inﬂuence which ﬁfty or sixty votes given to 
               <br />
               one side of the House or the other can exer- 
               <br />
               cme; the one party or the other will count 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> the votes of the French-Canadian section, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> as in England the Protestant majority 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> Parliament is not made up without the 
               <br />
               votes of the Catholic minority. Thus the 
               <br />
               position of Lower Canada will be a strong 
               <br />

               <br />
               objection I have only, Mr. SPEAKER, to make 
               <br />
               the same reply which I have already given on 
               <br />
               another occasion. Will not Confederation, 
               <br />
               whilst remedying our sectional diﬂiculties, 
               <br />
               contribute to the progress and advancement of 
               <br />
               these colonies ? Will it not increase our means 
               <br />
               of defence, securing at the same time to Lower 
               <br />
               Canada the exclusive control of its institutions, 
               <br />
               its laws and its nationality ? If to this propo- 
               <br />
               sition we are compelled, after careful consider- 
               <br />
               ation, to reply in the negative, then, un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly, we ought to reject the scheme; 
               <br />
               but if, on the contrary, our answer is in the 
               <br />
               aﬂirmativc, we ought to accept it, even al- 
               <br />
               though our expenditure should be increased, 
               <br />
               for it becomes the means of safety—Salas 
               <br />
               populi suprema lan. Certain other members 
               <br />
               object “that the Legislative Council is to be 
               <br />
               subject to the nomination of the Crown." 
               <br />
               For my part, I see no ground of objection in 
               <br />
               this; on the contrary, I look upon it as an 
               <br />
               argument in favor of the scheme. I have 
               <br />
               always been opposed to the elective system in 
               <br />
               that branch of our Legislature. We have but 
               <br />
               one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">class</span> in our society, we have no aristo- 
               <br />
               cracy. Why, then, should we have two popu— 
               <br />
               lar chambers ? In my opinion, it would have 
               <br />
               been wiser to abolish the Council than to 
               <br />
               make it elective. In the spirit of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Enalish</span> 
               <br />
               Constitution, the Legislative Council ts a 
               <br />
               tribunal for purifying the legislation of the 
               <br />
               Commons, for weighing in the balance ol" 
               <br />
               experience the probable consequences of their 
               <br />
               legislation. These advantages, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               will soon disappear under the elective system, 
               <br />
               which will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cause</span> the members of that body to 
               <br />
               lose that perfect independence requisite for the 
               <br />
               proper fulﬁlment of the high mission entrusted 
               <br />
               to them by the Constitution. In addition to 
               <br />
               this, the trouble of elections, the expenses 
               <br />
               which they entail, and the other difficulties 
               <br />
               inseparable from those great struggles, will 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">veri</span> often prevent the entrance into that hon-

               ora le body of the most competent men, whom 
               <br />

               <br />
               have just referred to, will induce to avoid 
               <br />
               public life and to remain in private life. For 
               <br />
               these reasons and in the public interest, I re- 
               <br />
