               that the Confederation of all the Provinces of

               British North America would be preferable, 
               <br />
               and is our only remedy. The Confederation

               <br />
               people. But when I speak of a great and 
               <br />
               werful nation, far be it from me to wish 
               <br />
               that we should form an independent nation, 
               <br />
               and that we should abandon the protection 
               <br />
               of the British ﬂag; on the contrary, I ear- 
               <br />
               nestly hope that we shall long remain under 
               <br />
               the protection of that ﬂag. What I would 
               <br />
               say is, that with Confederation we shall be 
               <br />
               in a better position for self-defence, and to 
               <br />
               aid the Mother Country under certain exi- 
               <br />
               cies, than we are at the present time. 
               <br />
               Having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> the Central Govern- 
               <br />
               ment will be in a position to have its orders 
               <br />
               carried out over its whole territory ; and when 
               <br />
               the question of defence comes up, it will not 
               <br />
               be obliged to consult four or ﬁve diﬁ‘erent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislaturœ,</span> but it will be able to organise 
               <br />
               our defences immediately and without ob- 
               <br />
               struction. Besides, we shall have acquired 
               <br />
               a standing which we have not hitherto 
               <br />
               attained in our relations with other countries 
               <br />
               with which we have dealings. It is of no 
               <br />
               mall importance for the inhabitants of 
               <br />
               a country to have a standing in foreign 
               <br />
               countries, and not to be treated as men 
               <br />
               of inferior position. When Canadians go 
               <br />
               to London or elsewhere out of their own 
               <br />
               country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> have no recognized posi- 
               <br />
               tion, because we are only a simple colony. 
               <br />
               But under the Confederation we shall be 
               <br />
               _ tested by England, and besides we shall

               Here is another question which especially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">M</span> 
               <br />
               Canada. In the course of last year, the subsidy

               <br />
               the Imperial Government. Another posts subsidy 
               <br />
               of £78,000 was just bein granted by the Imperial
