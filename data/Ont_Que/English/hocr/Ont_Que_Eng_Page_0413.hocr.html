               HON. MR. BOLTON—Before the debate 
               <br />
               is resumed, I would enquire whether it is 
               <br />
               the purpose of the Government to bring 
               <br />

               of education in Lower Canada, before the

               need not say to honorable gentlemen that 
               <br />
               this is a matter which is regarded with a

               great deal of in terest by a very large portion

               strong Opinions adverse to the pro 'aion

               now before the House. Far be it me 
               <br />
               to deprecate discussion—discussion of the 
               <br />
               amplest, widest, and most searching charac- 
               <br />
               ter, on this important question. And 
               <br />
               far be it— from me, by the use of a single 
               <br />
               word, to impute to those honorable members, 
               <br />
               who ieel it their duty to oppose this measure. 
               <br />
               any absence of patriotism. I believe they 
               <br />
               are actuated by the same ardent desire for 
               <br />
               the good of the country, which I claim for 
               <br />
               myself. (Hear, hear.) It is right that the 
               <br />
               question should be considered in all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it:</span> 
               <br />
               details—not merely in its hearings on the 
               <br />
               present state of parties, but as respects its 
               <br />
               inﬂuence in all time to come on the country 
               <br />
               at large. And with that view I think it 
               <br />
               ought to be calmly, deliberately and patiently 
               <br />
               investigated, and instead of deprecating the

               fullest and most ample discussion, I trust

               are few who, in the abstract, would not favour 
               <br />
               the idea of a union between a number of

               small states adjoining each other, rather

               which is made to the present scheme by a not 
               <br />
               unimportant class, is this—that the mere 
               <br />
               abstract principle of union does not apply 
               <br />
               with full force to colonies circumstanced as 
               <br />
               Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince

               colonies that are parties to this scheme. It 
               <br />
               is feared by many that it is the ﬁrst step

               towards independence—that it must tend to

               loosen the ties now existing between this and

               the mother country—that it changes our
