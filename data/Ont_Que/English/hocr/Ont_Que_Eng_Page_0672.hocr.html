               the bribes in ever direction with which they 
               <br />

               <br />
               to New Brunswick and Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               of the Intercolonial Railway, rejected by 
               <br />
               those to whom they were ‘oﬁ'ered. Canada

               position, and not suffered the humiliation of

               <br />
               dignantly rejected by the people of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces. The Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               West says that the scheme of Confederation 
               <br />
               has obtamed the consent of the governments 
               <br />
               of all the provinces; but where are those 
               <br />
               governments now ? Where is the Government 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick? Where is the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Prince Edward Island ? (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) As for the Government of Nova Sco— 
               <br />
               tia, it pledged itself to bring the scheme be— 
               <br />
               fore the Legislature; but it is wellknown that 
               <br />
               it dare not press it, and still less appeal to 
               <br />
               the people upon it. The members of that 
               <br />
               Government were wiser than the Government 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick, and would not appeal to 
               <br />
               the people. And here I must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> that I
