               tion in the negative. Surprise has been ex-

               pressed in certain quarters at the opposition

               advan which we were promised should

               result from it. Thus it was said that under

               sentatives at the onferenee stated that if the

               <br />
               been allowed to regulate herself the export duty

               on the export of its coal, whatsoever it may

               pay the duty in order to get the coal of that

               <br />
               question of the ﬁsheries. Article 17, of the
