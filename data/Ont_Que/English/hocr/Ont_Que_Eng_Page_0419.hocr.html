               if England, in case of war, should, for the

               We know that in modern warfare, if you

               can erect certain works which will compel 
               <br />
               an enemy to sit down before them, so as to

               <br />

               scheme of the defence commissioners may 
               <br />

               <br />

               following spring. If therefore we can only,

               country, prevent the progress of invasion, we 
               <br />
               are safe. Sudden conquest would be impos-

               Every one knows the history of the celebra-

               ted lines of Torres Vedras, which extended 
               <br />
               thirty miles, and by means of which the

               <br />
               rope was ﬁrst rolled back. These lines 
               <br />
               were defended by but a small number of 
               <br />
               men, and they compelled Napoleon to retire 
               <br />
               before them. Then, on this continent we have 
               <br />
               the experience of Richmond, which has 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               is next to impossible to subdue us. The
