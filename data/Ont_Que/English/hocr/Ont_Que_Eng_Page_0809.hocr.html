               am of Opinion that the Government ought

               not, in the ﬁrst place, to humiliate us by 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               must triple the expenditure, and lastly, fail

               in the respect which they owe to the people,

               the Constitution. If I am not greatly mis-

               stitutional changes is the very party which 
               <br />
               calls itself Conservative, who obtained their

               elections to preserve and guard the Consti- 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because,</span> it exclaimed, we were the allies of

               what do these hon. gentlemen do to-day ?

               Instead of preserving the Constitution, they

               change it and indeed destroy it, by granting

               however humble he may be, who has not just

               protest against the usurpation which this

               House, in my humble opinion, is guilty

               of in undertaking to pass this measure, or, 
               <br />
               so far as in its power lies, to impose upon 
               <br />
               the people of this country a Constitution con- 
               <br />
               trary to their wishes—a Constitution which 
               <br />
               they will never have an Opportunity of 
               <br />
               seeing, until they are called upon to submit to 
               <br />
               it and obey it. I rise to protest also against 
               <br />
               this parliamentary gag by which the at- 
               <br />
               tempt is made to suppress free discussion in 
               <br />
               this House, and to compel it to adopt against 
               <br />
               its will, or against its reason and judgment, 
               <br />
               a measure with which, perhaps, a very large 
               <br />
               number of the honorable members of this 
               <br />
               House have no real sympathy. It is no 
               <br />
               answer to me to say that I may express my 
               <br />
               views freely—that I may fully discuss this 
               <br />
               question. It is no answer to say that I have 
               <br />
               the privilege of pointing out the defects of 
               <br />
               this measure, if 1 am denied the privilege of

               <br />
               ting on record what I may consider its 
               <br />
               objectionable features—if I am denied the 
               <br />
               right of submitting to the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">substantive</span> 
               <br />
               motions and resolutions, which might perhaps 
               <br />
               meet the sense of the majority of this House, 
               <br />
