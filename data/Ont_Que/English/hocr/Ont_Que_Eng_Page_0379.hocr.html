               <br />
               ance of the question. I have no right to 
               <br />
               maintain that all those who are favorabl dis- 
               <br />
               posed towards Confederation are not acting in 
               <br />
               good faith; it is not my wish to reproach 
               <br />
               them for acting according to their convictions, 
               <br />
               but in so acting they should not forget the 
               <br />
               duties which their charge imposes on them. 
               <br />
               It a well known .fact that when the scheme 
               <br />
               of Confederation was laid before the pub- 
               <br />
               lio, all the newspapers, and most of the 
               <br />
               members who support the Administration, 
               <br />
               declared themselves in favor of the scheme, 
               <br />
               but, in nearly every- instance, with an ex- 
               <br />
               press reservation of the right to introduce 
               <br />
               certain amendments which they considered 
               <br />
               indispensable. But the Honorable Attor- 
               <br />
               ney General for Upper Canada declared, 
               <br />
               some days ago, that the Government would 
               <br />
               accept no amendment, and that the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions must be adopted exactly in the shape in 
               <br />
               which they were brought down. Are honor- 
               <br />
               able members going to submit to this decree? 
               <br />
               Is it not their intention at least to make an 
               <br />
               eﬁ'ort to have those amendments, which they 
               <br />
               looked upon as indispensable, adopted ? Their 
               <br />
               position in relation to the Government confers 
               <br />
               upon them an inﬂuence which they can never 
               <br />
               exert more usefully than at present; it is 
               <br />
               their duty to exert that inﬂuence; they are 
               <br />
               responsible for the results of this measure, 
               <br />
               which cannot be adopted without their con- 
               <br />
               currence. Their principal argument in sup- 
               <br />
               port of Confederation is that we have now an 
               <br />

               nature of the form of Government which will 
               <br />
               be imposed on Lower Canada? Can they 
               <br />
               say whether we shall have Responsible Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment ? No! for the Ministry refuses to 
               <br />
               speak; it will only k when the measure 
               <br />

               <br />
               when it is too late to raise any objections. 
               <br />
               Responsible government would not be a very 
               <br />
               eﬁcacious remedy for the evils which I fore- 
               <br />
               see, but it would, at all events, be a means of 
               <br />
               defence for us, and we ought not to reject it. 
               <br />
               It is true that, accordi to the 4lst article 
               <br />
               of the resolutions, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“¥he</span> local governments

               <br />
