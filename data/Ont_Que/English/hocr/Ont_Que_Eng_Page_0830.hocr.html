               been contended for, and facts will go to 
               <br />

               <br />
               lation, as is proposed by this scheme. But 
               <br />
               as it was necessary to establish some basis 
               <br />
               for contributing to the expenses of the 
               <br />
               local governments, without compelling them 
               <br />
               to resort to direct taxation, I think the 
               <br />
               principle adopted, that of population, is not 
               <br />
               unjust. (Hear, hear.) Again, it is argued 
               <br />
               that as Canada West contributes in the pro— 
               <br />
               portion already alluded to, that in the pay- 
               <br />
               ment of subsidies she will contribute more 
               <br />
               than her fair prôportion in the proposed 
               <br />
               Confederacy. To this I reply, if the hypo- 
               <br />
               thesis that the proportion which Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada respectively contribute to the 
               <br />
               general revenue be correct, and that the 
               <br />
               subsidy should be based upon revenue and 
               <br />
               not population, then undoubtedly the argu- 
               <br />
               ment is a good one. But, sir, let us see if 
               <br />
               the proposed arrangement is not a great 
               <br />
               improvement on the present method of dis- 
               <br />
               tributing the public funds. It is well known, 
               <br />
               air, that the complaint which U per Canada 
               <br />
               has made in the past was that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> appropri-

               according to population, but in utter disre-

               gard of both. Under the system which

               <br />
               SPEAKER, that it will give us national im- 
               <br />
               portance. (Hear.) But here again it is 
               <br />
               objected that to obtain this we must have a 
               <br />
               vast population. When the colonies now 
               <br />
               forming a portion of the American union 
               <br />
               severed the connection from the parentstate, 
               <br />
               their population was set down at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2,500,000,</span> 
               <br />
               and although an impression has very gener- 
               <br />
               ally obtained that they have increased in 
               <br />
               population faster than we have,.an examina- 
               <br />
               tion into the facts shows that such is not 
               <br />
               the case—for in 1860 their population 
               <br />
               reached 30,000,000, an increase of 1,200 
               <br />
               per cent, while ours in the same period had 
               <br />
               increased from 145,000 in 1784, to 3,000,000 
               <br />
               in 1861, or over 2,300 per cent. (ﬂeur.) 
               <br />
               Confederation, sir, would give us nationality 
               <br />
               -—-I speak of British nationality—a nation 
               <br />
               created from the fragmentary portions of the 
               <br />
               provinces of Britain on this continent, but 
               <br />
               still retaining its allegiance to the British ' 
               <br />
               Crown. Then, sir, it is claimed that the 
               <br />
               commercial advantages which may arise 
               <br />
               from Confederation of the provinces can œ 
               <br />
               readily be obtained by a Legislative as a 
               <br />
               Federal union. This is admitted; but as 
               <br />
               that is not obtainable, and as a union would 
               <br />
               remove the barriers to commercial inter- 
               <br />
               course and foster the trade between the 
               <br />
               colonies (each of which now effects more 
               <br />
               exchanges with the United States than with 
               <br />
               all the rest of the provinces), it is desirable 
               <br />
               that the union should take place. (ﬂeur.) 
               <br />
               This leads me, sir, to remark upon the 
               <br />
               probable abrogation of the Reciprocity treaty. 
               <br />
               The country will be glad to know, from the 
               <br />
               announcement made to the House on Mon-

               <br />

               with that of the United States, for the 
               <br />
               renewal of this treaty. (Hear, hear.) I am 
               <br />
               not of the number who believe that the 
               <br />
               advantages accruing from this treaty have 
               <br />
               been all on the side of Canada; for, from the 
               <br />
               statements lately published, it appears that 
               <br />
               the whole trade of 1854 was... $24,000,000 
               <br />
