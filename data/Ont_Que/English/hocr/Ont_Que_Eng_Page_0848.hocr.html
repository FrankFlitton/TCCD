               They have fallen into complete insigniﬁcance, 
               <br />
               a prey to the ambition of numerous dictators,

               <br />
               therefore without vitality or strength. (Hear,

               shook all the transatlantic dependencies of

               Spain; from that time everything tended to 
               <br />
               republieanism ; separate and independent 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">faithful</span> to the cause which gave it life, if

               <br />
               of poverty, misery, and decay, which seem now 
               <br />
               to be their inevitable fate. (Hear, hear.)

               But some of the honorable members of this 
               <br />
               House have maintained that the union would

               <br />
               while Canada is rich by means of its trade, 
               <br />

               part that we are as much in need of them as 
               <br />
               they are of us—(hear, hear)—-both in regard 
               <br />
               to industry, to trade, and to military power. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place, let us consider the various 
               <br />
               resources of the several Maritime Provinces. 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia is not, certainly, altogether an 
               <br />
               agricultural country, but it contains valleys in 
               <br />
               which the soil is as deep, as rich, and as well 
               <br />
               suited for farming as the best lands of the 
               <br />
               West. A large portion of the pepulation are 
               <br />
