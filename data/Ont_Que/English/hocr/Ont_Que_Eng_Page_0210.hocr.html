               mincrity of Upper Canada must not be 
               <br />
               abandoned to the mercy of the majority, and 
               <br />
               we succeeded in obtaining for them a system 
               <br />
               of separate schools which, however, does 
               <br />
               not appear to satisfy the minority. In 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. the Protestant minority has 
               <br />
               always been satisﬁed with the school system, 
               <br />
               until quite lately ; and they have now begun 
               <br />
               to agitate with the view of obtaining, as they 
               <br />
               pretend, a more equitable distribution of the 
               <br />
               moneys appropriated for school purposes. 
               <br />
               For my part, lknow that they have no found- 
               <br />
               ation for their claim, and I remember that 
               <br />
               when I was Secretary of the province, I 
               <br />
               drew the attention of the Superintendent of 
               <br />
               Education to the unequal distribution of the 
               <br />
               money, as it appeared that the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority of Lower Canada received a larger 
               <br />
               amount than they were entitled to. He 
               <br />
               replied that the distribution had been so 
               <br />
               made by his predecessor, and that he had 
               <br />
               not deemed it advisable to make any change. 
               <br />
               Thus we see that uneasiness prevails among 
               <br />
               the minority, both in Upper Canada and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, and even among the majority 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada. But I was astonished to 
               <br />
               hear the remedy announced by my honorable 
               <br />
               colleague (Hon. Sir N. F. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BELLEAU),</span> in the 
               <br />
               event of the Federal Government endeavor- 
               <br />
               ing to prejudice the interests of Lower Ca- 
               <br />
               nada. He tells us that as Lower Canada is 
               <br />
               to have sixty-ﬁve representatives in the 
               <br />
               Federal Legislature out of 194, these sixty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve members from Lower Canada will 
               <br />
               always be able to preserve their rights by 
               <br />
               taking sides with the Opposition to turn out 
               <br />
               the Government. Does the hon. member 
               <br />
               really suppose that all the members from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lover</span> Canada would make common cause 
               <br />
               on any question? Does he not know that 
               <br />
               there will always be a minority among them 
               <br />
               of diﬁ'erent origin and religion who will pro- 
               <br />
               bably take part with the Government or 
               <br />
               with the majority? In such a case, what 
               <br />
               would the Opposition from Lower Canada 
               <br />
               avail about which he talks? Do we not 
               <br />
               know that the diﬁculties which gave rise to 
               <br />
               the plan of Confederation were produced by 
               <br />
               theccalition of an Upper Canada minority 
               <br />
               with the Lower Canada majority ? And 
               <br />
               what happened to Upper Canada might very 
               <br />
               well happen to Lower Canada. By rejecting 
               <br />
               the principle of the double majority adapted 
               <br />
               by a liberal ministry, the apple of discord 
               <br />
               was thrown among the legislative body which 
               <br />
               originated the present diﬁcuties. Another

               Lower Canada was the overturning of a 
               <br />
               government which had maintained the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of an equality in representation. We 
               <br />
               now see to what that has brought us. The 
               <br />
               hon. member (Hon. Sir N. F. Bmuu) 
               <br />
               had said that our institutions would be pro- 
               <br />
               tected under the Federal Government. But 
               <br />
               how ? By the resolutions as they stand 
               <br />
               they would not be so guarded ; and would 
               <br />
               not the General Government put its veto on 
               <br />
               every act of the local governments? And 
               <br />
               while on this subject, I should like to know 
               <br />
               what is to be the organization of the Local 
               <br />
               Government of Lower Canada. As far as I 
               <br />
               can see, itis this—that nearly all our local 
               <br />
               revenue is to be taken from us, and we are 
               <br />
               to be allowed a subsidy of eighty cents per 
               <br />
               head. And yet this is not all. There will 
               <br />
               be a debt of $5,000,000 to be shared between 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada; and how is this 
               <br />
               sharing to be brought about? If, as we are 
               <br />
               told, Lower Canada is to be char ed with 
               <br />
               the payment of the debt contracte for the 
               <br />
               redemption of the Seigniorial Tenure, that 
               <br />
               alone will represent a capital of about 
               <br />
               84,118,202, including 8891,500 indemnity 
               <br />
               to the townships. Is Lower Canada to 
               <br />
               undertake the payment of that sum? Cer- 
               <br />
               tain sources of revenue in Lower Canada are 
               <br />
               devoted to the redemption of the Seigniorial 
               <br />
               Tenure, but if the Federal Government 
               <br />
               absorbs these sources of revenue, who will 
               <br />
               assure us that the Local Government will not 
               <br />
               repudiate the Seigniorial debt now by the 
               <br />
               Federal scheme sought to be imposed on it? 
               <br />
               The Local Legislature will lay, perhaps, that 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government has not the right 
               <br />
               of annulling the act which imposes on 
               <br />
               United Canada the payment of the indemnity 
               <br />
               to the seigniors, and will probably refuse to 
               <br />
               assume the whole responsibility of it, alleging 
               <br />
               that the General Government ought to pay 
               <br />
               it. And if the Local Government takes this _ 
               <br />
               course, what will the General Government 
               <br />
               do? On this question it will be easy to 
               <br />
               excite the passions of the people, prejudiced 
               <br />
               as they already are against the seigniors. 
               <br />
               Chieﬂy, and above all, we are bound to res- 
               <br />
               pect vested r' hts. We are recommended 
               <br />
               to vote with lind conﬁdence, but we are 
               <br />
               refused the details, which might satisfy the 
               <br />
               country and the honorable members of this 
               <br />
               House. Why not lay the constitution of 
               <br />
               the Local Government before the House? 
               <br />
               We are told that the possession of her civil 
               <br />
               code is to be guaranteed to Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               but we are not informed how it is to be done.
