               amendments to the resolutions, which do

               appear to me to have been resolved upon

               with such vital interest and importance to

               these provinces. If indeed, sir, the hon.

               gentlemen who so recently held their deli-

               berations in this city had been composed of 
               <br />
               men perfect in intellect, and possessing

               of ordinary humanity—liability to err, then 
               <br />
               it would. I say, have seemed more consistent 
               <br />
               to ask this or any other legislature to adopt 
               <br />
               the Constitution which they had framed ferns 
               <br />
               and for posterity without amendments, to 
               <br />
               ask us to receive, as we would or as we do, 
               <br />
               the articles of our religious faith—to ask us 
               <br />
               to have faith, and to believe that these del-

               the requisites and necessaries for a perfect 
               <br />
               Constitution. I had hoped, sir, we should 
               <br />
               be able to apply ourselves to the calm, delib-

               <br />

               have preferred alterations in some of the

               resolutions, 'as well as in some of the details, 
               <br />
               yet I am not, after having listened patiently 
               <br />
               and anxiously to the able arguments in favor 
               <br />
               of Confederation, as well as against it—I am 
               <br />
               not, I repeat, prepared to state that I will 
               <br />
               take upon myself to say that Confederation, 
               <br />
               as a scheme, should be rejected—that I will 
               <br />
               state that I shall vote against the creation of 
               <br />
               a new nationality. (Hear, hear.) I will 
               <br />
               state some reasons why I am not prepared to 
               <br />
               do so. In the ﬁrst place, when I look abroad 
               <br />
               and see the neighboring American Republic 
               <br />
               engaged in one of the moat terrible and 
               <br />
               disc.—trous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wars</span> that has ever racked this 
               <br />
               continent; when I read in almost every 
               <br />
               journal issuing from the press of that country 
               <br />
               anathemas against the British Empire; when 
               <br />
               I see that press teeming with threats against 
               <br />
               this country; when I know that that nation 
               <br />
               has by sea a navy prepared to cope with the 
               <br />
               strong powers ot the old world, and a force 
               <br />
               on land, in point of numbers at least, aston- 
               <br />
               - <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁshing</span> the generals of the most advanced

               like, butin a threatening attitude towards 
               <br />
               us, I am led to consider, as paramount to 
               <br />
               every other consideration, what ought to be 
               <br />
               done for the safety of this country. To 
               <br />
               preserve its territory from invasion, to pro- 
               <br />
               tect the lives and property of its subjects, 
               <br />
               is, I conceive, the ﬁrst important duty to- 
               <br />
               wards which the attention of every govern 
               <br />
               ment should be directed. ( Hear.) Then, 
               <br />
               sir, upon the well-understood maxim that 
               <br />
               union is strength, I am inclined to believe 
               <br />
               that the union of the British North Ameri- 
               <br />
               can Provinces would give strength to us all. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I confess I fail to see a 
               <br />
               source of weakness in this union, as is very 
               <br />
               ingeniously argued by some hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposed to this scheme in tale. It does 
               <br />
               appear to me that the very political and 
               <br />
               national status given to these provinces by 
               <br />
               a union, would become immediately a source 
               <br />
               of strength; that the very new name to be 
               <br />
               given to the new nationality would be an 
               <br />
               immense fortiﬁcation of defence in itself. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) When, sir, I consider the 
               <br />
               interest evinced by the people of England, 
               <br />
               the people of France, and, I may say, of all 
               <br />
               Europe, the very apprehension that seems 
               <br />
               to exist with regard to this Confederation of 
               <br />
               the British North American Provinces, it 
               <br />
               appears to me that the very announcement 
               <br />
               of the creation of this neW'nationality has 
               <br />
               given us already a position and a strength 
               <br />
               which in the palmiest days of the old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regime</span> 
               <br />
               we might never have hoped for. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) When I remember, sir, that great 
               <br />
               Constitutions in the old world have been 
               <br />
               founded in the blood of contending nations; 
               <br />
               that in the Mother Country the heirs 
               <br />
               of contending houses, at times through 
               <br />
               various centuries, struggled for supremacy; 
               <br />
               and that authority, power and good govern- 
               <br />
               ment have been established only after being 
               <br />
               wrenched from opposing factions by the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sword—whm</span> I remember, sir, that history 
               <br />
               records the revolution which terminated the 
               <br />
               long struggle between the sovereigns in 
               <br />
               England and their parliaments-how, from 
               <br />
               union, order and freedom, established only 
               <br />
               by the sword, sprung a prosperity hitherto 
               <br />
               unknown in the annals of human affaire; 
               <br />
               when I trace their history from the days of 
               <br />
               feudalism down to the present, I am led to
