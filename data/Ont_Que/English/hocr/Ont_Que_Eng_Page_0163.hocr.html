               in relation to an observation of my friend

               (Hon. Mr. BROWN) last night on the sub- 
               <br />
               ject of the Catholic Separate Schools of 
               <br />

               asked,and I think they ought to be satisﬁed.

               I will be no party to the re-opening of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the Protestant minority of Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               I think the Catholic minority in Upper Ca- 
               <br />
               nada ought to be placed in precisely the same 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> osition—neither better nor worse. (Hear, 
               <br />
               car.) At present I shall not add another 
               <br />
               word on this subject, as I am not aware of 
               <br />
               the articular nature of the amendments 
               <br />
               asks for at present, either east or west. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) All who have spoken on this 
               <br />
               subject have said a good deal, as was natural, 
               <br />
               of the interests at stake in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">succes</span> or 
               <br />
               failure of this plan of Confederation. I 
               <br />
               trust the House will permit me to add a few 
               <br />
               words as to the principle of Confederation 
               <br />
               considered in itself. In the application of 
               <br />
               this principle to former constitutions, there 
               <br />
               certainly always was one fatal defect, the 
               <br />
               weakness of the central authority. Of all 
               <br />
               the Federal constitutions I have ever heard 
               <br />
               or read of, this was the fatal malady: they 
               <br />
               were short-lived, they died of consumption. 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) But I am not prepared to say 
               <br />
               that because the Tuscan League elected its 
               <br />
               chief magistrates for two months and lasted a 
               <br />
               century, that therefore the Federal principle 
               <br />
               failed. On the contrary, there is something 
               <br />
               in the frequent, fond recurrence of mankind 
               <br />
               to this principle, among the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freem</span> people, in 
               <br />
               their best times and worst dangers, which 
               <br />
               leads me to believe, that it has a very deep 
               <br />
               hold in human nature itself—an excellent 
               <br />
               basis for a government to have. But indeed, 
               <br />
               sir, the main question is the due distribution 
               <br />
               of powers—a question I dare not touch to- 
               <br />
               night, but which I may be prepared to say 
               <br />
               something on before the vote is taken. The 
               <br />
               principle itself seems to me to be capable of 
               <br />
               being so adapted as to promote internal peace 
               <br />
               and external security, and to call into action a 
               <br />
               genuine, enduring and heroic patriotism. It is 
               <br />
               a fruit of this principle that makes the modern 
               <br />
               Italian look back with sorrow and pride over 
               <br />
               a dreary waste of seven centuries to the 
               <br />
               famous ﬁeld of Legnano ; it was this princi-

               the rocks of Uri; it was this principle that
