               <br />
               sup ° this were not the case, and that the

               by that discretion which has heretofore actu-

               all feel that the election of members for such

               enormous districts as form the constituencies 
               <br />
               of the Upper House has become a great prac- 
               <br />
               tical inconvenience. I say this from personal 
               <br />
               experience, having long taken an active inter- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">est</span> in the electoral contests in Upper Canada. 
               <br />
               We have found greater difﬁculty in inducing 
               <br />
               candidates to offer for seats in the Up r 
               <br />

               <br />
               for the Lower ouse. The constituencies are 
               <br />
               so vast, that it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd gentlemen 
               <br />
               who have the will to incur the labor of such 
               <br />
               a contæt, who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁciently</span> known and 
               <br />
               popular enough throughout districts so wide, 
               <br />
               and who have money enough— (hear) -— to 
               <br />
               pay the enormous bills, not incurred in any 
               <br />
               corrupt way,—do not fanc that I mean that 
               <br />
               for a moment—but the b' Is that are sent in 
               <br />
               after the contest is over, and which the candi- 
               <br />
               dates are compelled to pay if they ever hope 
               <br />
               to present themselves for re-election. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But honorable gentlemen say—“ This 
               <br />
               is all very well, but you are taking an impor- 
               <br />

               <br />
               which they now possess." Now this is a 
               <br />
               mistake. We do not propose to do anything 
               <br />
               of the sort. What we propose is, that the 
               <br />
               Upper House shall be appointed from the best 
               <br />

               <br />
               m 1855 there was not a single petition from 
               <br />
               the people asking for it——it was in a manner 
               <br />
               forced on the Legislature. The real reason 
               <br />
               for the change was, that before Responsible 
               <br />
               Government was introduced into this country, 
               <br />
               while the old oligarohical system existed, the 
               <br />
               U per House continuously and systemati- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cÆy</span> was at war with the popular branch, and 
               <br />
               threw out every measure of a liberal ten- 
               <br />
               dency. The result was, that in the famous 
               <br />
               ninety-two resolutions the introduction of the 
               <br />
               elective principle into the Up r House was 
               <br />
               declared to be indispensable. 0 long as Mr. 
               <br />
               ROBERT BALDWIN remained in public life, 
               <br />
               the thing could not be done; but when he 
               <br />
               left, the deed was consummated. But it is 
               <br />
               said, that if the members are to be appointed 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">life,</span> the number should be unlimited— 
               <br />
               that, in the event of a dead lock arising be- 
               <br />
               tween that chamber and this, there should be 
               <br />
               power to overcome the difﬁculty by the ap- 
               <br />
               pointment of more members. Well, under 
               <br />
               the British system, in the case of a legislative 
               <br />
               union, that might be a legitimate provision. 
               <br />
               But honorable gentlemen must see that the 
               <br />
               limitation of the numbers in the Upper House 
               <br />
               lies at the base of the whole compact on 
               <br />
               which this scheme rests. (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               is perfectly clear, as was contended by those 
               <br />
               who represented Lower Canada in the Con- 
               <br />
               ference, that if the number of the Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Councillors was made capable of in- 
               <br />
               crease, you would thereby sweep awa the 
               <br />
               whole protection they had from the pper 
               <br />
               Chamber. But it has been said that, though 
               <br />
               you may not give the power to the Executive 
               <br />
               to increase the numbers of the Upper House, 
               <br />
               in the event of a dead-lock, you might limit 
               <br />
               the term for which the members are appointed. 
               <br />
               I was myself in favor of that proposition. I 
               <br />
               thought it would be well to provide for a
