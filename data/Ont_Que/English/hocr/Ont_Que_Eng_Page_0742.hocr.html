               sire, before the debate is renewed, to call the 
               <br />
               attention of the Hon. Attorney General West 
               <br />
               to the matter of the previous question which 
               <br />
               he has moved—to recall to his recollection 
               <br />
               the statements that were made when the 
               <br />
               agreement was come to that this debate 
               <br />
               should be conducted in all respects as it the

               and to a peal to his sense of justice to adhere 
               <br />
               to the etter and spirit of that agreement. 
               <br />
               It will be remembered that, on behalf of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen sitting on this side of the House, 
               <br />
               Iobjected very strongly to the pr0position 
               <br />
               to consider these resolutions as a single re- 
               <br />
               solution, and insisted that they were of a 
               <br />
               nature that required them to be considered 
               <br />
               in Committee of the Whole House. The hon. 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leader</span> of the Government objected to 
               <br />
               that on this ground. He said that the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions were a treaty—I do not think the 
               <br />
               position sound, but I am not combating that 
               <br />
               just now—and that the Government were 
               <br />
               bound to bring all their inﬂuence to bear to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass</span> them in their entirety ; and in reply 
               <br />
               to some objection made by myself, he said
