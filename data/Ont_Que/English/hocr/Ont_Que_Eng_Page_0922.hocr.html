               natural resources and great future value of

               tory, from its geographical position as regards 
               <br />
               us, is very difﬁcult of access. A broad tract

               <br />

               plains of the Red River and the Saskatche-

               <br />
               save through a foreign country, rendering it

               close connection with and colonization of 
               <br />
               that country. We cannot jump all at once 
               <br />
               from the position of colonists to that of 
               <br />
               colonisers. That great territory can only be 
               <br />
               deveIOped, colonized and preserved to us by 
               <br />
               the exercise of that fostering care which the 
               <br />
               Empire has ever bestowed upon her colonies 
               <br />
               in their infanc . The Hon. President of 
               <br />
               the Council ( on. Mr. BROWN), in the 
               <br />
               course of the debate, said he ho d to see 
               <br />
               the day when our young men wou d go forth 
               <br />
               from among us to settle the North-West 
               <br />
               territory. I harbor no such wish. On the 
               <br />
               contrary, one of the fondest hopes I cherish 
               <br />
               as a result of Confederation is, that it will 
               <br />
               so attract capital and enterprise to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, so tend to develops our internal 
               <br />
               resources, as to offer to the youth of the 
               <br />
               country a ﬁeld for the exercise of that 
               <br />
               laudable energy and ambition which . now 
               <br />
               cause so many of them to leave their own 
               <br />
               hearths and cast their lot with strangers. 
               <br />
               One of the greatest ills that Canada now suffers 
               <br />
               from is, that the young men born and brought 
               <br />
               up in her midst look abroad for their future, 
               <br />
               and bestow their energies and talents on 
               <br />
               another land; and, although an immigrant 
               <br />
               myself, I know and admit that a man born 
               <br />
               and brought up here is worth any two immi- 
               <br />
               grants for the arduous task of clearing and 
               <br />
               settling what remains to us of the public

               domain. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">how</span> and trust that the Confede- 
               <br />
               ration of the Provinces will create suﬁcient 
               <br />
               inducements to keep the young men of the 
               <br />
               country at home. (Hear, hear.) It is in 
               <br />
               that hope that I support the measure. I 
               <br />
               trust at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">samîôtime</span> that the great N orth-

               unfair, at this late stage of the debate, to 
               <br />
               enter further into details. I promised that 
               <br />
               I would not do so. With details, indeed, it 
               <br />
               has all along appeared to me we had little to 
               <br />

               surely means will be found, as .we go on, to 
               <br />
               remedy objectionable details. With all its 
               <br />
               defects—and I admit there are many defects 
               <br />
               —there never was awritten Constitution but 
               <br />
               had its defects—I feel conﬁdent that the 
               <br />
               general desi n set forth in the resolutions 
               <br />
               meets with t e a proval of a large majority 
               <br />
               of the peOple of anada at all events ; and it 
               <br />
               would be an insult to the sound common 
               <br />
               sense of a people that have so long proved 
               <br />
               themselves capable of judging for them- 
               <br />
               selves and of governing themselves, to 
               <br />
               suppose them incapable of adjusting, from 
               <br />
               time to time, as occasion arises, the 
               <br />
               minor details or defects of a system 
               <br />
               of government to which they have resolved 
               <br />
               on according a fair trial. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               And now, Mr. SPEAKER, what I had to say 
               <br />
               on this important subject of Confederation 
               <br />
               I have said. I promised that I would not 
               <br />
               weary the House by entering into details; 
               <br />
               I trust that I have not done so; but I may 
               <br />
               be permitted to express a hope—a hope 
               <br />
               founded in a deep and abiding belief—that 
               <br />
               the peeple of these provinces are and will 
               <br />
               prove themselves equal to the great under-
