               depreeating the expenditure, there was a 
               <br />
               very signiﬁcant “ Hear! hear !” intimating 
               <br />
               a hearty concurrence in such sentiments. 
               <br />
               But, air, when my hon. friend in his usual 
               <br />
               forcible manner, expressed his willingness, 
               <br />
               when the time arrived, to spend the last 
               <br />
               drop of his blood in the defence of this land, 
               <br />
               we heard no more of the responding and 
               <br />
               concurring “Hear! hear l” I alluded to. 
               <br />
               (Laughter) My hon. friend, if I under- 
               <br />
               stood him rightly, deprecated the idea that 
               <br />
               any expense should be entailed upon us for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defensive</span> works. But, sir, he spoke like 
               <br />
               a true Briton, and I am quite sure that he 
               <br />
               wasin earnest, and did not ntter a mere 
               <br />
               barren sentiment, when he said that he 
               <br />
               would spend his last drop of blood in the 
               <br />
               defence of his country. And I am sure he 
               <br />
               would do so. But I would put itto my hon. 
               <br />
               friend if it is more reasonable that he should 
               <br />
               spend this blood, or spend a few pounds? 
               <br />
               Who can tell the thousands, ay, the hund- 
               <br />
               reds of thousands of human lives that may 
               <br />
               be spared by the judicious and timely ex- 
               <br />
               penditure now of a few hundreds of thousands 
               <br />
               of pounds? I wish to impress upon my hon. 
               <br />
               friend what is the clear conviction of my 
               <br />
               own mind, that in every point of view it is 
               <br />
               economy—economy of treasure, and economy 
               <br />
               of useful lives, to spend some money now to 
               <br />
               place our country in a state of defence. I 
               <br />
               think a great change has taken place within 
               <br />
               the last few years in reference to this subject. 
               <br />
               The ventilation of the subject has drawn 
               <br />
               men’s minds towards it, and we are beginning 
               <br />
               to feel that here we are a peOple consid- 
               <br />
               erable in numbers and considerable in wealth, 
               <br />
               and it is incumbent upon us to do more than 
               <br />
               we have been doing in times past. I would 
               <br />
               call attention to a very important work which 
               <br />
               can scarcely be overestimated. I allude to 
               <br />
               the Ottawa canal. I regret that the state of 
               <br />
               our ﬁnances will not permit us to think of 
               <br />
               its construction at the present time, but I 
               <br />
               refer-to it that we ma think of it; that 
               <br />
               the representatives 0 the people may 
               <br />
               think of it; that the statesmen of the 
               <br />
               country may think of it. In order to 
               <br />
               secure the future defence of the country, 
               <br />
               and especially the western section of it, 
               <br />
               and to maintain its independence, the 
               <br />
               Ottawa canal must be built. The Ottawa 
               <br />
               canal would be worth 50,000 men to us. 
               <br />
               With that canal, and the aid of the Mother 
               <br />
               Country, which we are assured will never be 
               <br />
               wanting when we require it, we will be able

               communication, looked at from a delensible 
               <br />
               point of view. Our St. Lawrence canals are 
               <br />
               almost entirely useless. I am glad to see 
               <br />
               that the American Government have given 
               <br />
               notice of their intention to terminate the

               convention for not keeping armed vessels on 
               <br />

               <br />
               be put an end to, for it was decidedly preju- 
               <br />
               dicial to our interests,and I have no doubt we 
               <br />
               shall have gunboats on our lakes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the

               <br />
               at the mercy of the United States. There is

               no question that, should they determine upon

               British gun-boat on our waters by the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence canals, as they are so easily 
               <br />
               accessible to our opponents, and, without 
               <br />
               much diﬂiculty, could be rendered useless for 
               <br />
               navigation. As regards the Rideau canal, 
               <br />
               how are we to get gun-boats through it? 
               <br />
               There is a certain class of gun-boats that

               ests—commercial, political and defensive-— 
               <br />
               and the peculiar circumstances in which we

               <br />
