               of the Reciprocity treaty, I say again, I am 
               <br />
               alarmed. What is going on at this present 
               <br />
               moment? We all know that for several 
               <br />
               years past there have been bad harvests; 
               <br />
               that of last year was not good, not in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada only, but also in Upper Canada; 
               <br />
               and since New Year's day, half the country 
               <br />
               peeple in Lower Canada have been buying 
               <br />
               the ﬂour necessary for their subsisten'ce. 
               <br />
               All they spend in the purchase of ﬂour, 
               <br />
               from this time till the harvest is gathered

               <br />
               the payment of their numerous debts. It 
               <br />
               is capital withdrawn from the working and 
               <br />

               <br />
               feels the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eEects</span> of it. The imports are more 
               <br />
               limited; a good deal of last year’s stock of 
               <br />
               goods in the cities remains unsold. The 
               <br />
               public revenue will be considerably affected 
               <br />
               by it, and the surplus of 1864 will in 1865 
               <br />
               become a deﬁcit. It is not necessary to bea

               <br />
               I say, then, that we are on the brink of a 
               <br />
               commercial crisis, and it is not such a scheme 
               <br />
               as that before us that will enable us to 
               <br />
               avoid it, when we need rather to practise

               <br />
               any proof of this assertion is necessary, visit 
               <br />
               Acton—Acton which has become a small

               city since the discovery of the copper mines 
               <br />
               now worked there. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               half the houses in Acton are now shut up, 
               <br />
               although as lately as last year the village 
               <br />
               presented every appearance of the highest 
               <br />
               prosperity. This year the inhabitants are 
               <br />
               driven to leave home and country to support 
               <br />
               their families. (Hear,' hear.) I say that 
               <br />
               a movement of self-banishment like that 
               <br />
               which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now'going</span> on in the winter season, 
               <br />
               is alarming; for when half the country people 
               <br />
               are obliged to buy their ﬂour as they now 
               <br />
               are, it proves that they must continue to buy 
               <br />
               it until next autumn, after the harvest is 
               <br />
               gathered in; and as many of them have not 
               <br />
               the means of waiting till then, they must 
               <br />
               leave the country to try to supply the wants 
               <br />
               of their families, by applying for work to our 
               <br />
               neighbors. (Hear, hear.) This move-

               repeat, then, Mr. SPEAKER, that a great

               many houses are shut up in the new settle- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the range and lot in the counties which I 
               <br />
               represent. An unseen but very extensive 
               <br />
               inﬂuence is at work in all the country south 
               <br />
               of the St. Lawrence, above Nicolet and 
               <br />
               as far as the frontier. I shall explain it 
               <br />
               to you. In all that part of the country, a 
               <br />
               great many young men go to the United 
               <br />
               States to look for employment. These chil- 
               <br />
               dren of the people ﬁnd there a wider ﬁeld 
               <br />
               for their enterprising minds; in fact, they 
               <br />
               are forced to leave Canada in order to earn 
               <br />
               money. When once they are established in 
               <br />
               the United States, they correspond with 
               <br />
               their relatives whom they have left behind 
               <br />
               them. In all their letters they describe the 
               <br />
               treatment they receive, and boast of their 
               <br />
               position, the footing they are on in their 
               <br />
               social relations with the Americans, the good 
               <br />
               wages which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theyOeceive,</span> and the state of 
               <br />
               prosperity at which they soon arrive. Not 
               <br />
               only do they correspond, they visit Canada to 
               <br />
               see their families from time to time. On 
               <br />
               these occasions, Mr. SPEAKER, their com- 
               <br />
               munications are made with greater freedom; 
               <br />
               they relate all that they have seen, and heard, 
               <br />
               and all they have learned. Be sure of this, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, these communications, these 
               <br />
               in'timacies between Canadians established in 
               <br />
               the States and their home friends, have 
               <br />
               greater effect to produce favorable feelings 
               <br />
               towards the Americans in our countr than 
               <br />
               all the newspapers in the world. t is a 
               <br />
               portion of the heart of the country removed 
               <br />
               into a strange land by the force of circum- 
               <br />
               stances. The accounts they hear from their 
               <br />
               friends prove to them that the Americans 
               <br />
               are not such horrible monsters as they are 
               <br />
               said to be in certain quarters, and that 
               <br />
               their political institutions are far superior 
               <br />
               to ours; that every man is on a footing of 
               <br />
               equality with his neighbor, and that he 
               <br />
               possesses political rights of which he cannot 
               <br />
               be deprived. This inﬂuence of which I am 
               <br />
               speaking is very great, and certainly it is 
               <br />
