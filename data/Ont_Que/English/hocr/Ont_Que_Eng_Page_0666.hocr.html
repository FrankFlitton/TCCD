               duty to call upon the Legislature of Canada, 
               <br />

               Government to obtain from the Legislature of

               the intelligence that has reached us from New

               than ever that the scheme should be carried 
               <br />

               <br />
               all the more necessary now to call for prompt 
               <br />
               and immediate action. The Government 
               <br />
               will, therefore, at once state, that it is our 
               <br />
               design to press, by all proper and parlia- 
               <br />
               mentary modes of procedure within our

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power,</span> for an early decision of the House

               —yes or no—whether they approve of 
               <br />
               this scheme or do not. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bean),</span> 
               <br />
               One great reason, among others, calling 
               <br />
               for promptness, is to provide as much 
               <br />
               as possible against the reaction which will 
               <br />
               take place In England from the disap- 
               <br />
               pointment that will pervade the minds of 
               <br />
               the people of England, if they get the 
               <br />
               impression that the project of the union of 
               <br />
               the provinces is abandoned. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I believe that if one thing more than an- 
               <br />
               other has raised British America, or the 
               <br />
               Province of Canada, its chief component 
               <br />
               part, in the estimation of the people and 
               <br />
               Government of England, it is that by this 
               <br />
               scheme there was offered to the Mother 
               <br />
               Country a means by which these colonies 
               <br />
               should cease to be a source of embarrassment, 
               <br />
               and become, in fact, a source of strength. 
               <br />
               This feeling pervades the public mind of 
               <br />
               England. Every writer and speaker of note 
               <br />
               in the United Kingdom, who has treated of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject,</span> says a new era of colonial exist- 
               <br />
               ence has been inaugurated, and that if these 
               <br />
               colonies, feeble while disunited, were a source 
               <br />
               of weakness, they will, by forming this 
               <br />
               friendly alliance, become a strong support to 
               <br />
               England. The disappointment of the corres- 
               <br />
               ponding reaction would be great in the 
               <br />
               Mother Country, if they got the idea 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t'"e</span> project was to be given up; 
               <br />
               and we appeal to honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               not to fall away from the position we have 
               <br />
               obtained by the mere submission of the 
               <br />
               scheme to the Government and the people 
               <br />
               of England, and not to allow Canada and the 
               <br />
               whole of British America to lose all its 
               <br />
               vantage ground by showing any signs of 
               <br />
               weakness, any signs of receding on this 
               <br />
               question“. (Hear, hear.) Another reason 
               <br />
               why this question must- be dealt with 
               <br />
               promptly and an early decision obtained, is, 
               <br />
               that it is more or less intimately connected 
               <br />
               with the question of defence, and that is a 
               <br />
               question of the most imminent necessity. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) No one can exaggerate the 
               <br />
               necessity which exists for the Legislature of 
               <br />
               this country considering at once the defences 
               <br />
               that are called for in the present position of
