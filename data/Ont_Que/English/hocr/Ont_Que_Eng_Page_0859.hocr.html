               ter. 1 do not desire, in any way, to accuse our 
               <br />
               statesmen or to question their motives. But have 
               <br />
               our statesmen always avoided <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contradiction—w</span> 
               <br />
               gerous measures? Is it prudent to trust solely 
               <br />
               to men, without scrutinizing their measures? 
               <br />
               What of the experience of the past? What of 
               <br />
               the maxim, “ Measures, not men ?” “Fear not," 
               <br />
               we are told again “none of the dangers you fear 
               <br />
               can arise; the thing is impossible.” Impossible! 
               <br />
               Why, then, leave a possibility of danger in the 
               <br />
               law? Why so much haste with a measure of 
               <br />
               such importance? The authors of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitu-</span> 
               <br />
               tion of the United States labored for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">month</span> and 
               <br />
               years at the draft of their Confederation, and 
               <br />
               after eighty years it is found defective. Our 
               <br />
               statesmen elaborate a Constitution in a tew <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">days,</span> 
               <br />
               in the midst of the noisy rejoicings of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hospitality.</span> 
               <br />
               and we are told that Constitution is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pert‘ett!</span> 
               <br />
               “You must not touch it; you shall not amend 
               <br />
               it.” But, we say, it contains dangerous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clauses,</span> 
               <br />
               it gives our enemies power to annihilate us. 
               <br />
               The answer is: “ Be silent ! It is th.- creation of 
               <br />
               our Ministers, our leaders! Trust in their honor. 
               <br />
               in their talents.” Excellent reasons, no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubt!</span> 
               <br />
               And yet, strange to say, people are still unes—y, 
               <br />
               still distrustful l But, are not the clergy, arenot 
               <br />
               the people for Confederation? As to the clergy, 
               <br />
               no; they are not all for your Confederation uit 
               <br />

               <br />
               feel no uneasiness, and trust all to our statesmen;
