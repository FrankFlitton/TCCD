               his inﬂuences over a respectable old man, who 
               <br />
               heretofore had remained apart from political 
               <br />
               struggles; he persuades him that his country 
               <br />
               is on the brink of an abyss; he tells him how 
               <br />
               n and what an imperative duty it is 
               <br />
               for all good citizens to unite for the defence of 
               <br />

               <br />
               I might have believed in the sincerity of the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman (Hon. Mr. DOBION) if I 
               <br />
               had heard him admit that he had changed his 
               <br />
               opinions and say that he had formerly enter- 
               <br />
               tained certain views ou the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculty</span> of our

               <br />
               dy. But no, he comes to us with the assurance 
               <br />
               to declare that he has never changed his 
               <br />
               opinions, and yet the journals and debates of 
               <br />
               the House are before him to convince him of 
               <br />
               the contrary. What a position. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The honorable gentleman added—“ The peo- 
               <br />
               ple are satisﬁed with their present position.” 
               <br />
               Since last session more than twenty counties 
               <br />
               have been called upon to elect new represent- 
               <br />

               of the scheme which is now under discussion. 
               <br />
               And yet the honorable member tells us, with 
               <br />
               an appearance of good faith which I shall not 
               <br />
               animadvert on now, that the people are satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed with their position; and lastly, the hon- 
               <br />
               orable member for Hochelaga says—“ Confed— 
               <br />

               <br />
               gentleman is the very last who ought to have 
               <br />
               raised this objection. Does he forget that, in 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{louse</span> that the time h arrived when it had

               such vast importance, the House and the 
               <br />
               country have a right to something more than 
               <br />
               a mere denial. Let honorable gentlemen on

               I now come to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguments</span> of the honor- 
               <br />
               able member for Lotbinière. Since I ﬁrst 
               <br />
               took my seat in Parliament, I had learned to 
               <br />
               esteem that honorable gentleman ; his conduct, 
               <br />
               always so honorable, and the good faith which 
               <br />
               appeared to govern his whole conduct as a 
               <br />
               legislator, had inspired me with the highest 
               <br />
               respect for him. But what was my surprise 
               <br />
               to see him condescend to the part which we 
               <br />
               have seen him play on the occasion of his
