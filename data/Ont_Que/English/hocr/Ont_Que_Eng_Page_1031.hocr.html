               he very face of it. And what would be 
               <br />
               the result of a general election ? Those 
               <br />
               two honorable gentlemen, holding such dis- 
               <br />
               similar views with regard to the motion 
               <br />
               upon which they have agreed, would go to 
               <br />
               the country pulling different wires. The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Peel will use his best 
               <br />
               endeavors to inﬂuence public opinion in such 
               <br />
               a manner that it will ratify the resolutions 
               <br />
               in favor of a Federal union, while the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman who seconded the motion will go 
               <br />
               to the peeple with the very reverse idea. 
               <br />
               So you will ﬁnd these two hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               who have joined so cordially to bring this 
               <br />
               motion before the House, will disagree on 
               <br />
               every point the moment after it would be car- 
               <br />
               ried, and cause the utmost confusion among 
               <br />
               the people. I cannot understand the matter 
               <br />
               at all. I do not see how they can defend 
               <br />
               their consistencies, either before this House 
               <br />
               or before the country. There was not a 
               <br />
               single word said by the Hon. President of 
               <br />
               the Council or the Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               West, with reference to the inconsistency of 
               <br />
               those two hon. gentlemen, to which every 
               <br />
               one in this House will not cordially assent. 
               <br />
               We voted by a large majority, the other night, 
               <br />
               in favor of those resolutions. Iwas in favor, 
               <br />
               when I came here, of having the question 
               <br />
               referred to the people; and I only wish that 
               <br />
               such could be yet done; but when I came to 
               <br />
               understand the emergencies by which we 
               <br />
               were surrounded, and saw that we were 
               <br />
               threatened with the loss of the Reciprocity 
               <br />
               treaty and the bonded system, in addition to 
               <br />
               the continuation of the passport system, and 
               <br />
               were also threatened with the putting of 
               <br />
               American gunboats on the lakes, and without 
               <br />
               access to the seaboard except upon and by 
               <br />
               suﬂ'erance of the United States Government, 
               <br />
               I came to the conclusion that it was impor- 
               <br />
               tant for us to take such steps as would pro- 
               <br />
               cure, in the shortest manner possible, the 
               <br />
               assistance of English money, English sol- 
               <br />
               diers and English gunboats for our defence, 
               <br />
               and that, therefore, there was the most urgent 
               <br />
               necessity for sending some members of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> home to England, to bring those 
               <br />
               resolutions before the Imperial Parliament 
               <br />
               during the present session, and making such 
               <br />
               arrangements for our defence as it seems we 
               <br />
               must make. These were the reasons why I 
               <br />
               voted for a set of resolutions which, I am 
               <br />
               free to confess, I would not otherwise have 
               <br />
               supported. Having voted for them on Fri- 
               <br />
               day night, along with a large majority of the 
               <br />
               members of this House, with the full expect- 
               <br />
               ation that. everything was to be hurried

               through, and the session brought immediately 
               <br />
               to a close, so that the leading members of the 
               <br />
               Government could go on an important mis- 
               <br />
               sion to the Mother Country, I understood 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Peel to have voted with 
               <br />
               the same understanding. And what are we 
               <br />
               told now? Why, that there is no necessity 
               <br />
               for haste in the matter at all; that there 
               <br />
               ought to be a new election, occupying two 
               <br />
               months at least, before a return could be 
               <br />
               made. But is it seriously proposed that 
               <br />
               during all this time we are to remain in a 
               <br />
               defencelcss state, and without any prospect 
               <br />
               of having any for another year? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'hy,</span> the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman must see that the pro- 
               <br />
               posal bears such a contradiction on the very 
               <br />
               face of it, that he ought to withdraw it. 
               <br />
               These resolutions have been passed by this 
               <br />
               House, or they have not been passed at all. 
               <br />
               If they have been adopted by the Parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada in a constitutional way, then in 
               <br />
               voting for this motion we would be only 
               <br />
               stultifying ourselves, mocking our constitu- 
               <br />
               ents, and insulting Her Majesty, for we 
               <br />
               would be putting ourselves in the most false 
               <br />
               and inconsistent position in which the repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of any people ever placed them- 
               <br />
               selves, on this continent. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               know the honorable member for Peel laid 
               <br />
               down the doctrine before he voted for the 
               <br />
               resolutions, that they ought to go to the 
               <br />
               people before their ﬁnal consummation, and 
               <br />
               to that doctrine every one must assent; but 
               <br />
               when he voted for the resolutions, as we all 
               <br />
               did, on the ground that there was a necessity 
               <br />
               for their immediate adoption, I say it is 
               <br />
               clearly contradictory for him to bring up 
               <br />
               this motion alter the resolution has been 
               <br />
               carried by so large a "majority. I am sorry 
               <br />
               that he has thought ﬁt to bring forward this 
               <br />
               motion at this stage of the proceedings, and 
               <br />
               I must say- and am sorry to have to say it 
               <br />
               too—that I think he has accomplished very 
               <br />
               little good for his party or for his constitu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en'ts,</span> since he has been in Parliament. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I voted'for the resolutions because 
               <br />
               I saw there was a necessity for doing so, 
               <br />
               and after having thus voted cn Friday night, 
               <br />
               I am not going to nullify that vote on Mon— 
               <br />
               day night, by supporting the amendment 
               <br />
               which the honorable member has proposed, 
               <br />
               more to gratify his own notions, I fear, than 
               <br />
               to do the country good. It has been said— 
               <br />
               and very correctly said, I think—that if a 
               <br />
               new House should be elected, the members 
               <br />
               of that House would have to discuss the
