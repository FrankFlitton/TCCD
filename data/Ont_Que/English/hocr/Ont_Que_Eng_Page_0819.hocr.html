               <br />
               attempt to argue that such is not the case, and 
               <br />
               endeavor to conceal the fact; but I ﬁrmly 
               <br />
               - believe it to be the policy of the United States 
               <br />
               to introduce coercive measures, with the view 
               <br />
               of making us feel that our commercial interests 
               <br />
               are identiﬁed with them, and I believe they 
               <br />
               will continue that course of policy towards 
               <br />
               us, not perhaps to the extent of immediate 
               <br />
               invasion and attempted subjugation, but I 
               <br />
               fear that their policy will be one of a re- 
               <br />
               strictive kind, so as to make us feel as much 
               <br />
               as they can our awkward position of depend- 
               <br />
               ence. Such, I believe, is their policy. They 
               <br />
               do not intend immediate invasion, but in- 
               <br />
               stead of that, they will, so to speak, put on 
               <br />
               the screws, in order, if possible, to make us 
               <br />
               feel that our interest is witn them and not 
               <br />
               separate from them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) I can 
               <br />
               very well see and very well understand the 
               <br />
               meaning of this desire to annex Canada, al— 
               <br />
               though many have maintained that such is 
               <br />
               not their wish. Going back to the early his- 
               <br />
               tory of the United States, I ﬁnd that even in 
               <br />
               the articles of Federation of the United 
               <br />
               States, it is provided by the 11th article 
               <br />
               that Canada, acceding, shall be entitled to 
               <br />
               participate in all the rights and privileges of 
               <br />
               the union, whilst they refused to allow any 
               <br />
               other country to come in unless with the con- 
               <br />
               sent of nine states. The war of 1812, too, 
               <br />
               evinced a strong disposition on the part of 
               <br />
               our neighbors to attach Canada. And I bc- 
               <br />
               lieve that the statesmen of the United States, 
               <br />
               in our own day, are animated by the same 
               <br />
               far-seeing policy in regard to this country, 
               <br />
               and that they are now applying a little gentle 
               <br />
               pressure to make us feel that our interest is 
               <br />
               no longer to remain isolated from them, but 
               <br />
               to connect our destiny with theirs. Not long 
               <br />
               since I listened to a certain lecture in this 
               <br />
               city, in which it appeared to me that induce- 
               <br />
               ments were purposely and designedly held 
               <br />

               of the people of the neighboring States. It 
               <br />
               was said that the great cause of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁcnlty</span> in 
               <br />
               the United States was now removed, and that

               there was no obstacle now in the way of their 
               <br />
               material and social progress. Well, sir, I so-

               knowledge that they are a great people, and 
               <br />
               that their advancement has been great; bntI 
               <br />
               fail to perceive that, if true to ourselves, we 
               <br />
               have not the same advantages. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               At all events, if our advantages are not so 
               <br />
               great, they are suﬂicient for all our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purposes</span> 
               <br />
               and we ought to be satisﬁed. There is one 
               <br />
               other consideration to which I desire to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">al.</span> 
               <br />
               lude. When we look at the people who in- 
               <br />
               habit these provinces, and consider from 
               <br />
               whence they come and what are their charac- 
               <br />
               teristics, that they are a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">progreaive.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enter.</span> 
               <br />
               prising and go-a-head people, is it reasonable 
               <br />
               to suppose that we are always going to re— 
               <br />
               main in this state of uncertainty? Is it 
               <br />
               reasonable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to,</span> suppose that we are always to 
               <br />
               be divided into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> provinces, with an 
               <br />
               imaginary line ? Have we no desire or wish 
               <br />
               to expand and grow ? And, I ask, is it pos- 
               <br />
               sible that we can hope to attain national 
               <br />
               greatness in a separate state of existence? I 
               <br />
               think that the interests of the several pro 
               <br />
               vinces should be consolidated. There is no 
               <br />
               disputing the resources of the country, sofar 
               <br />
               as territory is concerned. Stretching from 
               <br />
               the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc, it is ample for the 
               <br />
               support and sustenance of a great people. I 
               <br />
               have even heard it said, by persons who are 
               <br />
               good authority on the subject, that they 
               <br />
               believe the child is new born who will sœ

               <br />
               lation of 60,000,000. This may be going too 
               <br />
               far, but I think there can be no doubt a 
               <br />
               large increase to our numbers will take place 
               <br />
               when we shall have given effect to the scheme 
               <br />
               now in contemplation. (Hear, and cheers.) 
               <br />
               The honorable member for Hochelaga (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Domont)</span> stated in the course of“ his re- 
               <br />
               marks that it would be a dark day for Ca 
               <br />
               nada should these resolutions be adopted. 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, that may be that honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman’s opinion; but I must say that! 
               <br />
               differ from him entirely. On the contrary, 
               <br />
               I believe it will be a dark day for the whole 
               <br />
               country if we cannot agree upon some plan 
               <br />
               for securing our speedy union. (Cheers) 
               <br />
               The honorable gentleman also stated that the 
               <br />
               scheme was far too conservative in its char- 
               <br />
               acter. Well, I can understand why the hon- 
               <br />
               orable gentleman should ﬁnd fault with it on 
               <br />
               that account, but I confess that that does 
               <br />
               not trouble me in the‘ slightest degree.
