               any of the gentlemen who so well adorned

               with a great deal of interest and hope for 
               <br />
               the future. (Hear, hear.) They are men 
               <br />
               of such a superior order, that they would 
               <br />
               grace any legislature in which they might 
               <br />
               be called upon to take part, and I trust they 
               <br />
               may be soon again placed in the positions of 
               <br />
               power and trust from which they have been 
               <br />
               .so unhappily ejected. (Hear, hear.) There 
               <br />
               are other reasons to which I might refer, 
               <br />
               that are pressing the subject upon our 
               <br />
               attention. I will ﬁrst, however, brieﬂy 
               <br />
               refer to one important point connected with 
               <br />
               the subject, about which a good deal has 
               <br />
               been said by those who have spoken against 
               <br />
               the resolutions, and it is a matter that will 
               <br />
               be made the utmost of among the electors 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada. I mean the question of 
               <br />
               referring the scheme tea vote of the people, 
               <br />
               at a general election or some other way, to 
               <br />
               ascertain what their views are upon it before 
               <br />
               taking ﬁnal action in this House. Previous 
               <br />
               to the opening of the present session, I took 
               <br />
               occasion to visit several townships in the 
               <br />
               county I have the honor to represent. I 
               <br />
               laid the whole matter as fully before them as 
               <br />
               I could well do, and I did not meet with a 
               <br />
               single individual who did not recognize it as 
               <br />
               the duty of the present House of Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to carry the measure into effect as 
               <br />
               speedin as possible, so far as it was in the 
               <br />
               power of our Legislature and Government 
               <br />
               to do. At various meetings resolutions 
               <br />
               were voluntarily proposed by individuals in 
               <br />
               the audience, instructing me to support the 
               <br />
               measure, and further stating that they 
               <br />
               would consider it a calamity if a general 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> election were resorted to for the mere pur- 
               <br />
               pose of obtaining the consent of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple’on the subject, nine-tenths of whose 
               <br />
               press endorse it. So satisﬁed were my con- 
               <br />
               stituents of the fairness of the scheme on 
               <br />
               the whole, and of the importance of 
               <br />
               .having it go into operation with the least 
               <br />
               delay possible, that I feel that I shall be 
               <br />
               sustained in the vote I am about to give, 
               <br />
               by the sentiment of those Wth I repre- 
               <br />
               sent in this House. For these reasons, then, 
               <br />
               I am prepared to vote for the proposed 
               <br />

               I trust the House will not regard me as 
               <br />
               desirous of assuming the oﬂice of a censor, if 
               <br />
               I express my belief that many of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speeches</span> 
               <br />
               that have been made upon this question 
               <br />
               have contained a vast quantity of matter 
               <br />
               quite irrelevant to the question under dis- 
               <br />
               cussion. There may be parts of the arrange- 
               <br />
               ment proposed that are unsatisfactory to 
               <br />
               many hon. gentlemen, but it is utterly im- 
               <br />
               possible to devise a scheme that will be 
               <br />
               acceptable to everybody, or that will not be 
               <br />
               Open to the criticism of seeming to bear 
               <br />
               harder on one section of the country than on 
               <br />
               another. But it should not be judged in 
               <br />
               that manner, but by its general fairness and 
               <br />
               by its being calculated to promote the wel- 
               <br />
               fare of the entire country embraced and to 
               <br />
               be embraced in the Confederacy. It would 
               <br />
               be absurd to suppose that a scheme could be 
               <br />
               devised for the purpose that would please 
               <br />
               and satisfy every section. The scheme 
               <br />
               under consideration should not be treated 
               <br />
               and criticised in this narrow, contracted 
               <br />
               view. Some portions of the country may 
               <br />
               have to make concessions and sacriﬁces for 
               <br />
               the public good, but these should be cheer- 
               <br />
               fully borne, if not of too aggravating a 
               <br />
               nature. If Upper Canada is blessed with 
               <br />
               more wealth than any of the other provinces, 
               <br />
               it ought not to be forgotten that its account- 
               <br />
               ability and its responsibility are greater— 
               <br />
               that they are in proportion to its riches—and 
               <br />
               while the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of that important section of 
               <br />
               the Confederacy may be called upon to con-

               <br />
               highly for the general welfare, yet it is not 
               <br />
               for a moment to be supposed—and no one
