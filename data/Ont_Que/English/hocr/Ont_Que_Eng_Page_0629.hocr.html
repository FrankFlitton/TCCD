               <br />
               aid her in the task—the support of a French- 
               <br />
               Canadian majority. (Hear, hear.) In the 
               <br />
               following year occurred the glorious battle of 
               <br />
               Chateauguay. On that memorable day a 
               <br />
               handful of brave men, commanded by DESA- 
               <br />
               LABIRRY, confronted an enemy thirty times 
               <br />
               superior in number to themselves, arrested the 
               <br />
               advance of the invader, and by their devoted- 
               <br />
               ness and bravery saved this rich province for 
               <br />
               the Crown of England. Now, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               what the French-Canadians did in the war of 
               <br />
               1812, that they are once more prepared to do 
               <br />
               under the Constitution as it is at this moment. 
               <br />
               It was because they felt at that time that they 
               <br />
               had something more precious to defend than 
               <br />
               a Confederation which can afford no better 
               <br />
               protection to their material interests than to 
               <br />
               their institutions, their language, their laws, 
               <br />
               and their nationality, that they took no ac- 
               <br />
               count of the numbers of the enemy, but fought 
               <br />
               valiantly when they were outnumbered in the 
               <br />
               proportion of ten to one. And now again, 
               <br />
               in defending the Constitution as it is, with the 
               <br />
               rights and privileges it guarantees to us, the 
               <br />
               Canadians will not hesitate amoment to sacri- 
               <br />
               ﬁce themselves for the safety of the precious 
               <br />
               deposit entrusted to their keeping. Surely, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, it is not necessary to go far 
               <br />
               back into our history for an instance of this. 
               <br />
               In 1862, at the time of the aﬁ'air of the Trent, 
               <br />
               when a rupture with our neighbors seemed 
               <br />
               imminent, the French-Canadians rushed to 
               <br />
               arms with the eagerness and irresistible im- 
               <br />
               pulse of the heroes of New France. It is not, 
               <br />
               Mr. Srnna, that the French-Canadian

               <br />
               After the war of 1812, which had so greatly 
               <br />
               imperilled the possessions of England on this 
               <br />

               <br />
               were renewed without delay; so true is it 
               <br />
               that danger alone could interrupt them. The 
               <br />
               troops having gone into winter quarters, the 
               <br />
               Governor, Sir G. PBEVOBT, went down to 
               <br />
               Quebec to open Parliament, and the dis- 
               <br />
               agreements between the popular branch and 
               <br />
               the Legislative Council soon broke forth 
               <br />
               again little by little. STUART again brought 
               <br />
               up the question of the rules of practice, and 
               <br />
               made the most serious accusations against 
               <br />
               Judge SEWELL—charging him, for instance, 
               <br />
               with having attempted to enforce his rules of 
               <br />
               practice without the authority of Parliament; 
               <br />
               with having dismissed the Solicitor General 
               <br />
               from his place in order to instal therein his 
               <br />
               own brother, E. SEWELL; with having vio- 
               <br />
               lated the liberty of the press, by causing the 
               <br />
               Canadien to be seized without an plausible 
               <br />
               grounds; and the liberty of Parliament, by 
               <br />
               imprisoning several of its members. These 
               <br />
               accusations, some of which were true, were 
               <br />
               transmitted to England, but STUART having 
               <br />
               been unable to cross the sea in order to follow 
               <br />
               them up, SEWELL got rid of the charges. 
               <br />
               The same occurred as regards Judge MONK, 
               <br />
               who was accused at the same time of sundry 
               <br />
               malversations; and, as Mr. F. X. GABNEAU 
               <br />
               remarks, Judge SEWELL determined that the 
               <br />
               best revenge he could take for the accusations 
               <br />
               brought against him was to suggest to the 
               <br />
               Prince Regent the union of all the British 
               <br />
               provinces, with aview to compass the destruc- 
               <br />
               tion of French-Canadian nationality. Such, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, were the circumstances under 
               <br />
               which the scheme of Confederation was ﬁrst pro- 
               <br />
               posed. And it mustbe admitted that, hearing 
               <br />
               in mind the recommendation of Mr. SEWELL, 
               <br />
               it ought'to excite many fears on the part of 
               <br />
               every true French-Canadian. Who was the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst man to pronounce the word “ Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation” ? A man who violated the liberty of 
               <br />
               the press and the libert of Parliament! A 
               <br />
               man who had for years onged for the destruc- 
               <br />
               tion of the French-Canadian race! At a 
               <br />
               subsequent period, after the revolution of 
               <br />
               1837, Lord DURHAM proposed Confederation 
               <br />
               as the political organization best adapted for
