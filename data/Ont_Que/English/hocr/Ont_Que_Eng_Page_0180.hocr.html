               other provisions in the proposed Constitution 
               <br />
               which seem to be ambiguous in their meaning, 
               <br />
               and before discussion upon them it would be 
               <br />
               well to have them fully explained. In the 
               <br />
               eleventh clause of the twenty-ninth resolution, 
               <br />
               for instance, it is declared that the General 
               <br />
               Parliament shall have power to make laws 
               <br />
               respecting “ all such works as shall, although 
               <br />
               i ° wholly within any province, be specially 
               <br />
               eclared by the acts authorizing them to be 
               <br />
               for the general advantage.” It would appear 
               <br />
               from this, that works like the Welland canal, 
               <br />
               which yield a very large revenue, will be given 
               <br />
               over to the General Government; and this 
               <br />
               being the case, surely this is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁcient</span> set-
