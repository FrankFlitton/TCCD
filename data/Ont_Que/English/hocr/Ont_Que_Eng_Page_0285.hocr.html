               ve years ago, Lower Canada entered into the 
               <br />
               union of the provinces with a debt of £133,- 
               <br />
               000. That was a debt created by the Special 
               <br />
               Council, for the Legislature of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               under the old Constitution owed not a penny 
               <br />
               when it ceased to exist. That debt was 
               <br />
               created between 1837 and 1840. Since the 
               <br />
               union there have been expended in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, for the Beauhamois canal, the en- 
               <br />
               largement of the Lachine canal, the works 
               <br />
               on Lake St. Peter, and the Chambly canal, 
               <br />
               about four millions of dollars. Besides, we 
               <br />
               have three hundred and ﬁfty miles of the 
               <br />
               Grand Trunk Railway—about a hundred less 
               <br />
               than Upper Canada. Taking one-half the 
               <br />
               cost to the province of that railway ——two 
               <br />
               million pounds currency, or eight millions of 
               <br />
               dollars—we have four millions for canals and 
               <br />
               eight millions for railways. Twelve millions 
               <br />
               of dollars have, therefore, been expended for 
               <br />
               public works in Lower Canada, with perhaps 
               <br />
               another million for other small works—in all, 
               <br />
               thirteen millions of dollars.

               will have to be paid by Lower Canada alone, the

               interest on which, at ﬁve per cent, will be 
               <br />

               <br />
               ernment to Lower Canada or local purposes, 
               <br />
               leaving something less than 60 cents per head 
               <br />
               for carrying on the Local Government. Upper 
               <br />
               Canada came into the union with a debt of 
               <br />
               £1,300,000. Immediately after the union 
               <br />
               £1,500,000 sterling was borrowed for public 
               <br />
               works, most of which amount was expended in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada. And yet Upper Canada goes 
               <br />
               out of the union by simply abandoning its 
               <br />
               claim for indemnity under the Seigniorial 
               <br />

               Fede debt; while Lower Canada, on the 
               <br />
               contrary, goes out with a load of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,600,000</span> 
               <br />
               of local debt, besides the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">827,500,000</span>

               which falls to its share to be paid through
