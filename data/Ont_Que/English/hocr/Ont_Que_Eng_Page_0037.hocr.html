               ation, Government proposed to submit to the

               House a scheme or schemes to be considered 
               <br />

               respecting the constitutions of their respective 
               <br />
               governments. But the action with regard to 
               <br />
               them must be the action of Parliament. That 
               <br />
               action would only be asked after the Con- 
               <br />
               federation scheme was adopted, for until it 
               <br />
               was settled that there was to be Confederation, 
               <br />
               it was idle to discuss what should be the con- 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. GALT, at Sherbrooke, that before Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation took place, this Parliament would be asked 
               <br />
               to consider a measure which he hoped would be 
               <br />
               satisfactory to all classes of the communit . 
               <br />
               There was a good deal of apprehension m

               Lower Canada on the part of the minority 
               <br />

               on their rights on the subject of education, 
               <br />
               and it was the intention of the Government, if 
               <br />
               Parliament approved the scheme of Confedera- 
               <br />

               As regards the Intercolonial Railroad, the

               tention of the Government in that matter. The 
               <br />
               railroad was not, as stated by Hon. MLHOLTON, 
               <br />
               a portion of the Constitution, but was one of 
               <br />

               <br />
               agreed to enter into the constitutional agree-

               <br />
               would leave in the hands of the President of

               the Council, who understood it thoroughly, 
               <br />
               and could, no doubt, give Hon. Mr. HOLTON a 
               <br />
