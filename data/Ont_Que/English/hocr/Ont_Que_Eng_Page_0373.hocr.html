               strongest possible condemnation of the Constitu-

               <br />
               rated. 
               <br />
               If the readers of the work published by 
               <br />
               the Hon. Mr. CAUOHON, in 1865, in favor of 
               <br />
               Confederation, desire to know where I found 
               <br />
               that passage, I answer, in the work pub- 
               <br />
               lished by the Hon. Mr. CAUOHON, in 1858. 
               <br />
               It is probably the portion of the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman’s work of 1858, which he will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               it most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁcult</span> to get over. He may, indeed, 
               <br />
               allege in explanation of his change of Opinion 
               <br />
               on other points, that the political position is 
               <br />
               altered, that our relations with the provinces 
               <br />
               and our neighbors of the United States are no 
               <br />
               longer the same; but I apprehend he will hard- 
               <br />
               ly go the length of asserting that the geograph- 
               <br />
               ical conﬁguration of the country is changed. 
               <br />
               He will perhaps endeavor to show that the 
               <br />
               Inter-colonial Railway, the construction of 
               <br />
               which forms t of the plan of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, will obviate the defects of our aph- 
               <br />
               ical 'tion; but I would remind 'm that 
               <br />
               in 1 58, when he wrote his ﬁrst work, the 
               <br />
               building of the Intercolonial Railway was 
               <br />
               proposed as it is proposed new; this will ap- 
               <br />
               pear from the passage I have just quoted: 
               <br />
               “ And at this moment, pending the carrying 
               <br />
               out of the improvements we have just re- 
               <br />

               mythological ages. The Hon. Attorney Gen- 
               <br />
               eral for Lower Canada has developed a plan 
               <br />
               of strategy which I take the liberty of scri— 
               <br />
               ously recommending to the Commander-in- 
               <br />
               Chief. The honorable gentleman sums up in 
               <br />
               the following terms the advantages oi the 
               <br />
               Confederation in a milit point of view: 
               <br />
               “When we shall be unite , the enemy will 
               <br />
               know that if he attacks any part of our provin- 
               <br />
               ces, the Island of Prince Edward or Canada, he 
               <br />
               will have to meet the combined <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forces</span> of the 
               <br />
               Empire.” There was no need of the Confed- 
               <br />
               eration to convince our neighbors of that ; 
               <br />
               they are, as a general rule, suﬁciently shar 
               <br />
               wittcd to discover, without being told it, that 
               <br />
               if they content themselves with attacking us 
               <br />
               at a single point at a time, of course they will 
               <br />
               have to meet all our strength. Would it not 
               <br />
               be well to enter into a contract, binding them 
               <br />
               to attack us at a single point only at one time 
               <br />
               —say Quebec? We might, in fact, give them 
               <br />
               the free use of the Grand Trunk Railway to 
               <br />
               bring their troops to Point Levis. Of what 
               <br />
               beneﬁt to the United States would be their 
               <br />
               vast armies, their great ﬂeets, their abundant 
               <br />
               means of transport in every direction,_if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> 
               <br />
               were to attack us only at one point at a time, 
               <br />
               as the Hon. Attorney General seems to hope ? 
               <br />
               In the war of 1812, they attacked us simul- 
               <br />
               taneously at different points, though their 
               <br />
               troops were far less numerous in proportion 
               <br />
               to ours than they would now be in case of 
               <br />
               war, and though their means of transport 
               <br />
               were then far inferior to what they now are. 
               <br />
