               So, sir, there ‘are more objections still which 
               <br />
               the Colonial Secretary has not stated. He 
               <br />
               gives a general sanction, but 8 iﬁes four 
               <br />
               matters, two of which he distinct y says must 
               <br />
               be altered, and the other two he does not ap- 
               <br />
               prove of, and he says that other matters-— 
               <br />
               too numerous, I suppose, to specify—must be

               <br />
               appearance of this despatch. It is perfectly 
               <br />
               true that no hint was given oﬂicially, when 
               <br />
               this scheme was sent'home, that it contem- 
               <br />
               plated separation. Perfectly true, that in the

               answer there is no hint that separation is con- 
               <br />
               templated. But it is perfectly true, also, that 
               <br />
               the leading journal instantly sees in it, and 
               <br />
               seizes at, the possibility-ﬁrst, of its greatly

               greatly facilitating, on the part of the Mother

               Country, the letting of us go. I shall come 
               <br />
               back to this branch of the subject presently, 
               <br />
               after I shall have quoted from a much more 
               <br />
               important expression of public Opinion than 
               <br />
               any article in the Times. Meantime, I must 
               <br />
               refer to the anguage of Her Majesty’s Speech 
               <br />
               from the T rone. It has been read during 
               <br />
               this debate already, and has been read as if 
               <br />
               it contained the most emphatic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approval</span> 
               <br />
               possible of this whole scheme—-so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emphatic</span> 
               <br />
               an approval, that even to assume to discuss It 
               <br />
               now would seem to amount almost to treason. 
               <br />
               This language, of course, it is needless to say, 
               <br />
               is that of Her Majesty’s Imperial advisers, 
               <br />
               and is to be read in connection with what 
               <br />
               Her Majesty’s Government have said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about</span> 
               <br />
               this plan in the Colonial Secretary’s des- 
               <br />
               patch—that before it is passed into an 
               <br />
               enactment, it will require a good deal of 
               <br />
               revision. We may be told here that the 
               <br />
               document before us is a treaty, on which not 
               <br />
               a line or letter of amendment can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> 
               <br />
               by us. But Her Majesty’s Government 
               <br />
               clearly understand that they are not bound 
               <br />
               by it, and that they are to alter it as much 
               <br />
               as they please. They won’t give the pardon-
