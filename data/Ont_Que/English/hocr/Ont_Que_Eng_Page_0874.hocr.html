               <br />
               of $100,000 made to the Grand Trunk Rail-

               <br />
               which act several members of the Cabinet

               were responsible. Could you inform me, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, what has become of the $100,000 
               <br />
               question ? Alas ! it disappeared in the Minis- 
               <br />
               terial crisis, and left us the extraordinary 
               <br />
               Coalition which now governs us, composed of 
               <br />
               men who for ten years treated each other as 
               <br />
               men devoid of political principle! (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The Conservative party clung so 
               <br />
               tenaciously to power, that they were not 
               <br />
               appalled by the position to which they had 
               <br />
               brought the country. Any union or coalition 
               <br />
               between two political parties, of opposite 
               <br />
               principles, proves an abandonment of prin- 
               <br />
               ciple by one or the other. All coalitions are 
               <br />
               vicious in their very foundation: they have 
               <br />
               always been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">held</span> as proofs of political proﬂi- 
               <br />
               gaey, in England as everywhere else; and they 
               <br />
               are the more dangerous that they are generally 
               <br />
               strong. To the present Coalition we are in- 
               <br />
               debted for the scheme of the Confederation 
               <br />
               of the British Provinces in a tangible 
               <br />
               form. Had that Coalition never been formed, 
               <br />
               we should never have heard of the Quebec 
               <br />
               Conference, nor of the resolutions adopted 
               <br />
               at that meeting in October last, and now sub 
               <br />
               mitted to our consideration. Now, who au- 
               <br />
               thorised the holding of that Conference? 
               <br />
               What right had that body to arrogate to itself 
               <br />
               the power of proposing a radical change in 
               <br />
               our political condition? How was Canada 
               <br />
               represented there ? Three-fourths of the Ca- 
               <br />
               nadian delegates were men under the ban of 
               <br />
               parliamentary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">candemnation.</span> How was the 
               <br />
               voting carried on at that Convention? Was 
               <br />
               it not by provinces ? Have not the four little 
               <br />
               provinces below had twice as many votes on 
               <br />
               each question as the two large provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada ‘? These questions all occur naturally. 
               <br />
               If to each of them a categorical answer were 
               <br />
               rendered, we should be able to throw some light 
               <br />
               on the way in which the interests of the country 
               <br />
               have been neglected,overriddcn, and sacriﬁced. 
               <br />
               If we only think that to the last question no 
               <br />
               other answer could berendered than an aﬁirm- 
               <br />
               ative, there is no room for wonder that the

               Lower Provinces had all the advantage in the 
               <br />
               arrangements concluded at the Conference. 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing public business. (Hear, hear.) I do 
               <br />
               not mean to repeat what has been said during 
               <br />
               the debate; but before proceeding, I may be 
               <br />
               allowed to draw a contrast between our 
               <br />
               manner of acting and that of our neigh- 
               <br />
               bors in the United States when cou- 
               <br />
               stitutional changes are in question. In 
               <br />
               the United States—that country which people 
               <br />
               take so much pains to represent as the hotbed 
               <br />
               of all political, social, moral and physical hor- 
               <br />
               rors—they do not play with the written con- 
               <br />
               stitutions of the several states, any more than 
               <br />
               with that of the American union. There, 
               <br />
               whenever a constitution is to be amended, 
               <br />
               generally, it requires a vote of two-thirds 
               <br />
               of each of the two Houses. If it is the Con— 
               <br />
               stitution of the United States which is to be 
               <br />
               amended, the measure must also be sanctioned 
               <br />
               by a majority in each of the legislatures of the 
               <br />
               several states. If the amendment relates to a 
               <br />
               local constitution, besides a two—thirds vote of 
               <br />
               the two Houses, the amendment must be rati- 
               <br />
               ﬁed by a convention of delegates from the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> parties in the state, selected specially 
               <br />
               for the occasion. The United States are now 
               <br />
               occupied with the consideration of an amend- 
               <br />
               ment of their Constitution, the object of which 
               <br />
               is the abolition of slavery. The amendment 
               <br />
               has been adopted by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Congress</span> and by the 
               <br />
               Senate of the American union, and must be 
               <br />
               ratiﬁed by a majority of the local legislatures, 
               <br />
               before it. forms a part of the Constitution. It 
               <br />
               will even be necessary to take into the account 
               <br />
               the states which are now in rebellion. We 
               <br />
               see at once the arantees they are provided 
               <br />
               with, that no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">raâ‘ilcal</span> change shall be adopted 
               <br />
               without the consent of the people, who are 
               <br />
               allowed suﬂicient time to weigh all the consi- 
               <br />
               derations which may operate in favor of any 
               <br />

               <br />
               matters of importance; and, as a thing of 
               <br />
               course, they have established a political status 
               <br />
