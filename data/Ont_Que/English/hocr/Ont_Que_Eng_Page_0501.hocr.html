               Ms. DUN KIN said—Mr. Spsaxaa, almost 
               <br />
               every one who has yet spoken in this debate 
               <br />
               has begun with some expression of his feeling 
               <br />
               of embarrassmen t. For my own part, I should 
               <br />
               be glad if I could begin in some other way, 
               <br />
               but I confess that I cannot. For I certainly 
               <br />
               never did rise to address this House, or any 
               <br />
               other public body, under a feeling of such 
               <br />
               oppressive embarrassment as I experience at 
               <br />
               this moment. It is im ible for me, occu- 
               <br />
               pying the position in w ich I now stand, not 
               <br />
               to feel that I am opposed to powerful odds, 
               <br />
               and that there is a sort of foregone conclu- 
               <br />
               sion, here, against the views I desire to 
               <br />
               impress upon the House. It is impossible 
               <br />
               for me not to feel that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerations</span> to 
               <br />
               which I have to ask the attention of the 
               <br />
               House, are so many and so complex, that no 
               <br />
               sort ot‘ justice can possibly be done them 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               impatient, that one can scarcely hope to 
               <br />
               express his views fully, as he would wish 
               <br />
               and ought, on this vast scheme. I have even 
               <br />
               the feeling that my capacity for exertion is 
               <br />

               me less ca able than usual of physical 
               <br />

               inability to discuss this scheme as I could

               <br />
               the forbearance of Lon. members—that I 
               <br />
               hardly can help saying I should be in danger

               of shrinking from the duty of addressing

               <br />
               almost or quite as discouraging as this, that 
               <br />
               “ the race has not been to the swift nor the 
               <br />
               battle to the strong”—-that time and again [ 
               <br />
               have known those who went into such con-

               tests with the best hopes of success, disap- 
               <br />

               to combat, is anything but the deliberate 
               <br />
               result of a well-considered examination of 
               <br />
               the whole subject—is a feeling of most 
               <br />
               sudden growth, and of most passing char- 
               <br />
               acter. (Hear, hear.) Before I go further, 
               <br />
               I may be permitted distinctly to accept the 
               <br />
               challenge which has been more than once 
               <br />
               thrown out on the other side as to the man- 
               <br />
               ner in which this question ought to be 
               <br />
               discussed. I lreely admit and sincerely 
               <br />
               maintain that it ought not to he discussed
