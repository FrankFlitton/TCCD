               <br />

               no combination which so much needs one head

               and one guiding mind as the management of 
               <br />
               military organizations, and the guidance of 
               <br />
               military operations. What, I ask, would be 
               <br />
               our position in the event of war, should there 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> union? We have at present ﬁve dis- 
               <br />
               tinct provinces, with as many independent 
               <br />
               governments. The pe0ple are but little known 
               <br />
               the one to the other, and consequently have 
               <br />
               but the slightest possible interest in each 
               <br />
               other. In the event of war, circumstances 
               <br />
               might frequently occur where concerted action 
               <br />
               on the part of two or more of the provinces 
               <br />
               might be required. Immediate cooperation 
               <br />
               might be essential to the success of the pro- 
               <br />
               posed project. Should we not have the most 
               <br />
               serious diﬂiculties thrown in the way of the 
               <br />
               undertaking, simply from the fact that so 
               <br />
               many independent governments must be con- 
               <br />
               sulted, each jealous of its own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights,</span> and con- 
               <br />
               cerned only about its own safety. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Such a state of things demands a 
               <br />
               change, were there no other argument in 
               <br />
               favor of it. If we are to remain independent 
               <br />
               of the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States,</span> we must unite, in the 
               <br />
               most effective manner possible, our available 
               <br />
               means of defence. We must become ac- 
               <br />
               quainted with one another, and do all we can 
               <br />
               to call into existence a feeling of oneness, and 
               <br />
               of interest not only in one section or province, 
               <br />
               but in British America generally. Canadians 
               <br />
               should cease to think that they are interested 
               <br />
               alone in the defence of Canada, and Nova 
               <br />
               Sootians must learn to look beyond the limits 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Nova Seotia. If we are to offer anything 
               <br />
               like a united resistance, we must have a com- 
               <br />
               mon interest in the whole country. And how 
               <br />
               can we so surely eﬁ‘ect this, how effect it at 
               <br />

               own interests demand it, the interests of the 
               <br />
               Empire require it, that we may be able to hold 
               <br />
               our own against the strong and energetic 
               <br />
               power to the south of us. For these import- 
               <br />
               ant objects we must learn to throw aside all 
               <br />
               our sectional disputes, and to place ourselves 
               <br />
               in the hands of men who would have to guide 
               <br />
               us when the time of difﬁculty may arrive. No 
               <br />
               one more earnestly desires the continuance of 
               <br />
               the blessings of peace; but should the reverse 
               <br />
               come, we must all learn to obey orders with 
               <br />
               zeal and promptitude, to stand in readiness 
               <br />
               for service in any part of British America 
               <br />
               where our presence may be required. This 
               <br />
               can never be done so long as Nova Scotia is 
               <br />
               building up a nationality for herself, and New _ 
               <br />
               Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince Ed— 
               <br />
               ward Island are each remaining in a state of 
               <br />
               isolation, and Upper and Lower Canada are 
               <br />
               far removed in sentiment and feeling from 
               <br />
               either. So long as this is the case, we are 
               <br />
               diﬁ'using our strength and are weakening our— 
               <br />
               selves. From no point of view can union be 
               <br />
               more strongly urged as a necessity than in 
               <br />
               the case of our defence. The defence of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, although we have such an extended fron- 
               <br />
               tier, is not so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> as might at ﬁrst s' ht 
               <br />
               appear. There a few prominent points which 
               <br />
               must be defended, and which we must make 
               <br />
               up our minds to hold. It is true we have an 
               <br />
               extensive frontier, but the frontier of the 
               <br />
               United States is not the less so. It is true 
               <br />
               also that we have many towns on the frontier, 
               <br />
               but they are not to be compared to the wealth 
               <br />
               and importance of those of the United States, 
               <br />
               and therefore we are not placed at so great a 
               <br />
               disadvantage in that respect. There are cer— 
               <br />
               tain points which are the key or the gates to 
               <br />
               Canada, and which, if properly defended, we 
               <br />
               may reasonably hope to hold the country, 
               <br />
               without fear of any number that may be 
               <br />
               brought against us, and it is of the ﬁrst im- 
               <br />
               portance that the people of Canada should
