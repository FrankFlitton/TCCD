               Who would have thoug t, a month before the

               attack on Fort Sumter, that a devastating

               discussions which took place in the Congress 
               <br />
               of the United States? Up to that time 
               <br />
               everyone professed to believe that the hard

               <br />
               who, in so doing, gave up the demand for 
               <br />
               representation by population, which had for 
               <br />
               years agitated the western section of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince. For my part the feeling I had at the 
               <br />
               time was this: the MACDONALD-CARTIER 
               <br />
               and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CARTIER-MACDONALD</span> Governments,

               <br />
               thecountry, had refused to give us represent- 
               <br />
               ation by population. Our natural allies also, 
               <br />
               the Liberal party in Lower Canada—who, I 
               <br />
               believe, desired, and honestly desired, to do 
               <br />
               the best they could to meet our wishes-in 
               <br />
               like manner declared the impossibility of con- 
               <br />
               ceding to us this principle. Meanwhile the 
               <br />
               Liberal party from Upper Canada felt that the 
               <br />
               country was in a state of ﬁnancial embarrass- 
               <br />
               ment, and that an amelioration of her con- 
               <br />
               dition was urgently needed. A change was 
               <br />
               absolutely necessary. It was wisely thought 
               <br />
               that it was better to have half a loaf than no 
               <br />
               bread. But I have failed to see, and I yet 
               <br />
               fail to see, that the Liberal party of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada have ever given up the advocacy of re- 
               <br />
               presentation by population. We found all par-

               —refusing to concede to us what we conceived 
               <br />
               to be this just and pro r principle; and when 
               <br />
               the opportunity was o ercd to us of relieving 
               <br />
               the country from its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculties,</span> we felt that

               a good deal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sheet</span> by reading the past

               speeches of that honorable gentleman and the

               which have engaged the attention of the public

               felt more strongly than he did on account of 
               <br />

               agree with me when I say that am persuaded

               that the Hon. President of the Council did 
               <br />
               not feign the feeling he manifested in this 
               <br />
               House when he arose and avowed his in-

               tention, for the good of his country, of join- 
               <br />
               ing with the men whom he had previously de— 
               <br />
               nounced. (Hear, hear. But did he so act 
               <br />
               without a purpose, without receiving any- 
               <br />
               thing in return ? No. The principle advo- 
               <br />
               cated by him and his party for years was con- 
               <br />
               ceded; and in addition to that, in my opinion, . 
               <br />
               whatever may be the opinion of others—and 
               <br />
               it is an opinion I have held for years—by 
               <br />
               adopting the larger scheme we attain the same 
               <br />
               result. I ask, then, should the Hon.

               President of the Council be denounced now 
               <br />
               for the position he has felt it his duty to take; 
               <br />
               and, especially, should he be denounced by 
               <br />
               the Liberal party—by thoœ with whom he has

               course he has taken in common with others, 
               <br />
