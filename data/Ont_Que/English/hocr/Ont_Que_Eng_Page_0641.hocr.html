               <br />
               would certainly not have accepted a scheme

               <br />
               French race as that which has been submitted 
               <br />
               to us. They would have obtained more 
               <br />
               favorable conditions than those which are 
               <br />
               imposed upon us, among which is the 
               <br />
               appointment _ for life of the legislative 
               <br />
               councillors, by the Executive branch of the 
               <br />
               General Legislature. For my part, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I am not in favor of the appoint- 
               <br />
               ment for life of men taken from the crowd 
               <br />
               to be converted into the instruments of 
               <br />
               oppression, and ten often to serve to cast 
               <br />
               impediments in the way of the most import- 
               <br />
               ant liberties and rights of the peeple. The 
               <br />
               appointment for life of the legislative 
               <br />
               councillors by a majority which is hostile 
               <br />
               to our race is as dangerous to-day as it was 
               <br />
               in the nest evil days of our history, and to 
               <br />
               accept it is to place our most precious liber- 
               <br />
               ties at the mercy of the enemies of our race. 
               <br />
               With such provisions in the Constitution 
               <br />
               which it is proposed to force upon us, it is 
               <br />
               impossible that the French element should 
               <br />
               be protected in the Legislative Council. It 
               <br />
               is equally impossible that the aggressive 
               <br />
               tendencies, of which I gave an historical 
               <br />
               sketch in the ﬁrst part of my remarks, will 
               <br />
               not produce their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> in the Federal Ex- 
               <br />
               ecutive, when the question of the appoint- 
               <br />
               ment of those members is being settled. 
               <br />
               We have been told, “ The French Canadian 
               <br />
               section will resign if the Federal Executive 
               <br />
               attemptto practice injustice to the detriment 
               <br />
               of their fellow countrymen.” Well, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I would willingly believe that 
               <br />
               they would resign, and that no successors 
               <br />
               could be found for them, which is still more 
               <br />
               improbable, and I should like to know to 
               <br />
               what such a resignation would lead, and 
               <br />
               what sort of a remedy it would provide <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> 
               <br />
               our humiliating position. We shall have 
               <br />
               forty-eight members in the Federal Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment against one hundred and forty of 
               <br />
               English origin ; in other words, we shall be 
               <br />
               in the proportion of one to four. What 
               <br />
               could so weak a minority do to obtain justice? 
               <br />
               Evidently the resignation of the French 
               <br />
               section would make it still more powerless, 
               <br />

               contingency of a collision between our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Load</span>

               Legislature and the Federal Government, in 
               <br />
               consequence of the rejection of a measure 
               <br />
               passed by the Province of Lower Canadaand 
               <br />
               thrown out by the General Parliament; in 
               <br />
               what position shall we be? Let us remember 
               <br />
               that the Federal Executive appoints the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, presides over the crim- 
               <br />
               inal legislation of the country, and appoints 
               <br />
               the judges who administer it ; in a word, that 
               <br />
               in the Federal Government are vested all 
               <br />
               sovereign powers, to the exclusion of the 
               <br />
               local governments. Well, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Snamﬂ</span> 
               <br />
               say without hesitation that in the case of a

               collision, we shall ﬁnd ourselves <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compleuly</span>

               at the mercy of the hostile Federal majority,

               and that it may oppress us, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admilate</span> our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laws,‘j</span> suspend our judges, arm the militia 
               <br />

               exile in any way they maythink proper, not 
               <br />

               <br />
               the French-Canadian minority in the Federal 
               <br />
               Parliament. Such has already been found 
               <br />
               to occur; the past is there to prove the fact, 
               <br />
               and everything leads us to believe thatthe 
               <br />
               same attempts at fanatical aggression will be 
               <br />
               renewed in our day, if the scheme of Confed-
