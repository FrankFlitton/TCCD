               they are perfectly satisﬁed. It has been

               from a report which I received this morning 
               <br />
               of the proceedings of the Counties Council 
               <br />
               of York and Peel. These counties send four 
               <br />
               representatives to the other House of Parlia-

               ment, and they comprise portions of three of 
               <br />
               the divisions represented in this Chamber-— 
               <br />
               Midland, Peel and York. Mr. GRAHAM, a 
               <br />
               member of the council, moved that a select 
               <br />
               committee be appointed to draft a petition to 
               <br />
               the Legislature as to the advisability of the 
               <br />
               people being consulted before the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation should be carried into effect. 
               <br />
               Iwill now read from the report :—

               _ Hr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gama,</span> Vaughan, argued that he did not

               <br />
               of politics, and hence the question was not one of

               <br />

               what good results would ﬂow from it. The reso-
