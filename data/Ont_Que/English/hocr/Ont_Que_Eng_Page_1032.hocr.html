               wall seems to desire that the question 
               <br />
               should be referred to the people, not by 
               <br />
               means of a general election, but in such 
               <br />
               a. manner as to have a direct yea or nay 
               <br />
               upon it. Well, sir, if that mode were 
               <br />
               adopted, and the scheme were not sus- 
               <br />
               tained, most of the members of this House 
               <br />
               ought to go home at once and resign their 
               <br />
               seats. And what then? Why, sir, new 
               <br />
               elections would have to take place to ﬁll 
               <br />
               the vacant seats, and the summer would 
               <br />
               be nearly gone before we should have re- 
               <br />
               turns. We should then have to explain 
               <br />
               matters to the newly-elected members in 
               <br />
               order to convince them that the measure is 
               <br />
               all right, and in all probability more than 
               <br />
               six months would transpire before we could 
               <br />
               record our votes upon it. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               think it would be most unadvisable to allow 
               <br />
               the motion now before the House to be ap- 
               <br />
               plied in either way. But, sir, I must say 
               <br />
               that unless the arrangements in respect to the 
               <br />
               local governments are made satisfactory to 
               <br />
               the people of Upper Canada, I shall vote to 
               <br />
               cast them overboard. But when I look at 
               <br />
               the fact that the honorable gentlemen who 
               <br />
               compose the Government are the ablest which 
               <br />
               both political parties could furnish, and went 
               <br />
               together with the approval of the large 
               <br />
               majority of their political followers, I think 
               <br />
               it is not our place to relieve them from the 
               <br />
               responsibility now resting upon them, of 
               <br />
               carrying out this measure in a manner that 
               <br />
               I hope will prove satisfactory to the people. 
               <br />
               If we took it out of their hands, we would be 
               <br />
               assuming a responsibility that properly per- 
               <br />
               tains to them ; and for my part, I am willing 
               <br />
               to leave the responsibility on their shoulders 
               <br />
               at the present time. If they will not do 
               <br />
               what is right for us, I shall take the liberty 
               <br />
               of recording any vote against them, and thus 
               <br />
               give them a practical expression of my 
               <br />
               Opinion. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span>

               the subject upon which such great unanimity

               HON. MR. HUNTINGTON—I say that

               disregard the views of the people, and 
               <br />
               arrogate to himself the right to know what

               for South Oxford, when he came to put in 
               <br />
               his ear fairly, surprised me. I felt that he

               was entirely too severe upon my honorable 
               <br />
               friend the member for Peel. It was easy to 
               <br />
               see that the strong feeling of friendship for the 
               <br />
               Government which he entertained prevented 
               <br />
               him from making his argument tell in favor

               of his position as strongly as he might have 
               <br />
               done. I admired the eloquence which ren- 
               <br />
               dered his speech so acceptable to the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House, but I felt that he was . 
               <br />
               afraid of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offending</span> his friends in the Govern-

               ment. He seemed to select those hammers 
               <br />
               that would give the lightest blows. He ad- 
               <br />
               mitted that if an appeal to the people were 
               <br />
               taken, the honorable gentlemen on the Trea- 
               <br />
               sury benches would come back to their seats 
               <br />
               with, perhaps, even a more numerous follow- 
               <br />
               ing than now. There was one point of his 
               <br />
               argument that has remained unanswered. He 
               <br />
               said that in view of the position which the 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme occupied in the Lower

               <br />
               sion in its favor given by this House, there 
               <br />
               was no further need of haste —- no necessity for 
               <br />
               pressing the resolutions f urther until the peo-
