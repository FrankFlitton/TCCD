               <br />
               cipal features. lt is well known that upon three 
               <br />
               important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">points</span> touching the common rights and 
               <br />
               interests 0 the several states, much diversity of 
               <br />
               opinion prevailed, and many animated discussions 
               <br />
               took place. The first Was as to the mode of 
               <br />
               voting in Congress, whether it should be by 
               <br />
               states or according to wealth or pepulation. The 
               <br />
               second, as to the rule by which the expenses of 
               <br />
               the Union should be apportioned among the 
               <br />
               states. And the third, as has been already seen, 
               <br />
               relative to the disposal of the vacant and unappro- 
               <br />
               priated lands in the western territory. But that 
               <br />
               which strikes us with most force is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increasing</span> 
               <br />
               jealousy and watcht'ulness everywhere betrayed 
               <br />
               in respect to the powers to be conﬁded to the 
               <br />
               General Government. For this several causes 
               <br />
               may be assigned. The colonies had been long 
               <br />
               engaged in struggles against tue superintending 
               <br />
               authority of the Crown, and had practically felt 
               <br />
               the inconveniences of the restrictive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> 
               <br />
               of the parent country. These struggles 
               <br />
               had naturally led to a general feeling of resis- 
               <br />
               tance of all external authority, and these in- 
               <br />
               conveniences to extreme doubts, if not to dread 
               <br />
               of any legislation, not exclusively originating in 
               <br />
               their domestic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assemblies,</span> They had, as yet, 
               <br />
               not felt the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">importance</span> or necessity of union 
               <br />
               among themselves, having been hitherto con- 
               <br />
               nected with the British sovereignty in all their 
               <br />
               foreign relations. What would be their fate, as 
               <br />
               separate and independent communities; how far 
               <br />
               their interests would coincide or vary from each 
               <br />
               other as such; what would be the etfects of the 
               <br />
               union upon their domestic peace, their territorial 
               <br />
               interests, their external commerce, their political 
               <br />
               security, or their civil liberty, were points to them 
               <br />
               wholly of a speculative character, in regard to 
               <br />
               which various Opinions might be entertained, and 
               <br />
               various and even Opposite conjectures formed, 
               <br />
               upon grounds apparently of equal plausibility.

               <br />
               an examination of the powers conﬁded to the 
               <br />
               General Government would easily satisfy us that 
               <br />
               they looked principally to the existing revolu- 
               <br />
               tionary state of things. The princi a1 powers

               <br />
               dormant in times of peace. In short, Congress 
               <br />
               in peace was possessed of but a delusive and 
               <br />
               shadowy sovereignty, with little more than the 
               <br />
               empty pageantry of ofﬁce. They were indeed 
               <br />
               clothed with the authority of sending and receiving 
               <br />
               ambassadors; of entering into treaties and allian- 
               <br />
               ces; of appointing courts for the trial of piracies 
               <br />
               and felonies on the hioh seas ; of regulating the 
               <br />
               public coin; of ﬁxing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> standard of weights and 
               <br />
               measures; of regulating trade with Indians, of 
               <br />
               establishing post <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offices;</span> of borrowing money and 
               <br />
               emitting bills on the credit of the United 
               <br />
               States; of ascertaining and appropriating the 
               <br />
               sums necessary for defraying the public ex- 
               <br />
               penses, and of disposing of the western ter- 
               <br />
               ritory. And most of these powers required for 
               <br />
               their exercise the assent of nine states. But they 
               <br />
               possessed not the power to raise any revenue, 
               <br />
               to levy any tax, to enforce any law, to secure 
               <br />
               any right, to regulate any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade,</span> or even the poor 
               <br />
               prerogative of commanding means to pay its own 
               <br />
               ministers ata foreign court. They could contract 
               <br />
               debts, but they were without means to discharge 
               <br />
               them. They could pledge the public faith, but 
               <br />
               they were incapable of redeeming it. They could 
               <br />
               enter into treaties, but every state in the union 
               <br />
               might disobey them with im unity. They could 
               <br />
               contract alliances, but coul not command men 
               <br />
               or money to give them vigor. They could insti- 
               <br />
               tute courts for piracies and felonies on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">high</span> 
               <br />
               seas, but they had no means to pay either the 
               <br />
               judges or the jurors. In short, all powers which 
               <br />
               did not execute themselves were at the mercy of 
               <br />
               the states, and might be trampled upon at will 
               <br />
               with impunity.
