               MR. D. FORD JONES resumed the

               adjourned debate. He said— I rise, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, to address the House on the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions which you hold in your hand in 
               <br />
               favor of a Confederation of all the Provinces 
               <br />
               of British North America. I feel that the 
               <br />
               question is one involving such very great 
               <br />
               interests, involving a change in the whole 
               <br />
               Constitution of the country, and involving 
               <br />
               consequences which may plunge us into 
               <br />
               great difﬁculties, or which may have the 
               <br />
               very opposite eﬂ'eet— that I feel great 
               <br />
               diﬂideneeand embarrassment in approaching 
               <br />
               it. But I feel it is a duty I owe to myself 
               <br />
               and to those who sent me here, that I should 
               <br />
               express my opinions on this proposed union, 
               <br />
               before I record my vote on the resolutions 
               <br />
               now before the llouse. I desire to do this, 
               <br />
               because I cannot give my approval to the
