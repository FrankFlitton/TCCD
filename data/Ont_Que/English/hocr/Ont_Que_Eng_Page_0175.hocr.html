               I would like to know now how much it is to 
               <br />
               cost. It does appear to me that this is a very 
               <br />
               important question, and one that lies at the 
               <br />
               root of the whole matter in the minds of many

               the honorable gentleman who has just taken 
               <br />
               his seat (Hon. Mr. BOULTON), and who 
               <br />
               comes from Cobourg, has indulged in a gene- 
               <br />
               ral attack upon the elective system, because, 
               <br />
               forsooth, several munici 'ties throughout the 
               <br />
               country have borrowed argely from the Loan 
               <br />
               Fund, and because the money they so borrowed 
               <br />
               has not been properly invested. He argues 
               <br />
               from this that the principle of election by the 
               <br />
               people should be done away with in this 
               <br />
               House. It does appear strange that any hon.
