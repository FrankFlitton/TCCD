               probably if we suﬁ'er this opportunity to be

               events of this magnitude, a providential

               <br />
               ment of Canada was so modiﬁed last spring 
               <br />
               as to enable it to deal fearlessly with this 
               <br />
               subject, at the very moment when the coast 
               <br />
               colonies, despairing of a Canadian union, 
               <br />
               were arranging a conference of their own for 
               <br />
               a union of their own. Our Government 
               <br />
               embraced among its members from the 
               <br />
               western section the leaders of the former 
               <br />
               Ministry and former Opposition from that 
               <br />
               section. At the time it was formed it 
               <br />
               announced to this House that it was its inten— 
               <br />
               tion as part of its policy to seek a conference 
               <br />
               with the lower colonies, and endeavor to 
               <br />
               bring about a general union. This House 
               <br />
               formally gave the Government its conﬁdence 
               <br />
               after the announcement of this pclicy, and 
               <br />
               although I have no desire to strain terms, it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dam</span> appear to me that this House did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com.</span> 
               <br />
               mit itself to the principle of a union of the 
               <br />
               colonies if found practicable. That is my 
               <br />
               new, air, of the relations of this House to 
               <br />
               the Government after it gave it ex ressly its 
               <br />
               conﬁdence. Other members of t e House 
               <br />
               take another view of that matter, they do 
               <br />
               not think themselves committed even to the 
               <br />
               principle, and they certainly are not to the 
               <br />
               details of the scheme. (Hear.) After the 
               <br />
               Coalition was formed an incident occurred, 
               <br />

               <br />
               An intercolonial excursion was proposed and 
               <br />

               worthy citizen of Montreal, when went up 
               <br />
               a day or two in advance of the Montreal

               <br />
               —meaning the maritime delegates. I 
               <br />

               <br />
               they were, as a body, as able and accom-

               <br />
               of the former Opposition, and the former

               <br />
