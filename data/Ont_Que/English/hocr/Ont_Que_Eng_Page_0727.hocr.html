               <br />
               made in this House only last session, on the 
               <br />
               announcement of this Coalition, he stated 
               <br />
               that he could make no complaint as to the 
               <br />

               contradiction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">course</span> I took then, he 
               <br />
               has a right to blame me. But so long as I 
               <br />
               am carrying out in good faith the pledges I 
               <br />
               gave to the country, to my supporters, and to 
               <br />
               this House, it is not from that honorable gen-

               tleman at all events that any charge against

               union of all the colonies has failed. I totally 
               <br />
               deny it. (Hear, hear.) I am not prepared 
               <br />
               to admit—I do not believe—that the repre-

               will reject it. When they do so, itwill be

               time enough for the honorable gentleman to

               assert that the scheme has failed. Strange

               stranger still would it be were the promoters
