               Britain and her colonies, it by no means 
               <br />
               follows that it admits of extension to this 
               <br />
               case. If the vaguely stated powers of our 
               <br />
               so-called Federation are to be merely nomi- 
               <br />
               nal, they will be insuﬂicient; if not nominal, 
               <br />
               they will be excessive. Either way, the 
               <br />
               United States idea of an attempted precise 
               <br />
               statement of the powers meant to be given 
               <br />
               and used, is the true one. What, then, is 
               <br />
               the system adopted in the United States, as 
               <br />
               regards these relations between the Federal 
               <br />
               power and the several states? There are 
               <br />
               two leading principles, and very sound prin- 
               <br />
               ciples, that pervade it. In the ﬁrst place the 
               <br />
               United States, by its Constitution, guarantees 
               <br />
               to every state in the union a republican form 
               <br />
               of government ; by which is meant a Consti- 
               <br />
               tution. in the main, analogous to that of the 
               <br />
               United States—an elective executive, an 
               <br />
               elective second branch, an elective popular 
               <br />
               branch—the whole without what we here 
               <br />
               call responsible government. This is what 
               <br />
               everybody understands as the republican sys- 
               <br />
               tem. Accordingly, just the same sort of 
               <br />
               thing in principle and in all its great outlines 
               <br />
               as the Constitution of the United States, is 
               <br />
               the Constitution of each separate state of the 
               <br />
               union. And in the second place, along with 
               <br />
               this uniformity in principle and outlines 
               <br />
               between the Constitution of the United States 
               <br />
               and those of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> states, there is 
               <br />
               established a very exact system of what I may 
               <br />
               call limited state autonomy. The state, 
               <br />
               within its certain range of subjects, does what 
               <br />
               it likes, and is as free to act as the United 
               <br />
               States; it has its own functions, and within 
               <br />
               the limits of those functions nobody controls 
               <br />
               it. The United States have their special 
               <br />
               functions also, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">within</span> the range of those 
               <br />
               functions can, in turn, control everything. 
               <br />
               The respective judiciary systems of the state 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1nd</span> of the United States, are further so con- 
               <br />
               trived as to be the most perfect check that 
               <br />
               can well be imagined to secure the smooth 
               <br />
               and steady working of this Federal national 
               <br />
               machinery. It is a complex piece of machine- 
               <br />
               _ry,if you will ; there are many delicate parts 
               <br />
               mit, one depending nicely upon another; 
               <br />
               but, upon the whole, it has worked pretty 
               <br />
               well for many years, and may go on working 
               <br />
               pretty well for many more.

               fastened itself on the system of the United 
               <br />
               States at all. It is not even as yet adopted 
               <br />
               by nearly all the individual states, but only 
               <br />
               by some of them. It is an excrescenee 
               <br />
               which the founders of the United States 
               <br />
               system never, I fancy, thought of, or in all

               human probalility they would have expressly 
               <br />
               provided against it. (Hear, hear.) But 
               <br />
               now, sir, what is the system we are going to 
               <br />
               adept according to these resolutions ? What 
               <br />
               are the relations to be established between 
               <br />
               our general and local governments? We 
               <br />
               are told to take for granted that no clashing 
               <br />
               of interest or feeling need be feared; that 
               <br />
               the Federal union offered us in name will 
               <br />
               be a legislative union in reality. Yet, who- 
               <br />
               ever dislikes the notion of a legislative union 
               <br />
               is assured it will be nothing of the sort. Now, 
               <br />
               sir, I do not believe that you can have all 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advntages</span> of these two systems com- 
               <br />
               bined in one. (Hear, hear.) A Legislative 
               <br />
               union is one thing; a Federal union is an- 
               <br />
               other. The same system cannot be both at 
               <br />
               once. You cannot devise a system that 
               <br />
               shall have all the advantages of the one and ‘ 
               <br />
               of the other; but it is quite possible that 
               <br />
               you may devise one that will combine the 
               <br />
               chief disadvantages of both, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> is, I 
               <br />
               fear, pretty much what this system does. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) ‘ Let me ﬁrst take one feature 
               <br />
               of the scheme, or, I might say, one absence 
               <br />
               of a feature from the scheme—the non- 
               <br />
               provision of anything like provincial consti- 
               <br />
               tutions. We are not told about them; they 
               <br />
               are kept back completely in the dark; it is 
               <br />
               part of the scheme that we are not to know 
               <br />
               what it means them to be. (Laughter.) It 
               <br />
               is part of the scheme, too, from all appear- 
               <br />
               ance, that they may not be at all alike. 
               <br />
               For anything I can see, Nova Scotia will 
               <br />
               have a right under this scheme to devise a 
               <br />
               system of responsible government, with a 
               <br />
               cabinet and two branches of the legislature. 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, if it pleases, may have only 
               <br />
               ( ne legislative body, with or without respon- 
               <br />
               sible government. So may the Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island people have anything they 
               <br />
               like; and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peorile</span> of Newfoundland may 
               <br />
               do what they like, and so may we in Canada. 
               <br />
               Lower Canada may even have a constitution 
               <br />
               of one kind, and Upper Canada one of a 
               <br />
               totally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> kind. There may be no 
               <br />
               two of our six or more local constitutions 
               <br />
               framed on the same model. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It seems to he meant that these constitutions 
               <br />
