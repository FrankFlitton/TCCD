               Now, Mr. SPEAKER, as I said a moment 
               <br />
               ago, these were the opinions of all French- 
               <br />
               Canadians, and, with reference to this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, I cannot imagine anything to justify 
               <br />
               the change of opinion which has manifested 
               <br />
               itself amongst a certain number of French 
               <br />
               Canadian members and our Catholic ministers 
               <br />
               If it be true that a Catholic cannot adopt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e.</span>

               principle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,divorce,</span> and if we are in coe—

               science bound to oppose it in our capacity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> 
               <br />
               legislators, by voting against every measure 
               <br />
               tendingto sanction it, I ask how we can vote 
               <br />
               for a resolution purporting to vest in the Fed- 
               <br />
               eral Legislature the power of legislating on 
               <br />
               the subject? The hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Montluç—</span>

               rency, in the course of his speech in this
