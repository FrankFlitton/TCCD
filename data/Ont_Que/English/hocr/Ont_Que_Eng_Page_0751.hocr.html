               House and to the country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gﬂear,</span> hear.) 
               <br />
               In my opinion, the honorabe gentlemen 
               <br />
               would have shown a little more dignity and 
               <br />
               self-respect had they not thus exposed them- 
               <br />
               selves to the taunts of their own friends. 
               <br />
               But I cannot believe that the House will 
               <br />
               consent to be led away by the dexterous man- 
               <br />
               agement of the Hon. Attorney General West 
               <br />
               —by the ﬁctitious indignation which he is 
               <br />
               always ready to summon to his assistance, 
               <br />
               and with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Awhich</span> he has burst upon the House 
               <br />
               to-day. In respect to the factiousness of 
               <br />
               the Opposition, I repeat that I never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wit—</span> 
               <br />
               nessed in this House such a spectacle as 
               <br />
               that which has just been displayed by hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side. Never, in my 
               <br />
               life, did I hear a strong government rising 
               <br />
               in its place, and upon a question of this mag- 
               <br />
               nitude, involving the dearest interests of 
               <br />
               the country, exclaiming—“ You shall accept 
               <br />
               the scheme as a whole; you shall not even 
               <br />
               have the opportunity ot" moving a single 
               <br />
               amendment.” The honorable gentleman, 
               <br />
               sir, treated as an absurd proposition that of 
               <br />
               the honorable member for North Ontario 
               <br />
               —which is also the desire of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces—for a legislative union, with 
               <br />
               guarantees for the laws, language and reli- 
               <br />
               gion of the inhabitants of Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               instead of a Federal union. But, air, is it 
               <br />
               not the case that a great many members of 
               <br />
               this House, nay, some in the Administration, 
               <br />
               would prefer that to the proposed scheme of 
               <br />
               Federation ? Is it not also the case that in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, Hon. Mr. HOWE has set his face 
               <br />
               against_Federation, and is a strong advocate 
               <br />
               of legislative union, which the honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite treat as an absurdity. 
               <br />
               Well, sir, whether it is an absurdity or not, 
               <br />
               every honorable member of this House ought 
               <br />
               to have an opportunity to put his views on 
               <br />
               record, and of saying—“ I want a legislative 
               <br />
               union, and not a Federation; I want an 
               <br />
               elective, and not a nominative Council.”
