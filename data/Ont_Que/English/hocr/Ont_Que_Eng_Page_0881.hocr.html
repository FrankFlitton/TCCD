               the selection of the future form of Govern-

               ment for Canada, when we shall emerge 
               <br />
               from the colonial condition. I am free to 
               <br />
               admit that I do not participate in the illu- 
               <br />
               sions of certain persons in respect to the 
               <br />
               magniﬁcent destinies of the empiro to be 
               <br />
               founded by us in North America, and that 
               <br />
               I am far from believingthatitwould be to our 
               <br />
               advantage. I am opposed to the scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, because Ideny that this House has 
               <br />
               power to change the political constitution of 
               <br />
               the country, as it is now proposed to do, 
               <br />
               without appealing to the people and obtain- 
               <br />
               ing their views on a matter of such impor- 
               <br />
               tance. These are the principal reasons which 
               <br />
               induce me to Oppose the scheme brought 
               <br />
               down by the Government. But these are 
               <br />
               not all; I have yet many other considera- 
               <br />
               tions to urge. The gate of the future 
               <br />
               destinies of the country was opened when 
               <br />
               this scheme was laid before us, and I too am 
               <br />
               desirous of penetrating within its portals. I 
               <br />
               have said that the new organization which 
               <br />
               it is wished to establish here decs not suit 
               <br />
               either our resources or our wants. It would 
               <br />
               appear that we cannot attain in Canada a 
               <br />
               reasonable limit as regards the administra- 
               <br />
               tion of public aﬂhirs. Our system is not 
               <br />
               found to be extravagant enough, and it is 
               <br />
               wished to substitute for it one still more 
               <br />
               costly. Our neighbors have established <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an!</span> 
               <br />
               economical political system, which is much 
               <br />
               more advantageous to them than ours would 
               <br />
               be to any country. We pay here much 
               <br />
               more than is paid in the United States, 
               <br />
               although that peeple is inﬁnitely richer than 
               <br />
               we are. If we prepare a list of the salaries 
               <br />
               paid to the governors of the states in the 
               <br />

               to exist to our disadvantage. Here is a

               here to the mayors of our great cities. 
               <br />
               The State of New York, which is by itself

               more rich and populous than the whole

               <br />
               Governor. I will not compare this salary

               with that of our Governor, amounting to 
               <br />

               found that the latter receive higher salaries

               than the Governor of the State of New 
               <br />

               more rich and more populous than Canada, 
               <br />
               only pays 3l,800 to her Governor. If the 
               <br />
               salaries are comparatively small in the United 
               <br />
               States, it is because it was understood there 
               <br />
               that good administration of public aﬁ'airs 
               <br />
               might be obtained by the practice of a wise 
               <br />
               economy, without that display of luxury 
               <br />
               which is ruining us here. Another com— 
               <br />
               parison, on a smaller scale, might be made 
               <br />
               between the State of New York and Canada, 
               <br />
               in respect of another matter. It is this :— 
               <br />
               The State of New York possesses magniﬁ- 
               <br />
               cent canals, which cost her an enormous 
               <br />
               price; but the revenue produced by them 
               <br />
               has paid their cost, whilst here our canals, 
               <br />
               which also cost us very dear, do not even 
               <br />
               pay the interest of the debt which was 
               <br />
               contracted for their construction, and that 
               <br />
               is a point of difference by no means of small 
               <br />
               magnitude. The State of New York con- 
               <br />
               tracted a further debt lor the enlargement of 
               <br />
               her canals after the revenue produced by 
               <br />
               them had paid off that which had been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contracted</span> for their construction; and the 
               <br />
               revenue which they yield is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁcient</span> not 
               <br />
               only to pay the interest of that debt, but 
               <br />
               also to create a sinking fund which will
