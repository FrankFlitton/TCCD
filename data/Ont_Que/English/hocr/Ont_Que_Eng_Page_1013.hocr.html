               I charged the hon. gentleman with assum-

               ing that the question now before the House 
               <br />
               was speciﬁcally the one on which he agitated 
               <br />

               <br />
               voted in 1862. I happen to have placed in 
               <br />
               my hands the report of what took place 
               <br />
               when the subject of a Federal union was 
               <br />
               before the House, in 1858. Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               GALT having put the resolution before 
               <br />

               <br />

               lation, as an amendment to it. There he put 
               <br />
               the two propositions in distinct juxtaposition, 
               <br />

               the measure which he was then contending 
               <br />

               <br />
               he did signify his willingness to accept the 
               <br />
               proposition of a Canadian Federation, if it 
               <br />
               was concurred in by any considerable num— 
               <br />
               ber of the re resentatives from Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. But w at I now allude to is what 
               <br />
               took lace in 1858, when, instead of accept- 
               <br />
               ing on. Mr. GALT’s proposition to Federate 
               <br />
               all the provinces, he puta motion in amend- 
               <br />
               ment to it, showing that in 1858, as in 1859, 
               <br />
               he was not willing to consider that question 
               <br />
               as a means of settling the Canadian difﬁculty. 
               <br />
               But I think the honorable gentleman, though 
               <br />
               he was more or less successful in answer- 
               <br />
               ing the honorable member for Peel, utterly 
               <br />
               failed to meet the very cogent reasoning of 
               <br />
               my honorable friend from North Ontario. 
               <br />
               I hold as strongly as any member of this 
               <br />
               House to the doctrine of representation as 
               <br />
               contradistinguished from the doctrine of 
               <br />
               delegation. We are here commissioned by 
               <br />
               our constituents to do all that may be done 
               <br />
               under the Constitution under which we are 
               <br />
               sent here to legislate. But I hold that the 
               <br />
               change of the Constitution is something 
               <br />
               beyond our functions; that the represent- 
               <br />
               ative elected to administer the existing 
               <br />
               Constitution has no right to vote for the 
               <br />
               subversion of that Constitution. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) That is the doctrine which I hold, 
               <br />
               and I think honorable gentlemen will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               it exceedingly diﬂicult to controvert it. 
               <br />
               Then it has been said that there can be 
               <br />
               no possible occasion of a peeling to the 
               <br />
