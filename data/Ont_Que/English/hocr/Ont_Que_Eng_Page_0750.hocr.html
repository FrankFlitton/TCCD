               charging it with wasting the time of the

               <br />

               according to the agreement. And new, air, 
               <br />
               we are witnessing the extraordinary spec- 
               <br />
               tacle of a Government moving the “ previous 
               <br />

               <br />
               Well, indeed, might the hou. member for 
               <br />
               Carleton (Mr. POWELL) ask if there could 
               <br />
               be found a precedent for such a course! 
               <br />
               Hen. gentlemen who can accomplish such a 
               <br />
               thing as the “ double shufﬂe” can never 
               <br />
               be much embarrassed for the want of a 
               <br />
               precedent. They who have so long, by 
               <br />
               means of parliamentary tricks, succeeded in 
               <br />
               maintaining their position, are now inventing 
               <br />
               a new dodge in order to choke oﬁ' discussion 
               <br />
               on this question. Already, sir, have we 
               <br />
               seen, on one celebrated occasion—in the 
               <br />
               Corrigan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case-the</span> Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               West rising in his place and moving a 
               <br />
               resolution, and afterwards inviting his own 
               <br />
               followers to vote against it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> 
               <br />
               And now, following a similar course, he is 
               <br />
               proposing the “ previous question," the 
               <br />
               object of which is, in ordinary parliamentary 
               <br />
               practice, to prevent a vote being taken on 
               <br />
               the main proposition. Whenever an hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman does not want to vote in favor of 
               <br />
               the question before the House, and dares 
               <br />
               not vote against it, he moves or gets a 
               <br />
               friend to move the “ previous question,” 
               <br />
               which is that the question he now put, and 
               <br />
               votes against it. (Hear, hear.) Such is 
               <br />
               the invariable practice in England, where 
               <br />
               parliamentary usage is better known than in 
               <br />
               this country, and we here ﬁnd a govern-

               government, as my honorable friend says-— 
               <br />
               a government which boasts of having an 
               <br />
               immense majority. and of having the power 
               <br />
               to carry such measures as it pleases. It is 
               <br />
               such a government as this, I say, which is 
               <br />
               dragging its supporters still deeper through 
               <br />
               the mire—which is saying to them : “ You 
               <br />
               shall vote fdl' the scheme without putting 
               <br />
               your views on record, and without giving 
               <br />
               the people an opportunity of expressing their 
               <br />
               opinion in the usual constitutional manner.” 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But what do they gain by 
               <br />
               such a course? They acknowledge it will 
               <br />
               not stop discussion. And thus they will not 
               <br />
               gain a single hour or a single minute in point 
               <br />
               of time. But this they will gain—if their 
               <br />
               supporters are blind enough to follow them
