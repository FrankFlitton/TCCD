               entirely defenceless; but I apprehend that 
               <br />
               there are certain points in the country which 
               <br />
               could be so fortiﬁed that they could be held 
               <br />
               against any foe. While so held, the rest of 
               <br />
               the country would probably be under the con-

               remain as we were or be absorbed in the

               <br />

               defence as to enable it to resist the aggression 
               <br />
               of the United States.‘ I want to know whe- 
               <br />
               ther with two and a half millions of people, 
               <br />
               we could cope with an army of millions—be- 
               <br />
               cause the United States have shown that they 
               <br />
               are capable of raising such an army—or make 
               <br />
               fortiﬁcations that could resist it. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The Hon. Provincial Secretary has 
               <br />
               spoken on the ﬂoor of Parliament as well as 
               <br />
               to the electors in the country, to the effect 
               <br />
               that it was retrenchment we needed more than 
               <br />
               constitutional changes; and yet now he says 
               <br />
               that the people are not to have one word to 
               <br />
               say in reference to these vital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changes</span> thatare 
               <br />
               proposed, and the vastly increased expenditure 
               <br />
               that is to take place. In addressing this 
               <br />
               House in 1862, he said—“ The ﬁnances of the 
               <br />
               country are growing worse and worse, and a 
               <br />
               check must be applied. It was chieﬂy for this 
               <br />
               cause that the people of Upper Canada desired 
               <br />
               a change in the representation.” Now, I 
               <br />
               should like to understand how a union with 
               <br />
               800,000 people, with immense expenditure, is 
               <br />
               going to improve our ﬁnances, which, accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the honorable gentleman, are “ growing 
               <br />
               worse and worse.” (Hear, hear.) I have not 
               <br />
               heard in what has been yet said on the subject 
               <br />
               of these resolutions, anything to show me how 
               <br />
               this great increase and improvement is going 
               <br />
               to take place by a union with less than a mil- 
               <br />
               lion of people; but arguments for the union, 
               <br />
               when directed merely to the material <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> 
               <br />
               that will be served by it, are arguments ten-fold 
               <br />
               stronger in favor of union with the United 
               <br />
               States. (Hear, hear.) The arguments of 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen all point that way, because 
               <br />
               they say it is to our interest to be jomed with 
               <br />
               the 800,000 people of the provinces, who will 
               <br />
               furnish us with a market for our produce, 
               <br />
               when we have on the other side of the line 
               <br />
               thirty millions of people to furnish us 3 mar- 
               <br />
               ket. Arguments of this kind, urging the 
               <br />
               measure because our material interests will be 
               <br />
               promoted by it, are, therefore, arguments for 
               <br />
               union with the United States rather than with 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces; but union with the 
               <br />
               United States, I hope, will never take place. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Still I cannot help believing 
               <br />
               that this is the tendency of the measure ; for 
               <br />
               when we have a legislature in each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province,</span> 
               <br />
               with powers cobrdinate with those of the 
               <br />
               Federal Legislature—or if not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possessing</span> co- 
               <br />
               ordinate powers, having the same right at least 
               <br />
               to legislate upon some subjects as the General 
               <br />
               Legislature—there are certain to arise disagree- 
               <br />
               ments between the Local and the General 
               <br />
               Legislature, which will lead the people to de- 
               <br />
               mand changes that may destroy our connection
