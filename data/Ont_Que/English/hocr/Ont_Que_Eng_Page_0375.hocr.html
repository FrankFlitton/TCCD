               ourselves sell our ﬂour to the Lower Provin— 
               <br />
               ces ? For the simple reason that, instead of 
               <br />
               having to pay four millions four hundred and 
               <br />
               forty-seven thousand dollars to the United 
               <br />
               States, they would have to pay us ﬁve millions 
               <br />
               of dollars, and they would therefore refuse to 
               <br />
               buy from us. There is no such thing as sen- 
               <br />
               timent in matters of business; men buy in the 
               <br />
               cheapest market. The Gulf Provinces ,will 
               <br />
               buy their ﬂour from the United States so long 
               <br />
               as they can obtain it at a lower price there 
               <br />
               than in Canada; and the fact that they do 
               <br />
               obtain it cheaper from the United States is 
               <br />
               clearly demonstrated by their buying from 
               <br />
               the Americans and not from us. But a single 
               <br />
               glance at the ma will account ibr the differ- 
               <br />
               ence in price. do not believe that the In- 
               <br />
               tercolonial Railway can be advantageously 
               <br />
               employed for the transportof ﬂour from Rivière 
               <br />
               du Loup to Halifax; the cost of transport 
               <br />
               over ﬁve hundred miles of railway would be 
               <br />
               too great; the water route must therefore be 
               <br />
               adopted. Kingston and Halifax are in the 
               <br />
               same latitude, between the 44th and 45th 
               <br />
               parallel. From Kingston the St. Lawrence 
               <br />
               ﬂows undeviatingl towards the north—east, 
               <br />
               and falls into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gulf</span> in the 50th degree of 
               <br />
               north latitude. From that point, in order to 
               <br />
               reach the Gut of Cause, you must not only 
               <br />
               make ﬁve degrees of southing, but also make 
               <br />
               nearly three degrees of longitude to the east, 
               <br />
               and then nearly three more towards the west 
               <br />
               before reaching Halifax. Moreover, the navi- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«ration</span> is more or less dangerous throughout. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">îVhen</span> you compare this circuitous route with 
               <br />
               the far more direct one of the United States, 
               <br />
               it is quite eas to understand why the United 
               <br />
               States can sel even our wheat to the Gulf 
               <br />
               Provinces at lower prices than we ourselves 
               <br />
               are able to do. I have attempted to reduce 
               <br />
               the commercial advantages we are promised to 
               <br />
               their proper proportion. I will now endeavor 
               <br />
               to show that we can secure every one of these 
               <br />
               advantages without the Confederation. I 
               <br />
               shall cite, for that purpose, the very words of 
               <br />

               If we look at the results of the tree interchange 
               <br />

               <br />
               _we shall ﬁnd that our trade with them increased,

               <br />
               shews in the most conclusive manner that we

               <br />

               <br />
               It is under this head of commercial advan-

               tages that the Intercolonial Railway ﬁtly 
               <br />
               comes in. The Honorable President of the 
               <br />

               not. The hon. minister, in the same speech,

               ives an answer to the representatives from

               <br />
               last year by the Honorable Minister of Agri—

               <br />

               <br />
               us the means of building the railway with- 
               <br />
               out having recourse to Confederation. To 
               <br />
               sum up all in few words: all the ad 
               <br />
               are negative, that is to say, Confederation will 
               <br />
               do no harm to our interests, military or com- 
               <br />
               mercial, but neither do they require it. As to 
               <br />
               the inconveniences of which it may be pro- 
               <br />
               ductive, I leave them to the judgment of the 
               <br />
               House, who will decide whether they are posi- 
               <br />
               tive. I am asked: “ If you will have nothing to
