               of view. (Hear, hear.) And the Hon. 
               <br />
               President of the Council voted, as I did, 
               <br />
               against the introduction of the elective prin- 
               <br />
               ciple, and in favor of the retention of the 
               <br />
               nominative principle—not, however, for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the view he entertains now, in favor of a 
               <br />
               nominated Legislative Council, was the view 
               <br />
               be entertained then, and the change is one 
               <br />
               which I will be glad to see brought about. 
               <br />
               But it is a change of which the people at the 
               <br />
               last election had no idea. And the alteration 
               <br />
               in the minds of public men has been so great, 
               <br />
               within a short space of time, that I say we 
               <br />
               have a right to think and pause and reﬂect. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Look at the programme 
               <br />
               which was brought down on this subject by 
               <br />
               the constitutional committee moved for by 
               <br />
               the Hon. President of the Council. The 
               <br />
               part of the report of that committee which 
               <br />
               was most opposed was the Confederation of 
               <br />
               British North America. And it is well 
               <br />
               known that what the Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂered,</span> 
               <br />
               at the time of its formation, was that the 
               <br />
               lesser scheme of a Federation of the Canadas 
               <br />
               should go ﬁrst, and the larger scheme of a 
               <br />
               Federation of all the colonies aiterwards. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Thy</span> were ﬁrst of all to try to have a Federal 
               <br />
               Government for Canada alone, and then to 
               <br />
               extend that, as circumstances permitted, to 
               <br />
               the whole of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North,</span> American 
               <br />
               Colonies. Well, in the short space of little 
               <br />
               over three months, men’s minds were so 
               <br />
               changed that the Federation of the Canadas 
               <br />
               ceased to be talked of, and the Confeder- 
               <br />
               - tion of the whole provinces came up in 
               <br />
               its stead. That scheme for the Confederation 
               <br />
               of British North America, which a short 
               <br />
               time ago seemed to have but very few sup- 
               <br />
               porters, was brought suddenly before us 
               <br />
               with a large number of supporters. How do 
               <br />
               we know that there may not be a change 
               <br />
               again in a short space of time—that the 
               <br />
               whole system with which we are now deal- 
               <br />
               ing, and on which hon. gentlemen have 
               <br />
               placed their views before the country, may 
               <br />
               not be changed again, without the peeple, 
               <br />
               who are said to be so satisﬁed with this 
               <br />
               scheme, having had the matter placed before 
               <br />
               them for consideration, or the opportunity of 
               <br />
               voting for or against the scheme ? Therefore 
               <br />
               I believe it would be wiser, better, and more 
               <br />
               for the interests of the whole of this country

               people in the constitutional mode of a general

               <br />

               men, of creating dissatisfaction hereafter. 
               <br />
               And I say that for the sake of carrying this 
               <br />
               scheme in the Lower Provinces, it is desir- 
               <br />
               able to take this course. What is the reason 
               <br />
               of the suspicion entertained with regard to 
               <br />
               this scheme by the Lower Provinces ? They 
               <br />
               say that the Government of Canada is urging 
               <br />
               it so rapidly, that there must be some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arriére</span> 
               <br />
               pensée—that there is something in it which 
               <br />
               will place her in a better position—that they 
               <br />
               are therefore ressing it upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of 
               <br />
               Canada and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oiP</span> the Lower Provinces, without 
               <br />
               giving them an opportunity of considering 
               <br />
               it fairly. One of the things madeuse of in 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces is that our interest in 
               <br />
               the matter is so great, and we are entangled 
               <br />
               in so many diﬁiculties, that we wish the other 
               <br />
               provinces united with us in order that, on 
               <br />
               their credit united with ours, we may be able 
               <br />
               to incur greater liabilities, and carry out our 
               <br />
               views as to public works, the beneﬁt of which 
               <br />
               we will gain exclusively, although the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces assume their share of the liability. 
               <br />
               For the present, therefore, unless by a great 
               <br />
               stretch of power on the part of the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament, it will be impossible to force it 
               <br />
               on the Lower Provinces. They say that 
               <br />
               Canada, pressing it in that way, must have 
               <br />
               some ulterior object in view, which does not 
               <br />
               distinctly appear. Can we suppose for a 
               <br />
               moment that the position of the gentlemen 
               <br />
               going to England will be, that they will 
               <br />
               press the Imperial Parliament to pass this 
               <br />
               measure, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coûte</span> que coûte, whether the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces like it or not, urging that as 
               <br />
               Canada possesses the larger population—— 
               <br />
               two-thirds of the whole—if she desires to 
               <br />
               have it the others must have it, whether 
               <br />
               they will or not. If that policy were ur- 
               <br />
               sued, it would be necessary, ﬁrst of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all:</span> to 
               <br />
               deprive them of their constitutions, and then 
               <br />
               to declare that they must unite with us— 
               <br />
               that the will of the majority should over— — 
               <br />
               rule the wishes of the minority, exactly 
               <br />
               as in the United States, where everything 
               <br />
               depends on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will‘of</span> the majority, and the
