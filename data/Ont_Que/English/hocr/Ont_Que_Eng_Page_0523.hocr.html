               ever. (Hear, hear.) When a politician, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, in the United States, who is 
               <br />
               obnoxious to the ill-will of any large body of 
               <br />
               the people, is there elected to be Governor 
               <br />
               of his state, the halo of his election sur- 
               <br />
               rounds him with a something of political 
               <br />
               glory that throws into shade any stains on 
               <br />
               his political reputation. But if the governors 
               <br />
               of the several states of the American Union 
               <br />
               were appointed from Washington, do you 
               <br />
               think the people would put up with the 
               <br />
               results of such appointment, as they now do 
               <br />
               with those of their own choice; when they 
               <br />
               might feel that the man was even a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">despised,</span> 
               <br />
               dishonest man, and his appointment as well 
               <br />
               an insult as a wrong? Who does not know 
               <br />
               that our chief public men of all parties have 
               <br />
               been so assailed, as to be held at this moment 
               <br />
               at a painfully low value by the large section 
               <br />
               of our people who have differed from their 
               <br />
               views? I do not say that they have deserved 
               <br />
               this fate, but the fact is undeniable that 
               <br />
               they have met it. Let any one of our dozen 
               <br />
               or twenty most prominent Canadian politi- 
               <br />
               cians be named Lieutenant-Governor of Up- 
               <br />
               per or of Lower Canada, would net a large 
               <br />
               and powerful class of the community in 
               <br />
               either case to be governed, be very likely to 
               <br />
               resent the nomination as an insult? Do not 
               <br />
               tell me that we are entering upon a new era, 
               <br />
               that all such things are passed away, that 
               <br />
               we are to have a political millennium, by 
               <br />
               virtue of this Confederation? Come what 
               <br />
               may, we are going to have pretty sharp con- 
               <br />
               tests for place and power in the future as in 
               <br />
               the past. No matter over what colony ap- 
               <br />
               pointed, or from what colony coming, a lien- 
               <br />
               tenant-governor will have hard cards to play, 
               <br />
               and will have very much to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put</span> up with from 
               <br />
               the people over whom he is set, on this 
               <br />
               mere score of his past political exploits. 
               <br />
               And he will not ﬁnd it easy, either, to get 
               <br />
               along without exciting a good deal of ill- 
               <br />
               feeling, as he goes. He has been known as 
               <br />
               a politician, and will be held to be favorable 
               <br />
               or unfavorable to this or that party in the 
               <br />
               province he governs. He will have stepped 
               <br />
               into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> as a statesman of the Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation. No man so placed will be able to blot 
               <br />
               the record of his past, or deny his participa- 
               <br />
               tion in this, that and the other proceeding, 
               <br />
               which his opponent may choose to brand as 
               <br />
               perhaps next to criminal; how then will he 
               <br />
               be able to hold that position of equilibrium 
               <br />
               between political parties, which, if he is not 
               <br />
               to fail utterly in his rôle of governor, he must

               <br />
               sort of distinction between the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clues</span> 
               <br />
               of politicians to grow up under our proposed 
               <br />
               Confederation. There will be those who 
               <br />
               will aim at and get seats in the Federal 
               <br />
               Legislature, and who may be denominated 
               <br />
               the senior or higher class of our politicians. 
               <br />
               It will be from this class that men will get 
               <br />
               into the Federal Executive Council, into 
               <br />
               high-caste judgeships, lieutenant-governor- 
               <br />
               ships, and other high places of the new 
               <br />
               system—“ the chief seats in the synagogue.” 
               <br />
               The lower seats, with their less tem ting 
               <br />
               prizes, will be left to the junior or ower 
               <br />
               class of our politicians. But if anything 
               <br />
               ever so little like responsible government 
               <br />
               is to be carried out in the provinces, while 
               <br />
               the lieutenant-governors must be taken from 
               <br />
               the former of these two classes, the members 
               <br />
               of any cabinets or quasi-cabinets that they 
               <br />
               may have (not to say their provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Prev</span> 
               <br />
               miers even, very likely), must be taken from 
               <br />
               the latter class. Do you mean to tell me that 
               <br />
               a governor chosen from among our politi- 
               <br />
               cians, of what I may call high caste, will put 
               <br />
               up with much of control from a lot oi poli- 
               <br />
               ticians of low caste, sitting at his sham 
               <br />
               council board or forming his sham legisla- 
               <br />
               ture? I fancy he will want to have—and 
               <br />
               will be held by his pe0ple to be wanting to 
               <br />
               have—a vast deal more of power than they 
               <br />
               will like, or than any system ever so little 
               <br />
               free can allow of. And meantime, what of 
               <br />
               the power behind, and nominally above him 
               <br />
               —-the Federal Executive—with its Premier, 
               <br />
               sections, and what not? Once named, he is 
               <br />
               likely to feel every inch a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gommer;</span> might 
               <br />
               perhaps run round to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the‘Premier</span> and Minis-

               try that had named him, and tell them in

               effect, though probably not in so many 
               <br />
               words: “ I am here and you are there. I 
               <br />
               shall be careful not to give you suﬁcient 
               <br />
               cause for so bold a step as my dismissal, but 
               <br />
               there is a good deal I can do. I am here for 
               <br />
               ﬁve years; and your tenure of oﬁice is less 
               <br />
               certain.” He may be drawn into this atti- 
               <br />
               tude by differences growing up between 
               <br />
               himself and them. Or, the Federal Cabinet 
               <br />
               may so change its composition or policy as 
               <br />
               to force such attitude upon him. Why, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, you may have a Lieutenant- 
               <br />
               Governor—say of Lower Canada— in open 
               <br />

               <br />
               with a successor of such Premier; the two,
