               <br />
               hear.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With</span> regard to the proposed resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated</span> at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outset</span> that there were 
               <br />
               portions of the scheme to which I objected, 
               <br />
               and 1 may now, sir, be allowed brieﬂy to 
               <br />
               auvert to them. I would prefer that the 
               <br />
               whole power was concentrated under one head 
               <br />
               by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> union, rather than a Federal 
               <br />
               union. I tear that the machinery will be com- 
               <br />
               plex, and that we will ﬁnd, under the proposed 
               <br />
               system, that the expenses of the Government 
               <br />
               will be much greater than it' we had one 
               <br />
               General Government without these additions 
               <br />
               of local legislatures for each of the provinces. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But lam happy to say that 
               <br />
               the proposed Federal system is not a reﬂex 
               <br />
               ofthe old Federal union of the United States. 
               <br />
               Notwithstanding some honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               have praised the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span> system in the 
               <br />
               States as worthy of imitation, still I think 
               <br />
               our proposed system much to be preferred. 
               <br />
               It dtﬂ'ers in this—the United States Federal 
               <br />
               system was formed from a number of sov- 
               <br />
               ereign states, with sovereign powers, dele- 
               <br />
               gating to a central power just as much or as 
               <br />
               little of their power as they chose; thereby 
               <br />
               the doctrine ot state rights obtained, and, 
               <br />
               as we have seen within the last four years, 
               <br />
               has been the cause of bloodshed and civil 
               <br />
               war, it may be to the probable destruction of 
               <br />
               that Federal union. Our case is exactly the 
               <br />
               reverse. instead of the Central Government 
               <br />
               receiving its power from the different pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, it gives to those pzovinces just as 
               <br />
               much or as little as it chooses. Hear what 
               <br />
               the 45th resolution says—“ ln regard to all 
               <br />

               my mind most devoutly to be desired. (Hear,

               hear.) There are two or three more of the 
               <br />
               points of the resolutions to which I have 
               <br />
               objection. The public lands are placed at 
               <br />
               the disposal of the local legislatures; immi— 
               <br />

               <br />
               gislatures, and the seacoast ﬁsheries are in 
               <br />
               the hands of the local legislatures. These 
               <br />
               are matters common to the whole, and should, 
               <br />
               tor many reasons, be under the control of till 
               <br />
               General Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Theeevarious</span> interests, 
               <br />
               however, are all covered by the 45th resolu- 
               <br />
               tion of the Conference which I have just 
               <br />
               read, and which declares that when eon- 
               <br />
               sistent With the welfare of the General 
               <br />
               Government, their control will be taken from 
               <br />
               the local legislatures. (Hear, hear.) I have, 
               <br />
               as brieﬂy as possible, shewn thatin my opinion. 
               <br />
               in our political and our commercial relations 
               <br />
               we would be beneﬁted by the union of Canada 
               <br />
               with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Maritime</span> Provinces. I have also 
               <br />
               adverted brieﬂy to the objections which I 
               <br />
               hold to the proposed mode of carrying out 
               <br />
               the union. I shall now endeavor to show 
               <br />
               that as a means of defence it is highly desir- 
               <br />
               able. If there is one thing more desirable 
               <br />
               than another, it is to have the whole forces 
               <br />
               of the country under one governing power. 
               <br />
               How might it. fare with us, in case of war or 
               <br />
               invasion, with the provinces disunited? 
               <br />
               Objections could now be made against the 
               <br />
               withdrawal of a portion of the militia from 
               <br />
               one province to the others, without the 
               <br />
               consent of the government of that province, 
               <br />
               and before they could be brought into the 
               <br />
               ﬁeld, valuable time would be lost, red-tapeism 
               <br />
               would stand in the way, and the delay might 
               <br />
               be dangerous. (Hear, hear.) By being united 
               <br />
               and controlled under one head, troops could 
               <br />
               be thrown upon any point attacked, at a 
               <br />
               moment’s notice. Objections have been made 
               <br />
               by hon. gentlemen to any expenditure for 
               <br />
               the purpose ot building <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lortiﬁoatioœ,</span> at pre

               <br />
               but I am satisﬁed there is no reasonable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suit</span> 
               <br />
               that may be required that will be grudgei
