               is stated that we must put forth every

               the whole of the physical laws relating to

               whole of our territory is to be compacted,

               attack, and, if attacked, will be much more 
               <br />
               easily defended. Is not this the most absurd

               sophistry? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Caa</span> paper resolutions change

               <br />
               as it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today?</span> I think, sir, it is generally 
               <br />
               admitted that Canada is unequal to the 
               <br />
               defence of its own frontier against invasion 
               <br />
               from the only quarter from which it is 
               <br />
               apprehended. It is also admitted that the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces are alike unequal to the 
               <br />
               defence of their own frontier. By what 
               <br />
               process then will you demonstrate to me, 
               <br />
               that by adding the frontier of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces to that of Canada, and by adding 
               <br />
               the force of those provinces to our own, 
               <br />
               there will not be the same defencelessness 
               <br />
               as at present? Will there not be the same 
               <br />
               disproportion between the defensive power 
               <br />
               and the object to be defended? (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, in the ﬁrst place I perceive 
               <br />
               no immediate necessity for those constitu- 
               <br />
               tional changes. I think that our present 
               <br />
               Constitution is ample for the wants of the 
               <br />
               people of this country, and that all the didi- 
               <br />
               eulties, either real orimaginary, under which 
               <br />
               we labor, might be solved within the limits 
               <br />
               of our present Constitution. I consider all 
               <br />
               our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dimcnlties</span> to be merely sectional, arising 
               <br />
               neither from differences of religion, of origin,

               the inhabitants of Upper Canada called

               upon to meet the extravagant municipal

               (Hear, hear.) I think you cannot ﬁnd any 
               <br />
               reason for it, except on the supposition that 
               <br />
               they remain united for the purpose of 
               <br />
               maintaining their sectional power and in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence, under a system by which the 
               <br />
               common exchequer is deemed a legitimate 
               <br />
               object of public plunder. Each section 
               <br />
               seems to have always regarded the public 
               <br />
               chest as fair game; and it is undeniable that 
               <br />
               Lower Canada has generally had the best 
               <br />
               of it. These things caused dissatisfaction 
               <br />
               in the minds of peeple from other sections 
               <br />

               from the public chest similar undue advan- 
               <br />
               tages. The remedy for this state of things 
               <br />
               is to deprive the Legislature of the power
