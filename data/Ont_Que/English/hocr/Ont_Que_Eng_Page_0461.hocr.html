               of the House to this extract, as showing how 
               <br />
               the United States have been able to take 
               <br />
               advantage of our isolated condition—our want 
               <br />
               of central power and authority—to gain for 
               <br />
               themselves advantages in the negotiation of 
               <br />
               that treaty, such as they could not have ob- 
               <br />
               tained or even sought, had we been in a 
               <br />
               position to present all the advantages, in 
               <br />
               negotiations with the United States, which 
               <br />
               Canada and the Maritime Provinces as a 
               <br />
               whole could present. Instead of the Ameri- 
               <br />
               can statesmen having to negotiate with the 
               <br />
               separate governments of separate provinces, 
               <br />
               they would have to negotiate with the com- 
               <br />
               bined interests of British North America. 
               <br />
               I read this extract as a very striking one, 
               <br />

               defence question has been alluded to very 
               <br />
               frequently in this debate. I think there 
               <br />
               really cannot be a question that it would be 
               <br />
               for the advantage, not only of Britain, but of 
               <br />
               each one of these provinces, that on such 
               <br />
               subjects as the militia, and on all kindred 
               <br />
               questions, such as those relating to aliens,

               the observance of neutrality and like sub— 
               <br />
               jects, there should be a general and uniform 
               <br />
               action ; that, seeing the action of any one of 
               <br />
               the colonies might involve the parent state 
               <br />
               in war, there should not be separate and 
               <br />
               distinct action, but one uniform action, on 
               <br />
               all that class of national and international 
               <br />
               subjects, throughout the whole of the 
               <br />
               British Provinces. I cannot help thinking 
               <br />
               that in practice an immense advantage would 
               <br />
               be derived from the introduction of such a 
               <br />
               system. It is not my forte, as that of some 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, to speak with regard to the 
               <br />
               defence question. There are other hon.

               members who understand that subject 
               <br />
               thoroughly, and will no doubt deal with it in 
               <br />
               a satisfactory manner. But I cannot help 
               <br />
               thinking that a uniform system of militia 
               <br />
               and marine for British North America would 
               <br />
