               the question of direct taxes ; but must say

               that municipalities having at their disposal

               millions of acres of land, will be something

               When we opposed representation based upon 
               <br />
               population, was it because we feared that the 
               <br />
               majority would pass a tariff weighing une- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">æally</span> on the two sections of the province ? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               as it because we feared they would erect 
               <br />
               no more light-houses in the Gulf or elsewhere ? 
               <br />
               Was it because we feared that Upper C anada,by 
               <br />
               means of its majority, would establish a great- 
               <br />
               er number of post-oﬂices, or increase the rates 
               <br />
               of postage on letters ? N 0, Mr. SPEAKER, it 
               <br />
               was not for any of these reasons; but it was 
               <br />
               because we properly and rightly feared that 
               <br />
               when Upper Canada obtained a larger num- 
               <br />
               ber of representatives in the Legislature than 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, they would invade our rights 
               <br />
               and endanger all that we hold most dear. 
               <br />
               That is what we feared. (Hear, hear.) And 
               <br />
               at the very moment when the Government 
               <br />
               presents a measure securing the safety of all 
               <br />
               our rights and institutions, with guarantees 
               <br />
