               Hon. President of the Council chastised that 
               <br />
               Government for its most triﬂing backslidings; 
               <br />
               and that whenever he threatened, the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment quickly mended its ways? To-day you 
               <br />
               speak of the vast expenditure of the province; 
               <br />
               but you formed part of a Ministry which prom— 
               <br />
               ised wonders to the country, and what did it 
               <br />
               do after all? The facts are there; and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\</span> surely it ill-becomes you to speak of extrav- 
               <br />
               agant expenditure. Hon. gentlemen exclaim— 
               <br />
               “ $40 per head!" They do not, it is true, 
               <br />
               tell us that the high price of molasses is due 
               <br />
               to CARTIER and J. A. MACDONALD—(laugh- 
               <br />
               ter)—but they everywhere assert that these 
               <br />
               gentlemen want to ruin the people, increase 
               <br />
               the taxes, and plunge the country into an 
               <br />
               ocean cf debt. And yet honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite have themselves been in power, and 
               <br />
               notwithstanding all their previous denuncia- 
               <br />
               tions of taxation and extravagant expenditure, 
               <br />
               they were forced to admit the necessity of 
               <br />
               customs duties, and to work out responsible 
               <br />
               government ; they found it necessary to 
               <br />
               retract all they had said in former speeches, 
               <br />
               when they themselves held the reins of power. 
               <br />
               But they did not remain in oﬂice long enough 
               <br />
               to get rid of the old leaven completely, and 
               <br />
               now that they are out of power once more, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd them taking up their former cries. 
               <br />
               We have the honorable members for Chateau- 
               <br />
               guay and Hochelaga, who once had a Con- 
               <br />
               federation scheme of their own, opposing the 
               <br />
               scheme of the Government, simply because it 
               <br />
               did not originate with themselves, and op- 
               <br />
               posing the adoption of any measure-for the 
               <br />
               defence of the country. T'iese honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen stated, through their organ Le 
               <br />
               Pays, that if England desires to retain 
               <br />
               Canada, she should pay for'its defences. This 
               <br />
               is not said so Openly now, but the great wealth 
               <br />
               of the United States, the immense number of 
               <br />
               their guns, ships of war and armies, are used 
               <br />
               as arguments to shew the uselessness of any 
               <br />
               attempt on our part to defend ourselves in 
               <br />
               case of attack, and also to lead the peeple to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that it is better for the country 
               <br />
               not to expend anything for defence. When 
               <br />
               the CARTIER-MACDONALD Government was 
               <br />
               defeated on a question of loyalty towards the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government, the wholo Opposition 
               <br />
               voted against the principle of organizing the 
               <br />
               militia for our defence. The leaders of the 
               <br />
               Opposition then voted unﬂinchingly against 
               <br />
               a Militia law; but three or four days after, 
               <br />
               when they had succeeded in taking the place 
               <br />
               of those whom they had defeated, they them- 
               <br />
               selves voted, without seruple or hesitation, 
               <br />
               $600,000 for the organization of the militia.

               not want Confederation, but they admit that 
               <br />
               there is need of a remedy for our sectional

               They keep it all to themselves, shut up in 
               <br />
               their own minds, as they did with the cele- 
               <br />
               brated budget of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Chateauguay, which was to be the cure for all 
               <br />
               our ﬁnancial diﬂiculties, but which never saw 
               <br />
               the light. Eighteen months of incubation did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span>

               <br />
               ment should not succeed in inducing all the 
               <br />
               provinces to accept the scheme, they, at all 
               <br />
               events, will have kept their word and kept 
               <br />
               the faith which is due to a treaty solemnly con- 
               <br />
               tracted between the Provinces of British North 
               <br />
               America. The hon. member for Chateau- 
               <br />
               guay (Hon. Mr. HOLTON) has told us that he 
               <br />
               had received a telegraphic despatch, by which 
               <br />
               he had positive information that the people of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces had rejected Confeder— 
               <br />
               ation, and that they had pronounced against 
               <br />
               it in New Brunswick. But what does all 
               <br />
               that amount to ? Ought we on that account 
               <br />
               also to reject the scheme of the Government? 
               <br />
               Are we not bound to this scheme by the word 
               <br />
               of our Ministers ? No, we hold to this 
               <br />
               great scheme of Confederation, and we want 
               <br />
               no little schemes such as are proposed by the 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House—schemes by which they would appoint 
               <br />
               little judges and divide Canada into little dis— 
               <br />
               tricts. The Opposition, it is true, have 
               <br />
               created a certain amount of distrust in this 
               <br />
               scheme among the people, by harping on 
               <br />
               direct taxation, and declaring that Canada 
               <br />
               will be obliged to tax herself in order to pur 
               <br />
               chase and defend the territory of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces. They hope by these means to 
               <br />
               gain the conﬁdence of the people, and to 
               <br />
               return to power; but even if they succeeded, 
               <br />
               they would be obliged to do later what they 
               <br />
               have already done, what they now con— 
               <br />
               demn, and what the men now in power are 
               <br />
               desirous of doing in the interest of the people; 
               <br />
               they would be obliged to organize the defences 
               <br />
               of the country, as the Government propose to 
               <br />
               do, and as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Imperial</span> Government desire. 
               <br />
               At the present moment we have to choose one 
               <br />
