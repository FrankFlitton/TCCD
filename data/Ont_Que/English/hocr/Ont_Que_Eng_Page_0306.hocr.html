               <br />
               The whole thing, I say again, proceeds from

               that individual, who has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[sown</span> to the storm

               however, that it will be found the most ad-

               is what appears to me to be only what is 
               <br />
               reasonable, as applied to the every day trans-

               at least, in these proceedings. (Hear, hear.)

               viewing the question ; and claiming to myself
