               <br />
               I think I said that under Lord METCALF 
               <br />
               there was res nsible government in name 
               <br />

               <br />
               little closer, he will admit that such was the 
               <br />
               case. The consequence was, as I have already 
               <br />
               stated, the resignation of Hon. Messrs. LAPON- 
               <br />

               <br />
               dian party was unbroken. It is true the new 
               <br />
               advisers of Lord METCALF enquetted much 
               <br />
               with that majority to obtain adhesion ; but it 
               <br />
               was in vain. They remained ﬁrm to the 
               <br />
               last, until the general election of 1848 brought 
               <br />
               back the parties to Parliament in much about 
               <br />
               their natural strength. I have already stated 
               <br />
               that I have destroyed my notes, Iand I am

               the motion now before the House, I think it 
               <br />
               desirable to clear myself from the imputation 
               <br />
               of inconsistency in having supported the 
               <br />
               amendments which have been proposed. and 
               <br />
               which the House has rejected. I may state 
               <br />
               that my views as to the desirableness of sub- 
               <br />
               mitting the question to the people are un- 
               <br />
               changed; the plan has been voted down, but no 
               <br />
               argument has been adduced to demonstrate that 
               <br />
               it was wrong in principle, or likely to destroy 
               <br />
               the scheme. I have previously expressed my 
               <br />
               general approval of the Confederation, and that 
               <br />
               my desire was to secure its permanency by 
               <br />
               having its foundation broad and deep in the 
               <br />
               expressed approval of the people. Submission 
               <br />
               of the repose] to them has been refused, and 
               <br />
               the on y question now for me to decide is 
               <br />
               whether I should accept the scheme as it is, 
               <br />
               or vote for its rejection altogether. Under

               Ma. JOLY said—Mr. SPEAKER, when it 
               <br />
               is proposed to change the Constitution of 
               <br />
               the country, it becomes our duty to study 
               <br />
               with the greatest care, and from every dis- 
               <br />
               tinct point of view, the new Constitution 
               <br />
               which it is preposed to substitute for the 
               <br />
               existing one; and in doing so we ought not 
               <br />
               to disdain the experience of past ages
