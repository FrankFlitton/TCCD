               I have been deceived and disappointed in my

               itself to my judgment, and convince me 
               <br />
               it would remove the sectional difﬁculties

               long complained of, it would have re-

               ceived my approval. I had hoped, too, 
               <br />
               and fully believed, that when it came to be 
               <br />
               pronounced upon by the Legislature, it would, 
               <br />
               before ﬁnal adaption, be submitted to the 
               <br />
               people for their approval. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               That this was the Opinion of a large majority 
               <br />
               of the people of Upper Canada., in November 
               <br />
               and December last, is, I think, beyond doubt. 
               <br />
               The local papers in all sections of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada asserted that the Government could 
               <br />
               not take upon itself the fearful responsibility 
               <br />
               of forcing such a measure upon the peeple, 
               <br />
               without asking whether they consented to it 
               <br />
               or not. Allow me, sir, to read an extract 
               <br />
               from one that has accidentally fallen into 
               <br />
               my hands, in order to show the feeling of 
               <br />
               the people of Upper Canada upon this point. 
               <br />
               I am not in the habit of addressing the 
               <br />
               House very often, and when I speak I fear 
               <br />
               I do n0t acquit myself very creditably ; and 
               <br />
               feeling on this occasion an unusual sense of 
               <br />
               responsibility, I am afraid I shall be worse 
               <br />
               than usual, which at all times is very indif- 
               <br />
               ferent. But I am impelled by a sense of 
               <br />
               duty to give my views upon the subject, and 
               <br />
               the House, I am sure, will overlook any 
               <br />
               shortcomings that I may exhibit. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The extract to which I have alluded 
               <br />
               reads as follows :—

               the present or any other Government to make 
               <br />
               such sweeping alterations in the Constitution of 
               <br />
               the country without consulting them. The mem-

               bers of the respective governments were not 
               <br />

               were the members of the various legislatures

               the months of November and December last,

               were full of sentiments like those I have

               quoted ; but, looking over the numbers that 
               <br />
               have appeared since that magnetic or mes- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Provincial Secretary’s Oﬂice, I see that it 
               <br />
               has sung dumb. (Laughter.) I fearlessly 
               <br />
               assert that the Confederation of the British 
               <br />
               North American Provinces has taken no 
               <br />
               strong hold of the public mind of Canada. 
               <br />
               It never was demanded, and I believe as 
               <br />
               certainly as that I am now speaking, that if 
               <br />
               this matter were submitted to the peeple, 
               <br />
               and fully understood by them, they would 
               <br />
               reject it. (Hear, hear.) I have endeavored 
               <br />
               to obtain from the leading men in the riding 
               <br />
               which I have the honor to represent, an ex- 
               <br />
               pression of their Opinions with reference to 
               <br />
               this scheme. At the time the resolutions 
               <br />
               were printed here, I secured from twenty to 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve copies, and mailed them .to my 
               <br />
               constituency, asking an expression of opinion 
               <br />
               as to the propriety of adapting them. Only 
               <br />
               two sent anything like a favorable verdict, 
               <br />
               and all they were able to say in their favor 
               <br />
               was, that they thought the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schem—</span> might 
               <br />
               be advantageous in a national point of 
               <br />
               view, but they feared the expense of 
               <br />
               carrying it out would more than counter- 
               <br />
               balance the advantages. These are the most 
               <br />
               favorable expressions of opinion I have get, 
               <br />

               in toto. Allow me to read an extract from
