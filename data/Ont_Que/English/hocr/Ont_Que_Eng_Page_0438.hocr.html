               know what is the feeling of his constituents

               his constituents desire in respect to it, and

               sponsibility of his vote ? I believe there is 
               <br />
               not. And does any honorable ntleman 
               <br />
               think that if there was to be a disso ution and 
               <br />
               an appeal to the country on this question, the 
               <br />
               elections would turn upon the scheme itself, 
               <br />
               that there would not be individual predilec- 
               <br />
               tions, personal questions, and local questions 
               <br />
               affecting the elections, far more than Confed- 
               <br />
               eration ? And would it not be most anomalous 
               <br />
               to elect a Parliament, the ﬁrst vote ’ven b

               <br />
               business of the new Parliament would be to 
               <br />
               agree upon a Constitution which should 
               <br />
               annihilate itself. There is something so 
               <br />
               anomalous, almost unconstitutional and absurd 
               <br />
               in such a step, that I think it could not com- 
               <br />
               mend itself to the common sense of the

               and views of the country are, and that too 
               <br />
               after an intellioent appreciation of it in all its 
               <br />
               bearings, and Ido not think there is anything 
               <br />
               to be gained, but on the contrary much to be 
               <br />
               imperilled by the expense and delay of an 
               <br />
               election. I know that in my own constituency

               —-not the least important in the province—this 
               <br />

               considerate love of change—not from any 
               <br />
               ardent and temporary impulse or vague aspir-

               <br />
               England or of injury to their interests, but I 
               <br />
               believe the scheme is stamped with their ap- 
               <br />
               proval, because their reason and ju ent 
               <br />
               convince them that it is not only desirab e but

               a necessity of our condition. (Hear, hear.)
