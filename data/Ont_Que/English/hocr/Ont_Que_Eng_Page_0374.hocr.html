               their desire to form more intimate commercial 
               <br />

               vantages which would result from these rela- 
               <br />
               tions as an overwhelming argument in favor 
               <br />
               of Confederation, it is as well to form a proper 
               <br />
               appreciation of those advantages, and see 
               <br />
               whether we cannot secure them without Con- 
               <br />
               federation. The Gulf Provinces possess tim- 
               <br />
               ber, coal and ﬁsheries; our own two reat 
               <br />
               articles of export are timber and w eat. 
               <br />
               With regard to timber, the Gulf Prov- 
               <br />
               inces have no more need of ours than we

               <br />
               chea r than we could import it from the 
               <br />
               Gui Provinces. When this supply becomes 
               <br />
               insufﬁcient to meet our growing wants, it will
