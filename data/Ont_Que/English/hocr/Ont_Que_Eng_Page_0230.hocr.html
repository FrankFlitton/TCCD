               we have not yet had from the ant

               <br />
               the legislative councillors from Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Island are excepted? In that rovince, 
               <br />
               as we know, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leg'slative</span> Coun ' is elec- 
               <br />
               tive, and it is an elected Chamber that is now 
               <br />
               in existence there, but the members of it are 
               <br />
               excepted from the rovisions that apply to 
               <br />
               the egislative councils of the other provinces. 
               <br />
               Whyrsthis? Ithinkthere mustbesome 
               <br />
               reason, in the ﬁrst place, for breaking the 
               <br />
               good rule that in no way shall the prerogative 
               <br />
               ofthe Crown bemstricted;and,in the second, 
               <br />
               for making an exception in regard to one that 
               <br />
               does note to the others. I think a reason 
               <br />
               may be foun for this in the fact, that it was 
               <br />
               doubted whether the resolutions in a different 
               <br />
               shape would have passed through some of the 
               <br />
               chambers that compose the legislatures of the 
               <br />
               diﬁerent provinces. (Hear, hear. I would 
               <br />
               like to know what justice will be one if this 
               <br />
               change is carried out? What, for instance, 
               <br />
               will be done with to two honorable 
               <br />
               members who come from the city of Hamilton ? 
               <br />
               One of them (the Hon. Mr. MILLS) is an 
               <br />
               a inted member; the other (the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               ULL) was the almost unanimous choice of 
               <br />
               the peo le only a few months since. Under 
               <br />
               the wor ° of the resolutions, one of these 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen will forfeit his seat.

               Hos. Mn. ROSS—Wh ? (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               HON. Mn. CURRIE— it does not follow

               that one of these honorable gentlemen willlose 
               <br />
               his seat, it must follow that some other por-

               tion of Upper Canada will be unre resented

               gentlemen take either horn of the dilemma 
               <br />
               they please. It may be quite true that the 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have been sent here 
               <br />
               the conﬁdence of their constituents, ut it 
               <br />
               does not follow that the will be retained 
               <br />
               in their seats. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plain</span> that a great 
               <br />
               injustice will be done these honorable
