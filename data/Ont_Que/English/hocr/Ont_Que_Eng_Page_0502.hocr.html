               bation, or are they not? (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               pledge myself that I will discuss the ques- 
               <br />
               tion from that point of view. I will do my

               utmost to avoid mere passing or personal

               however, I am bound to repeat at the outset, 
               <br />
               that no one can do justice to a question like

               approach this question from any new point 
               <br />

               <br />
               largest sense of the term. I desire to per- 
               <br />
               petuate the union between Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. I desire to see developed, the largest 
               <br />
               union that can possibly be developed (I care 
               <br />
               not by what name you call it) between all 
               <br />
               the colonies, provinces, and dependencies of 
               <br />
               the British Crown. I desire to maintain that 
               <br />
               intimate union which ought to subsist, but 
               <br />
               which unfortunately does not subsist as it 
               <br />
               ought, between the Imperial Government and 
               <br />
               all those de endeneies. I am a unionist, who 
               <br />
               especially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drbes</span> not desire to see the provinces

               <br />
               my mind, this scheme does not at all present 
               <br />
               itself as one of union; and if hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite will admit the truth, they will 
               <br />
               acknowledge that, practically, it amounts to a 
               <br />
               disuuion between Upper and Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I confess that I am irrecon- 
               <br />
               cileably opposed to that portion of the 
               <br />
               scheme. I repeat I do not care to see 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada more dissevered 
               <br />
               than they are; on the eontrary, I wish to 
               <br />
               see them brought into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">closer”</span> union ; and 
               <br />
               far from regarding this scheme as cementing 
               <br />
               more closely the connection of these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces with the British Empire, I look upon 
               <br />
               it as tending rather towards a not distant 
               <br />
               disuuion of these provinces from the 
               <br />
               British Empire. (Hear, hear.) My posi- 
               <br />
               tion as regards this scheme is that of one 
               <br />
               who desires to see this union perpetuated, 
               <br />
               and not of one who would contemplate a 
               <br />
               state of disuuion between any of the 
               <br />
               component parte of the British Empire. 
               <br />
               I hold that proper means ought to 
               <br />
               be taken to prevent our disuuion from the 
               <br />
               British Empire and absorption into the 
               <br />
               United States, and that this scheme by no 
               <br />
               means tends that way. I have no fancy for 
               <br />
               democratic or republican forms or institu- 
               <br />
               tions, or indeed for revolutionary or political 
               <br />
               novelties of any sort. The phrase of “ oliti- 
               <br />
               eal creation ” is no phrase of mine. hold 
               <br />
               that the power to create is as much a higher 
               <br />

               develops the ordinary growth of our institu-

               tions; and this growth, if it is to be healthy 
               <br />
               at all, must be slow. There must be the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">°</span>
