               gentlemen have said that we have merely 
               <br />
               submitted the general scheme of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and they have called upon us to 
               <br />
               give details—details about the School bill, 
               <br />
               details about the local governments, and 
               <br />
               the immense string of other details em- 
               <br />
               braced in the amendment moved the other day 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from Grandville <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hon.:Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ls'rELLrsa</span> DE ST. J us'r), which I am sure was 
               <br />
               at least a fathom long, and a very long fathom 
               <br />
               too. ( Laughter.) Now, suppose we had all 
               <br />
               these matters before us, could we really digest 
               <br />
               such a mass of information as hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               have asked for? It seems to me it would 
               <br />
               be like introducing liquids into a vessel whose 
               <br />
               month is very small; if you throw in the 
               <br />
               liquid rapidly and in two great quantities, the 
               <br />
               vessel will be overﬂowed, and the ﬂuid won’t 
               <br />
               be got into it. I think we have enough before 
               <br />
               us at present, when we have the principal 
               <br />
               matter, without the accessories. For, what 
               <br />
               would be the use of the accessories if you reject 
               <br />
               the principle? (Hear, hear.) Depend upon 
               <br />
               it, as soon as these resolutions are concurred 
               <br />
               in, then the details will be given one after the 
               <br />
               other; and I trust they will be of such a 
               <br />
               nature as to meet with the approval of the 
               <br />
               majority of this Honorable House. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Some hon. gentlemen have told us 
               <br />
               that this was not a Federal union—that the 
               <br />
               project before you, hon. gentlemen, was in 
               <br />
               point of fact a project for a Legislative union. 
               <br />
               One hon. gentleman who took this view read 
               <br />
               the 29th section, in order to shew that the 
               <br />
               General Government, if it chose, could repeal 
               <br />
               any of the local acts of the different local 
               <br />
               legislatures—that the General Government, 
               <br />
               for instance, could do away with our religious 
               <br />
               and benevolent corporations, or deprive them 
               <br />
               of their property. I think the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman must have been rather short-sighted 
               <br />
               when he read the 29th resolution, for be 
               <br />
               emitted a very important part of it; and, 
               <br />
               if he had not omitted that part, I do not 
               <br />
               think he would have said that this Federal 
               <br />
               sch :me was really a scheme for a Legislative 
               <br />
               union. I have no doubt my honorable 
               <br />
               friend acted in good faith; but being rather 
               <br />
               short-sighted, he did not read the whole clause ; 
               <br />
               otherwise he must have arrived at a different 
               <br />
               conclusion. The 29th section says: “The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Geneval</span> Parliament shall have poWer to 
               <br />

               mitted to the General Government. But the 
               <br />
               resolution does not ﬁnish there. There is 
               <br />
               something that comes after all that, and it is 
               <br />
               this: “And generally respecting all matters

               <br />
               able gentlemen if an act incorporating a re- 
               <br />
               ligious body or benevolent society here in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada is a subject of a general char- 
               <br />
               acter; is it not a subject purely local ? (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear. Take, for instance, the sisters of 
               <br />
               charity. Could the General Government, 
               <br />
               under this clause, interfere with the privileges 
               <br />
               of those ladies? I say they could not. I 
               <br />
               suppose the honorable gentleman who used 
               <br />
               the argument advanced it conscientiously and 
               <br />
               in good faith. But I think it is quite evident 
               <br />
               from a reading of the resolution that, if Con— 
               <br />
               federation takes place, the General Government 
               <br />
               will have no power to interfere with such mat- 
               <br />
               ters. (Hear, hear.) I must say positively, 
               <br />
               if I am competent to draw any conclusion at 
               <br />
               all from what I read, that the General Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment will have no right to meddle at all 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those.</span> religious and benevolent corpora- 
               <br />
               tions, none in the world. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Remarks have also been made about the laws 
               <br />
               of divorce and marriage, and the honorable 
               <br />
               member for the division of DeLanaudiére 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. OLIVIER) told us that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com</span> 
               <br />
               ference had done well in transferring the 
               <br />
               power of divorce to the General Government. 
               <br />
               On his part, I think this was a wise view of 
               <br />
               the question, and I am glad to have the o por- 
               <br />
               tunity of now telling him so. He was, ow- 
               <br />
               ever, very uneasy about the Word “marriage.” 
               <br />
               Well, I will try to put him right and at his 
               <br />
               case on that point; and I will give him the 
               <br />
               answer as I ﬁnd it put down in writing, so 
               <br />
               that no possible misunderstanding may con- 
               <br />
               tinue to exist. If the honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               will but take his pen, he will be able to note 
               <br />
               my answer :—“ The word ‘ marriage’ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">haslbeen</span> 
               <br />
               inserted to give the General Legislature the 
               <br />
               right to decide what form of marriage will be 
               <br />
               legal in all parts of the Confederation, without 
               <br />
               in any way interfering with the rules and
