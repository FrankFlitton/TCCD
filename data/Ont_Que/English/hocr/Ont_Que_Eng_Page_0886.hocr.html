               besides, to help in case of war. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) No, we are not to imagine that a 
               <br />
               war at this time would be a war of 1812, 
               <br />
               and the people know it perfectly well. If a 
               <br />
               Confederation like this which is now pro- 
               <br />
               posed is imposed upon the peOple without 
               <br />
               consulting them, and even against their 
               <br />
               will—if they are forced to bear a burthen 
               <br />
               much heavier than they now hear —and if 
               <br />
               the treaty of reciprocity is not continued—— 
               <br />
               if a commercial crisis should ensue, and if 
               <br />
               war should break out between England and 
               <br />
               the United States, you must not suppose that 
               <br />
               the people will ﬁght <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> they fought in 1812, 
               <br />
               when you have driven them to discontent, 
               <br />
               and rendered their position harder than it 
               <br />
               now is. You may toll off the population 
               <br />
               into regiments, and they will not rebel, be- 
               <br />
               cause they are loyal and submissive, but 
               <br />
               their hearts will not be in the cause, and 
               <br />
               they will assuredly not ﬁght with the same 
               <br />
               spirit as they would shew if they were de- 
               <br />
               fending a constitution 'and a state of things 
               <br />
               of their own choosmg. They will not ﬁght 
               <br />
               with the same courage as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sauthern</span> rebels 
               <br />
               have shewn, for they were ﬁghting to defend 
               <br />
               institutions—bad ones it is true, but which 
               <br />
               they were attached to, and which they were 
               <br />
               desirous of preserving. (Hear, hear.) ln 
               <br />
               the event of a War with the United States, 
               <br />
               and being under a Confederation, the people 
               <br />
               would be called upon to defend a state of 
               <br />
               things which they dislike—a Constitution 
               <br />
               imposed upon them, to which they would 
               <br />
               not be attached—a Constitution in which 
               <br />
               they would have no interest. The war 
               <br />
               might result from a difﬁculty originating 
               <br />
               in China! They would be compelled to 
               <br />
               ﬁght against a people whom they look 
               <br />
               upon not as enemies, but as friends, with 
               <br />
               whom they keep up daily relations; and, 
               <br />
               I repeat it, it would not be possible for 
               <br />
               them to ﬁght as they did in the last war. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But I return to the Recipro- 
               <br />
               city treaty, and I say that we shall feel its 
               <br />
               great value once it has been repealed. It is 
               <br />
               like a bridge over a river between two 
               <br />
               parishes ; so long as the bridge stands, every 
               <br />
               one takes advantage of it without a thought 
               <br />
               of its utility, but let the bridge be carried 
               <br />
               away or destroyed, and every one feels what 
               <br />
               an advantage it was, and the pe0ple realize 
               <br />
               _ the loss they have suffered, when they are 
               <br />
               once more compelled to resort to the old 
               <br />
               system of ﬂats and boats every time they 
               <br />
               require to cross the river. (Hear, hear.)

               with them, by displaying misplaced sym-

               pathy. (Hear, hear.) For my part, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I know that the people of Canada 
               <br />
               do not ask for annexation to the United 
               <br />
               States, for they are in the enjoyment of 
               <br />
               peace and contentment as things now stand. 
               <br />
               The people do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'not</span> desire any change; but 
               <br />
               if you wish to establish a new order of 
               <br />
               things, if you desire to create a new nation- 
               <br />
               ality, I fancy we have the right to say what 
               <br />
               we consider suited to us; and if you desire 
               <br />
               to establish a new kingdom on this continent, 
               <br />
               we surely are entitled to examine what it 
               <br />
               is t) be, and the basis upon which it is to be 
               <br />
               erected. I say it would be a misfortune 
               <br />
               for us if we attempted to establisha system 
               <br />
               founded upon a political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principle</span> contrary 
               <br />
               to that of the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States—on</span> the mon- 
               <br />
               archical principle. If we must inaugurate 
               <br />
               a policy, let it not be a policy calculated to 
               <br />
               give umbrage, a policy of distrust and pro- 
               <br />
               vocation. Let it rather he a policy of con- 
               <br />
               ciliation and peace. Let it not be a policy 
               <br />
               of armies, of useless walls and fortiﬁcations-— 
               <br />
               a policy of ruin and desolation! What 
               <br />
               would be the use of all these fortiﬁcations, 
               <br />
               all these walls, if they load us with an 
               <br />
               unbearable burthen of taxation, restrict 
               <br />
               our commerce, paralyse our industry, shut 
               <br />
               ns up within our own narrow limits, with 
               <br />
               our vast <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">products</span> cut <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> from a proﬁt- 
               <br />
               able market? (Hear, hear.) Do you fancy 
               <br />
               that the people would then care much 
               <br />
               whether the ﬂag ﬂoating over them here a 
               <br />
               cross or a strips? The people are satisﬁed to 
               <br />
               remain as they are; they do not wish for 
               <br />
               anything better now; but if you desire to 
               <br />
               change their political relations, they have 
               <br />
               the right to examine your scheme in all its 
               <br />
               phases. They have the right to ask them- 
               <br />
               selves whether what you oﬂ'er them is not a 
               <br />
               permanent state of war tor themselves and 
               <br />
               their children. (Hear, hear.) The Consti- 
               <br />
               tution of the United States is certainly far 
               <br />
               superior to that proposed to us, and far better 
               <br />
               suited to our habits and the state of society 
               <br />
               amongst us. This scheme of Confederation, 
               <br />
               this scheme of an independent monarchy, 
               <br />
               can lead but to extravagance, rain and 
               <br />
               anarchy! You may decry as much as you
