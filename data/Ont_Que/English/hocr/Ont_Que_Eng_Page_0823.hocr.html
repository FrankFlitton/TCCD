               now contemplated by the pe0ple of these

               <br />
               some length my reasons, if we had to decide 
               <br />
               between these alternatives. for opposing the 
               <br />
               former. I believe—and I think hon. gen-

               tlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">almost</span> unanimously in this House 
               <br />
               agree with me—that the union existing be- 
               <br />
               tween these provinces at the present time 
               <br />
               has, in all its important bearings, more than 
               <br />
               realized the most sanguine anticipations of 
               <br />
               those who were concerned in bringing it about. 
               <br />
               We have seen, since the union, an increase 
               <br />
               in the population, revenue and resources of 
               <br />
               these provinces seldom witnessed in the 
               <br />
               history of any country. We have seen two 
               <br />
               peuples entirely dissimilar in race, language 
               <br />
               and institutions—having nothing in common 
               <br />
               but their joint allegiance to the same Crown 
               <br />
               --we have seen those two peoples rapidly be- 
               <br />
               coming one people—one in name, one in 
               <br />
               object, one in feeling. And I believe that 
               <br />
               in every respect the union under which we 
               <br />
               now live has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most</span> happy in its results. 
               <br />
               If I had gone, therefore, into the subject, as 
               <br />
               I originally intended, I should have stated 
               <br />
               fully my views upon it in all its bearings. 
               <br />
               And I should have stated, as I now state, 
               <br />
               that if I had had to give my vote whether 
               <br />
               the connection between these two provinces 
               <br />
               should remain, or whether it should be dis- 
               <br />
               solved, and we should go back to the state 
               <br />
               of separate existence in which we were be- 
               <br />
               fore the union, I should have been found 
               <br />
               for one most hostile to a dissolution of that 
               <br />
               union. (Hear, hear.) But circumstances, 
               <br />
               over some of which this House has not con- 
               <br />
               trol, while others are within our control, 
               <br />
               have led to a probable termination of this 
               <br />
               debate at an earlier period than I had an-

               would become absolutely necessary. I look

               that our commercial relations with our sister
