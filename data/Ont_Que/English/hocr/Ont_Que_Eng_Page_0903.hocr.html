               “ That which is best administered is best.” 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, no scheme can be entirely 
               <br />
               perfect. Indeed, it is scarcely desirable it 
               <br />
               should be so. There should be room for the 
               <br />
               exercise of political virtue, and scope for 
               <br />
               the exercise of that executive responsibility 
               <br />
               which attaches to our system of government. 
               <br />
               There is a great deal of discretion left to 
               <br />
               our public men, and they are expected to 
               <br />
               use their powers for the general weal and 
               <br />
               welfare. I am disposed to place conﬁdence 
               <br />
               in the Government, and believe that they 
               <br />
               will, so far as their ability goes, work out 
               <br />
               this scheme to a desirable result, and in 
               <br />
               this I hope and trust they will succeed. 
               <br />
               The hon. member for Lennox and Addington 
               <br />
               (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), in his speech to-day, 
               <br />
               which, like all his other speeches, was of 
               <br />
               the most admirable kind, made some 
               <br />
               profound observations. He had thought 
               <br />
               deeply upon the subject of which he 
               <br />
               was treating. He remarked that the 
               <br />
               Government were merely giving eﬂect 
               <br />
               to a foregone conclusion. He, no doubt, 
               <br />
               recognized that the public sentiment and 
               <br />
               public opinion had attained a certain state— 
               <br />
               had arrived at such a point, that the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment were compelled to go with the stream, 
               <br />
               and endeavor to consummate that which the 
               <br />
               peeple had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">already.</span> brought into such a con- 
               <br />
               dition of forwardness. And I thought, sir, 
               <br />
               that this was the proper and philosophical 
               <br />
               view to take of the matter. It is true, to 
               <br />
               my mind at all events—and I think that those 
               <br />
               who have made themselves acquainted with 
               <br />
               political history, and the political history of 
               <br />
               England in particular, must come to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hose</span> governments act most 
               <br />
               wisely who take advantage of existing cir— 
               <br />
               cumstances, and adapt legislation to the real 
               <br />
               wants and exigencies of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> The 
               <br />
               question is not at all times what is best in 
               <br />
               the abstract, but what is most useful and 
               <br />
               advantageous to the people. My idea of a 
               <br />
               statesman is that he should be inﬂuenced to 
               <br />
               alarge extent by motives of expediency. 
               <br />
               Abstract propositions can seldom be reduced 
               <br />
               to practice. lt is foolish for gentlemen 
               <br />
               placed in the position of the Government to 
               <br />
               go against the popular stream, and they best 
               <br />
               manifest their prudence, their ability, and 
               <br />
               their adaptation to the discharge of their im- 
               <br />
               portant duties, who make use of passing 
               <br />
               events for directing the vessel of state into 
               <br />

               <br />
               they did not apply to the present subject. 
               <br />
               I presume we are not here for the purpose 
               <br />
               of discussing the past acts of the Govern—

               <br />
               reference to extraneous matters. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear ) I think, sir, we are now passing out 
               <br />
               of the season of political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">childhood,</span> and that 
               <br />
               we are being called upon, in the courseof 
               <br />
               events. to enter upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dutic</span> sand respon- 
               <br />
               sibilities incidental to the period of youth. 
               <br />
               We are required to practise and inure our- 
               <br />
               selves to the discharge of important duties, 
               <br />
               which require discretion and self—reliance. 
               <br />
               And as it is in nature, so it is in communi- 
               <br />
               ties—there are various stages of pregress 
               <br />
               through which we must pass before we can 
               <br />
               arrive at the position of manhood. There 
               <br />
               are only two kinds of animals that attain to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eminence-things</span> that ﬂy and things that 
               <br />
               creep. Things which ﬂy are never secure 
               <br />
               ——they are frequently brought down ; whilst 
               <br />
               things which creep proceed ﬁrmly and can-

               <br />
               to a. state of political manhood, violate the 
               <br />
               order and arrangement observed in na- 
               <br />
               ture. We have seen instances where 
               <br />
               people have disregarded the various stages 
               <br />
               of political existence; but in so doing 
               <br />
               they have deprived themselves of the ad- 
               <br />
               vantages of that experience which is ne- 
               <br />
               cessary to a vigorous manhood, and which 
               <br />
               previous training alone can secure. I trust 
               <br />
               we shall not make this mistake, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we 
               <br />
               shall observe the order and gradations of 
               <br />
               nature, and pass through the various political 
               <br />
               stages of being, from childhood upwards, in 
               <br />
               such a way that we may learn to discharge 
               <br />
               the duties of our position in a spirit of self— 
               <br />
               reliance; that we shall have been taught 
               <br />
               how to make the best of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances,</span> 
               <br />
               and prove that the training we have 
               <br />
               received during our pupilage has been such 
               <br />
               as to ﬁt us for a vigorous and prosperous 
               <br />
               future. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(ﬂeur.)</span> I think that this view of 
               <br />
               the subject is one of some importance—so 
               <br />
               much so, that it has been said the logical 
               <br />
               conclusion of it would be our independence.
