               DB. PARKER—Mr. SPEAKER, before 
               <br />
               the debate closes, I desire to make a few 
               <br />
               observations in explanation of the vote it is 
               <br />
               my intention to record on this question. I 
               <br />
               shall not trespass on the indulgence of the 
               <br />
               House, but will compress in a few sentences 
               <br />
               the explanations I desire to make. It is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">getty</span> well within the knowledge of the

               ouse that I entertain strong objections to 
               <br />
               the Address on the table—not only objections 
               <br />
               of principle, but detail—objections not only 
               <br />
               as an Upper Canadian, but as a British North 
               <br />
               American, and objections as to the time and 
               <br />
               manner in which it is sought to give to these 
               <br />
               resolutions the force of law. If it was pos- 
               <br />
               sible to propose or secure certain changes, I 
               <br />
               would make them or warmly support them. 
               <br />
               The motion of the “ previous question’ ’ by 
               <br />
               the leader of the Government precludes all 
               <br />
               amendments; for it I am not responsible, but 
               <br />
               by it I am forced to give a yea or nay vote 
               <br />
               on the Address as it now stands. I have no 
               <br />
               choice but to acce tor reject these resolutions 
               <br />
               as a whole. If could take the respons- 
               <br />
               ibility of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> latter, I would state my 
               <br />
               objections to the basis of Confederation 
               <br />
               fully, perhaps strongly. I refrain from this 
               <br />
               expression, because, under the circumstances 
               <br />
               to which I have alluded, it would serve no 
               <br />
               good end or purpose. It has been persist- 
               <br />
               ently urged during this debate that the 
               <br />
               opponents of this measure should propound 
               <br />
               a better. A suﬂicient answer to that argu- 
               <br />
               ment is, that they are not allowed to do so. 
               <br />
               But aside from this, the opponents of a public 
               <br />
               measure are not always called upon to submit

               concurrence or be carried. The only ques- 
               <br />
               tion, however, I have to determine is, that 
               <br />
               under the necessities of the time and the

               <br />
               which I am in any way responsible—I can 
               <br />
               see my way to nothing better, and I have 
               <br />
               therefore determined to record my vote for 
               <br />
               these resolutions. (Hear, hear) Conced- 
               <br />
               ing, as I honestly do, the necessity of 
               <br />
               constitutional changes, I accept this as the 
               <br />
               only practical measure at the present time. 
               <br />
               If I could see a reasonable probability of 
               <br />
               securing anything better, I would vote 
               <br />
               otherwise. But from some of the remarks 
               <br />
               made by leading members in opposition to 
               <br />
               this Address, the changes which they would 
               <br />
               probably propose I could under no circum- 
               <br />
               stances support ; because then, sir, circum- 
               <br />
               stances, over which I have no control, make 
               <br />
               this the Only practicable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changu</span> possible; 
               <br />
               and, as the necessity is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">urgent,</span> I accept 
               <br />
               these resolutions as a necessity of the time 
               <br />
               and situation. In voting for this Address,

               however, I reserve to myself the right of judg-
