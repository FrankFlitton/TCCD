               the British Empire; for in it he would ﬁnd 
               <br />
               allusion made to the Chinese war, the several 
               <br />
               insurrections in India, the insurrectional 
               <br />
               movement in Ireland, the Russian war, the 
               <br />
               Sepoy rebellion, and a large number of other 
               <br />
               matters ;' but all this would prove nothing 
               <br />
               against the prosperity of the empire under 
               <br />
               the rule of Her Majesty. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But, without losing time over the reply 
               <br />
               which may be made to this style of reasoning, 
               <br />
               I say that it does not follow that the Federal 
               <br />
               system is impracticable, because it has not 
               <br />
               succeeded among certain peeple who were 
               <br />
               not in a suﬁciently advanced condition for 
               <br />
               the application of the system. N o constitu- 
               <br />
               tion suits every people equally well; constitu- 
               <br />
               tions are made for the people, and not the 
               <br />
               peeple for the constitution. When a people 
               <br />
               is suﬂiciently enlightened and sufﬁciently 
               <br />
               educated and civilized, a constitution ensur- 
               <br />
               ing their liberty may be given them ; but it 
               <br />
               is necessary to wait until they are able to 
               <br />
               appreciate and enjoy it, before giving it to 
               <br />
               them. A free constitution entrusted to an 
               <br />
               unenlightened peeple is like an edged tool 
               <br />
               placed in the hands of a child; it is a dan— 
               <br />
               gerous instrument, with which it may chance 
               <br />
               towound itself. Besides, certain forms of 
               <br />
               government are better suited to certain 
               <br />
               people than others. Thus, to endeavor to 
               <br />
               give the English Constitution to the French 
               <br />
               people would be to commit a great mistake, 
               <br />
               for the French people are not adapted to the 
               <br />
               working of the political institutions of Eng- 
               <br />
               land. Again, try to give the English people 
               <br />
               the French Constitution, and the English 
               <br />
               peeple will revolt. Before giving a consti- 
               <br />
               tution to a peeple, that peeple must be taught 
               <br />
               how to use it. It cannot be said that a table 
               <br />
               of contents is not history, but certainly one 
               <br />
               would not seek in that part of the volume for 
               <br />
               the philosophy of history. Let us suppose 
               <br />
               that some one is desirous of reading the 
               <br />
               history of the Celestial Kingdom, and that 
               <br />
               on taking up the book he ﬁnds, in the table 
               <br />
               of contents, that at a certain period there 
               <br />
               was a terrible battle between the good and 
               <br />
               the wicked angels; if he shared the ideas of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Lotbiniere, he would 
               <br />
               Baytohimself: “ This country cannot have a 
               <br />
               good government, and it is not advisable to 
               <br />
               live in it.” When aperson draws historical 
               <br />
               conclusions from a table of contents, it shews 
               <br />
               that he has not derived much beneﬁt from 
               <br />

               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. DUBION) is in favor of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation of the two Canadas, and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Lotbinière (Mr. J CLY) is against 
               <br />
               any Confederation at all. They do not even 
               <br />
               agree <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> to their reasons for opposition. 
               <br />
               Some are opposed to Confederation because 
               <br />
               it grants too much to Lower Canada, and 
               <br />
               others because it grants too much to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. Yet Confederation cannot be dis- 
               <br />
               advantageous to everybody, and, for my part, 
               <br />
               I am of opinion that e ryonc may ﬁnd some- 
               <br />
               thing good in it, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> only reasonable in 
               <br />
               his expectations. If the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Hochclaga were called upon to arrange the 
               <br />
               diﬂicultics in which the country is at present 
               <br />
               situated, I am satisﬁed that he would not 
               <br />
               bring forward any other plan than some 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation or other; and if he 
               <br />
               did not succeed with the scheme for the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the Canadas, he would try 
               <br />
               the more extended plan of a great Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation of all the provinces. There is indeed, 
               <br />
               it is true, another remedy which would be 
               <br />
               more likely to meet the views of certain 
               <br />
               members—annexation to the United States; 
               <br />
               but I, for my part, am resolutely opposed to 
               <br />
               it, and am prepared to ﬁght against it by 
               <br />
               every possible means, and to take up arms, 
               <br />
               if necessary, to resist it. If we are ever 
               <br />
               invaded by the United States. I shall ever 
               <br />
               be ready to take up arms to drive the 
               <br />
               invaders out of the country. (Hear,-hcar.) 
               <br />
               A great outcry which is raised against Con- 
               <br />
               federation is that about direct taxation. 
               <br />
               For my part, I consider that the honorable 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance (Hon. Mr. GALT) has 
               <br />
               proved clearly that We shall not require to 
               <br />
               have recourse to it. But even supposing 
               <br />
               that such should turn out to be the case, we 
               <br />
               should not be any worse <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oil~</span> than we should 
               <br />
               be with the gentlemen on the other side of 
               <br />
               the House in power; for it is perfectly well 
               <br />
               known that the hon. member for Chateau- 
               <br />
               guay’s plan is to establish direct taxation. 
               <br />
               With them, therefore, we should not have 
               <br />
               to wait for Confederation before we got it. 
               <br />
               The honorable members on the other side of 
               <br />
               the House have also taken occasion to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               fault with the Speech from the Throne having 
               <br />
               contained an allusion to the peace and gene- 
               <br />
               ral prosperity of the coun’try. “ Why,” they 
               <br />
               say, “the Speech from the Throne states 
               <br />
               that trade is prospering, that the peeple are 
               <br />
               happy and centented, that the harvests have

               been magniﬁcent, and that great contentment
