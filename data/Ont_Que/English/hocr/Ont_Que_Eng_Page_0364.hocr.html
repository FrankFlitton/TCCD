               <br />
               what will become of the amount due to the

               will repudiate that portion of the debt so 
               <br />
               allotted her.” Well, I repl , Lower Canada 
               <br />
               cannot do that, if she were 'sposed to do so; 
               <br />
               but I do not believe that Lower Canada would 
               <br />
               be di (1 to repudiate a debt which she has 
               <br />
               herse contracted—a debt of honor—a debt 
               <br />
               which is, as it were, sacred. But even if 
               <br />
               Lower Canada were dis to do so, the 
               <br />
               General Government are hable for the amount 
               <br />
               of that debt, and as the General Government 
               <br />
               has to give to Lower Canada a subsidy of 80 
               <br />
               cents per head, it would, of course, take very 
               <br />
               good care to substraet from the amount allotted 
               <br />

               may state that it was only for the sake of

               tell you, honorable gentlemen, that they never

               <br />
