               <br />
               into our politics. Canada has been cursed 
               <br />
               with party cries, and it is time for us to clear 
               <br />
               the political arena of such false issues and 
               <br />
               dangerous contests. To introduce this new

               element of discord can only gain for its 
               <br />

               relations, at this moment, with the American 
               <br />
               people are mainly traceable to cries of this 
               <br />
               kind. By rendering the people sus icious 
               <br />
               of such inﬂuence, the promoters of t e cry 
               <br />
               are hastening the accomplishment of what 
               <br />
               they pretend to oppose. Once render the 
               <br />
               people of this country dissatisﬁed with the

               working of their system of government, and 
               <br />
               there will be danger of their continuing 
               <br />
               what will then seem inevitable. If there

               be any who desire annexation, they could 
               <br />
               not better forward their views than by raising 
               <br />
               the false cry of American interference in our 
               <br />
               political con tests. Once destroy public conﬁ- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               towards annexation, in 1865 it is the 
               <br />

               any attention to the subject will see that

               under the Ashburton treaty our frontier

               (Hear, hear.) This question of Federation isa

               question which concerns our country, which 
               <br />
               concerns our allegiance, which concerns our

               connection with the Home Government and 
               <br />
               the future of this country ; and when our in-

               something of the railways of New Brunswick, 
               <br />

               <br />
               by the people of St. John to extend their 
               <br />
               railways to the American frontier, as Canada 
               <br />
               has done in several instances. It was their 
               <br />
               interest to connect with the Portland road, 
               <br />
               just as it was the interest of Canada to con- 
               <br />
               nect the Grand Trunk with the road from 
               <br />
               Montreal to Portland. And with Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               TILLEY as the advocate of such extension, is 
               <br />
               it reasonable to infer that the American rail- 
               <br />
               way men opposed his election ? The scheme 
               <br />
               before us is fraught with a job of greater 
               <br />
               proportions than the New Brunswick people 
               <br />
               ever thought of. The lurking inﬂuences of 
               <br />
               the Grand Trunk Railway, or of the well-
