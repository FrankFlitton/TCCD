               whose management would be entirely independent

               lonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> seems to be the ﬁrst step towards

               any more intimate relations between the British

               North American Provinces than those which now 
               <br />
               exist. The construction even of this work is by 
               <br />
               no means certain; although this Government, 
               <br />
               looking at it mainly as a means of defence, has 
               <br />
               entertained the preliminaries, in common with 
               <br />
               delegates from the provinces of N ova Scotia and 
               <br />
               New Brunswick. It is premature, just now, to 
               <br />
               speculate upon the possible political consequences 
               <br />
               which may never be consummated. Certain it is,

               however, that the re can be no closer intercolonial

               <br />
               certain that the provinces, supposing them to be

               Sir, these were the replies to the various 
               <br />
               propositions submitted by His Grace in rela- 
               <br />
               tion to our contributions towards the defence 
               <br />
               of this country, and to the means for supply- 
               <br />
               ing the same. If different ground is now 
               <br />
               taken by honorable gentlemen on the Trea- 
               <br />
               sury benches, it seems to me that they 
               <br />
               abandon the rights which belong to a free 
               <br />
               people—the right ochntrolling the expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of our own money, the denial of which 
               <br />
               caused the revolt of the American colonies 
               <br />
               in 1776. In the observations I have made 
               <br />
               on the question cf defence, and the willing- 
               <br />
               ness of the people of this country to contri- 
               <br />
               bute their share, I wish to be understood 
               <br />
               that the proportion asked of us shall be 
               <br />
               according to our ability. What I say is 
               <br />
               that in the condition in which the country 
               <br />
               is at this moment, it would be idle for us to 
               <br />
               undertake an outlay which would hopelessly 
               <br />
               embarrass our exchequer. ’.l‘o organize a 
               <br />
               large force in connection with the outlay for 
               <br />
               fortiﬁcations, would require a large number 
               <br />
               of men, who would be withdrawn from the 
               <br />
               industry of the country—and, that industry 
               <br />
               being heavily taxed, without any return being 
               <br />
               expected ;--and the soil refusing perhaps to 
               <br />
               be as proliﬁc as in other years, most serious 
               <br />
               embarrassments would overtake us in the 
               <br />
               attempt to defend ourselves in a war which ' 
               <br />
               we had done nothing to provoke. And, 
               <br />
               having no knowledge of the Imperial policy 
               <br />
               which might bring about such a war, I say 
               <br />
               it becomes the people of this country, before 
               <br />
               they undertake a large outlay for defence or 
               <br />
               military organisation, to consider what por- 
               <br />
               tion we can bear of the burdens sought to be 
               <br />
               imposed upon us. (Hear, hear.) I say 
               <br />
               nothing of the sensational style of speaking 
               <br />
               which the Attorney General West gets up 
               <br />
               about other topics, in order to get away from 
               <br />
               the point raised by my honorable friend from 
               <br />
               Chateauguay, who stated the case in a way 
               <br />
               that any one who desired might have met it 
               <br />
               fairly. When a plain answer is wanted to a 
               <br />
               pointed question, honorable gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site invariably ﬂy oﬂ' to something else. I 
               <br />
               will not allude to the debate which incident- 
               <br />
               ally followed aftcr the recess this evening, 
               <br />
               and before I resumed my observations a 
               <br />
               little while ago, farther than to make a 
               <br />
               remark on the statement of the Attorney 
               <br />
               General West, that I sneered at the question
