               <br />
               two branches of the Legislature, owing their 
               <br />
               existence to the same source, and being 
               <br />
               elected by the same class of voters, to work 
               <br />
               in harmony for any length of time. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It may be called a retrograde move- 
               <br />
               ment, yet I can heartily assent to it, because, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, it places things where they 
               <br />
               should have been left. In pressing upon 
               <br />
               this House the adoption or rejection of these

               <br />

               tion to the constitution of the U per House, 
               <br />
               so far as the limiting of the num er of mem- 
               <br />
               bers is concerned. I for one, although there 
               <br />
               is no doubt that these resolutions will be 
               <br />
               assed by this House precisely in the form 
               <br />
               in which they have been submitted to us, 
               <br />
               am quite content that the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment should make such alterations in that, 
               <br />
               or any other res ect, as they consider neces- 
               <br />
               sary, and I sha bow with very great satis- 
               <br />
               faction to such amendments. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               There are two or three questions in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with these resolutions upon which I 
               <br />
               desire to offer a few remarks. One of them 
               <br />
               is that of education. We have already had,° 
               <br />
               in the course of this discussion, a good deal 
               <br />
               said on this subject. I would simply say, as 
               <br />
               one of those who gave cﬁ'ect by my vote to 
               <br />
               the present law of Upper Canada for the 
               <br />
               establishment of separate schools, that in 
               <br />
               doing so I believed that I was according to 
               <br />
               the minority of one section of the province 
               <br />
               what I conceived the minority of the other 
               <br />
               section were entitled to, thus doing justice to 
               <br />
               all. It gives me, therefore, great satisfac- 
               <br />
               tion to observe the recognition in these reso- 
               <br />
               lutions of the principle that the rights of the 
               <br />
               minorities, in each section, with respect to 
               <br />
               educational facilities, should be guaranteed. 
               <br />
               I confess that if I were living in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, I should not feel that I was 
               <br />
               being justly treated in being called upon 
               <br />
               to contribute by taxation to the support 
               <br />
               of schools to which I could not con- 
               <br />
               scientiously send my children. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               , I have the satisfaction of knowing that, after 
               <br />

               Bill, and going back to my constituents, they 
               <br />
               were fully satisﬁed with the explanation I 
               <br />
               gave them, and my action was endorsed by 
               <br />
               them. Another question that I look upon 
               <br />
               as of very great importance to these colonies, 
               <br />
               is not dealt with in these resolutions in that 
               <br />
               manner to which its importance entitles it. 
               <br />
               I refer to the management and sale of our 
               <br />
               Crown lands. I am very sorry to observe 
               <br />
               that they are to be conﬁded to the control 
               <br />
               of the local legislatures. I believe that if, 
               <br />
               in any one question more than another, the 
               <br />
               Government of this province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> failed in 
               <br />
               their duty in times ast, it is in the manage-

               ment of our Crown ands. 'l‘he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complaint‘I</span> 
               <br />
               have to make is that they have not made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use</span> 
               <br />
               of those lands in establishing a wise and 
               <br />
               liberal system of immigration, by offering 
               <br />
               them free to all who would come and settle 
               <br />
               upon them. It cannot but be humiliating to 
               <br />
               every person having a stake in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province</span> 
               <br />
               to observe the torrents of immigration that 
               <br />
               pour <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fromjthe</span> Mother <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Country</span> into the 
               <br />
               neighboring republic; and especially so 
               <br />
               when they see them passing through the 
               <br />
               whole length of Canada by multitudes to the 
               <br />
               Western States. Hear, hear.) We have, 
               <br />
               in times past, failed to hold out such induce- 
               <br />
               ments as would stop that tide of immigra- 
               <br />
               tion from ﬂowing past us. I fear that by 
               <br />
               leaving those lands in the hands of the local 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures,</span> the immigration question will 
               <br />
               be dealt with, in future, in the same narrow 
               <br />
               spirit in which it has been treated in times 
               <br />
               past. I would have been very highly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pleased</span> 
               <br />
               if I could look forward to the future with 
               <br />
               the hope that our Gener ll Legislature would 
               <br />
               adopt a large, enlightened, and liberal scheme 
               <br />
               of immigration, sending their agents to all 
               <br />
               the European ports from which the largest 
               <br />
               tide of immigration sets in, for the purpose 
               <br />
               of explaining to the people the advantages 
               <br />
               they could derive from settling in these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I am, therefore, very sorry to see 
               <br />
               that the delegates-were obliged to make the 
               <br />
               arrangement they have made with reference 
               <br />
               to this important question. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.)

               Now, sir, in reference to another of the 
               <br />
               questions embraced in these resolutions. 
               <br />
               though not forminga part of the proposed 
               <br />
               Constitution, I am prepared to admit here 
               <br />
               that my opinions have undergone a Very 
               <br />
               material change since I ﬁrst came into this 
               <br />
               Heuse. I refer to the construction of the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial RailWay. I came here, in 
               <br />
               1862, decidedly hostile to our assuming any 
               <br />
               portion of the expense of constructing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               road. I believed, at that time, that it
