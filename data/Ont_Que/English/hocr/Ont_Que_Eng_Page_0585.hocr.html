               OpiniOns divided the Congress on the question of

               people. These two last opinions carried the exis-

               tence Of the Chamber to be admitted, but it was 
               <br />

               nating the senators. Among the members who 
               <br />
               desire a senate, the greater number sustained 
               <br />
               nomination by the king, as being more in harmony 
               <br />
               with the nature of the institution; but those who 
               <br />
               wished only one Chamber directly elected being 
               <br />

               named without the intervention of the royal 
               <br />
               power, so that this Opinion prevailed. The

               <br />
               the same majOrity. The central section pr0posed,

               tion by the king without presentation and in un- 
               <br />
               limited number. The question was discussed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               the sitting Of the 15th, 16th and 17th December. 
               <br />
               Nomination by the king was rejected by 96 
               <br />
               against 77. Two leading Opinions still divided 
               <br />
               the partisans of election. One would conﬁde it 
               <br />
               to the ordinary electoral colleges, and others to 
               <br />
               the Provincial Council or States. “ We desire,” 
               <br />
               said M. BLARGNIES in proposing the last mode 
               <br />
               of election “a neutral power which can resist the 
               <br />
               dangers which might result from the preponder- 
               <br />
               ance Of the head of the state or from an elective 
               <br />
               Chamber. It is, therefore, necessary that this 
               <br />
               power should emanate neither from the same 
               <br />
               elements as the elective Chamber, nor from the 
               <br />
               chief of the state.” To conﬁde election toa parti- 
               <br />
               cular class, was said on the other side, is to create 
               <br />
               privileged electors with a double vote, and to in- 
               <br />
               troduce into our country all the inconveniences 
               <br />
               of the division of electors which has just been 
               <br />
               abolished in France. Provincial Councils should, 
               <br />
               moreover, be administrative bodies. The system 
               <br />
               of article 53 was adapted by 136 votes against 
               <br />

               <br />
               one Chamber, and consequently only one mode of 
               <br />
               election, determined the majority.
