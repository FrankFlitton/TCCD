               assuredly be less satisﬁed with the decisions 
               <br />
               of a Federal Court of Appeals than with 
               <br />
               those of Her Majesty’s Privy Council. In 
               <br />
               good truth, I do not see why this clause was 
               <br />
               imposed upon our delegates. I do not 
               <br />
               suppose that the delegates of the other pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               but even if they had, I do not see why ours 
               <br />
               submitted to it. Of course our laws would 
               <br />
               not be understood in such a court, and most 
               <br />
               of the judges would render their decisions 
               <br />
               according to principles of jurisprudence 
               <br />
               unknown to Lower Canada. I am convinced 
               <br />
               that those Lower Canadian members who 
               <br />
               are in favor of Confederation are not in 
               <br />
               favor of a legislative union; but have they 
               <br />
               not read the speech made at Toronto by the 
               <br />
               Hon. President of the Council (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BROWN)?</span> And did they not hear that of 
               <br />
               the honorable member for South Leeds (Mr. 
               <br />
               FORD JONES), and the speeches of the 
               <br />
               members from Upper Canada generally, who 
               <br />
               nearly all spoke in favor of a legislative 
               <br />
               union, declaring that they accept Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instalment—a</span> ﬁrst step—towards 
               <br />
               a legislative union, which we shall have in a 
               <br />
               few years? It is not necessary for me to 
               <br />
               discuss, on this occasion, the advantages or 
               <br />
               disadvantages of a legislative union, for all 
               <br />
               the members are perfectly well acquainted 
               <br />
               with the question; but I am well convinced 
               <br />
               that the Confederation will be convert- 
               <br />
               ed into a legislative union in a few 
               <br />
               years. I believe that the Hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance and the hon. member for South 
               <br />
               Leeds were sincere in saying that, and that 
               <br />
               they were perfectly convinced of its truth. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It has been said, as a reason 
               <br />
               for hurrying on the passing of the measure, 
               <br />
               that if we wish for Confederation, now is 
               <br />
               the time to obtain it ; that if we wait another 
               <br />
               year it will be too late ; that the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces are ready for Confederation, and 
               <br />
               that England is disposed to grant us a new 
               <br />
               Constitution. I believe that the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces have proved to be a little slack 
               <br />
               in fulﬁlling their engagements, and that the 
               <br />
               policy of the Government might therefore, 
               <br />
               with great safety, undergo some modiﬁcation. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But if we must absolutely 
               <br />
               have Confederation, if there is no getting on 
               <br />
               without it, why was not an appeal made to 
               <br />
               the peeple last autumn, when the scheme 
               <br />
               was quite prepared? (Hear, hear.) For 
               <br />
               my part, I think that the want of the mea- 
               <br />
               sure of Confederation is not so urgent as it 
               <br />
               is said to be, and that time should be taken 
               <br />
               to mature the plan. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Does</span> anybody believe

               measure is urged forward so anxiously, it is 
               <br />

               when the people have pronounced upon it. 
               <br />

               my heart, if the Government had not been 
               <br />
