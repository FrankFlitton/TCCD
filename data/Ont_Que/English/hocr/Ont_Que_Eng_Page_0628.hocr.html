               suffered. Listen to the noble utterances of 
               <br />
               that great patriot, in presence of his electors,

               The past must not discourage us, or diminish 
               <br />
               our veneration for our Constitution. An other 
               <br />
               form of government would be subject to t e same 
               <br />
               drawback, and in fact to drawbacks far greater ; 
               <br />
               the peculiarity of our present system is, that it 
               <br />
               furnishes the means of remedying its own defects. 
               <br />
               [And he added]: We must, moreover, be prepared 
               <br />
               to make some sacriﬁces for the securing of these 
               <br />
               great advantages.” 
               <br />
               Such was the language of that great patriot ; 
               <br />
               not a word of bitterness, complaint, or re- 
               <br />
               crimination, but dignity of expression and a 
               <br />
               sincere conviction of the advantages of the 
               <br />
               Constitution. Whata contrast, alas! between 
               <br />
               those days of devotedness and civic courage, 
               <br />
               and the egotisn: and frigid indifference of our

               own, in which self-interest overrides every- 
               <br />
               thing, and patriotism has ceased to exist. The 
               <br />
               page of our history I have just read, is 
               <br />
               one which certainly should not remain un-

               ﬁnd an example of patriotism well deserving 
               <br />
               of imitation. It is well to contemplate and 
               <br />
               study the great struggles of our forefathers, 
               <br />

               noble patriots-—a victory dearly purchased, 
               <br />

               BEDARD to a seat on the judicial bench. She

               understood clearly that she could do nothing 
               <br />

               ance of the French-Canadian element. And 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government also hoped to recover 
               <br />
               the control of the inﬂuence and the services of 
               <br />

               into prison, and whom the Government had 
               <br />

               SPEAKER, the Imperial Government showed

               nation they thus sought to gain over to their 
               <br />
               cause. For it must be admitted—and it is 
               <br />
               perhaps our misfortune—that it is the peculiar 
               <br />
               characteristic of the French element, that they 
               <br />
               very often too soon forget the persecutions of 
               <br />
               which they have been the victims, and which 
               <br />
               ought to inspire them with an honest indigna- 
               <br />
               tion when they reﬂect on the past. Over-con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdent of the sincere good will of our adver- 
               <br />
               saries, we are always taken unawares at each 
               <br />
               new attempt at aggression. And even now, 
               <br />
               a few years of prosperity has been enough to 
               <br />
               dazzle us and make us anticipate a brilliant 
               <br />
               prospect in a measure which involves nothing 
               <br />
               short of the annihilation of our inﬂuence as a 
               <br />
               race, which is in fact decreed in the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation now sought to be forced upon 
               <br />
               the people. (Hear, hear.) But the American 
               <br />
               army threatened the frontier, and it was 
               <br />
               necessary to think of defence. With a view 
               <br />
               of being prepared for an attack, the Governor 
               <br />
               assembled Parliament twice in 1812, and 
               <br />
               measures were taken for arming the militia and 
               <br />
               voting the sums required for the organization 
               <br />
               and defence of the province. Sir GEORGE 
               <br />
               PREVOST, at the opening of Parliament in 
               <br />
               1813, complimented the people for their 
               <br />
               courage and energy, and the proceedings were 
               <br />
               less stormy than usual; fresh supplies were 
               <br />
               voted for the war, and a good under- 
               <br />
               standing subsisted between the Government 
               <br />
               and the two Houses during the session. 
               <br />
               At that heroic period of our history, we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd our French-Canadian fellow—country- 
               <br />
               men, to whom fresh concessions had been 
               <br />
               made, obedient to the voice of their chiefs, 
               <br />
               rushing to the frontier and driving back the 
               <br />
               invader. But in 1812, as in 1775, the de— 
               <br />
               votcdness and patriotism of our people were 
               <br />
               destined soon to be forgotten. The moment 
               <br />
               of danger had scarcely passed away when 
               <br />
               those who had saved the power of England in 
               <br />
               America, at the price of their blood, were 
               <br />
