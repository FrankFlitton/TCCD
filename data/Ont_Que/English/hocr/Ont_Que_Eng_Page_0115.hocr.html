               end the sectional discord between Upper and 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Federal Legislature will meet at last as 
               <br />
               citizens of a common country. The questions 
               <br />
               that used to excite the most hostile feelings 
               <br />
               among us have been taken away from the

               General Legislature, and placed under the

               own section, are unpo ular in the other,—for 
               <br />
               he will not have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal</span> with sectional ques-

               <br />

               <br />
               at an end. What has rendered prominent

               public men in one section utterly unpopular 
               <br />
               in the other in past years? Has it been our

               views on trade and commerce —immigration 
               <br />

               <br />
               of national interest ? No, sir, it was from our 
               <br />
               views as to the applying of public money 
               <br />

               roads, bridges, and landing-piers with public 
               <br />

               school system—and similar matters, that the 
               <br />
               hot feuds between Upper and Lower Canada 
               <br />

               <br />
               unpopular in the other. A most happy day 
               <br />
               will it be for Canada when this bill goes into 
               <br />
               effect, and all these subjects of discord are

               avor of this scheme as a remedial measure, 
               <br />
               because it brings to an end the doubt that has 
               <br />

               be one of the very last to express doubts on

               this point. Has he not, for many years, ad-

               tablished in our land ? Has he not taken art 
               <br />
               in the contests to obtain those changes ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%as</span> 
               <br />
               he not experienced the harsh and hostile feel-

               ings that have pervaded this House and the

               whole country ? And did he not sign the re- 
               <br />
               port of my committee last session, declaring a 
               <br />
               Federal union to be the true solution of our 
               <br />

               <br />
               does the honorable member think these matters 
               <br />
               were not well known in the United States, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Does he fanc that people abroad, as well as 
               <br />
               at home, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dig</span> not perfectly understand that

               to the injustice from which she su cred—and 
               <br />
               that until the future relations of the two sec- 
               <br />

               <br />

               when the measure before us has been adopted 
               <br />

               <br />
               when all are placed on an equal footing—when 
               <br />
               the sectional matters that rent us have been 
               <br />
               handed over to sectional control—when see-

               tional expenditure shall be placed on sectional 
               <br />
               shoulders—will not a sense of securit and 
               <br />
               stability be inspired, which we never fore

               sure—I fearlessly assert that the scheme in your 
               <br />
               hands is a just and satisfactory remedy for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               feel this, that were every word of o jection 
               <br />
               urged against our union with the Maritime

               Provinces just and true to the ve letter, I 
               <br />
               would not hesitate to ad0pt the union as the 
               <br />
               price of a measure of constitutional reform in 
               <br />
               Canada, so just and so complete as now pro-

               Maritime Provinces being sound, so far from
