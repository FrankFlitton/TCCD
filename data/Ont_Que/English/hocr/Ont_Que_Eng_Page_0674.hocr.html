               the continuance of this scheme by the honor-

               able gentlemen opposite. I think they are 
               <br />
               bound to proceed in some other way, seeing 
               <br />
               that this scheme cannot be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried,</span> as it cer- 
               <br />
               tainly cannot. It has been rejected not only

               by l\ew Brunswick, but by Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island, one of whose delegates to Quebec, Mr. 
               <br />
               WHELAN, has been holding meetings, and all 
               <br />
               that he has been able to accomplish is the 
               <br />
               passing of resolutions of conﬁdence in himself, 
               <br />
               and the assertion that no such scheme should 
               <br />
               be given effect to without being ﬁrst submit— 
               <br />

               <br />
               ble expressron of opinion that can be obtained 
               <br />
               in Prince Edward Island. It is well known, 
               <br />
               too, that the Legislature of Nova Scotia is 
               <br />
               against the scheme by a large majority. And 
               <br />
               now we ﬁnd that New Brunswick has pro— 
               <br />
               nounced against it also. Will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon,</span> gentlemen 
               <br />
               go to England andpress on the scheme under 
               <br />
               such circumstances ? Will they argue that 
               <br />
               because we are 2,500,000 and they only 900,- 
               <br />
               000, we ought to swallow them up by press- 
               <br />
               ing them into Confederation against their 
               <br />
               wishes ? (Hear, hear.) I do not suppose

               larger failed, then they would fall back upon

               the minor, which provided for a federation of 
               <br />
               the two sections of the province." And it

               was expressly stated that during this session,
