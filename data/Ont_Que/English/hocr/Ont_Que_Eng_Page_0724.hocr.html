               the same training as the honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               in the way of word twisting. I take his 
               <br />
               words in their plain and literal sense. He 
               <br />
               says he has no doubt that these resolutions 
               <br />
               will form the Constitution of this country. 
               <br />
               Then, sir, why do not honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               keep faith ? Why does not the Hon. President 
               <br />
               of the Council, in an especial manner, keep 
               <br />
               faith with his party, by giving us the scheme 
               <br />
               which he pledged himself, in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">event</span> of

               such a contingency as this, should be 
               <br />
               brought down during this session of Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment? The honorable gentleman does not 
               <br />
               ﬁnd it convenient to answer. I confess I 
               <br />
               did not expect an answer; but nevertheless 
               <br />
               I thought it desirable to put the question to 
               <br />
               him. I, equally with other members of the 
               <br />
               House, can draw my inferences from his 
               <br />
               silence. He knows very well it is a viola- 
               <br />
               tion of the programme under which he 
               <br />
               entered the Government ; and well he knows 
               <br />
               that it is a departure from the avowal which 
               <br />
               constituted, I will not say his justiﬁcation, 
               <br />
               but his sole excuse for occupying the seat 
               <br />
               which he now ﬁlls. The question is now 
               <br />
               asked whether it is intended by the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to go to England and ask the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament to establish a Constitution for 
               <br />
               this country, the principles of which have 
               <br />
               never been considered, because we are oon-

               the admission of the hon. gentleman to—day, 
               <br />

               question to the House. Well, sir, there is

               another reason perhaps for the course taken

               HON. MR. HOLTON—I say it has always

               been a theory of my own, and facts are 
               <br />
               rapidly demonstrating the truth of that 
               <br />
               theory, that this Government was formed in 
               <br />
               consequence of the emergencies of certain 
               <br />
               gentlemen who were in oﬂice, and desired to 
               <br />
               retain oﬁice, and of certain other gentlemen 
               <br />
               who were out of oﬁice and who desired to 
               <br />
               come in. I believe that the whole constitu- 
               <br />
               tional difﬁculties, or alleged constitutional 
               <br />
               difﬁculties, of this country arose from the 
               <br />
               personal or rather the political emergencies 
               <br />
               into which certain hon. gentlemen found 
               <br />
               themselves, from causes to which I shall not 
               <br />
               now advert. (Hear, hear.) Well, sir, feeling 
               <br />
               that this scheme has failed—feeling that the 
               <br />
               pretext upon which they have held oﬁice 
               <br />
               for six or nine months is about to fail them, 
               <br />
               they devise other means, as a sort of lure to 
               <br />
               the country, whereby ofﬁce may be kept for 
               <br />
               a further period. I admit the dexterity with 
               <br />
               which the thing is done—a dexterity for 
               <br />
               which the Hon. Attorney General West has 
               <br />
               long been famous in this country. His 
               <br />
               theory is : “ Take care of to-day—when 
               <br />
               to—morrow comes we will see what can be 
               <br />
               done”-—and by adhering to this maxim he 
               <br />
               has managed to lengthen out the term of his 
               <br />
               political existence. That, I believe, will be 
               <br />
               acknowledged to be the theory upon which 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman acts.

               the highest kind of reward of a public life— 
               <br />

               thinks of the hon. gentleman as a statesman, 
               <br />
