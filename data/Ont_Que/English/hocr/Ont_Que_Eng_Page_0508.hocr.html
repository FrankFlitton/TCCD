               gets little more than we now have of what

               is called a feature of the British Constitu-

               tion, in the composition of the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council. It has been spoken of as an im- 
               <br />
               propriety, almost treasonable, to hint at it as 
               <br />
               a bait thrown out to gentlemen who have 
               <br />
               been elected to the Legislative Council for 
               <br />
               a ﬁxed period, that .by voting‘for this 
               <br />
               scheme they may get themselves made le- 
               <br />
               gislative councillors for life. If in this 
               <br />
               scheme provision had been made, in regard 
               <br />
               to the members of this branch of the Legis- 
               <br />
               lature, that they should hold their seats, not 
               <br />
               for lite, but say, for a mere period of ﬁve 
               <br />
               years, I rather think there would be few 
               <br />
               found here very mealy-mouthed on the sub- 
               <br />
               ject; and when it is offered to men who, 
               <br />
               like ourselves, will have to go before their 
               <br />
               constituents within a few months, or years, 
               <br />
               at most, that they are to be made legislative 
               <br />
               councillors for life, the bait, I think, is not 
               <br />
               a very small one. (Hear, hear.) We are told, 
               <br />
               too, on the face of this scheme, that the 
               <br />
               choice is to be made by the present govern- 
               <br />
               ments of the several provinces; but of course 
               <br />
               with perfect fairness to the Opposition in 
               <br />
               each province! M ost satisfactory! Each Op- 
               <br />
               position is to be treated with perfect fairness 
               <br />
               —“ it is so nominated in the bond.” We hear 
               <br />
               of a minister of the Crown in one place, ad- 
               <br />
               dressing his neighbors,and telling them they 
               <br />
               may depend on it, that when Her Majesty 
               <br />
               comes to make the selection, the utmost res- 
               <br />
               pect will be paid to the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               of the elected members, so that their elected 
               <br />
               member will have the fairest chance of be- 
               <br />
               coming a life member of the Confederate 
               <br />
               Legislative Council. In another place, on 
               <br />
               the other hand, we hear from another minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Crown that those gentlemen who 
               <br />
               hold patents of appointment for life may feel 
               <br />
               quite as safe, for certainly their claim to be 
               <br />
               retained in their present position is sure to 
               <br />
               have full weight. Further, in Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               each locality is told that it may rest satisﬁed 
               <br />
               It will not be overlooked, for each is to be 
               <br />
               represented in the Legislative Council by a 
               <br />
               gentleman residing or holding property in 
               <br />
               it; and both origins and both creeds alike 
               <br />
               are thus to have representation and full pro- 
               <br />
               tection. Another point upon which there 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been a like pleasant sort of ambiguity 
               <br />
               kept up, is as to who are to make the future 
               <br />
               nominations to this Legislative Council. 
               <br />
               Viewing this part of the scheme as amatter of 
               <br />
               principle, one would have thought that these 
               <br />
               future nominations must be made on the

               Federal principle. It was not expressly so 
               <br />
               stated; it is not (as we are at last here 
               <br />
               told) it is not so meant; but till we 
               <br />
               were so told, everybody who thought one 
               <br />
               way said that the resolutions meant it 
               <br />
               to be that way, and all who thought the 
               <br />
               other way conveniently found the resolutions 
               <br />
               to justify their way of thinking. Well, 
               <br />
               turning then to matters which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> this 
               <br />
               House, the same sort of thing is still observ- 
               <br />
               able. Representation by population is 
               <br />
               given to meet the grand demand of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper</span> 
               <br />
               Canada; but the people of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               are assured, in the same breath, that it will 
               <br />
               not hurt them; that their institutions and 
               <br />
               privileges are made perfectly safe ; that they 
               <br />
               will even have as many members in the 
               <br />
               Lower House as before, and that they will, 
               <br />
               in a variety of ways, he really better oﬂ' 
               <br />
               than ever. Adelightful ambiguity is found, 
               <br />
               too, upon the point as to who will make the 
               <br />
               future apportionments of the constituencies. 
               <br />
               The leader of the Government,in explaining 
               <br />
               the scheme the other night, admitted that 
               <br />
               the decennial revisions of our representation 
               <br />
               districts are really not to be left to the local 
               <br />
               legislatures, but are to be dealt with alto- 
               <br />
               gether by the Federal Legislature. Till 
               <br />
               then most peOple, I believe, had held the 
               <br />
               contrary; but all had“ admitted the text of 
               <br />
               the resolutions to be equivocal, and each 
               <br />
               party had of course interpreted them as it 
               <br />
               wished. The postponement of the local 
               <br />
               constitutions is of the same character. 
               <br />
               Everyone is given to understand that the 
               <br />
               thing will be made to work to the satis- 
               <br />
               faction of all; each is promised that he 
               <br />
               shall have it as he Wants. Those who 
               <br />
               hold to the principle of responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment, as commonly understood, in the local 
               <br />
               administrations are, of course, told to 
               <br />
               expect a lieutenant—governor, with a cabinet, 
               <br />
               and, presumably, two branches of a local 
               <br />
               legislature. Those who Wmlld have two 
               <br />
               legislative bodies, without a responsible 
               <br />
               ministry, are told that very well it may be 
               <br />
               so. Whoever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prefers</span> one legislative body, 
               <br />
               hears that it is beyond a doubt there very 
               <br />
               well may only be one; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> those again who, 
               <br />
               even with one House, do not wish to see 
               <br />
               responsible government in the provinces, are 
               <br />
               assured that the machinery is likely to be 
               <br />
               very simple; that each province will proba- 
               <br />
               bly have a lieutenant-governor, with a few 
               <br />
               heads of needed departments, and one House, 
               <br />
               and that so, no doubt, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">each</span> pro-
