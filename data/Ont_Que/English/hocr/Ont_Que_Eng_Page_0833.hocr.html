               election. And at all of those meetings, 
               <br />
               some six or seven, not a single voice wa_s 
               <br />
               raised against the union of these provinces 
               <br />
               with the Provinces of Nova Scotia, N cw 
               <br />
               Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Island. All appeared to think such 
               <br />
               a union advisable and necessary, not only 
               <br />
               for commercial purposes, but because it 
               <br />
               would tend to strengthen the ties that bound 
               <br />
               us to the Mother Country. It has been said 
               <br />
               that this union has never been before the 
               <br />
               people, that it has never been a test question 
               <br />
               at the polls. Now, sir, so long ago as the 
               <br />
               year 1826, this union was advocated by Sir 
               <br />
               JOHN BEVERLEY ROBINSON, one of the most 
               <br />
               able men this country has ever produced; 
               <br />
               subsequently, on diﬂ'erent occasions, it was 
               <br />
               adverted to by Lord DURHAM in his celebrated 
               <br />
               report—also by the British American League, 
               <br />
               -presided over by the late lamented Hon. 
               <br />
               GEO. MOHATT of Montreal, and latterly 
               <br />
               in that despatch to the home Government 
               <br />
               in October, 1858, over the signatures of the 
               <br />
               Hon. Messrs. CARTIER, GALT and Ross. 
               <br />
               Why action was not taken upon that despatch, 
               <br />
               I cannot say; I leave this matter in the 
               <br />
               hands of those who at that time administered 
               <br />
               the affairs Of this country, and who are 
               <br />
               responsible for the course they pursued in 
               <br />
               allowing it to be dropped. Sir, the union 
               <br />
               of these provinces would, in my humble 
               <br />
               opinion, be of the very greatest advantage 
               <br />
               to us in many points. It would strengthen, 
               <br />
               and not weaken, as has been said by its 
               <br />
               Opponents, the ties that bind us to the 
               <br />
               Mother Country. It would give us a standing 
               <br />
               in the eyes of the world. Instead of being 
               <br />
               several small, disjointed and fragmentary pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, as was so ably expressed in the Speech 
               <br />
               from the Throne, we would form one great 
               <br />
               nationality, with a population to begin with 
               <br />
               of nearly 4,000,000 peeple, which would 
               <br />
               place us among the list of the ﬁrst countries 
               <br />
               of the world. (Hear, hear.) It would tend 
               <br />
               to strengthen our securities both here and 
               <br />
               in the Mother Country. Instead Of our stocks 
               <br />
               and our bonds being quoted as if by accident 
               <br />
               on the Stock Exchange in London, they 
               <br />
               would be looked for daily, and sought after. 
               <br />
               It would give us an increased market for 
               <br />
               our produce and our manufactures, and it 
               <br />
               would tend more than anything else to 
               <br />
               cause a tide of emigration to ﬂow to our 
               <br />
               shores. (Hear, hear.) Now the emigrant 
               <br />
               in coming to America is prcplexed to know 
               <br />
               to which of the different provinces he shall 
               <br />
               go, and when he speaks of going to America, 
               <br />
               the only place he thinks of is New York;

               <br />
               that this country will not be‘made more
