               this subject, which had been so often canvassed, 
               <br />
               was new to the country, was to assert an un- 
               <br />
               truth. At the close of that session, Sir EDMUND 
               <br />
               HEAD, in his Speech proroguing Parliament, 
               <br />
               made use of the following language :—“ I 
               <br />
               propose, in the course of the recess, to 
               <br />
               communicate with Her Majesty’s Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and with the Governments of the sister 
               <br />
               colonies, on another matter of very great im- 
               <br />
               portance. I am desirous of inviting them to 
               <br />
               discuss with us the principles on which ahead 
               <br />
               of a federal character, uniting the Provinces of 
               <br />
               British North America, ma perhaps hereafter 
               <br />
               be practicable.” In aceo ance with that an- 
               <br />
               nouncement of policy, a deputation was sent to 
               <br />
               England, composed of his then colleagues, 
               <br />
               Hons. Messrs. GALT and Ross and himself. 
               <br />
               We pressed the matter before the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government, whom we asked to authorize a 
               <br />
               meeting of delegates from the British North 
               <br />
               American Governments, to consider this sub- 
               <br />
               ject and report upon it, said report to be com- 
               <br />
               municated to the Colonial Secretary. Of 
               <br />
               course we wanted, at that time, to act with the 
               <br />
               sanction and approval of the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. We pressed the matter as strongly as 
               <br />
               we could before it. Of all the provinces that 
               <br />
               responded to the call of the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, Newfoundland, he thought, was the only 
               <br />
               one which professed her readiness to appoint 
               <br />
               del tes when the opportune moment arrived. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Although the other provinces 
               <br />
               were not opposed to Confederation, still, as the 
               <br />
               question had not been brought conspicuously 
               <br />
               before their people, they did not like then to 
               <br />
               join in the measure and in the proceedings 
               <br />
               which the Canadian delegates had urged upon 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government in 1858. At this 
               <br />
               time the Canadian Delegates had a duty to 
               <br />
               perform towards the illustrious Administrator 
               <br />
               of the Government, Sir E. HEAD, to fulﬁl the 
               <br />
               promise he had made, on proroguing Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, by pressing the measure upon the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the Imperial Administration. The 
               <br />
               Canadian Government also kept its promise 
               <br />
               to report to the House the result of the 
               <br />
               mission to England, at the next session of 
               <br />
               Parliament. The hon. gentleman here read 
               <br />
               the despateh dated October, 1858, which was 
               <br />
               transmitted to the Imperial Government, set- 
               <br />
               ting forth the sectional difﬁculties which had 
               <br />
               arisen between Upper and Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               principally on account of the former’ s demand 
               <br />
               for increased representation in Parliament, on 
               <br />
               the ground of its much larger population. 
               <br />
               Every one who knew anything of his past pub— 
               <br />
               lie course was aware that he was opposed to 
               <br />
               the principle of representation by population 
               <br />

               while Upper and Lower Canada were under 
               <br />
               one Government. He did not regret his oppo- 
               <br />
               sition. If such a measure had been passed, 
               <br />
               what would have been the consequence ? There 
               <br />
               would have been constant political warfare be- 
               <br />
               tween Upper and Lower Canada. True it was 
               <br />
               that the members from Upper Canada, being 
               <br />
               in the majority, it might have been imagined 
               <br />
               they would have carried everything before 
               <br />
               them; but as far as justice to Lower Canada 
               <br />
               was concerned, such might not have been the 
               <br />
               case. The consequence of representation by 
               <br />
               population would have been that one territory 
               <br />
               would have governed another, and this fact 
               <br />
               would have presented itself session after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ses-</span> 
               <br />
               sion in the House, and day after day in 
               <br />
               the public prints. (Hear, hear.) The mo- 
               <br />
               ment this principle had been conceded as the 
               <br />
               governing element, it would have initiated 
               <br />
               between the two provinces a warfare which 
               <br />
               would have been unremitting. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               He wished that Upper Canada should un— 
               <br />
               derstand him in this matter. He was ac- 
               <br />
               cused of being opposed to Upper Canada’s 
               <br />
               rights, because during ﬁfteen or twenty years 
               <br />
               he had to oppose his honorable friend the 
               <br />
               President of the Council (Hon. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bnows).</span> 
               <br />
               His honorable colleague took the und that 
               <br />
               representation should be arrange according 
               <br />
               to population in each section of the prov- 
               <br />
               ince. He (Hon. Ma. CARTIER) had resisted 
               <br />
               that position, believing that the moment such 
               <br />
               a principle was applied, his honorable friend, 
               <br />
               who, no doubt, wanted to maintain the ce- 
               <br />
               ful government of the country, would have 
               <br />
               been disappointed in his wish. It would have 
               <br />
               given rise to one of the bitterest struggles 
               <br />
               between the two rovinces that ever took place 
               <br />
               between two nations. He did not mean to 
               <br />
               say that the majority from Upper Canada 
               <br />
               would have tyrannized over Lower Canada ; 
               <br />
               but the idea that Upper Canada, as a terri- 
               <br />
               tory, had the preponderenee in the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment by a large number of representatives, 
               <br />
               would have been suﬁcient to generate that 
               <br />
               sectional strife to which he had alluded. In 
               <br />
               1858 he ﬁrst saw that representation by 
               <br />
               population, though unsuited for application as a 
               <br />
               governing principle as between the two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, would not involve the same objection if 
               <br />
               other partners were drawn in by a federation. 
               <br />
               In a struggle between two—one a weak, and 
               <br />
               the other a strong party—the weaker could not 
               <br />
               but be overcome; but if three parties were 
               <br />
               concerned, the stronger would not have the 
               <br />
               same advantage; as when it was seen by the 
               <br />
               third that there was too much stren on one 
               <br />
               side, the third would club} with t e weaker 
               <br />
