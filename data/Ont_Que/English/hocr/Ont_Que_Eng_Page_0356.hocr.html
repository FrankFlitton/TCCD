               value for transporting such things as these 
               <br />
               if there were occasion for it, which I hope 
               <br />
               there never will be. It is, however, meet to 
               <br />
               be prepared for such an eventuality as war, 
               <br />
               for that is the best way to avoid it. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I may here refer to what some 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen have remarked in this 
               <br />
               debate, that the circumstance of‘ certain 
               <br />
               portions of the pepulation of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces being occupied in maritime pur- 
               <br />
               suits, diminishes to that extent their power 
               <br />
               of aidin Canada in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case</span> of war. In this 
               <br />
               opinion am unable to concur; ﬁn if there

               <br />
