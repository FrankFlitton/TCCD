               I am not, however, the less persuaded that 
               <br />
               the want of some such central authority to 
               <br />
               regulate matters of common importance to 
               <br />
               the Australian colonies will be felt, and 
               <br />
               probably at a very early period; but when this 
               <br />
               want is so felt, it will of itself suggest the means 
               <br />
               by which it may be met. The several legislatures 
               <br />
               will, it is true, be unable at once to give the 
               <br />
               necessary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">authority</span> to a General Assembly, be- 
               <br />
               cause the legislative power of each is conﬁned of 
               <br />
               necessity within its territorial limits; but if two 
               <br />
               or more of these legislatures should ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               there are objects of common interest for which it 
               <br />
               is expedient to create such an authority, they will 
               <br />
               have it in their power, if they can settle the terms 
               <br />
               of an arrangement for the purpose, to pass acts 
               <br />
               for giving etfect to it, with clauses suspendin 
               <br />
               their Operation until Parliament shall have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supplietgl</span> 
               <br />
               the authority that is wanting. By such acts the 
               <br />
               extent and ob'ects of the powers which they are 
               <br />
               prepared to elegate to such a body might be 
               <br />
               deﬁned and limited with precision, and there can 
               <br />
               be little doubt that Parliament, when applied to 
               <br />
               in order to give effect to an arrangement so 
               <br />
               agreed upon, would readily consent to do so.

               Some may say, Mr. SPEAKER, that this is 
               <br />
               very true, but that the British Government 
               <br />
               dropped the plan and did not proceed with it. 
               <br />
               I think I shall be prepared to meet that argu- 
               <br />
               ment, and show that it only rested in the plan 
               <br />
               to learn the wishes of the people of the colo—

               nies; for you ﬁnd it following the very same 
               <br />
               principle, reported upon favorably by the Com-

               mittee on Trade and Foreign Plantations, in 
               <br />
               the Constitution which was subsequently 
               <br />
               granted to the New Zealand provinces. In 
               <br />

               <br />
               in regard to Australia, was carried into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ'ect</span> 
               <br />
               in New Zealand, and it must be remembered 
               <br />
               that at that time the pepulation of New Zea- 
               <br />
               land was very small, so small indeed that one

               <br />
               at the present day; but the statesmen of 
               <br />
               Great Britain looked into the future of the 
               <br />
               colony, and they decided that it would be 
               <br />
               advisable to confer on it powers analogous to 
               <br />
               those now sought for by us. The New Zea- 
               <br />
               land Constitutional Act created six provinces, 
               <br />
               with superintendents, provincial councils of 
               <br />
               nine appointed by the governor, and a general 
               <br />
               government of three estates. In the debate 
               <br />
               on that bill, Earl GREY said that this was the 
               <br />
               only form of government which could be con- 
               <br />
               ferred on a colony situated as that one was. 
               <br />
               He remarked :— 
               <br />

               It was impracticable and must for many years 
               <br />
               continue to be so, for any general legislature to 
               <br />
               meet all the wants of so many separate settle- 
               <br />
               ments at a reat distance from each other; hence 
               <br />
               it seemed a solutely necessary to constitute pro- 
               <br />
               vincial legislatures on which a great portion of 
               <br />
               the public business must devolve.

               The very diﬂiculty which was met with there is 
               <br />
               the one we have to overcome here. It was found 
               <br />
               absoluœl necessary to create in every province 
               <br />
               a Local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£egislature,</span> and in addition one cen-

               tral power, to whom matters common to all 
               <br />
               might be referred. Earl GREY, in the course 
               <br />
               of the same debate, speaking of the import- 
               <br />
               ance of this arrangement, said : —“ There 
               <br />
               were some subjects on which extensive incon- 
               <br />
               venience would arise, if uniformity of legisla- 
               <br />
               tion among the several provinces were not in- 
               <br />
               sured, which could only be accomplished by a 
               <br />
               General Legislature.” And that, sir, is what 
               <br />
               this Government now asks us to adOpt. They 
               <br />
               ask us to invite the Imperial Parliament to 
               <br />
               create for us provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures,</span> to 
               <br />
               whom shall be referred all local matters, and 
               <br />
               that we shall have a General Legislature for 
               <br />
               the care of those subjects of a general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">char-ac»</span> 
               <br />
               ter which could not be so well looked after by 
               <br />
               the provincial legislatures. And Isay,sir, that 
               <br />
               ﬁnding as we do that this is no new question, 
               <br />
               we can, therefore, understand why this measure 
               <br />
               met with such ready approval from the states- 
               <br />
               men of Britain and the high commendation of 
               <br />
               Her Majesty by her advisers. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But, Mr. SPEAKER, I will now pass from the 
               <br />
               consideration of the history of this important 
               <br />
               movement—and I assure you that I feel the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty of addressing the House“ on this sub- 
               <br />
               ject, in consequence of the sense I entertain 
               <br />
               of the gravity of the question itself and the 
               <br />
               momentous character of the issues it involves. 
               <br />
               The subject, sir, is one of the very highest 
               <br />
               importance. The destinies of this great coun- 
               <br />
               try are bound up in it. (Hear, hear.) The
