               cannot conceive any sound objection to mixed

               schools. But while in the Conference and 
               <br />
               elsewhere I have always maintained this view, 
               <br />
               and always given my vote against sectarian 
               <br />
               public schools, I am bound to admit, as I have 
               <br />
               always admitted, that the sectarian system, 
               <br />
               earned to the limiœd extent it has yet been in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, and conﬁned as it chieﬂy is to 
               <br />
               cities and towns, has not been a very great 
               <br />
               practical injury. The real cause of alarm was 
               <br />
               that the admission of the sectarian principle 
               <br />
               was there, and that at any moment it might 
               <br />
               be extended to such adegree aste split up 
               <br />
               our school system altogether. There are but 
               <br />
               a hundred separate schools in Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               out of some four thousand, and all Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic. But if the Roman Catholics are 
               <br />
               entitled to separate schools and to go on 
               <br />
               extending their operations, so are the members 
               <br />
               of the Church of England, the Presbyterians, 
               <br />
               the Methodists, and all other sects. No can—

               did Beman Catholic will deny this for a 
               <br />
               moment; and there lay the great danger to 
               <br />
               our educational fabric, that the separate 
               <br />
               system might gradually extend itself until the 
               <br />
               whole country was studded with nurseries 
               <br />
               of sectarianism, most hurtful to the best 
               <br />
               interests of the province, and entailing an 
               <br />
               enormous expense to sustain the hosts of 
               <br />
               teachers that so prodigal a system of public 
               <br />
               instruction must inevitably entail. Now

               <br />

               of the question in Upper Canada. When,

               therefore, it was proposed that a provision

               <br />
               from my point of view, this is a blot on the 
               <br />
               scheme before the House, it is, confessedly, one 
               <br />
               of the concessions from our side that had to be

               hesitation in accepting it as a necessary condi-

               though this arrangement might perhaps be fair
