               of our history. Hon. gentlemen, it is said 
               <br />
               that the peeple of the country have had those 
               <br />
               resolutions before them, that they perfectly 
               <br />
               understand them, and that they are pre- 
               <br />
               pared to a dispassionate judgment in 
               <br />
               the matter. It ill becomes the members of 
               <br />
               the Government to make such a statement. 
               <br />
               Why, what has been witnessed on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House ? A simple question was put 
               <br />
               to the Hon. Commissioner of Crown Lands 
               <br />
               as to the manner in which the members of 
               <br />
               the Legislative Councils of the various pro- 
               <br />
               vinces were to be appointed. The Hon. 
               <br />
               Commissioner informed us that the appoint- 
               <br />
               ments were to be made by the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments, and he was conﬁrmed in that view by 
               <br />
               the hon. and gallant Premier, who had the 
               <br />
               dignity conferred u n him of presiding over 
               <br />

               HON. MP.. CURRIE—I understood him 
               <br />
               to conﬁrm the statement of the Hon. Com- 
               <br />
               missioner Of Crown Lands. But at all 
               <br />

               <br />

               the absurdity of that position was pointed

               out, my hon. friend, the Commissioner of 
               <br />
               Crown Lands, asks a day to give an answer 
               <br />
               to the question, and he comes down next 
               <br />
               day and gives a totally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> reply. A 
               <br />
               few days later, the question of the export 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">du?</span> on the minerals of Nova Scotia came 
               <br />
               un er consideration, and I understood the 
               <br />
               Hon. Commissioner of Crown Lands as 
               <br />
               saying that in his opinion only the coal and 
               <br />
               minerals exported to foreign countries would 
               <br />
               be liable to duty. But according to the 
               <br />
               explanations given by the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               afterwards, I understand that the export 
               <br />
               duty will apply to all coal and minerals 
               <br />
               exported from Nova Scotia. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               went on to explain the meaning of this 
               <br />
               export duty. And what is his explanation ? 
               <br />
               He tells us that it is nothing more than a 
               <br />
               royalty. The export duty is imposed simply 
               <br />
               n n the coal which leave the country. In 
               <br />
               ' ova Scotia they now impose a royalty, and 
               <br />
               that royalty they intend to change for an
