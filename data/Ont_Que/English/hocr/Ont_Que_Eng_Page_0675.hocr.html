               HON. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">A'r'ry.</span> GEN. MACDONALD—I will 
               <br />
               repeat to the honorable gentleman what I did 
               <br />
               say. It was this : that I had no doubt the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of Contederatiou was one of the subjects 
               <br />
               which inﬂuenced the people of St. John. 
               <br />
               But I did not pretend that that was the only 
               <br />
               one. There were other local questions which, 
               <br />
               I have no doubt, had their due weight of 
               <br />
               inﬂuence. There was, for instance, the 
               <br />
               usual struggle between the ins and the cuts, 
               <br />
               and I presume there was the inﬂuence to 
               <br />
               be contended against of those who were 
               <br />
               in favor of the railways to the American 
               <br />

               <br />

               absent from some inevitable cause, but sent a
