               MB. DUN KIN—The hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               presumption reminds me of one, perhaps as 
               <br />
               conclusive, but which DICKENS tells us 
               <br />
               failed to satisfy his Mr. BUMBLE. That hen- 
               <br />
               pecked beadle is said to have said, on hearing 
               <br />
               of the legal presumption that a man’s wife 
               <br />
               acts under his control :—“ If the law pre— 
               <br />
               sumes anything of the sort, the law’s a fool 
               <br />
               —a natural fool !” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">daughter.)</span> If this 
               <br />
               permission of disallowance rests on a pre- 
               <br />
               sumption that the legislation of our provinces 
               <br />
               is going to be unjust or unwise, it may be 
               <br />
               needed ; but under that idea, one might 
               <br />
               have done better either not to allow, or else 
               <br />
               to restrict within narrower limits, such 
               <br />
               legislation. If the promised non-exercise of 
               <br />
               the power to disallow rests on a presumption 
               <br />
               that all will be done justly and wisely in the 
               <br />
               provincal legislatures, the legislative power 
               <br />
               is well given ; but then there is no need, 
               <br />
               on the other hand, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the»</span> permission to 
               <br />
               disallow. (Hear, hear.) I repeat, this 
               <br />
               system, or no-system, aims at nothing like 
               <br />
               uniformity between the general and local 
               <br />
               constitutions, or between the local constitu- 
               <br />
               tions themselves ; and in this respect, it is 
               <br />
               essentially at variance with the much wiser 
               <br />
               system adopted in the United States. It 
               <br />
               further allows of no real autonomy; in fact, 
               <br />
               the only trace of uniformity it can be said to 
               <br />
               have about it, consists in its disallowance of 
               <br />
               all autonomy to the provinces. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) N ow, let me take up those few 
               <br />
               features that undoubtedly are given to us, 
               <br />
               as characterizing our provincial system. Wide 
               <br />
               as we have seen the latitude is which the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces may take in framing their constitutions, 
               <br />
               there are a few matters as to which the 
               <br />
               system lays down an iron rule. There is 
               <br />
               the appointment of a lieutenant-governor 
               <br />
               which is to be ves:edin the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. It is not said in so many words that 
               <br />
               he is to be a colonist, but I think it may be 
               <br />
               taken for granted that he will be. It is not 
               <br />
               ve likely that we shall get any right hono- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rable</span> gentleman or eminent statesman, from

               <br />

               his mind, that perhaps if he were named to

               it, there might be a doubt in some quarters 
               <br />
               as to his entire ﬁtness for it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.)

               But seriously these lieutenant-governors 
               <br />
               thus selected, are all to hold ofﬁce by a very 
               <br />
               peculiar tenure. They are not to be remov- 
               <br />
               able except by the Federal power; nor by it 
               <br />
               within the term of ﬁve years, except for 
               <br />
               cause, which cause must be stated in 
               <br />
               writing, and laid before both branches of 
               <br />
               the Federal Parliament. For ﬁve years, 
               <br />
               therefore, they may be said to hold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁœ</span> 
               <br />
               during good behaviour. They are to be 
               <br />
               paid, too, by the Federal power. They are 
               <br />
               to exercise the reprieving and pardoning 
               <br />
               power, subject to such instructions as they 
               <br />
               may receive from the General Government 
               <br />
               from time to time. And they are to have 
               <br />
               the initiation, by message, of all money 
               <br />
               bills, and the power to reserve bills for ap— 
               <br />
               proval <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘the</span> Federal Government. They 
               <br />
               are to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> these leading functions of the 
               <br />
               nominated lieutenant governors under our 
               <br />
               system, but with one most marked diﬁ'er— 
               <br />
               ence— the attribute of non-removability. 
               <br />
               Beyond these few points, the resolutions 
               <br />
               leave us all at sea. Save as to these, they 
               <br />
               leave room, as we have seen, for the widest 
               <br />
               divergencies of constitution. To be sure, I 
               <br />
               gather one hint more, not from the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions themselves, but from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dispatc“</span> sent 
               <br />
               along with them to the Colonial Secretary, 
               <br />
               by the Governor General, and this is, that 
               <br />
               according to the view of our Canadian Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span> legislatures had bet-

               ter be framed on the one chamber principle. 
               <br />
