               to what I call the social relations which I 
               <br />
               think ought to exist and will spring up be— 
               <br />
               tween the people of the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               and ourselves if there is a closer communi- 
               <br />
               cation established between us, and also in

               <br />
               parties to this pro ed union. And ﬁrst, I 
               <br />
               will make a rem to some of the French

               In the northern counties of New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               from the Miramiehi to the Mata ediac, they 
               <br />

               of his constituency, and I believe I am cor- 
               <br />
               rect in saying that Mr. Li: Vrscosra, the 
               <br />
               late Finance Minister of Nova Scotia, was, 
               <br />

               <br />

               In New Brunswick there is more than one
