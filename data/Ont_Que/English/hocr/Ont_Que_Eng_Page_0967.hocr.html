               Emperor of Russia from extending the fron- 
               <br />
               tiers of his states indeﬁnitely, to the detriment 
               <br />
               of the surrounding nations. Why did the 
               <br />
               present Emperor of the French go to war 
               <br />
               with his cousin the Emperor of Austria? 
               <br />
               For exactly the same reason. I will go 
               <br />
               even further, and ask why the beast grazing 
               <br />
               in a pasture drives away the ﬁrst strange 
               <br />
               animal which enters it? It is a mere 
               <br />
               instinct of self-preservation. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Well, Mr. SPEAKER, as that instinct of 
               <br />
               self-preservation prevails among all created 
               <br />
               beings on the earth, why should it not 
               <br />
               be produced among the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> provinces 
               <br />
               of the Confederation? If Upper Canada 
               <br />
               should ever seek to act unjustly towards 
               <br />
               Lower Canada and the Lower Provinces, the 
               <br />
               latter would' naturally and instinctively 
               <br />
               strike up an alliance to resist the encroach- 
               <br />
               ments and injustice of the sister province. 
               <br />
               I am certain, therefore, that in this respect 
               <br />
               we have nothing to fear. As a French- 
               <br />
               Canadian, it is my business to speak oi what 
               <br />
               concerns us most nearly: our religion, our 
               <br />
               language, our institutions and our laws 
               <br />
               Well, then, with respect to our language, I 
               <br />
               ask whether there is the least danger of our 
               <br />
               losing it in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation?</span> Far from 
               <br />
               being in danger, I believe it will be more in 
               <br />
               vogue under the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">régime,</span> as it can be 
               <br />
               spoken and made use of not only in the 
               <br />
               Federal Parliament and local legislatures, 
               <br />
               but also in the supreme courts which will 
               <br />
               be hereafter instituted in the country. I 
               <br />
               sr y that when that time arrives—that is to 
               <br />
               say, when the Confederation is established, 
               <br />
               we shall have a fuller use of our language. 
               <br />
               For what liberty have we in its use in this 
               <br />
               chamber? That liberty which the liberals 
               <br />
               have vaunted so highly, which cannot be 
               <br />
               touched without destroying it, in what way 
               <br />
               have we it here? Has it been conceded to 
               <br />
               us in the full acceptation of the word ? By 
               <br />
               no means, Mr. SPEAKER ; we have it, but it 
               <br />
               is as TANTALUS had the water—he was 
               <br />
               thirsty, but he drank not ; though the water 
               <br />
               bubbled to his lips, the water receded as 
               <br />
               soon as he attempted to receive it. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) In truth, what kind of liberty have 
               <br />
               we, who do not understand the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English</span> 
               <br />
               language? We are at liberty to hold our 
               <br />
               tongues, to listen, and to understand if we 
               <br />
               can. Hear, hear, and continued laughter.) 
               <br />
               Under the Confederation, the Upper Cana- 
               <br />
               dians will speak their language, and the 
               <br />
               Lower Canadians theirs, just as we do now;

               <br />

               <br />

               in the towns, nay, even in the country parts, 
               <br />
               Canadians who have no sooner caught up 
               <br />
               two words of English than they run oﬁ' with 
               <br />
               delight to repeat them to their neighbors.

               <br />
               cease under Confederation (for we shall have 
               <br />
               the management of our public lands), has 
               <br />
               been a principal cause of that stupid mania 
               <br />
               with which all seem to be seized who have 
               <br />
               lived some time among our neighbors and 
               <br />
               returned to Canada. '10 give you an idea 
               <br />
               of that lamentable mania, I shall relates 
               <br />
               circumstance in which I was one of the 
               <br />
               actors. Not two months since, I was on the 
               <br />
               platform at the station where the branch 
               <br />
               from Arthabaska to Three Rivers leaves the 
               <br />
               Grand Trunk, when two young men, dressed 
               <br />
               in the American fashion, came to the hotel 
               <br />
               One, as he came in, called out in a loud 
               <br />
               voice, “ Where is the ostler ?” The man, 
               <br />
               who was a stout Canadian, soon made his 
               <br />
               appearance, and as soon as he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sat</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«yes</span> on 
               <br />
               the gentleman, called out in his turn, 
               <br />
               “ What! Joe, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> it you ?” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Tiens!</span> c’est toi, 
               <br />
               Joh !) Of course our pretended American 
               <br />
               was taken aback, and for the moment dumb- 
               <br />
               founded. Seeing his embarrassment, and 
               <br />
               willing, in pity to the poor victim of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effects-</span> 
               <br />
               tion, to relieve him from it, although it had 
               <br />
               its comic side, I called to the stableman and 
               <br />
               said, “ Go and take the gentlemen’s horses; 
               <br />
               don’t you see they are Americans, and that 
               <br />
               they don’t understand you.” Well, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, such scenes frequently occur; 
               <br />
               nay, those who move now and then from 
               <br />
               home may see them every day. So if 
               <br />
               we do not wish our beautiful language 
               <br />
               to lose its inﬂuence, we must not fail to 
               <br />
               discountenance the affectation of Canadians 
               <br />
               talking English when they hardly know 
               <br />
               a word of it. Otherwise we must take
