               <br />
               Canadian regiment in the year 1858, or the

               While on this subject, I ma refer to one or 
               <br />
               two of the answers which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l-Iis</span> Royal High-

               to him in passing through this country. One 
               <br />
               of the most gratifying to my own mind, and 
               <br />
               to the mind of every man who desires to see 
               <br />
               our connection with the Mother Country per- 
               <br />
               petuated, is his answer to the Address from the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, in which he said—“ Most 
               <br />
               heartily do I respond to your desire that the 
               <br />
               ties which bind together the Sovereign and 
               <br />
               the Canadian people may be strong and en- 
               <br />
               during.” (Hear, hear.) But it is not neces- 
               <br />
               sary for me to quote further from the answers 
               <br />
               made by His Royal Highness. The whole 
               <br />
               aspect of his visit to this country—the utter- 
               <br />
               ancesof the leaders of the two great parties 
               <br />
               is the British Empire—the well-known wishes 
               <br />
               of our Sovereign and of the Heir-Apparent to 
               <br />
               the Throne—all these intimate, so far as acts 
               <br />
               and language can intimate anything ,that there 
               <br />
               is still an unanimous desire on the part of 
               <br />
               the British people for the continuance of 
               <br />
               the connection of these provinces with the 
               <br />
               British Empire. And I believe it rests 
               <br />
               with us—altogether rests with trs—whether 
               <br />
               that connection shall be perpetuated. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I have no doubt that this prevailing 
               <br />
               desire for the perpetuation of the connection 
               <br />
               is one main ground of the satisfaction with 
               <br />
               which the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> view our move—

               our union must tend to the consolidation of 
               <br />
               our power and our strength, and to the de- 
               <br />
               velopment of our resources. I see no abso-

               lute necessit why, as we grow in strength, 
               <br />
               we should think, for many long years to come, 
               <br />
               of severing the connection; but as we in- 
               <br />
               crease in wealth and in numbers, we ought 
               <br />
               gradually, in the time of peace, to relieve the

               Another reason why we should earnestly de-

               order that new channels of commerce should 
               <br />
               be opened up, is because of the hostilit of 
               <br />
               the United States, evidently manifeste to 
               <br />
               this country during the past few months. 
               <br />
               What has been the policy of the United 
               <br />
               States towards Canada during that time? 
               <br />
               We have seen adopted the passport system— 
               <br />
               a remnant of despotism which even the dc- 
               <br />
               spotic governments of the old world have 
               <br />
               abolished. We have seen that democratic 
               <br />
               people embarrassing and restricting the inter- 
               <br />
               course between us; they have given notice 
               <br />
               of the termination of the convention limiting 
               <br />
               the lake naval force; they have, I believe, 
               <br />
               given notice of the abrogation of the Reci— 
               <br />
               procity treaty; we have seen the committee 
               <br />
               of ways and means reportino a bill for put- 
               <br />
               ting the frontier defences in order, and re- 
               <br />
               commending the expenditure of upwards of 
               <br />
               a million of dollars on those defences. 
               <br />
               They have given notice, or propose to give 
               <br />
               notice, of the abrogation of the Extradition 
               <br />
               treaty. They have proposed the construction 
               <br />
               of a ship canal around the Niagara Falls for 
               <br />
               gunboats and vessels of war. This is the 
               <br />
               policy of the United States towards Canada.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) And it makes us consider
