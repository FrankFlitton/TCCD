               lately appeared in a published letter of the 
               <br />
               ArchbishopofHalifax,Dr. CONNOLLY. Who

               is the Archbishop of Halifax ? In either

               of the coast colonies, where he has labored

               in his high vocation for nearly a third of a 
               <br />
               century, it would be absurd to ask the ques-

               tion; but in Canada he may not be equally 
               <br />
               well known. Some of my honorable friends in

               <br />
               hospitality. (Hear, hear.) Well, he is
