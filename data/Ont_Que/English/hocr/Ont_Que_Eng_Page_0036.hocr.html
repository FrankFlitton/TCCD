               the intention of the Government to bri down 
               <br />

               question of Confederation. The honorable 
               <br />
               tleman had already answered that uestion 
               <br />
               saying it was not the intention of t e Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to introduce this measure, and had 
               <br />
               given reasons for this course. Upon these 
               <br />
               reasonshe Hon. Mr. HOLTON) desired to say 
               <br />
               one word. e maintained that the uestion now 
               <br />
               before the House was, should ey revolu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the government of the country ? (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) That was undoubtedly the question, 
               <br />
               and he would like to know distinctly whether 
               <br />
               the form of the proposed new government, 
               <br />
               local as well as neral, formed of the 
               <br />
               same scheme ? e felt that the case could 
               <br />
               not be in a position to consider the proposed 
               <br />
               forms of the Constitution until they had before 
               <br />
               them, at least in a general way, the forms of

               government which were to obtain between the 
               <br />
               two sections of the province, of the union of 
               <br />
               which a dissolution was to be wrought by the 
               <br />
               measure before the House. Then another 
               <br />
               question which he had proposed to ut had 
               <br />
               reference to the educational system o Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. The Minister of Finance, in a speech 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> Sherbrooke, had romised that the Gov-

               <br />
               posed the Intercolonial Railway, had now be- 
               <br />
               come so enamoured of it and its adjuncts that 
               <br />
               he was reported to have declared in a speech

               at Toronto, that rather than not have those

               as vigorously as the railway itself, he would

               entitl to know what was to be done with re-

               <br />
               formed a part. He desired a‘so some infor-

               taining that Canada had a territorial right
