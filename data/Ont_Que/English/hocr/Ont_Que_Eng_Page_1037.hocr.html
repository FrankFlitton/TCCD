               avail one’s self of it. (Hear.) I look on this 
               <br />
               motion—I refer now to the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peel, and except the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Ontario—as an attempt to make a little 
               <br />
               capital at the expense of members who will 
               <br />
               save its supporters by votingit down. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Peel drew afearful picture of 
               <br />
               our exposed and defenceless state—of the dark 
               <br />
               and threatening cl-_-ud gathering over us—of 
               <br />
               the necessity of setting our house in order 
               <br />
               by a union of these provinces. Now, sir, if 
               <br />
               I half agreed with him, I should never think 
               <br />
               of bringing in an amendment causing delay 
               <br />
               and continued exposure to increasing danger, 
               <br />
               but Would go in strongly for the adoption of 
               <br />
               measures against such a state of things, the 
               <br />
               very ﬁrst hour it was possible. This resolu- 
               <br />
               tion, from the time at which it is moved, sir, 
               <br />
               should be voted down at once. The House 
               <br />
               owes it to itself to give it no countenance 
               <br />
               at this stage of the proceedings. Had it 
               <br />
               been moved before the previous question, I 
               <br />
               would have voted for it ; but as it comes u 
               <br />
               after the adoption of the main <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolutions,I</span> 
               <br />
               will stand by the solemn and deliberate action 
               <br />
               we have taken—I will stand the responsibility 
               <br />
               of the House and vote against it. (Hear.) 
               <br />
               MR. RYMAL—Being one of the eight 
               <br />
               members from Upper Canada who voted 
               <br />
               against the resolutions of the Quebec 
               <br />
               Conference, and whose names, I expect, 
               <br />
               will long be cherished by the peOple 
               <br />
               of that section, I presume, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               that I may vote for the amendment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'now</span> in

               your hands, without being charged with 
               <br />
               inConsistency, as some honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               have‘been during this discussion. I should 
               <br />
               not, however, have risen to address you, sir, 
               <br />
               but for a personal matter that was drawn 
               <br />
               into this debate, in reference to myself and 
               <br />
               my connection with the constituency I have 
               <br />
               the honor to rcpresent—-or misrepresent, as 
               <br />
               some people say. (Laughter, and hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) According to the doctrines held by 
               <br />
               the Hon. Attorney General West, it would 
               <br />
               appear that after I had been elected to this 
               <br />
               House, I have no business to refer any 
               <br />
               matter for decision to or consult the feelings 
               <br />
               of the people who sent me, but to act as I 
               <br />
               thought best for their interests. Allow me 
               <br />
               to dissent from this doctrine; but I have 
               <br />
               been obliged to exercise my own judgment, 
               <br />
               and I have done so honestly, independently, 
               <br />
               and fearlessly, irrespective of the conse- 
               <br />
               quences that may result to me, or of the 
               <br />
               half-uttered threats held out over me. These 
               <br />
               things, sir, have no inﬂuence over me ; I
