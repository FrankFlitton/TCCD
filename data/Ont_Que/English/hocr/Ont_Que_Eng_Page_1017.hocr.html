               most pressing reason given for passing the

               measure now is, that the relations between 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada have reached such 
               <br />

               cannot go on in peace and quietness any 
               <br />
               longer. I do not think anything of the kind

               is the case. I do not think any honorable

               gentleman from Upper Canada is ready to 
               <br />
               rush into civil war. I do not think any num-

               I ﬁnd this passage in the speech of the

               hon. and gallant knight at the head of 
               <br />
               the Government :—“At the time these mea- 
               <br />
               sures were resolved upon, the country was 
               <br />
               bordering on civil strife, and he would ask if 
               <br />
               it was not the duty of both sides to do all 
               <br />
               the could to prevent the unfortunate results 
               <br />
               which would have followed.” Well, I see it 
               <br />
               is the term “civil strife” that is used instead 
               <br />
               of “ civil war.” (Laughter.) But it is used 
               <br />
               in the same sense as the term “ civil war." 
               <br />
               The French version of our oﬂicial reports 
               <br />
               has “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guerre</span> civile.” I think it is most un- 
               <br />
               fortunate to hear hon. members of the Gov-
