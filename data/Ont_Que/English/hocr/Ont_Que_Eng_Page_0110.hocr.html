               <br />
               realestate alone. This is correct; but I fancy 
               <br />
               it matters little to us upon what species of 
               <br />

               <br />
               or in Newfoundland base their qualiﬁcation. 
               <br />
               Here in Canada real estate is abundant; eve 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               one can obtain it; and admittedly by all it is 
               <br />
               the best qualiﬁcation, if it be advisable to 
               <br />
               have any prope qualiﬁcation at all. But 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland 1t would be exceedingly in- 
               <br />
               convenient to enforce such a rule. The pub- 
               <br />
               lic lands there are not even surveyed to any 
               <br />
               considerable extent; the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wople</span> are almost 
               <br />
               entime engaged in ﬁshing and commercial 
               <br />
               pursuits, and to require a real estate qualiﬁ- 
               <br />
               cation would be practically to exclude some 
               <br />
               of its best public men from the islative 
               <br />
               Council. Then in Prince Edward sland a

               large portion of the island is held in exten-

               sive tracts by absentee proprietors and leased 
               <br />

               <br />
               been the result, and there would be some

               ﬁrst. I apprehend, however, there is no doubt 
               <br />
               whatever as regards that. Clause 14 says: 
               <br />
               “the ﬁrst selection of the members to constitute 
               <br />
               the Federal Legislative Council shall be made 
               <br />
               from the members of the now existing legis- 
               <br />
               lative councils, by the Crown, at the recom- 
               <br />
               mendation of the General Executive Govern-

               ment, upon the nomination of the respective 
               <br />
               local governments.” The clear meaning of 
               <br />
               this clause simply is, that the present gov- 
               <br />
               ernments of the several rovinces are to 
               <br />
