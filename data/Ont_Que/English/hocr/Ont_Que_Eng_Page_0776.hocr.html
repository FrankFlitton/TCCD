               There is the express declaration of two 
               <br />
               Ministers of the Crown that this measure, 
               <br />
               before it would become law, should be sub— 
               <br />
               mitted to the people. (Hear, hear.) Now, 
               <br />
               is the course indicated that which has been 
               <br />
               adopted? Is the scheme to be submitted to 
               <br />
               the people ? N o; they bring down the scheme 
               <br />
               and say that it must be passed in its entiret , 
               <br />
               and eo far from submitting it to the peep e, 
               <br />
               they mpve the previous question to prevent 
               <br />
               the possibility 0 an amendment to that effect 
               <br />
               being put. Some members who have pre- 
               <br />
               ceded me contended that it would be un- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> to submit it to the people, and 
               <br />
               they cited cases in support of their argument. 
               <br />
               But in those cases, Parliament had full 
               <br />
               power to dispose of the question then before 
               <br />
