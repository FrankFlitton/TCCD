               observing that it demonstrates that on every

               encroachments and antagonism of the English 
               <br />

               <br />
               a remarkable fact that during the whole time

               fused us our most just demands and the

               control of the general administration. Still 
               <br />
               more, the most arbitrary acts were thrust upon 
               <br />

               moreover, by colonial English fanaticism,

               which lost no opportunity of turning its well— 
               <br />
               known exclusiveness to our disadvantage. But 
               <br />
               so soon as their countrymen exceeded us in 
               <br />

               <br />
               tained a preponderance in the House of 
               <br />
               Assembly by means of the union of 1840, the 
               <br />
               English authorities granted us all the political 
               <br />
               rights for which we had asked in vain for a 
               <br />
               century. They perfectly well knew that those 
               <br />
               rights would be controlled, and in case of 
               <br />

               <br />
               the patriotism of our men of that day, we 
               <br />
               succeeded in baﬂling the schemes of the Brit—

               <br />
               had had to keep up a constant struggle, 
               <br />
               marked by a degree of heroism worthy of the

               lish autocracy, which was banded together 
               <br />
               against our countrymen. We, their descend-

               <br />
               children of the soil. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> Let us 
               <br />
               now see what was the condition of the liberty 
               <br />
               of the press and of the liberty of the subject 
               <br />
               at this gloomy period of our parliamentary 
               <br />
               history. The Canadien having dared to ask 
               <br />
               for responsible government, and Mr. BÉDARD 
               <br />

               twenty-one'against nine in favor of the voting 
               <br />
               of the supplies, the Executive Council re- 
               <br />
               solved at any cost to injure the inﬂuence of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               tion, and on the deposition of two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               dividuals, caused the printing oﬂice to be 
               <br />
               seized by a squad of soldiers, its contents 
               <br />
               to be conveyed to the vaults of the 
               <br />

               a charge of treasonable practices. And this 
               <br />
               act of tyranny was grounded on the fact that 
               <br />
               these political mart had had the courage 
               <br />
               to demand for Canada the right of voting the 
               <br />
               supplies! The Canadien gave an account of 
               <br />
               this atrocious imprisonment in the following 
               <br />

               sentative of the people was cast into prison 
               <br />
               for having asked for the granting of a right 
               <br />
