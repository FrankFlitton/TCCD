               before the debate closes, the Government

               will see the propriety and the advisability of

               granting the reasonable delay therein asked 
               <br />

               <br />
               the short delay of one month, it can do no

               over for a month will certainly not destroy

               it. If, on the other hand, it be bad-—-if it 
               <br />
               contain within itself the elements of decay—— 
               <br />
               it is better to know it now than hereafter,

               If my hon. friend will consult the Journals

               of Parliament, he will ﬁnd there petitions for 
               <br />

               <br />

               rance of the facts of the case—although he 
               <br />

               <br />
               before bringing it under the notice ot the 
               <br />
               House. He said that a House appointed by 
               <br />
               the Crown would be more responsible to the 
               <br />
               people than the present House. That, hon.

               gentlemen, is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cenainly</span> a new doctrine to 
               <br />
               me. If such would be the case, why, I ask, 
               <br />
               do you not apply the same system to the 
               <br />
               other branch of the Legislature? ln such

               an event I feel assured that the Government 
               <br />
               of the day would have a much more comfort- 
               <br />
               able and pleasant life of it than even the 
               <br />
               present Government, strong and talented as 
               <br />
               they undoubtedly are. (Laughter.) But, 
               <br />
               says my hon. friend. once more, the peeple 
               <br />
               of Canada are in favor of the scheme, in
