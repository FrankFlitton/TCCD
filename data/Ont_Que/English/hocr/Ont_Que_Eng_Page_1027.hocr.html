               friend from South Oxford with deceiving us 
               <br />

               <br />

               the honorable gentleman found to be palatable.

               measure that is at variance with English

               the assistance of their political supporters, 
               <br />
               suddenly to change our Constitution, and take 
               <br />
               away our liberties, then, forsooth, are we not 
               <br />
               to take our own course as to whether or not 
               <br />
               we shall ask that their measure shall be 
               <br />
               referred to those who sent us here ? The 
               <br />
               Hon. Attorney General West scouts the idea 
               <br />
               of our being delegated only to work under the 
               <br />
               Constitution that we have. He forgets that 
               <br />
               when we make laws <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under‘our</span> Constitution, 
               <br />
               we can change them ourselves at any time; 
               <br />
               but when we make a Constitution, and have 
               <br />
               it ratiﬁed by the Imperial Government, it 
               <br />
               does not lie in our power to change it by a 
               <br />
               simple resolution of this House. He dwelt 
               <br />
               strongly on his belief that we were the repre- 
               <br />
               .tative men of our constituencies, and that 
               <br />
               through us the people had a voice in this 
               <br />
               House. Well, if we were legislating for 
               <br />
               ourselves, and for our own people, under our 
               <br />
               Constitution as it stands, then I admit that 
               <br />
               we would be fully justiﬁed in canying out 
               <br />
               any scheme that we might deem essential for 
               <br />
               the welfare of the province at large, or for any 
               <br />
               portion of it; but when he carries that 
               <br />
               princi le so far as to say that we ought not to 
               <br />
               vote or having a measure of _this kind— 
               <br />
               whieh will affect other provinces as well as 
               <br />
               our own—referred to the people, then, I say. 
               <br />
               he carries the principle to a most unwarrant- 
               <br />
               able length. (Hear, hear.) 'What can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> 
               <br />
               advance in justiﬁcation of such a course? 
               <br />
               He talks about it being unconstitutional. 
               <br />
               Why, they understand constitutional law in 
               <br />
