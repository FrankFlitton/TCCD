               ment. (Hear, hear.) The people are so 
               <br />
               thoroughly m earnest on this question, that I 
               <br />
               am persuaded they are prepared to give a fair 
               <br />
               trial to any scheme which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offers</span> a reasonable

               satisfactory state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) 
               <br />
               There are, in my opinion, two methods by 
               <br />
               which this may be done. The ﬁrst is a le- 
               <br />
               gislative union between Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Can:1d:1,bas'ed upon representation by popu- 
               <br />
               lation , the second is by a F ederal union either 
               <br />
               between the two Canadas or between all the 
               <br />
               B1itisl1 North American Provinces. Unless 
               <br />
               one or other of these two remedies is speedily 
               <br />
               applied, there is great danger that an entire 
               <br />
               separation of the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> may ultimate- 
               <br />
               ly take place, which, in my opinion, would 
               <br />
               rove fatal to our existence as a British 
               <br />
               colony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(dear,</span> hear.) Our proximity to 
               <br />
               the United States makes it necessary that 
               <br />
               the union should be maintained at almost any 
               <br />
               cost. In order to effect a change in our Con- 
               <br />
               stitution, it is highly desirable to obtain the 
               <br />
               censent of a majority of the representatives of 
               <br />
               both sections of the province; for, although a 
               <br />
               scheme might be adopted by the majority of 
               <br />
               one section, aided by the minority of the 
               <br />
               other section, it would not give such general 
               <br />
               satisfaction as could be desired. The de- 
               <br />
               mands made by the people of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               for representation by population under the 
               <br />
               existing union, have hitherto been resisted 
               <br />
               by the people of Lower Canada with a degree 
               <br />
               of determination that has convinced even the 
               <br />
               most sanguine advocates of that measure 
               <br />
               that it is impracticable, at least for some 
               <br />
               time to come. Admitting, then, that re- 
               <br />
               presentation by population under the exist- 
               <br />
               ing union cannot be obtained, I think it is our 
               <br />
               duty to endeavor to ﬁnd some other solution 
               <br />
               of our sectional diﬁiculties. In my opinion 
               <br />
               the formation of a system of government based 
               <br />
               upon the Federal principle, with a Central 
               <br />
               Parliament which shall have the control of 
               <br />
               matters common to all the provinces, and a 
               <br />
               Local Legislature for each province to man- 
               <br />
               age local affairs, is the only system which will 
               <br />
               prove satisfactory to the people of these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Such is the scheme now under dis- 
               <br />
               cussion by this House. It is said by some 
               <br />
               ot' the opponents of the present scheme that 
               <br />
               there is no necessity for a chmge, that the 
               <br />
               people of Upper Canada have abandoned 
               <br />
               their agitation for constitutional reform, and 
               <br />
               that they are perfectly content to go on as they 
               <br />
               I can only say to those honorable gen-

               <br />
               in order to keep pace with the ordinary 
               <br />
               gress of events; and we generally ﬁnd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>

               those great political changes which result in

               <br />
               scheme, we should divest our minds as much 
               <br />

               the prejudices which are to be overcome, it is 
               <br />
               evident that we must consider this scheme in 
               <br />
               the spirit of compromise. Mutual conces- 
               <br />

               without doing an injustice to any. In refer-

               ence to the scheme now before the House, 
               <br />

               that can be obtained under our nliar cir-
