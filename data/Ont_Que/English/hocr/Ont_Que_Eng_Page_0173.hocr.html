               The people of England very truly said we had 
               <br />
               now grown up so as to be able, to some ex- 
               <br />
               tent at least, to protect ourselves, and while 
               <br />
               they did not expect us to maintain the whole 
               <br />
               st le unaided, they yet demanded that we 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shit-:53</span> do our part. This done, according to 
               <br />
               the measure of our ability, we would have 
               <br />
               nothing to fear, and the union would enable 
               <br />
               us to do better than we otherwise could. 
               <br />
               There might still be a feeling among a few of 
               <br />
               our people in favor of annexation to the 
               <br />
               Unitedâ€˜ States, but it was limited to a very 
               <br />
               small number indeed, if it existed at all. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Some years back he thought 
               <br />
               the feeling prevailed to some extent, but the 
               <br />
               unhappy war in the adjoining country had 
               <br />
               led to a very great change in this respect. 
               <br />
               He deplored that dreadful war, and would 
               <br />
               deprecate the possibility of a rupture of our 
               <br />
               present peaceful relations with that country. 
               <br />
               He hoped we would still continue to live 
               <br />
               upon amicable terms, and was convinced 
               <br />
               that if war did arise, it would not be ro- 
               <br />
               voked by us. They were a great an a 
               <br />
               powerful people, and he hoped they would con- 
               <br />
               tinue in the future to treat us kindly as they 
               <br />
               had done in the past; but it could not be 
               <br />
               denied that of late they had shewn a different 
               <br />
               disposition. They had passed a measure to 
               <br />
               repeal the Reciprocity Treaty, which had been 
               <br />
               of so much advantage to the two countries; 
               <br />
               a repeal which, two or three years ago, they 
               <br />
               had no purpose whatever to bring about; but 
               <br />
               he thought a change might yet take place, and 
               <br />
               that after all the treaty would not be abolished. 
               <br />
               At the same time, if it were abolished, he did 
               <br />
               not think we would be ruined altogether, but 
               <br />
               expected that intercourse with the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinoes would, in a great degree, make up the 
               <br />
               loss. It might be, however, that we could 
               <br />
               yet pass through the States, but if not, and 
               <br />
               we were restricted to our own channels of 
               <br />
               communication, we must do the best we can. 
               <br />
               He trusted the amendment of the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Sherbrooke (Hon. Ma. SANBORN) 
               <br />
               would be voted down, and that the measure as 
               <br />
               it was would pass in its integrity. The Con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the Federal Legislature had been 
               <br />
               adepted in a council of our leading <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politiciens,</span> 
               <br />
               some of whom had all along been opposed to

               elective legislative councils, amongst others,

               GEORGE BROWN). And the people, he verily 
               <br />
               believed, did not wish to see the principle 
               <br />
               prevail. He had no doubt the Crown would 
               <br />
               make wise selections as it had generally done 
               <br />
               before, and though mistakes might in some

               <br />
               reasonably ask, but it was a fact that the power 
               <br />
               granted had in many instances been abused. 
               <br />
               Many municipalities have been nearly ruined. 
               <br />
               They contracted loans, and instead of applying 
               <br />
               the money in a way to forward the public 
               <br />
               weal, a good deal of it had gone into the 
               <br />
               pockets of the borrowers. (Hear, hear.) He 
               <br />
               desired to prevent a recurrence of such th' 
               <br />
               When the Municipal Loan Fund Bill was 
               <br />
               passed, great advantages had been expected 
               <br />
               from it, and great improvements had been 
               <br />
               projected, some of which, he was free to say, 
               <br />
               had been carried out, but some of the munici- 
               <br />
               palities had misapplied and wasted the money, 
               <br />
               and now they were asking the Government 
               <br />
               for delay to enable them to pay the interest. 
               <br />
               In making these remarks he had no intention 
               <br />
               of saying aught that could be disagreeable, 
               <br />
               and if he had done so he prayed it might be 
               <br />
               overlooked. He had taken an active art in 
               <br />
               the legislature, especially in the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">branch,</span> 
               <br />
               in years gone by, and had always acted in- 
               <br />
               dependently, and he thought it was the duty 
               <br />
               of public men to follow the dictates of their 
               <br />
               own convictions in preference to the solicita- 
               <br />
               tions of friends. Having done so in the past, 
               <br />
               he would try to do so in the future. He would 
               <br />
               close by expressing the hope that the resolu- 
               <br />
