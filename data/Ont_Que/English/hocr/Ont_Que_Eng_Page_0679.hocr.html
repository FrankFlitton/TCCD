               HON. J. H. CAMERON—There is one 
               <br />
               point on which I should like an explaination

               from the Hon. Attorney General West. He

               <br />

               July or August, but the appropriation for the

               HON. Mn. GALT—I will answer the 
               <br />
               question put by my honorable friend to the 
               <br />
               Hon. Attorney General West. The intention 
               <br />
               of the Government is to ask such a vote of 
               <br />
               credit from this House, as in their opinion 
               <br />
               the necessities of the country will demand, 
               <br />
               until the period when Parliament may again 
               <br />
               be called together. With reference to that, 
               <br />
               I would remind the House that the ordinary 
               <br />
               supplies have been voted up to the 30th June, 
               <br />
               and this will have to be borne in mind in 
               <br />
               considering the sum the House will be asked 
               <br />
               to vote. The Government will unquestion- 
               <br />
               ably have in view the continuance of the 
               <br />
               protection of the frontier. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               As the Hon. Attorney General has stated 
               <br />
               the intention of the Government is to 
               <br />
               meet Parliament again, so soon as they 
               <br />
               are in a position to state to them frankly the 
               <br />
               views of the Imperial Government; and 
               <br />
               that of course, to a certain extent, depends 
               <br />
               on the time during which they may be de- 
               <br />
               layed in London in getting a ﬁnal answer. 
               <br />
               But the intention of the Government is to 
               <br />
               lose no time in meeting Parliament again. 
               <br />

               word or two to say. The Government have 
               <br />
               changed their policy so quickly, that we can 
               <br />
               now place no reliance on the statements of 
               <br />
               Ministers of the Crown. I have not the 
               <br />
               slightest doubt that hon. gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches at this moment contem- 
               <br />
               plate—and I ask the attention of the House 
               <br />
               to what I am saying, because it is a bold 
               <br />
               statement 1 am to make—I say it is my 
               <br />
               deliberate opinion, that if we pass these resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, the gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
               <br />
               will go home and ﬁnd a justiﬁcation in Eng- 
               <br />
               land for manufacturing a bill of perhaps an 
               <br />
               entirely diﬁ'erent character, that will cover all 
               <br />
               points, and that they will come back and 
               <br />
               force that on the people of this country at 
               <br />
               all hazards, having embodied in it what— 
               <br />
               ever regulations they please as to schools, 
               <br />
               and whether there shall be one House 
               <br />
               or two Houses in the Local Parliament, 
               <br />
               and all other such matters. I am satisﬁed 
               <br />
               that that is their plan. They know 
               <br />
               well they cannot go to an unwilling people 
               <br />
