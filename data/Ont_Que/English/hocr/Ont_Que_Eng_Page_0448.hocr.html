               course of the House was a revolutionary one, 
               <br />

               <br />
               but still a revolution. It implied the opinion 
               <br />
               on the part of our public men, that our 
               <br />
               present system could not be gone on with; 
               <br />
               and if our present system cannot be continued, 
               <br />
               we ought not to attempt to throw out this

               desirable that all the members from Lower

               <br />
               that when the measure came down and we 
               <br />

               think the measure entirely faultless that I

               denied that with a population of three millions 
               <br />
               and a half, it will be absolutely necessary for

               <br />
               Country for protection. (Hear, hear.) I took 
               <br />
               occasion to express these views last car, when 
               <br />
               discussing the estimates, and sai I hoped 
               <br />
               the Government would bring down a measure 
               <br />
               to pay a large portion of the expenditure at- 
               <br />
               tendant on the maintenance, by the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government, of British tr00ps amen us. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Portugal, with a population as 
               <br />
               nearly as can be equal to our own, has a 
               <br />
               standing army of 17,000 men. Holland, with 
               <br />
               about the same pepulation as ourselves at 
               <br />
               home, but with extensive colonies abroad, has 
               <br />
               a standing army of 57,600 men. Denmark, 
               <br />
               with a population not quite equal to one half 
               <br />
               what the Confederacy will possess, has an 
               <br />
               army of 22,900 men. Now I do not think it 
               <br />
               will beatall necessary for us to maintain a 
               <br />
               standing army like these nations. I do not 
               <br />
               think we are in the same position as these 
               <br />
               countries, because our wealth is, to a great 
               <br />
               extent, not realized. It would be hardly fair 
               <br />
               to assess some of our new counties, where 
               <br />
               people own nothing but their land, at the 
               <br />
               nominal value of that land, for the purpose of 
               <br />
               paying a large standing army; and besides we 
               <br />
               have no colonies, no outside sources of wealth. 
               <br />
               I think, however, we are nearly as well able, 
               <br />
               man for man, to maintain a force necessa
