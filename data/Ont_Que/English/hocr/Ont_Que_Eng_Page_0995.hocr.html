               <br />
               guarantee it for us. If they will do that, 
               <br />
               they will ﬁnd that these provinces are 
               <br />
               willing and ready to make all due provision 
               <br />
               for their defence. This province is only one 
               <br />
               of a number which are equally bound to 
               <br />
               defend themselves with us, as I believe they 
               <br />
               have the spirit and inclination to do. I fancy 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd as much loyalty in the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces as in Canada, and you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that when we are ready to aid the Mother 
               <br />
               Country in defence of this portion of her 
               <br />
               territory, they will be ready too; and as they 
               <br />
               are now united to the Mother Country as 
               <br />
               well as ourselves, we could be in no better 
               <br />
               position for defence through the contem- 
               <br />
               plated union. The union cannot make us 
               <br />
               stronger, when we have to look to the Impe- 
               <br />
               rial power as the bond that keeps us together 
               <br />
               under any circumstances. It is to them we 
               <br />
               shall look for orders when the time comes to 
               <br />
               act. I am not one of those who like to look 
               <br />
               at the idea of the severance of the bond 
               <br />
               between this and the Mother Country, but 
               <br />
               yet I feel that if Upper Canada is burdened 
               <br />
               more heavily than she has been by the addi- 
               <br />
               tional burdens which this Federal union 
               <br />
               must impose to sustain its costly machinery, 
               <br />
               there will be great danger of the same state 
               <br />
               of things being brought about which ren- 
               <br />
               dered some change necessary at the present 
               <br />
               time. It cannot but be felt that this scheme 
               <br />
               has not been brought forward with a view 
               <br />
               to more econémical government, or with a 
               <br />
               view to providing the best means of union 
               <br />
               that could be obtained, but that it had its 
               <br />
               origin in expediency and compromise. The 
               <br />
               peeple of Canada felt compelled to seek 
               <br />
               some change, and the people of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, if they adop‘t the measure, will 
               <br />
               in a sense have it forced upon them by the 
               <br />
               people of Canada. A scheme has been 
               <br />
               adopted which it is thought will prove the 
               <br />
               most expedient for the time being, but 
               <br />
               which must be changed in the course of a 
               <br />
               few years, after leading us into contentions 
               <br />
               and strife, such as we have had for the past 
               <br />
               ten years. Why not pause and discuss the 
               <br />
               measure more thoroughly, and have it weed- 
               <br />
               ed of its defects, so that we may accomplish 
               <br />
               at once the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction</span> of a Constitution 
               <br />
               that shall be a lasting one, and not risk the 
               <br />
               formation of a union on a Constitution that 
               <br />
               will tumble to pieces, and drive a large por-

               Here is what was said by that newspaper

               <br />
               Truly a charming scheme to be proposed by a
