               into this digression in consequence of the 
               <br />
               taunts and imputatiens cast upon us this 
               <br />
               evening by the leader of the House. We 
               <br />
               were obliged to him for saying, in his 
               <br />
               speech at the opening of this debate, that we 
               <br />
               are all loyal in this country; and yet the At- 
               <br />
               torney General East in his speech made on 
               <br />
               the following day, said there were annexation- 
               <br />
               ists here—there were the JOHN DOUGALL 
               <br />
               party and the extreme democratic party. It 
               <br />
               is not for me to reconcile the statements of the 
               <br />
               two honorable gentlemen. One says there 
               <br />
               are no annexationists, the other says there are. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Attorney General East spoke of 
               <br />
               an annexation sentiment in Montreal. Whe- 
               <br />
               ther he is.right or not, we know that that 
               <br />
               city became notorious for its annexation 
               <br />
               proclivities at a former time. With regard 
               <br />
               to the prosperity of the country, and its con- 
               <br />
               ditieu at this present time, I have some 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">observations</span> to make, and will leave the 
               <br />
               House to deduce therefrom. how far the 
               <br />
               Administration will be justiﬁable in asking 
               <br />
               from this House authority to make the out- 
               <br />
               lay which they may propose for purposes 
               <br />
               of defence. I have said that the cry of 
               <br />
               annexation has arisen from the attempt 
               <br />
               made by honorable gentlemen opposite to

               <br />
               model. And there is nothing more natural 
               <br />
               than, when the commerce of the country is 
               <br />
               at a stand-still, when indebtedness presses 
               <br />
               hard and heavy upon the farmers and

               and embarrassments have overtaken us 
               <br />
               —and the result will be that the policy of

               honorable gentlemen opposite with regard to 
               <br />
               this question will make people look to the 
               <br />
               States, in spite of themselves. I wish to 
               <br />
               shew that the state of the country ten years 
               <br />
               ago was much more prosperous than it is 
               <br />
               new. The condition in which we found our- 
               <br />
               selves in 1852 and 1853 justiﬁed us to a great 
               <br />
               extent in going into a large indebtedness for 
               <br />
               the Grand Trunk. And probably the healthy 
               <br />
               condition of the farming interest and of every 
               <br />
               branch of trade at that time, justiﬁed to some 
               <br />
               extent the enactment of the Municipal Loan 
               <br />
               Fund Act, which enabled municipalities to 
               <br />
               borrow money for all sorts of improvements. 
               <br />
               Having referred to the state of prosperity 
               <br />
               which then prevailed, I shall next allude to 
               <br />
               the cause, which, in my judgment, more 
               <br />
               than anything else contributed to produce 
               <br />
               the disastrous difﬁculties which have since 
               <br />
               overtaken the country. I ﬁrst quote from the 
               <br />
               despatch of Lord ELGIN in 1852, to show 
               <br />
               what was our condition about that period, when 
               <br />
               transmitting to the Colonial Oüce the Ca- 
               <br />
               nadian Blue Book for the previous year :— 
               <br />
               I had the honor with my despatch, No. 2, 
               <br />
               on the 9th Septem r, to transmit two copies of 
               <br />
               “ Tables of the Trade and Navi ation of the Pro- . 
               <br />

               <br />
               Blue Book, together with a printed co y of the

               “ Accounts of the Province,’ and of a port by

               the Commissioner of Public Works for the same 
               <br />
               ear. These documents furnish much gratif ing 
               <br />
               evidence of the re ss and prosperity o the 
               <br />
               colony, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justify</span> t e antici tions On this head 
               <br />
               expressed in my despatch, o. 94, of the 1st 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">August,</span> 1851, which accompanied the Blue Book 
               <br />
               of 1860. 
               <br />
               That is the ‘oﬁcial statement made by the 
               <br />
               then Governor General to the Mother Country. 
               <br />
               And what does he say in the following year? 
               <br />
               In 1853, after going over a number of facts, 
               <br />
               shewing‘ the advancement of trade and com- 
               <br />
               merce, and the general progress of the 
               <br />
               country, he says, in the last sentence but one .
