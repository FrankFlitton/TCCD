               Observe, Mr. SPEAKER, that these enormous 
               <br />
               amounts are not in dollars, but pounds ster- 
               <br />

               dollars of our money. This is information

               for those who think that colonies are of no

               of England, know perfectly well that she is 
               <br />
               an essentially commercial nation-—perhaps 
               <br />
               the most commercial nation‘ in the world— 
               <br />

               found in its commerce the chief element of 
               <br />
               its strength ; for with commerce comes 
               <br />
               money, from money men to carry on its 
               <br />
               wars. The ancient Romans knew how to

               <br />
               but they did not know how to keep them, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Accordingly, when the English make them- 
               <br />
               selves masters of any territory, you imme- 
               <br />

               build stores, ﬁnd out the resources of the 
               <br />
               country, and next come a body of soldiers 
               <br />
               to second the authority ot justice,and enforce 
               <br />
               respect for law and order. In a short space

               SPEAKER, England is bound to keep us. 
               <br />
               Losing us, she would, at a future day, lose 
               <br />
               her West Indian possessions, and would enter 
               <br />
               on the ﬁrst phase of an eclipse which she is 
               <br />
               too far-seeing not to anticipate and avoid. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) England sees with pleasure 
               <br />
               the eﬁ'crts which our Government is making 
               <br />
               to carry out the union of all the provinces, 
               <br />
               and looks upon our future un ion as a step in 
               <br />
               the right direction—the only practical 
               <br />
               means of increasing our resources and 
               <br />
               strengthening our power. One word, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, on the appeal to the people. 
               <br />
               There are three classes of men in society: 
               <br />
               those who deceive, those who are deceived, 
               <br />

               <br />
               deceived. I take my place advisedly among 
               <br />
               the last.

               the plan and all the details relating to the 
               <br />
               local governments, would be an absurdity; 
               <br />
               for it would be a double appeal to the pee; le

               expense and trouble, both for the country 
               <br />
               and the members. We must bear in mind 
               <br />
               that after the two elections constituting the 
               <br />
               double appeal to the people, we must have 
               <br />

               one of the deceived; and I should be so in 
               <br />
               a striking degree if I allowed myself to be 
               <br />
               cajoled by the gentle put-rings of the 
               <br />
               Opposition, who make a show of agitation 
               <br />
               for the appeal to the people, only that they 
               <br />
               may have an opportunity, at any cost, of 
               <br />
               defeating the scheme at Confederation. I 
               <br />
               maintain, Mr. SPEAKER, that the Opposition 
               <br />
               have not the slightest wish to go to the
