               his seat in this House-also addressed a 
               <br />
               large meeting, but with the same result as 
               <br />
               in the previous case. The only opposition 
               <br />
               which was manifested throughout the con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               points of detail. (_ Hear, hear.) The Consti-

               tution of the Legislative Council was the 
               <br />
               principal one referred to, my Opponent 
               <br />
               contending that the Upper House should 
               <br />
               continue an elective body, as at present, 
               <br />
               instead of being a nominated Chamber, as it 
               <br />
               is proposed to make it. I can sustain the view 
               <br />
               taken by the Hon. President of the Council 
               <br />
               in his opening address the other evening, 
               <br />
               when he said he would not hesitate to go 
               <br />
               into any liberal constituency in Western 
               <br />
               Canada and obtain their sanction to this 
               <br />
               principle. (Hear, hear.) Such at all events 
               <br />
               was the result in South Ontario. I am free 
               <br />
               to admit that a change was not asked for in 
               <br />
               the constitution of the Legislative Council; 
               <br />
               but although the resolutions make the 
               <br />
               change, there is a feeling abroad in the 
               <br />
               country that on this account the scheme as 
               <br />
               a whole should not be rejected. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Whenever a point was attempted to 
               <br />
               be made against me that I was endeavoring, 
               <br />
               by my advocacy of the nominative principle, 
               <br />
               to build up an aristocracy in this country, 
               <br />
               and that the result would be the locking up 
               <br />
               of the lands of the province in the hands of 
               <br />
               a privileged class, I replied that such had 
               <br />
               not been the case in the past, and that in a 
               <br />
               country like ours such could never be its 
               <br />
               results; and I further stated that the leader 
               <br />
               cf the Reform party, the Hon. President of 
               <br />
               the Council, had himself stood almost alone 
               <br />
               on his side of the House in 1850, in resist- 
               <br />
               ing the change from the nominative to the 
               <br />
               elective principle. My desire, sir, is to see 
               <br />
               the union carried out only on a fair and 
               <br />
               equitable basis, and this, I think, is likely 
               <br />
