               together. And now, when the proposition is 
               <br />
               brought before this House to place the matter 
               <br />
               before the people, we are told that there are 
               <br />
               certain precedents against such a course, 
               <br />
               such as the union of Scotland and the union 
               <br />
               of Ireland, which I am sure must- be parti- 
               <br />
               cularly strong in the view of my friend the 
               <br />
               Honorable Minister of Agriculture. We are 
               <br />
               told that we must accept this scheme at once 
               <br />
               without a moment’s delay, or it would slip 
               <br />
               through our ﬁngers. I feel, sir, that this is 
               <br />
               a point which ought to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made—that</span> the 
               <br />
               ground on which this motion is opposed, that 
               <br />
               the peeple having elected their representa- 
               <br />
               tives, they have a right to look to them. And 
               <br />
               if this country was annexed to the United 
               <br />
               States, if this Parliament is supreme, if it is 
               <br />
               able to u set one Constitution, why not an- 
               <br />
               other? he doctrine is a new one. It ma 
               <br />
               be fortiﬁed by strong precedents, but it is 
               <br />
               not fortiﬁed by constitutional practice in 
               <br />
               this country—it is not fortiﬁed by the opinion 
               <br />
               of the people of this country, which is, that 
               <br />
               the representative is not elected to frame its 
               <br />
               Constitution. It is said by the honorable 
               <br />
               member for South Oxford that a number of 
               <br />
               elections have taken place, and that the people 
               <br />
               are in favor of the scheme. But what elections 
               <br />
               have taken place? There have been a few 
               <br />
               for the Upper House; but even the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for South Ontario, a gentleman who comes 
               <br />
               in for a Ministerial constituency represented 
               <br />
               formerly by the present Vice-Chancellor of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, even that honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               is defeated and another gentleman is elected 
               <br />
               in his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place.</span> That honorable gentleman is 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst fruits of the elections, and he comes 
               <br />
               here and tells us that he pledged himself to 
               <br />
               his constituents that this subject should be 
               <br />
               appealed to the people—and more than that, 
               <br />
               he tells us that they were afraid he Would

               is an unhappy day for this country when it is

               MR. JOS PH DUFRESNE—I did not

               a statement made by the honorable member

               Canada upon this question were about equally

               of the peeple in Lower Canada look upon an 
               <br />
               election as an oath—they want to use it only

               parties in Lower Canada in favor of an elec-

               <br />
               to it. There are also a few honorable gentle-

               men in this House who may be in favor of it, 
               <br />
               but in my opinion the are wrong. I can 
               <br />
               class those who are in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fiver</span> of an election in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada—these are the Rouges. Under 
               <br />
               the present circumstances, they say:—“ We 
               <br />
               are only about ﬁfteen or sixteen ; what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ-</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               number; and who knows that the States will 
               <br />
               not come here in our country with a few 
               <br />
               thousand greenbacks and help us ?” (Laugh- 
               <br />
               ter.) I only say this as a supposition. Then 
               <br />
               the second is the class who sell liquor in the 
               <br />
               day, and those who sell without a license— 
               <br />
               who are almost looked upon as public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">robbers.</span> 
               <br />
               The third class are the drunkards—those who 
               <br />
               go on a spree for several days and pay nothing 
               <br />
               for it. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) Every- 
               <br />
               one knows that the accounts are sent in and 
               <br />
               are paid. Of course these words are not 
               <br />
               applicable to any one in this House; but those 
               <br />
               are the only ones who are in favor of an elec-

               tion. The bulk of the people are opposed to 
               <br />
               it; they consider it as an immorality ; and if 
               <br />
               any one doubts that, I wish they would go out 
               <br />
               into my part of the country and inquire for

               MB. A. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">D</span> ACKENZ E—The language 
               <br />
               used by the hon. member for North Ontario,

               <br />
               that there was any serious agitation in Upper 
               <br />

               boldly asserted that an arrangement could

               <br />
               the people could get on. Now, here is the 
               <br />
               language he used some years ago. In his 
               <br />
               speech on the Address in 1862, the following 
               <br />
