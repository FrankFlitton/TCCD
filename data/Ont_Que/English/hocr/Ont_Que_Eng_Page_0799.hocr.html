               <br />
               has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explained</span> to us that the intention of the 
               <br />
               members of the Conference of Quebec was, 
               <br />
               not only that the French language should be 
               <br />
               usedin the Federal Legislature and the Local 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion. he honorable gentleman has also told 
               <br />
               us that the word <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘!</span> marriage” inserted in the 
               <br />
               resolutions does not signify anything else but 
               <br />
               what he explained to the House in his speech, 
               <br />
               and that we ought to be happy to see that the 
               <br />
               representatives of .the French population at 
               <br />
               the Conference had thus secured the safety 
               <br />
               of their civil and religious institutions. For 
               <br />
               my part, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> I must say that I 
               <br />
               cannot bring myself, like the honorable mem-

               ber, to see the splendid protection he vaunts 
               <br />
               so highly. If the resolutions now before this 
               <br />
               House have any meaning, that meaning is only 
               <br />
               to be derived from the strict letter of the 
               <br />
               resolutions themselves. It will always be 
               <br />

               and they may at any time say to us: “You 
               <br />
               cannot have it, we oppose it, and the Consti— 
               <br />
               tution does not confer on you the rights you 
               <br />
               claim under it.” And-it will be the more 
               <br />
               easy for them to do so from the fact that the 
               <br />
               resolution does not aﬁrm that these matters 
               <br />
               cannot be disturbed. If the Conference had 
               <br />
               any other intention than what appears in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               of it before being called upon to vote on these 
               <br />
               resolutions. For if the intention of the Con- 
               <br />
               ference was as stated by the Honorable Soli- 
               <br />
               citor General for Lower Canada, and if that 
               <br />
               intention be carried into effect, the Housewill 
               <br />
               run the risk of discovering that on all the 
               <br />
               other resolutions the intention. is diﬁ'ereut 
               <br />
               from the letter, and will be in like manner 
               <br />
               carried out, for the resolutions must be inter- 
               <br />
               preted as they stand, without reference to 
               <br />
               the intention of the members of the Confer- 
               <br />
               ence. And for that reason I cannot help de- 
               <br />
               claring that we French-Canadians would be 
               <br />
               guilty of an act oi unpardonable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imprndmce</span> 
               <br />
               in adopting a resolution which declares that 
               <br />
               the Federal Legislature is to have the right 
               <br />
               of legislating on marriage and divorce, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nd</span> 
               <br />
               which merely declares that the French lau-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wage</span> may be used in the Federal Legislature. 
               <br />
               e French-Canadian members, I repeat it, 
               <br />
               ought to insist that the word “ shall” be sub- 
               <br />
               stituted for the word “ may” in the resolution 
               <br />

               <br />
               take every possible precaution, sonner or later 
               <br />
               the English speaking majority in the Federal

               ada, we shall be told when we exclaim against 
               <br />
               that injustice: “You should have obtained

               more full and complete guarantees, and you 
               <br />
               should have seen that the Constitution was- 
               <br />
               made more explicit and more precise on this 
               <br />
               point.” Ann we shall have no answer to 
               <br />
               make. We must perforce be resigned, and 
               <br />
               put up with all the restrictions the majority
