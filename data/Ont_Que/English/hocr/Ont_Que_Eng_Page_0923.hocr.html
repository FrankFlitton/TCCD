               MB. SCOBLE—If I were to consult my own 
               <br />
               feelings or my convenience, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               I should certainly not rise at this advanced 
               <br />
               period of the debate, to offer any observations 
               <br />
               on the great question which has now been 
               <br />
               so long under discussion ; but having some- 
               <br />
               what- altered the o inions that I entertained 
               <br />
               ot the scheme su mitted 'to the House by 
               <br />
               the Government, I feel it necessary to make 
               <br />
               a few remarks in explanation and vindi- 
               <br />
               cation of the vote I intend to give. In 
               <br />
               approaching the consideration of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion, I shall divest myself, as far as possible, 
               <br />
               of all party predilections, of all personal 
               <br />
               preferences, and of all sectional jealousies, 
               <br />
               and shall endeavor to discuss it upon its 
               <br />
               merits, fairly and impartially- ﬁrst, with 
               <br />
               reference to the great diﬂiculties which un- 
               <br />
               happily exist between Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada; and, secondly, in relation to the pro- 
               <br />
               posed union of the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces for purposes and objects common 
               <br />
               to them all. These branches of the main 
               <br />
               question, or rather these two questions, are 
               <br />
               not necessarily connected, and may, there- 
               <br />
               fore, be discussed separately ; for it is possible 
               <br />
               we ma not be able immediately to secure 
               <br />
               the union of the provinces, and in that case 
               <br />
               .we shall still have to deal with the diﬂicul- 
               <br />
               ties of our own position, and try, if possible, 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd a satisfactory solution for them. 
               <br />
               (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> And ﬁrst, sir, with reference 
               <br />
               to the diﬂiculties which have so long dis- 
               <br />
               tracted and disturbed us, and which hitherto 
               <br />
               we have in vain attempted to remove. If 
               <br />
               we may believe the hon. member for Brome 
               <br />
               (Mr. DUNKIN), whom I regret to see is not 
               <br />
               in his place, the diﬂiculties to which I 
               <br />
               have referred are imaginary, not real. 
               <br />
               He told us, in his elaborate and exhaus- 
               <br />
               tive speech, that in Lower Canada the 
               <br />
               Catholic and non-Catholic, the English 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French-speaking</span> populations, were liv- 
               <br />
               ing in the most entire harmony with each 
               <br />
               other; and this statement was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬁrmed</span> by 
               <br />
               the honorable and learned gentleman the 
               <br />
               Hon. Atty. Gen. East (Hon. Mr. CARTIER), 
               <br />
               who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">declared</span> that so great was that har- 
               <br />
               mony, that he enjoyed the conﬁdence not 
               <br />
               only of the Catholic, but the Protestant sec- 
               <br />
               tion of the communit , and in fact repre- 
               <br />
               sented them both. ow, sir, I am not 
               <br />
               disposed to uestion the fact proclaimed by 
               <br />
               these honors le gentlemen; on the contrary, 
               <br />
               I fully believe it, and ascribe the oircum- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span>

               stance to their having common objects to 
               <br />
               pursue, and common interests to maintain. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Brome went further. He aﬁ'ected to believe 
               <br />
               that no diﬁculties of any moment existed 
               <br />
               between Upper and Lower Canada, and that. 
               <br />
               any dissatisfaction that had been manifested 
               <br />
               by the upper section of the province, might 
               <br />
               be easily removed without resorting to an 
               <br />
               organic change in our present Constitution. 
               <br />
               At least, so I understood the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man. On this point I am at issue with him, 
               <br />
               for I believe those diﬂiculties to be of a most 
               <br />
               formidable character, and that they threaten 
               <br />
               at no distant day, unless theybe adjusted, 
               <br />
               the peace and the rospcrity of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince—perhaps its isintegration—perhaps 
               <br />
               its annexation to the United States. Every 
               <br />
               lover of his country must deprecate such 
               <br />
               results, and. ought to strive to prevent them, 
               <br />
               or either of them. The House and the 
               <br />
               country will sustain me in the view I take 
               <br />
               of the danger of our position, and conse- 
               <br />
               quently of the importance of the measure 
               <br />
               now under consideration, as one means of 
               <br />
               removing it. (Hear, hear.) If, sir, we can 
               <br />
               ascertain the true cause of our diﬁculties, we 
               <br />
               shall not have to seek far or long for their 
               <br />
               remedy. In what dothey originate? Some 
               <br />
               tell us in diﬁ'erence of nationality, of religi- 
               <br />
               ous creed, of civil institutions, and of language. 
               <br />
               I am not disposed to ignore these, or todeny 
               <br />
               that they may be made to play a conspicuous 
               <br />
               part in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> non-settlement of sectional quee- 
               <br />
               tions; but I utterly deny that they are the 
               <br />
               cause of our diﬂioulties. Take the question of 
               <br />
               nationality, for instance. Those among us 
               <br />
               who are of French extraction may be justly 
               <br />
               proud of their ancestry, of their traditions, 
               <br />
               and of their history. They can boast of 
               <br />
               the mighty empire which those of kindred 
               <br />
               blood with themselves have founded in 
               <br />
               Europe, and of the vast inﬂuence which it 
               <br />
               exerts over the civilization and politics of 
               <br />
               the world; but as they are no longer subject 
               <br />
               to France, but are within the allegiance of 
               <br />
               the British Crown, and enjoy all the fran- 
               <br />
               chises of British freemen, it appears to me 
               <br />
               that the question of French nationality dis- 
               <br />
               appears, whilst that of origin only remains; 
               <br />
               and that now the only nationality that 
               <br />
               can be recognized among us is a British 
               <br />
               nationality, unless indeed we are pre— 
               <br />
               pared to sever our connection with the 
               <br />
               parent state, commence a new nationality of 
               <br />
               our own, or merge our litical existence in 
               <br />
               the neighboring repu lio. But who, sir,
