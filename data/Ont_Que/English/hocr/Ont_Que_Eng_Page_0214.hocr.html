               <br />
               soon began to act, and their first movement 
               <br />
               was to take the rcvincial steamer and go off 
               <br />
               to Prince Edwar Island. I remember well

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference</span> at Charlottetown, and I have no

               <br />
               too that they were well received. There had 
               <br />
               been a growing love in these provinces tost 
               <br />
               Canada for some time. This was manifested 
               <br />
               when they gave an invitation to this Legisla-

               <br />

               <br />
               every member of it—did not accept that in-

               <br />
               better informed than when they went there. 
               <br />
               We had the satisfaction of seeing those who 
               <br />
               probably are going to be our partners in this 
               <br />
               union. And I do assure you, that for one, I 
               <br />
