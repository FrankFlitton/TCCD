               make good their contract, I shall consider 
               <br />
               the Government still bound to ﬁnd some 
               <br />
               other solution for our diﬁculties. Reason-

               able time and allowance being made for the 
               <br />
               diﬁiculties of their task, I will continue to 
               <br />
               hold them responsible for some satisfacto 
               <br />
               measure of settlement. Should British 
               <br />
               North America become united on the basis 
               <br />
               of these resolutions, a serious responsibility 
               <br />
               will rest on those public men who will be 
               <br />
               called in the ﬁrst days to administer these 
               <br />
               several governments. Should they fall into 
               <br />
               prodigal hands, the most seri'ous injury, even 
               <br />
               ruin, may be entailed on the country. 
               <br />
               These dangers may be averted by prudence 
               <br />
               and economy in our future legislators, by 
               <br />
               which happier results may be achieved. 
               <br />
               But, sir, under the most favorable auspices, 
               <br />
               I believe difﬁculties and embarrassments will 
               <br />
               grow up under this new Constitution. I 
               <br />
               hope it will not then be considered aﬁnality, 
               <br />
               but capable of amendment as time goes on. 
               <br />
               I sincerely trust that so far as its future 
               <br />
               defects may have their origin in matters of 
               <br />
               law, they will be redressed by wise, legal and 
               <br />
               enlightened means; and, so far as they may 
               <br />
               have their foundation in matters of sentiment 
               <br />
               or opinion, that they will be redressed by the 
               <br />
               cultivation of better and more fraternal feel-

               <br />
               happy means, although it is not now such a 
               <br />
               Constitution as we can all approve, that it

               before a division is taken. My honorable 
               <br />
               friend from Granville (Mr'. SHANLY), in 
               <br />
               the course of his very interesting speech 
               <br />
               -—a speech to which I listened with a 
               <br />
               great deal of attention—took occasion to 
               <br />
               remark upon what be characterised as the 
               <br />
               bold and manly course adopted by the Go— 
               <br />
               vernment, on learning of the rejection of 
               <br />
               this scheme by the people of New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick. Sir, on that point, I join issue with 
               <br />
               that gentleman. The course of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment ought to be bold and manly, to entitle 
               <br />
               it to the support of a bold and manly mind 
               <br />
               like his, that was so much in doubt as to 
               <br />
               what course to pursue before this bold and 
               <br />
               manly policy was adopted. But, sir, instead 
               <br />
               of its being a bold and manly course, I hold 
               <br />
               that it was a mere running away from the 
               <br />
               diﬁculty which the defeat of those resolutions 
               <br />
               by the people of New Brunswick presented. 
               <br />
               What was the position at‘that moment? We 
               <br />
               were discussing the desirability and feasibility 
               <br />
               of having a union of all these colonies, 
               <br />
               founded upon resolutions ado ted by a 
               <br />
               conference of delegates from t e various 
               <br />
               colonies, which met in this city in October 
               <br />
               last. These resolutions were to be concurred 
               <br />
               in by all the provinces, and were represented 
               <br />
               to -us as being in the nature of a treaty. 
               <br />
               Suddenly we hear that the Province of 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, the only one whose terri- 
               <br />
               tory adjoins ours, had, in eﬁ'e'ct, refused to 
               <br />
               ratify that treaty, and hence the treaty falls 
               <br />
               to the ground, and the refusal of that 
               <br />
               province to join the union renders a union 
               <br />
               impossible. My hon. friend says it was a 
               <br />
               bold and manly course to insist on going 
               <br />
               on with that which it had become impos- 
               <br />
               sible to carry out; but, sir, I maintain, 
               <br />
               as I said before, that their course was 
               <br />
               merely a method—cunning and adroit, 
               <br />
               perhaps, but neither bold nor manly— 
               <br />
               which they adepted of running away from 
               <br />
               their duty. (Hear, hear.) The refusal of 
               <br />
               New Brunswick to join the union, or to 
               <br />
               ratify the treaty, having destroyed it, a new 
               <br />
               duty then devolved upon our Government—a 
               <br />
               dut growing directly out of the obligation 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">und’er</span> which those gentlemen placed them- 
               <br />
               selves in the reformation of their Government 
               <br />
               in June last. That obligation was to settle 
               <br />
               the Canadian diﬂicul this session, either by 
               <br />
               a Confederation of the provinces, or by a 
               <br />
               Canadian Federation. The one now under con- 
               <br />
               sideration for the former object being dead, they 
               <br />
               were bound to deal with the Canadian ques-
