               to that work, and the attacks of the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Lotbiniere will hardly prevent 
               <br />
               that name from going down to our descend-

               who know the services he has rendered to his

               country. But the Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               for Lower Canada was not satisﬁed with these 
               <br />
               services. In the midst of a terrible crisis his 
               <br />
               country conﬁded to him all its interests, all 
               <br />
               its rights, all its institutions, its nationality, 
               <br />
               its religion, in a word everything it held most 
               <br />
               dear. The Hon. Attorney General received 
               <br />
               the whole trust into his safe and faithful keep- 
               <br />
               ing, and when called upon to render an ac- 
               <br />
               count, he exhibited all these interests, rights, 
               <br />
               institutions, our nationality and religion. in 
               <br />
               fact everything that the people held dear, and 
               <br />
               restored them guaranteed, protected and sur- 
               <br />
               rounded by every safeguard, in the Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation of the British North American Provin- 
               <br />
               ces. He has been a faithful banker, and has 
               <br />
               not betrayed the trust reposed in him, he has 
               <br />
               honestly paid his debt; rich and poor, seigniors 
               <br />
               and censitat'res, advocates and pleaders, all 
               <br />
               have received their due, and the banker is 
               <br />
               blessed from one end of the province to the 
               <br />
               other. The honorable member says that the 
               <br />
               Hon. Attorney General will have his reward. 
               <br />
               He is right; my honorable colleague will have 
               <br />
               his reward—his day will come as did that of 
               <br />
               the late Sir LOUIS HYPOLITE LAFONTAINE. 
               <br />
               When that eminent citizen held the position 
               <br />
               occupied <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> by the Hon. Attorney General, 
               <br />
               the opposition heaped upon him the same re- 
               <br />
               proaches, the same insults that are now offered 
               <br />
               to my honorable friend. He was accused of 
               <br />
               being a traitor to his country ; it was broadly 
               <br />
               asserted that he was selling his fellow-citizens, 
               <br />
               and that he was the enemy of his race. 
               <br />
               Nevertheless, that defender of the rights and 
               <br />
               institutions of Lower Canada had but one 
               <br />
               ambition, namely, to secure for his fellow- 
               <br />
               countrymen the splendid position they have 
               <br />
               ever since occupied. He let the disaffected 
               <br />
               continue to assail him, and before descending 
               <br />
               into the tomb, he had the happiness of seeing 
               <br />
               his patriotic efforts and the purity and noble- 
               <br />
               ness of his intentions acknowledged; and when 
               <br />
               his mortal remains were carried to their last 
               <br />
               resting place, all classes of his fellow-citizens 
               <br />
               were eager in doing honor to that great man, 
               <br />
               and all united in blessing the memory of one 
               <br />
               who was no longer accused of being a traitor, 
               <br />
               but whose name was universally admitted to 
               <br />
               be deserving of a place among the very highest 
               <br />
               in parliamentary history. It will be the same

               <br />
               the greatest benefactors of his country. I 
               <br />
               regret, Mr. SPEAKER, having spoken at such 
               <br />
               great length, but' the importance of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion must be my excuse for having, perhaps, 
               <br />
               wearied the House. After the lon s es

               laga and the honorable member for Lotbiniere, 
               <br />
               it was impossible for me to curtail my re- 
               <br />
               marks, when I had to refute and destroy all 
               <br />
               the hazardous assertions of the two honorable 
               <br />
               members. I think I have said eno h to 
               <br />
               show that the honorable member for oche- 
               <br />
               laga made a false prediction when he said that 
               <br />
               the day on which Confederation was accom- 
               <br />

               mission to explain what I had stated, because

               from the manner in which he has acted
