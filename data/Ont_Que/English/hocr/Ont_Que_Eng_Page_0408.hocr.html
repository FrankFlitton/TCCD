               power of divorce, I found that we were to

               decide in what legislative body the authority 
               <br />
               should be lodged which we found in our Con- 
               <br />
               stitutlons. After mature consideration, we 
               <br />
               resolved to leave it in the Central Legislature, 
               <br />

               <br />
               a procedure which is at present so easy. We

               thought then, as we still think, that in this 
               <br />
               we took the most prudent course. The fol-

               lowing illustration will prove this still more 
               <br />
               forcibly. It is known to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> how

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perancef</span> Well, we will suppose that the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman were present as a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of a municipal council in which it was to 
               <br />
               be decided whether all the taverns in a very 
               <br />
               populous part of the parish, which could not 
               <br />
               be suppressed, should be banished to a remote 
               <br />
               corner of the parish, where they would no 
               <br />
               longer be a temptation and a stumbling-block; 
               <br />
               would he not vote for such a measure ? 
               <br />
               Would he not send them to a place where 
               <br />
               they would be least accessible to the popula- 
               <br />
               tion, and would he not think he had done a 
               <br />
               meritorious act, an act worthy of a good 
               <br />
               friend of the temperance cause? Just so 
               <br />
               in a question of divorce; the case is exactly 
               <br />
               analogous. We found this power existing 
               <br />
               in the constitutions of the different pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, and not being able to get rid of it, 
               <br />
               we wished to banish it as far from us as pos- 
               <br />
               sible. One thing it would be vain to deny, 
               <br />
               namely, that although we, as Catholics, do not 
               <br />
               admit the liberty of divorce, although we hold 
               <br />
               the marriage bond to be indissoluble, yet there 
               <br />
               are cases in which we both admit and require 
               <br />
               the annulling of the marriage tie—in cases, 
               <br />
               for instance, where a marriage has been con- 
               <br />
               tracted within the prohibited degrees without 
               <br />
               the necessary dispensations. Au instance of 
               <br />
               this occurred very recently. A few months 
               <br />
               since, an individual belonging to my county, 
               <br />
               who had married a young girl of a neighboring 
               <br />
               parish, without being aware at the timc of his 
               <br />
               marriage of the relationship which existed 
               <br />
               between him and his wife, found out several 
               <br />
               months afterwards that they were related in 
               <br />
               such a degree that they required a dispensa- 
               <br />
               tion from the bishop. That dispensation had 
               <br />
               not been obtained. He spoke of it to his wife, 
               <br />
               who refused to apply for a dispensation, as a 
               <br />
               step towards the legal celebration of their 
               <br />
               marriage. It became necessary, therefore, to 
               <br />
               have the marriage annulled. The affair was 
               <br />
               brought before the Ecclesiastical Court, and, 
               <br />
