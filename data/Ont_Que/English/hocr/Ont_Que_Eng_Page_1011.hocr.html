               facts? The Government of that day had 
               <br />
               proposed a Confederation of all the provinces 
               <br />
               as their remedy for the Canadian diﬁculty. 
               <br />
               The Liberal party did not accept. that. If 
               <br />
               they had done so, the probability is that you 
               <br />
               would have had Confederation long ago,

               with the consent of the Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces.</span> 
               <br />
               But the Reform Convention declared it was 
               <br />
               no remedy. It is true they put in a saving 
               <br />
               clause, that at some future day, in some 
               <br />
               remote contingency, after the settlement of 
               <br />
               the Canadian diﬁculty, but not as a means

               of settling it, the Federation of all the

               fallacy into which he has fallen—and it is a 
               <br />
               very close one—in assuming that this mea-

               sure is identical with the measure for which 
               <br />

               HON. MB. BROWN—I think the hon.

               as correct, I dissent from it toto cœlo. The

               position of the matter is quite the opposite 
               <br />
               of what he states. He says this is a different

               thing altogether. I totally deny that it is. 
               <br />
               I say this is simply what we asked for, only 
               <br />
               in another form. The measure we asked for 
               <br />
               was representation by population. We got 
               <br />
               that. (Hear, hear.) And the hon. gentle-

               man is the last man to object to this, which 
               <br />
               is the very basis on which he agreed to go 
               <br />
               into the BBOWN—DOBION Administration— 
               <br />
               representation by pOpulation being the basis, 
               <br />
               accompanied by such checks and guarantees 
               <br />
               as might be shown to be necessary. Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The hon. gentleman has stated that 
               <br />
               I have spoken against Confederation of the

               mine since I entered Parliament in

               which, when I made any allusion to

               the matter, I did not take care express]

               to state that I regarded a union of all the
