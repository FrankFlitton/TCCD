               formerly held opinions different from those which 
               <br />
               I now hold. A French 'ournal has said “ that I 
               <br />
               loudly called for a Con ederation of the provin- 
               <br />
               ces.” But I shall say now, as I stated in 1856, 
               <br />
               and as I stated in 1861, that I have always been 
               <br />
               and am still Opposed to Confederation. I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               by the Mirror of Parliament, which contains a 
               <br />
               report of my speech, although an exceedingly bad 
               <br />
               report, that I stated in 1861—“A time may 
               <br />
               come when it will be necessary to have a Con— 
               <br />
               federation of all the provinces; ‘ ‘ ‘ but the 
               <br />
               time has not yet come for such a scheme.” This 
               <br />
               was the s ech which was misrepresented as 
               <br />
               meaning tnat I was calling loudly for Confeder- 
               <br />
               tion, and that nothing would give me greater 
               <br />
               pleasure. And yet I explicitly stated on that 
               <br />
               occasion that although a time might come when 
               <br />
               Confederation would become necessary, it was 
               <br />
               not desirable under actual circumstances.
