               atthe present moment. If the scheme is

               <br />
               my hon. friend alluded to the state of the

               country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jut</span> before the present Government 
               <br />
               was formed, in terms which I hardly think 
               <br />
               he was justiﬁed in using. He claimed that 
               <br />
               the country was in a state of anarchy and 
               <br />
               confusion. Now, hon. gentlemen, I must 
               <br />
               say that for my part I saw none of that 
               <br />
               anarchy, and I must say very little of 
               <br />
               that confusion. I assert that there may 
               <br />
               be witnessed in other lands what was 
               <br />
               witnessed in this. We saw weak govern- 
               <br />
               ments striving month after mouth to keep 
               <br />

               res in power, and we saw these 
               <br />
               governments daily and hourly attacked 
               <br />
               byan and wary opposition. But, hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen, I have yet to learn that the 
               <br />
               giving of 17 additional members to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada and 47 members to the eastern pro- 
               <br />
               vinces will ensure us against the same state 
               <br />
               of thin in the future. It was very well put 
               <br />
               by the n. member for Wellington (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. SLNBOBN) when he said, if there was 
               <br />
               more patriotism on the part of our public 
               <br />
               men, and less desire to sacriﬁce the country 
               <br />
               for the good of party, we would not have had 
               <br />
               that state of confusion to which m hon. 
               <br />
               friend from the Erie Division has al uded. 
               <br />
               Then my hon. friend who represents the 
               <br />
               Erie Division, in order to fortify the position 
               <br />
               he took in supporting the scheme, took up 
               <br />
               the resolutions adopted by the Toronto Be- 
               <br />
               form Convention in 1859. He stated that I 
               <br />
               was a delegate present at that convention ; 
               <br />
               but I can only say that, although elected a 
               <br />
               delegate, I took no part in the proceedings, 
               <br />
               and know nothing more of them than I 
               <br />
               learned from the public prints. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, however, conveniently read only 
               <br />
               apart of the resolutions. But it must be ad- 
               <br />
               mitted that these resolutions were the iden- 
               <br />
               deal basis upon which the present Govern- 
               <br />
               ment was organized. This Government 
               <br />
               was organised for the express purpose of 
               <br />
               carrying out the arrangements embodied in 
               <br />
               the rœolutions of that body. And, hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen, a committee was appointed by 
               <br />
               the Toronto Convention, and that committee 
               <br />
               prepared a draft address to the public. That 
               <br />
               was submitted to the executive committee, 
               <br />
               and considered on the 15th of February, 1860,
