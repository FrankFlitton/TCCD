               appears to me that they have avoided the

               detrimental to the interests of the whole. 
               <br />
               The great adVantago which I see in the 
               <br />
               scheme is this, that the powers granted to 
               <br />
               the local governments are strictly deﬁned 
               <br />
               and circumscribed, and that the residuum 
               <br />
               of power lies in the Central Government. 
               <br />

               governors named by the central authority— 
               <br />
               an admirable provision which establishes

               in this case, as there has been in the case of 
               <br />
               the Americans. The powers of the local 
               <br />
               governments are distinctly and strictly de-

               <br />

               <br />
               other point which commends itself sostrongly 
               <br />
               to my mind is this, that there is a veto 
               <br />
               power on the part of the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment over all the legislation of the Local 
               <br />
               Parliament. That was a fundamental element 
               <br />
               which the wisest statesmen engaged in the 
               <br />
               framing of the American Constitution saw, that 
               <br />
               if it was not engrafted in it, must necessarily 
               <br />
               lead to the destruction of the Constitution. 
               <br />
               These men engaged in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">framingrof</span> that 
               <br />
               Constitution at Philadelphia saw clearly. that 
               <br />
               unless the power of veto over the acts of the 
               <br />
               state legislatures was given to the Central 
               <br />
               Government, sooner or later a clashing of 
               <br />
               authority between the central authority and 
               <br />
               the various states must take place. What 
               <br />
               said Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manrsort</span> in reference to this point ? 
               <br />
               I quote from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Secret Debates upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               Federal Constitution, which took place in 
               <br />
               1787, and during which this important 
               <br />
               question was considered. On the motion of 
               <br />
               Mr. PINKNEY “ that the National Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture shall have the power of negativing all 
               <br />
               laws to be passed by the state legislature, 
               <br />
               which they may judge improper," he stated 
               <br />
               that he considered “ this as the corner stone 
               <br />
               of the system, and hence the necessity of 
               <br />
               retrenching the state authorities in order to 
               <br />
               preserve the good government of the National 
               <br />
               Council.” And Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Maniacs</span> said, “ The 
               <br />
               power of negativing is absolutely necessary 
               <br />
               -this is the only attractive principle which 
               <br />
               will retain its centrifu 1 force, and without 
               <br />
               this the planets will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%;</span> from their orbits.” 
               <br />
               Now, sir, I believe this power of negative, 
               <br />
               this power of veto, this eoatrolling power on 
               <br />
               the part of the Central Government is the 
               <br />
               best protection and safeguard of the system; 
               <br />
               and if it had not been provided, [would have 
               <br />
               felt it very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁcult</span> to reconcile it to my 
               <br />
               sense of duty to vote for the resolutions. 
               <br />
               But this power having been given to the 
               <br />
               Central Government, it is to my mind,in 
               <br />
               conjunction with the power of naming the 
               <br />
               local governors, the appointment and pay- 
               <br />
