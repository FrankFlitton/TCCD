               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considering</span> the project of Confederation, one 
               <br />
               of the principal subjects which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has‘under-</span> 
               <br />
               gone discussion in this House has been the 
               <br />
               proposed Constitution of the Council, and 
               <br />
               the most prominent question connected with 
               <br />
               it has been the question of the elective versus 
               <br />
               the nominative principle. Although an 
               <br />
               elected member, I voted without the least 
               <br />
               hesitation against the elective principle, and 
               <br />
               I believe that in doing so I represented the 
               <br />
               views of my constituents as well asmy own—I 
               <br />
               mean the great majority of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my,</span> constituents, 
               <br />
               for there may be some exceptions with re- 
               <br />
               gard to this point, as there are no doubt 
               <br />
               with respect to the general question of Con- 
               <br />
               federation. I based my vote on what is, I 
               <br />
               think, a true principle in politics, which is 
               <br />
               that if you wish a check to be established, 
               <br />
               such as I think this Council is intended to 
               <br />
               establish on the legislation of the other 
               <br />
               branch, you must not have the two Chambers 
               <br />
               returnable by the same constituents. If the 
               <br />
               constituents of both Houses are nearly the 
               <br />
               same, you lose the power of check, or at 
               <br />
               least you will not have it eﬁ'ectual, because 
               <br />
               you will have the same sentiments and feel- 
               <br />
               ings represented in this House as in the 
               <br />
               other. I am not singular in this opinion, 
               <br />
               but were I to cite the opinions of men who 
               <br />
               are of a conservative turn of mind, and who 
               <br />
               have always upheld the privileges of the 
               <br />
               aristocracy and the prerogative of the Crown, 
               <br />
               I should, perhaps, give you opinions which 
               <br />
               would carry less weight with the opponents 
               <br />
               of this measure than will that of a gentleman 
               <br />
               whose views I will cite, who has written a 
               <br />
               great deal, and very ably, and who belongs 
               <br />
               to the ranks of the advanced Liberal party

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, honorable gentlemen, I think a Second 
               <br />
               Chamber, constituted nearly in the same 
               <br />
               way as the Lower Chamber, would be wholly 
               <br />
               ineﬁ'ectual to stop the current of legislation 
               <br />
               coming from that Chamber; the point, in- 
               <br />
               deed, admits of very little question. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The objections which have been raised 
               <br />
               to nomination by the Crown or the Execu— 
               <br />
               tive Government arc of very little effect at 
               <br />
               this time of day. For myself I should have 
               <br />
               preferred to have the nomination of legis- 
               <br />
               ative councillors vested in the Crown inde- 
               <br />
               pendently cf the recommendation of the 
               <br />
               Local Government, so as to have left the pre- 
               <br />
               rogative unfettered. There is no doubt that 
               <br />
               abuses formerly existed in Canada when the 
               <br />
               nominative system was in force—before res- 
               <br />
               ponsible government was established and 
               <br />
               when the Colonial Oﬂîcc meddled a good deal 
               <br />
               with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘airs</span> of the province; but now 
               <br />
               every honorable gentleman with any know- 
               <br />
               ledge of historical events in Canada will say 
               <br />
               at once the case is altogether altered. So 
               <br />
               far from interfering in our internal matters, 
               <br />
               the Colonial Oﬂice now leaves us a great deal 
               <br />
               to ourselves and lets us do as we please. 
               <br />
               There never was a freer Constitution than 
               <br />
               ours. Under these altered circumstances, I 
               <br />
               should have preferred, I say, that in order 
               <br />
               to avoid all appearance of nominations for 
               <br />
               party purposes, the direct nomination of le— 
               <br />
               gislative councillors should have been lefttc 
               <br />
               the Crown or the Crown’s representative in 
               <br />
               the Confederation. (Hear.) There was 
               <br />
               one remark made by the hon. member lor 
               <br />
               Wellington in reference to Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Caunwm's</span> 
               <br />
               letter, which I think was madcin error. He 
               <br />
               inferred from that dcspateh that Mr. CARD-
