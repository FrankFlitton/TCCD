               import duty on foreign grain brought to 
               <br />
               her markets, will be remembered. Before 
               <br />
               that period our grain and other produce 
               <br />
               were protected on the English markets in

               <br />
               the Black Sea and the United States was 
               <br />
               subject to a duty which was high enough 
               <br />
               to aﬂ'ord great protection in favor of ours. ' 
               <br />
               This new policy in relation to the colonies
