               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tn:</span> HON. THE SPEAKER—There may 
               <br />
               be some diﬁculty in deciding on a matter of 
               <br />
               this kind, because the two motions, although 
               <br />
               not exactly identical, are very nearly so in one 
               <br />
               particular. The argument that the motion 
               <br />
               of Hon. Mr. SANBOBN contained more than 
               <br />
               is embraced in this motion does not apply. 
               <br />
               The question is, does this aﬁirm what was 
               <br />
               contained in the motion already voted upon ? 
               <br />
               That in dcciding on this particular matter, 
               <br />
               we have decided on other things connected 
               <br />
               with it, does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘ect</span> the position. Rules 
               <br />
               on questions of this kind have been made to 
               <br />
               prevent Parliament deciuin one day con- 
               <br />
               trary to another, and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avoif</span> also surprises, 
               <br />
               by uestions being introduced a second time 
               <br />
               int e absence of members who may have 
               <br />
               previously voted on them. Were this motion 
               <br />
               to carry, it would aﬁrm a principle which 
               <br />
               was negatived when the motion of the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. SANBORN was before the House. It is 
               <br />
               not necessary that the two motions should be 
               <br />
               exactly the same; it is suﬂicient if they are 
               <br />
               substantially alike. I will quote a few words 
               <br />
               on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thispoint</span> from MAY :— 
               <br />

               It is a rule in both Houses not to rmit any 
               <br />
               uestion or bill to be offered which is substan- 
               <br />
               nelly the same as one On which their judgment has 
               <br />
               already been pronounced during the same session. 
               <br />
               This is necessary to avoid different decisions being 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given,</span> and to prevent surprises by a question

               <br />
               in the negative. 
               <br />
               Should we pass this motion now before the 
               <br />
               House, we should be doing what MAY says 
               <br />

               on one day, and in another day the contrary. 
               <br />
               I am bound to say that in my opinion the 
               <br />
               resolution is substantially contained in the 
               <br />
               resolution already decided upon, and that

               tlemen, I deeply regret that the amendment 
               <br />
               of my honorable friend could not have been 
               <br />
               placed before the House, in order to a more 
               <br />
               direct vote bein elicited on the principle 
               <br />
               therein contains , that of the a plieation of 
               <br />
               the elective rinciple to this ones. It is 
               <br />
               true that the onorable member for Welling- 
               <br />
               ton embodied the same principle in the 
               <br />
               resolution which he brought before the 
               <br />
               House, and which was negatived. I confess 
               <br />
               I hardly expected, when 1 saw this amend— 
               <br />
               ment on the notice paper, that it would be 
               <br />
               allowed to be proceeded with. Still I was 
               <br />
               in hopes that the House would have borne 
               <br />
               with the honorable gentleman, and would 
               <br />
               have allowed his motion to be placed on the 
               <br />
               Journals of the House. Having been sent 
               <br />
               here by a constituency which embraces about 
               <br />
               75,000 souls, upon the elective principle, I 
               <br />
               feel that I should but ill discharge my duty 
               <br />
               to that constituency, without having received 
               <br />
               from them their direct and ositive instruc- 
               <br />
               tions to the contrary, were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{to</span> stand up on

               the ﬂoor of this House and advocate the 
               <br />
               taking away from them of the privilege of 
               <br />
               the elective franchise which has been con- 
               <br />
               ceded to them by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Parliament.</span> If this prin- 
               <br />
               ciple had not been granted, the position 
               <br />
               would be altogether changed; but having 
               <br />
               once granted to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maple</span> the right of saying 
               <br />
               whom they will have to represent them in 
               <br />
               this Chamber, they ought also to be asked, 
               <br />
               before we are called upon to vote, whether 
               <br />
               they desire to give back the privilege into 
               <br />
               the hands of the Government. I would not 
               <br />
               for a moment think of placing them in so 
               <br />
               false a position. I cannot, therefore, look 
               <br />
               with favor upon that portion of the resolu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the ri ht to nominate and select members to 
               <br />
               this onorable House. So much has been 
               <br />
               said on this subject that it would be hardly 
               <br />
               worth while for me to consume the time of 
               <br />
               the House in going over the ground which 
               <br />
               so many others have gone over already. I 
               <br />
               have not heard, however, in all the speeches 
               <br />
               which have been made in advocacy of this 
               <br />
               measure, anything to cause me to swerve for 
               <br />
               a moment from the views I have always en-

               tertained after reading this portion of the
