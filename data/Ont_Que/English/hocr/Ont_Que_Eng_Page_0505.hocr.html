               honorable gentlemen; I am not raising the 
               <br />
               question whether they were right or 
               <br />
               wrong in taking that course. They may 
               <br />
               have been the purest patriots, the most 
               <br />
               farseeing statesmen the world has known, 
               <br />
               for ought I care. What I say is merely 
               <br />
               this, that whether for good or evil, whether 
               <br />
               wisely or unwisely, the fact is, that the 
               <br />
               public mind was not occupied in the least 
               <br />
               with this Confederation question. After 
               <br />
               having fought a long time, mainly about 
               <br />
               measures, and secondarily about men, we 
               <br />
               were all suddenl called upon, in 1862, to 
               <br />
               consider nothing ut the uestion of the men 
               <br />
               who were to do everything right, and to 
               <br />
               settle everything fairly and honestly, and so 
               <br />
               forth. Representation by population was un- 
               <br />
               mistakably, for a time at least, laid upon the 
               <br />
               shelf, declared to be secondary, almost unim- 
               <br />
               portant. It had been half shelved some 
               <br />
               time before; then, it was wholly shelved. 
               <br />
               It was hardly taken down from the shelf in 
               <br />
               1863, when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MacDONann-DoamN</span> Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment merely put it back to the same 
               <br />
               place, which it had long occupied to no 
               <br />
               purpose of a practical character under 
               <br />
               the CARTIER-MACDONALD Administration. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Such, then, was the state of 
               <br />
               affairs—nobody thinking or caring about 
               <br />
               this great question, until last Session of 
               <br />
               Parliament, when the hon. member for 
               <br />
               South Oxford, the present President of the 
               <br />
               Council, moved for and obtained a commit-

               tee cn the subject of constitutional changes 
               <br />
               generally. Certainly that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               did a very clever thing, in embodying in his

               edly clever, in the hon. member for South

               sition to the then Government and to himself

               —-an expression of opinion almost coinciding 
               <br />
               with his own. He carried his committee. 
               <br />
               No one made any great objection to it. I 
               <br />
               have been told that I am guilty of some sort 
               <br />
               of inconsistency, after having voted for that 
               <br />
               committee, in now opposing this measure. 
               <br />
               The sequitur is hard to see. I did certainly 
               <br />
               speak and vote for it, but on the express 
               <br />
               ground that I believed it would do no sort of 
               <br />
               harm, and that, on the contrary, it might 
               <br />
               have the good effect of leading other hon. 
               <br />
               entlemen to the sober conclusion at which 
               <br />
               had long before arrived myself. I there- 
               <br />
               fore had no objection to the committee, and 
               <br />
               I sat on it.“ I am not going to reveal what 
               <br />
               have been called the secrets of the commit— 
               <br />
               tee. As in many other like cases, there was 
               <br />
               mighty little in them. Owing to accidents, 
               <br />
               wholly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aside</span> from this question of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, the report of the committee was pre- 
               <br />
               sented on the very night that vote happened 
               <br />
               to be given, indirectly adverse to the TACHB— 
               <br />
               MACDONALD Administration. The report 
               <br />
               itself was an accident. All the allusion there 
               <br />
               was in it to Federation of any sort, found its 
               <br />
               way there at the last moment and unexpect- 
               <br />
               edly. It is no violation oi conﬁdence to sa 
               <br />
               that it was even voted against by the leader 
               <br />
               of this House, the Attorney General for 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, the new leading advocate of 
               <br />
               the present scheme. That fact is on the 
               <br />
               printed record. It was voted against, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also,</span> 
               <br />
               by the members for Cornwall and West El- 
               <br />
               gin. There were ﬁve other members, of 
               <br />
               whom I am sorry I was one, who were absent; 
               <br />
               had I been there, unquestionably my vote 
               <br />
               would have been against it. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               And, Mr. SPEAKER, those who were in this 
               <br />
               House at the time that report was made, will 
               <br />
               remember pretty well the more than cool 
               <br />
               indifference with which it was here received, 
               <br />
               little or nothing, after all, as it amounted to. 
               <br />
               Well, this vote in the House thus following, 
               <br />
               the opportunity suddenly oﬁ'ered to honorable
