               of different races, laws and customs, and con- 
               <br />
               sequently more suitable to the Confederation 
               <br />
               of the British North American Provinces than 
               <br />
               to the smaller one of Upper and Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada. Lower Canada, “ unless she wish re- 
               <br />
               presentation based upon population, should 
               <br />
               not reject a written Constitution under which 
               <br />
               she has protection for and control of her pecu-

               <br />
               the expenses of the federal and local govern-

               of the present system. According to the 
               <br />
               Montreal manifesto of 1859, the Federal Gov-

               <br />

               this solemn debate. (Hear, hear.) How 
               <br />
               did he act? Forgetting his declarations of 
               <br />
               1858, he verned Lower Canada with a 
               <br />
               weak minority of its representatives, and as, 
               <br />
               according to his ideas, “power led to des-

               potism," he ruled it with that rod of iron 
               <br />
               which the radicals alone know how to wield. 
               <br />
