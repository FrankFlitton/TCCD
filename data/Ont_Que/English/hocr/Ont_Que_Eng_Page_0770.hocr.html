               the ﬁrst time that the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               will contribute anything towards the western 
               <br />

               <br />
               that, if they undertake to fortify Quebec, the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government will have to undertake 
               <br />
               the works at Montreal and westward. Now, 
               <br />
               we are told that this scheme has reference 
               <br />
               both to local government and local defence, 
               <br />
               and as the cost of defensive works is stated 
               <br />
               by Col. J envers to be six millions, I suppose 
               <br />
