               dozen which to my mind justify me in 
               <br />
               Opposing it. In the ﬁrst place, I oppose it 
               <br />
               because this is not the scheme which the 
               <br />
               Government pledged themselves to submit 
               <br />
               to the House this session, nor the one which 
               <br />
               has been considered by the people of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. I oppose it also, because I was 
               <br />
               not sent here to change the Constitution, or 
               <br />
               to enter into partnerships, without those 
               <br />
               who sent me here having an opportunity of 
               <br />
               pronouncing their opinion concerning them. 
               <br />
               I oppose it, because of the arbitrary conduct 
               <br />
               of the promoters of the scheme in endeavor- 
               <br />
               ing to wrest from the people privileges 
               <br />
               which they have enjoyed without abusing, 
               <br />
               and which they do not wish to give up. I 
               <br />
               refer here to the preposed mode of appoint- 
               <br />
               ing the Legislative Council. I oppose it, 
               <br />
               because the expenditure which this scheme 
               <br />
               involves, in my opinion, far outweighs 
               <br />
               the advantages to be derived from 
               <br />
               it. Further, I Oppose it, because I do 
               <br />
               not believe it will settle the sectional diﬂi- 
               <br />
               cultics we have complained of, but, on the 
               <br />
               contrary, will multiply them to the same 
               <br />
               extent as we take in new partners, and will 
               <br />
               leave Upper Canada the victim, not of one, 
               <br />
               but of several smaller provinces. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) In conclusion, I think honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen will agree with me, that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1850</span> 
               <br />
               Canada was the admiration and the envy 
               <br />
               of most of the people who were acquainted 
               <br />
               with our position. I would compare the 
               <br />
               position of Canada at that time—and I 
               <br />
               think I may without imprOpriety—to that of 
               <br />
               ayoung man of eighteen or twenty, hand- 
               <br />
               some in ﬁgure, with a good constitution, of 
               <br />
               robust strength, and under the care of a 
               <br />
               tender and loving _parent (as I presume 
               <br />
               England is to Canada), and this parent has 
               <br />
               committed the health of this child of his— 
               <br />
               this lovely youth—to the care of a family 
               <br />
               physician, who, however, has transferred him 
               <br />
               from time to time to the care of other 
               <br />
               physicians of different schools. Some of 
               <br />
               them were allopaths, some were homœopaths, 
               <br />
               some were hydropaths—but they all bled— 
               <br />
               (laughter)—they all blistered—they all 
               <br />
               sweated. (Continued laughter.) Under 
               <br />
               such treatment this lovely youth became 
               <br />
               pale and sickly. The ruddy hue of health 
               <br />
               passed from his countenance, and instead of 
               <br />
               his step being ﬁrm and bounding, he began 
               <br />
               to stagger in his gait. Then the parent be- 
               <br />
               gan to call the physicians to account, for 
               <br />
               they were acting or pretending to act under 
               <br />
               responsibility for the result of their treat- 
               <br />

               ment. And what answer did they make? - 
               <br />
               Each one of them protested that his own 
               <br />
               nostrum was suﬂicient to cure the malady, 
               <br />
               although it was evident that he was sinking 
               <br />
               under the treatment. But in order that he 
               <br />
               might have the beneﬁt of the craft, and them- 
               <br />
               selves not be dismissed for want of skill, they 
               <br />
               agreed to join, and, making an admixture of 
               <br />
               their several nostrums, to administer that to 
               <br />
               the patient. (Great laughter) Under this 
               <br />
               treatment, however, the kind parent began 
               <br />
               to think that his son had but a poor chance. 
               <br />
               He remonstrated—as I presume our parent 
               <br />
               (England) has done—and declared that this 
               <br />
               could not be allowed, that the patient would 
               <br />
               die, and that the neighbors were Wondering 
               <br />
               at the amount of the patient’s endurance, 
               <br />
               and the parent’s folly in permitting this 
               <br />
               bleeding, blistering, sweating process to go 
               <br />
               on so long. And what do you suppose

               the quacks, in order to satisfy the parent, 
               <br />

               glad to say, that when they heard of this

               <br />

               but I trust my language has conveyed the

               “ I am right," and the other, “ You’re
