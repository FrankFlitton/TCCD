               We are marching fast and steadily towards 
               <br />
               free trade. We must meet the views of the

               <br />
               Imperial authorities that we should not tax 
               <br />
               their manufactures so heavily as—in their 
               <br />
               phrase—almost to deprive them of our mar- 
               <br />
               ket. It was distinctly and ofﬁcially stated 
               <br />
               the other day, in Newfoundland, that assur- 
               <br />
               ance had been given to the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland that the views of the “Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Government are unmistakably in this 
               <br />
               direction. And I do not think there is any 
               <br />
               mistake about that, either. To shew how 
               <br />
               peeple at home, too, expect our tariff to come 
               <br />
               down, I may refer to the speech of Mr. 
               <br />
               HAMBURY TRACY, in seconding the Address 
               <br />
               in answer to the Speech from the Throne, in 
               <br />
               the House of Commons the other day. He 
               <br />
               could not stop, after saying generally that he 
               <br />
               was pleased with this Confederation move- 
               <br />
               ment, without adding that he trusted it would 
               <br />
               result in a very considerable decrease in the 
               <br />
               absurdly high and hostile tariﬂ' at present 
               <br />
               prevailing in Canada. I have not here the 
               <br />
               exact words, but that was their purport. 
               <br />
               Well, if the customs tariff is to come down 
               <br />
               largely, we must look for a decrease of 
               <br />
               revenue. I am free to admit that a 
               <br />
               reduction of the tariﬁ' on certain articles, 
               <br />
               or even some measure of reduction all 
               <br />
               round, might be no material loss, or might 
               <br />
               even be a gain, to the revenue— in 
               <br />
               ordinary or prosperous times, that is to say. 
               <br />
               But when the object of reducing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> 
               <br />
               is to moet other exigencies than those of 
               <br />
               revenue, one can hardly hope to get such a 
               <br />
               tariff as shall give us the largest revenue 
               <br />
               attainable. And besides, no one can deny 
               <br />
               that we are about entering upon a time, 
               <br />
               commercially speaking, that may be termed 
               <br />
               hard. W'e have had, for some time past, 
               <br />
               pretty heavy importations, and our best in-

               not to have a plethoric purse, even under 
               <br />
               ordinary drafts upon it, for some years. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_</span>

               cannot look forward to an increase in the

               to involve ourselves in the enormous extra 
               <br />
               vagances here contemplated. No taxing 
               <br />
               scheme can ever meet the case. Nothing 
               <br />
               can be looked to, but a device of borrowing 
               <br />
               without limit—the incurring of an amount 
               <br />
               of debt that, in interest and sinking fund, 
               <br />
               must prove to be simply unendurable here- 
               <br />
               after.‘ (Hear, hear.) But, in fact, we can- 
               <br />
               not even borrow to any large amount 
               <br />
               unless under false pretenses. We cannot 
               <br />
               borrow without telling tales of our con- 
               <br />
               dition, resources and expectations, that 
               <br />
               will in the end he found out to he lies. 
               <br />
               We must awaken hepes in the minds of 
               <br />
               money lenders abroad, that cannot but prove 
               <br />
               delusive—the memory of which must work

               us hereafter an aggravation of punishment 
               <br />
               that we shall then scarcely need. And when 
               <br />
               that time of reckoning shall have come, then 
               <br />
               staggering under the load, without credit at 
               <br />
               home or abroad, the country will have to 
               <br />
               choose whether it will have heavy direct tax- 
               <br />
               ation—for heavy such taxation then must be 
               <br />
               ——or have recourse to more or less of re- 
               <br />
               pudiation; or even run some risk of both.

               to decoy us into wild expenditure and crushing 
               <br />
               debt. (Hear, hear.) Well, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> 
               <br />
               I now pass to another branch of my subject 
               <br />
               altogether. There is a further salient con— 
               <br />
               trast between the American system and the 
               <br />
               system proposed for our adoption. The 
               <br />
               peeple of the United States, when they 
               <br />
               adopted their Constitution, were one of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> 
               <br />
               nations of the earth. They formed their 
               <br />
               whole system with a view to national ex- 
               <br />
               istence. They had fought for their inde- 
               <br />
               pendence, and had triumphed; and still in 
               <br />
               the ﬂush of their triumph, they were laying 
               <br />
               the foundations of a system absolutely nl— 
               <br />
               tional. Their Federal Government was to 
               <br />
               have its relations with other nations, and wa! 
               <br />
               sure to have plenty to do upon entering the 
               <br />
               great family of nations. But we—what are 
               <br />
               we doing? Creating a new nationality, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the advocates of this scheme.
