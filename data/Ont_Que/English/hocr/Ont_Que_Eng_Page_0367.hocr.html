               with he Central American Confederacy or 
               <br />
               Repu lic of Guatemala.’ It was established 
               <br />
               in 1821, and was composed of ﬁve states: 
               <br />
               Guatemala, Honduras, San Salvador, Nica- 
               <br />
               ragua, and Costa Rica. In 1829, that is to

               say, after an interval of eighteen years only, 
               <br />
               Honduras set the example by seceding from 
               <br />
               the Confederation, an example which was very 
               <br />
               soon followed by the four other states, and 
               <br />
               that Confederation has ceased to exist, after

               <br />
               tions and civil wars. The Confederation of 
               <br />
               Columbia was formed in 1819 of the twelve 
               <br />
               provinces freed by Bolivar from the dominion 
               <br />
               of Spain. After endless troubles and revo- 
               <br />
               lutions, they separated in 1831 (after an

               <br />
               during the years 1853 and 1854. Iwill not 
               <br />
               occupy the time of the House by entering 
               <br />
               into the details of that history; I shall epito- 
               <br />
               mize it by reading a few lines from the table 
               <br />
               of contents, in which we ﬁnd mention made 
               <br />
               of the principal events in the most succinct 
               <br />
               form. Iread from this table as follows:—— 
               <br />
               “ Venezuela—General condition of Vene- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               to these operations in course of time, however 
               <br />
               disagreeable they may be. At all events, 
               <br />
               if matters turn out well with the com- 
               <br />
               pulsory borrowers, as I have no doubt 
               <br />
               they do, they do not leave enough to

               the United States. But let us proceed to 
               <br />
               another confederation. Bolivia and Lower 
               <br />
               Peru <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed‘themselves</span> into a Confederacy 
               <br />
               in 1836. This Confederacy was born and 
               <br />
               lived and died, the whole in three years, 
               <br />
               between 1836 and 1839, hardly allowing 
               <br />
               time to begin to write its history. Next we 
               <br />
               have the confederation of the United Pro- 
               <br />

               fourteen independent provinces. BOUILLET,

               the new Constitution, continues in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follow.</span>

               This Constitution, however, does not prevent

               something half-way between a movement and 
               <br />

               ancient history. Let us look at a few jour- _
