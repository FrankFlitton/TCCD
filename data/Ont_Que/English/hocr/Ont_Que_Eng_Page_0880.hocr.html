               <br />
               Canada, especially at Quebec, and will be so

               MB. T. C. WALLBRIDGE—The Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces have reserved the right of placing

               <br />
               MR. J. B. E. DORION—My honorable 
               <br />
               friend reminds me that we shall not be able 
               <br />
               to obtain coal from the provinces .which will 
               <br />
               form part of the Confederation, without paying 
               <br />
               them a tax. Is not that admirable ?. We are 
               <br />
               to constitute a single people, a single country, 
               <br />
               but there will be taxes to pay for trading with 
               <br />
               each other in certain articles. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I should understand the commercial advan- 
               <br />
               tages which we should gain if the English 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> were situated in different clin’iates, 
               <br />
               yielding every kind of produce, which should 
               <br />
               be freely exchanged. That ”which built up 
               <br />
               the commercial prosperity of the United States 
               <br />
               'is their geographical position—their immense 
               <br />
               territory, in which is to be found every climate 
               <br />
               imaginable, from the north producing ice, to 
               <br />
               the south producing the most delicious fruits. 
               <br />
               An inhabitant of Maine may load a vessel 
               <br />
               with ice, proceed to New Orleans and barter 
               <br />
               his cargo of ice for rice, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c., 
               <br />
               with which he may return home without 
               <br />
               paying a single farthing of customs duties. 
               <br />
               It is this free and continual exchange of their 
               <br />
               various products from Maine to California 
               <br />
               which has placed the United States in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst rank of commercial nations in so short a 
               <br />
               time. (Hear, hear.) Let us not, therefore, 
               <br />
               be lulled with fancies of the great commercial 
               <br />
               ad'vantages we shall derive from a Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation of the provinces. We have wood, they 
               <br />
               produce it; we produce potash, and so do 
               <br />
               they. All that they would require would be 
               <br />
               a little flour, and that Upper Canada can sup- 
               <br />
               ply to them now without paying any tax for 
               <br />
               doing so. Again, our trade with them cannot 
               <br />
               be very considerable, because there are natural 
               <br />
               obstacles in the way to prevent its being so. Si- 
               <br />
               tuated in the same degree as ourselves in respect 
               <br />
               of climate, they produce what we produce, and 
               <br />
               what we want they want—a foreign market 
               <br />
               wherein to dispose of their surplus products. 
               <br />
               Besides, the commercial advantages may all be 
               <br />
               obtained by a mere commercial union, apart 
               <br />
               from a political union. England concluded a 
               <br />
               commercial treaty with the United States, by 
               <br />
               means of which we trade freely with them in 
               <br />
               all products of the soil and of the ﬁsheries.

               What objection could there be to the estab-

               <br />
               of incalculable weakness. How can it be 
               <br />
               believed that by adding 700 miles to our long 
               <br />
               frontier, we shall strengthen ourselves against 
               <br />
               the enemy, when the territory to be added 
               <br />
               does not yet contain inhabitants enough to 
               <br />
               defend it? Is it supposed that if we had a 
               <br />
               war with the Americans, they would not attack 
               <br />
               the English Provinces at all points ? They 
               <br />
               would attack Newfoundland, Prince Edward

               Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as 
               <br />

               <br />
               would be vulnerable at all points along its 
               <br />
               frontier of 1,600 to 1,800 miles. In geo—

               Nothing would be easier than to cut it into

               <br />
               the result of a conspiracy against popular 
               <br />

               I am opposed to the scheme of Confederation, 
               <br />
               because it is proposed to perpetuate, on a 
               <br />
               still greater scale, a state of things which is

               not suitable to the populations of America 
               <br />
               when they attain to years of discretion—a 
               <br />
               state of things which evidently was not in- 
               <br />
               tended for a country in which there are no 
               <br />
               castes, no privileged classes and no heredi-

               socially and politically, by force of circum-
