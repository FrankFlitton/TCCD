               the power of any party to act unjustly. If

               prevent anything of that kind. But the veto 
               <br />
               itself is objected to. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objecwd</span> that the 
               <br />
               elected Legislature will be rendered powerless 
               <br />

               <br />
               House exercised over them. ell, sir, under 
               <br />
               the British Constitution, in all British colon- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ies</span> and in Great Britain itself, there is a 
               <br />
               certain elasticity to be presumed. Every- 
               <br />
               thing is not provided for, because a great deal 
               <br />
               is trusted to the common sense of the people. 
               <br />
               I think it is quite fair and safe to assert that 
               <br />
               there is not the slightest danger that the 
               <br />
               Federal Parliament will perpetrate any injus— 
               <br />
               tiee upon the local legislatures, because it 
               <br />
               would cause such a reaction as to compass 
               <br />
               the destruction of the power thus unjustly 
               <br />
               exercised. The veto power is necessary in 
               <br />
               order that the General Government may have 
               <br />
               a control over the proceedings of the local 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lgislatures</span> to a certain extent. The want of 
               <br />
               this power was the great source of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weaknem</span> 
               <br />
               iuthe United States, and it is a want that 
               <br />
               will be remedied by an amendment in their 
               <br />
               Constitution very soon. So long as each 
               <br />
               state considered itself sovereign, whose acts 
               <br />
               and laws could not be called in question, it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> quite clear that the central authority was 
               <br />
               dætitute of power to compel obedience to 
               <br />
               general laws. If each province were able to 
               <br />
               enact such laws as it pleased, everybody 
               <br />
               would be at the mercy of the local 1 ' a- 
               <br />
               tures, and the General Legislature woul be- 
               <br />
               come of little importance. It is contended 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the power of the General Legislature 
               <br />

               reference to its own territory, resident in the 
               <br />
               local legislatures, respecting the application 
               <br />
               Of general laws to their jurisdiction. All 
               <br />
               power, they say, comes from the people and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ascends</span> through them to their representa-

               I have always felt anxious about in this coun-

               <br />
               in such a position that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">couldpgafely</span> repose,

               without fear of danger from any uarter,

               ( ear, hear.) And when we look to the 
               <br />
               vast territory we have in the North-West; 
               <br />
               when we know that the great rivers which ﬂow 
               <br />
               through that territory, ﬂow through immense 
               <br />
               beds of coal, and that the whole country is 
               <br />
               rich in mineral deposits of all kinds—petro- 
               <br />
               leum, copper, gold and iron; that the land is 
               <br />
               teeming with resources of wealth calculated to 
               <br />
