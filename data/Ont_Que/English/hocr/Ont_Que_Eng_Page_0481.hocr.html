               what little care has been exercised in the

               wording of these resolutions, in one place 
               <br />
               they speak of the seal of the General Gov-

               <br />
               the seal of the “ Federated Provinces.” I 
               <br />
               presume there is no such thing as a seal of 
               <br />
               a general government. It is the seal of the

               <br />
               the true interests of the country, and not an 
               <br />
               eye to the creating of a number of legisla-

               expensive and burdensome in their character

               —works which will be of but little value as 
               <br />
               a commercial undertaking, and of very little 
               <br />
               value for military purposes, but which, no 
               <br />
               doubt, are absolutely necessary for bringing

               us into contact with the people of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces. It seems to me that it would be 
               <br />
               much better had this Intereolonial Railway 
               <br />
               been built without forming this union at all. 
               <br />
               (Opposition cheers.) Had we gone on 
               <br />
               building the railway without a union, it 
               <br />
               would have been less expensive in its char- 
               <br />
               acter to us ; we would have gained more by 
               <br />
               it, and we would have had the control of 
               <br />
               our aﬂairs, without being swamped, so far as 
               <br />
               Upper Canada is concerned. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
