               have always been in favor of a legislative

               ed. If it could be adapted to our circum-

               stances in these colonies, I would at this 
               <br />
               moment he in favor of a legislative union 
               <br />
               as the best system of government. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that is the general opinion of the people 
               <br />
               in the west. But it is the duty of every 
               <br />
               public man to shape his course with refer- 
               <br />
               enceto theoretical principles of government,

               according to the circumstances which may 
               <br />
               prevail locally. And it is quite clear that, 
               <br />
               if the legislative union could not be worked 
               <br />
               well with Upper and Lower Canada, it would 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work</span> still worse with the other provinm 
               <br />
               brought in. There remained, therefore, in 
               <br />
               my opinion, no other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alternative</span> than to

               of the greatest calamities which could befall 
               <br />
               thœe provinces. Even if this scheme were 
               <br />
               more objectionable than it is, had I the 
               <br />
               alternative put before me to accept dissolu- 
               <br />
               tion of the union or to accept this, I would 
               <br />
               without hesitation accept Confederation 
               <br />
               rather than dissolution. (Hear. hear.) In 
               <br />
               the scheme as propcunded, we have all that

               <br />

               <br />
               besides that, we have provision made for ex-

               well as to her trade and commerce. The 
               <br />
               most important question that arises relates 
               <br />
               to the constitution of the Upper House. It 
               <br />
               is said that in this particular the scheme is 
               <br />
               singularl defective—that there has been a 
               <br />
               retrogra e movement in going back from 
               <br />
               the elective to the nominative system. I 
               <br />
               admit that this statement is a fair one from 
               <br />
               those who contended long for the applica- 
               <br />
               tion of the elective principle to the Upper 
               <br />
               House; but it can have no weight with 
               <br />
               another large class, who, like myself, never 
               <br />
               believed in the wis-lom of electing the 
               <br />
               members of two Houses of Parliament with 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coordinate</span> powers. I have always believed 
               <br />
               that a change <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the present system was 
               <br />
               inevitable, even with our present political 
               <br />
               organization. (Hear, hear.) The constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of an Upper House or Senate seems to 
               <br />
               have originated in the state of society which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prevailed</span> in feudal times; and from being 
               <br />
               the sole legislative body—er at least the most 
               <br />
               powerful—in the State, it has imperceptibly 
               <br />
               become less powerful, or secondary in impor- 
               <br />
               tance to the lower chamber, as the mass of 
               <br />
               the people became more intelligent, and 
               <br />
               popular rights became more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fully</span> understood. 
               <br />
               Where there is an Upper House it manifestly 
               <br />
               implies on the part of its members peculiar 
               <br />
               duties or peculiar rights. In Great Britain, 
               <br />
               for instance, there is a large class of landed 
               <br />
               proprietors, who have long held almost all 
               <br />
               the landed property of the country in their 
               <br />
               hands, and who have to pay an immense 
               <br />
               amount of taxes. The ﬁscal legislation of 
               <br />
               Britain for many years has tended to the 
               <br />
               reduction of impost and excise duties on 
               <br />
               articles of prime necessity, and to the impo- 
               <br />
               sition of heavy taxes on landed property and 
               <br />
               incomes. Under such a ﬁnancial system, 
               <br />
               there are immense interests at stake, and the 
               <br />
               House of Lords being the highest judicial 
               <br />
               tribunal in the kingdom, there is a combi- 
               <br />
               nation of peculiar rights and peculiar duties 
               <br />
               appertaining to the class represented which 
               <br />
               amply justify its maintenance. We have no 
               <br />
               such interests, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> we impose no such duties, 
               <br />
               and hence the Upper House becomes a mere 
               <br />
               court of revision, or one of cobrdinate juris— 
               <br />

               <br />
               become the former, it should be constituted
