               it has been left for our Canadian statesmen 
               <br />
               to propose new political alliances in order 
               <br />
               to divert trade and commerce from their 
               <br />
               natural channels. It is yet further said in 
               <br />
               favor of Confederation that it will increase 
               <br />
               our power of defence. In the ordinary ac- 
               <br />
               ceptance of the term, union undoubtedly is 
               <br />
               strength; but there are cases in which 
               <br />
               union, instead of being a source of stren h, 
               <br />
               is in reality an element of weakness. I we 
               <br />
               could attach the territory possessed by the

               <br />
               sistance for our joint defence of the man 
               <br />
               who is pepularly supposed to inhabit that 
               <br />
               luminary, we might derive strength from 
               <br />
               the Confederation. (Laughter.) But al-

               though John Bull is accused of doing many

               foolish things, I am persuaded that the 
               <br />
               Mother Country is far too wise to entrust 
               <br />
               the lives of her valuable soldiers when sent 
               <br />
               to our defence—as in case of need I feel 
               <br />
               well assured they would he—in passing over 
               <br />
               a road so liable to attack and so easy of

               involved with them in war, which I sincerely

               Well, it so happened that the corner-stone 
               <br />
               was that which concerned the representation 
               <br />
               in both Houses. It was agreed on the one 
               <br />
               hand that in the House of Commons of the 
               <br />
               Confederate Government representation should 
               <br />
               be accordin to numbers, and that in the other 
               <br />
               branch of e Legislature it should be ﬁxed 
               <br />
               that this representation should be equal for all 
               <br />
               the provinces—that is to say, Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada, and the Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, grouped into one, should each be 
               <br />
               allowed to send the same number of represen- 
               <br />
               tatives, so as to secure to each province its 
               <br />
               rights, its privil , and its liberties. We 
               <br />
               acted upon this rlnciple, because we felt that 
               <br />
               if the House of ommons’ representation was 
               <br />
               based upon population, equality should be 
               <br />
               secured in the other branch of the Legislature. 
               <br />
               My honorable friend from Wellington has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%one</span> over almost every detail of the schemeof 
               <br />
               ederation, and he thought also he would try 
               <br />
               his hand a little at constitution-making, by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irrfproving</span> that art which has particular 
               <br />
               r erence to the egislative Council. Well, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, I think the saying is 
               <br />
               pretty correct that it is easy to ﬁnd fault, but 
               <br />
               it is not so easy to do better. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The honorable gentleman no doubt thought 
               <br />
               in his own mind that he was going to improve 
               <br />
               the scheme of the Conference, but I think he 
               <br />
               has made it so bad that I believe I can shew 
               <br />
               in the course of the few observations I have 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer,</span> even if we had the power to make a- 
               <br />
               mendments, no member of this House either 
               <br />
               from Upper or Lower Canada would consent to 
               <br />
               them for a moment. I have just said the agree- 
               <br />
               ment was that there should be equality in the 
               <br />
               representation in the Legislative Council. 
               <br />
               But the honorable gentleman has moved that 
               <br />
               the elective members as they now stand should 
               <br />
               form the Legislative Council in the Federal 
               <br />
               Government, and that also the life members 
               <br />
               should continue for the remainder of their 
               <br />
               days; and, as a set-off against the life mem- 
               <br />
               hers, he proposes to allow the other provinces 
               <br />
               a certain number of new members who should 
               <br />
               have the right to sit in the Legislative Council 
               <br />
               of the Federal Government. But what does 
               <br />
               He do ? Does he reserve the proportion as 
               <br />
               laid down at the onvention ? Not a bit of 
               <br />
               it. The proportion agreed upon at the Con- 
               <br />
               vention was one-third to the Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces; the Lower Provinces grouped together 
               <br />
               had a right to send one-third of the represen- 
               <br />
               tatives. The honorable gentleman, however, 
               <br />
               I suppose out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fnlneæ</span> of his good dis—
