               and yet constitutional changes are proposed 
               <br />
               in order to soothe the discontent of the

               people and the agitation of the country.” 
               <br />
               Well ! let us suppose that the gentlemen are 
               <br />
               right—for it is true that the year has not 
               <br />
               been a good one in respect of business, and 
               <br />
               it is natural that such should be the case, in 
               <br />
               view of the position of the crisis through 
               <br />
               which America is now passing, and but little 
               <br />
               else can be expected; the harvest has not been 
               <br />
               a very :good one,—however, allowing that 
               <br />
               these gentlemen are right, it is not the less 
               <br />
               true that we are rela ' ely in a state of quiet- 
               <br />
               ude and great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosgrity,</span> and it is just at 
               <br />
               the present time, when we are in a state of 
               <br />
               tranquillity and can do it in perfect liberty, 
               <br />
               that we should adopt means to settle our 
               <br />
               internal diﬁculties. It is not during a time 
               <br />
               of trouble or a civil war that we can do it, 
               <br />
               and therefore we ought to proﬁt by the 
               <br />
               opportunity which is now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> us. A Con- 
               <br />
               stitution will not last unless it is elaborated 
               <br />
               with the care, the deliberation and the calm 
               <br />
               consideration which can be devoted to it 
               <br />
               only in time of peace. We are now at peace 
               <br />
               with our neighbors, our friends are in a large 
               <br />
               majority, the question is known to the 
               <br />
               country and has been considered for several 
               <br />
               months past, and our duty is to do now in 
               <br />
               time of peace, what it is impossible to do in 
               <br />
               time of trouble. We ought also to labor to 
               <br />
               enlighten public opinion on the subject of 
               <br />
               this plan ot Confederation, not by appeals to 
               <br />
               its prejudices, but by free and open discus- 
               <br />
               sion, and by wise counsel based on that truth 
               <br />
               which should always be our guiding star. 
               <br />
               I am, therefore, disposed to vote in favor of 
               <br />
               the resolutions which are submitted to us. 
               <br />
               When I became aware that the Government 
               <br />
               were bringing forward this scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, I said to myself that we were 
               <br />
               about to be liberated from colonial leading- 
               <br />
               strings, and that we were about to become a 
               <br />
               peeple, and I expected the House would 
               <br />
               approach the question with due regard to 
               <br />
               its greatness; some hon. members have un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly done so, but I regret that many 
               <br />
               others have not been ableto raise themselves 
               <br />
               above the narrow considerations of party. 
               <br />
               The question has been discussed by states- 
               <br />
               men on this side of the House at least; but 
               <br />
               on the other side it has been made a miser- 
               <br />
               able question of party and of taxation. 
               <br />
               With these few remarks, I shall conclude by 
               <br />
               stating that it is my determination to vote 
               <br />
               in favor of the scheme submitted to us.— 
               <br />

               MR. BEAUBIEN—Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> I do

               not rise to make a long speech, for I freely 
               <br />
               acknowledge that it is not in my power to 
               <br />
               do so; and besides, the question which is 
               <br />
               submitted to us has been so well discussed 
               <br />
               by those who have preceded me, and who 
               <br />
               are in a better position than myself to judge 
               <br />
               of the condition and requirements of the 
               <br />
               country, that the subject is almost exhausted. 
               <br />
               I only wish, by rising on this occasion, to 
               <br />
               record my presence at the debates which are 
               <br />
               in progress on this question, and to state in 
               <br />
               a few words what the reasons are which in- 
               <br />
               duce me to support this measure. The 
               <br />
               peculiar position of the British North Ame- 
               <br />
               rican colonies and their proximity to the 
               <br />
               United States, call upon them to unite 
               <br />
               together in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">order</span> to form a stronger nation, 
               <br />
               and one more able to withstand the onslaught 
               <br />
               of an enemy, should it be necessary so to do, 
               <br />
               and to increase their prosperity in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mater-</span> 
               <br />
               ial point of view. There is one fact which 
               <br />
               must not be forgotten, and which I must 
               <br />
               mention—it is that when France abandoned 
               <br />
               this country, and England took possession 
               <br />
               of it, from that moment French immigration 
               <br />
               entirely ceased and gave way to immigration 
               <br />
               of persons of foreign origin—of British 
               <br />
               origin. From that period the English popu— 
               <br />
               lation increased from day to day in this 
               <br />
               country, and at the present time the French- 
               <br />
               Canadians are in a minority in United 
               <br />
               Canada. Under these circumstances, I am 
               <br />
               of opinion that it would be at once an act of 
               <br />
               imprudeuee and one characterised by a lack 
               <br />
               of generosity on our parts towish to prevent 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of the population of the country 
               <br />
               from displaying greater aspirations for our 
               <br />
               common country, and from desiring its ad- 
               <br />
               vancement and more rapid progress in an 
               <br />
               onward direction, at the same time drawing 
               <br />
               closer the bonds which unite us to the 
               <br />
               Mother Country. I have reﬂected on these 
               <br />
               matters, and although I am not disposed to 
               <br />
               submit to injustice to my country or my 
               <br />
               countrymen, yet I am ready to enter into a 
               <br />
               compromise with persons of other origins. 
               <br />
               I consider, moreover, that since we are 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with our position as English <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub.</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jecas,</span> and with the Constitution which we 
               <br />
               are allowed freely to exercise, we should 
               <br />
               do all in our power to increase England’s 
               <br />
               interest in her colonies; and for my part, I 
               <br />
               consider that the means of so doing is to 
               <br />
               accept the Confederation which is pr0posed 
               <br />
               to us. N ot long since discontent was mani-
