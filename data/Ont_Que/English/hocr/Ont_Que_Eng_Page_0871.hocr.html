               Well, Mr. SPEAKER, is there not injustice 
               <br />
               in this provision ? We have been told that 
               <br />
               we shall have the management of our public 
               <br />
               lands. I admit that this would be of great 
               <br />
               beneﬁt to us, if we were in a position to 
               <br />
               assure those who might settle in our midst 
               <br />
               that they would have a voice in the councils 
               <br />
               of the nation. But no, Mr. SPEAKER; im- 
               <br />
               migration to this country will always be 
               <br />
               impossible under the Confederation pcrparing 
               <br />
               for us, and it will be diverted towards the 
               <br />
               territories of Upper Canada, where the 
               <br />
               settlers can be represented in the Provincial 
               <br />
               Legislature, where the climate is more 
               <br />
               favorable and the soil more fertile. But 
               <br />
               from another point of view, can we consider 
               <br />
               advantageous to Lower Canada the possession 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration</span> of its public domain 
               <br />
               under the circumstances in which we shall 
               <br />
               be placed by Confederation? Assuredly 
               <br />
               not, and for this reason : each province is to 
               <br />
               assume its public lands, with the debts due 
               <br />
               upon the lands. On the public lands 
               <br />
               situated in Upper Canada, and which she 
               <br />
               is to assume, there is a debt of six millions 
               <br />
               of dollars due to the province, whilst on 
               <br />
               those in Lower Canada there is only a debt 
               <br />
               of one million, consequently Upper Canada 
               <br />
               will obtain from Lower Canada a claim for 
               <br />
               ﬁve million of dollars in excess of that which 
               <br />
               she yields to Lower Canada. Here we have 
               <br />
               one of the few great advantages which have 
               <br />
               been pointed out to us since the beginning 
               <br />
               of the discussion; and I ask you, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, whether it is advantageous to 
               <br />
               Lower Canada? On the contrary, while 
               <br />
               highly advantageous to Upper Canada, it 
               <br />
               is grossly unjust to Lower Canada. Is 
               <br />
               it not evident that the Confederation is 
               <br />
               entirely for the beneﬁt of Upper Canada? 
               <br />
               And is not a suﬁcient proof of it to be 
               <br />
               found in the fact that we ﬁnd in this House 
               <br />
               but two or three members from that section 
               <br />
               of the province who are opposed to the 
               <br />
               scheme? If all the members from Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, to what party scever they may be- 
               <br />
               long, unite to-day to support the scheme of 
               <br />
               the Government, it is because they perfectly 
               <br />
               understand that everything <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been con- 
               <br />
               ceded to them, and that they have obtained 
               <br />
               all that they wished for—all the concessions 
               <br />
               that they sought for, and for which they 
               <br />
               labored and struggled so energetically and 
               <br />
               so long. (Hear, hear.) That is perfectly 
               <br />
               well understood. But if inﬂuences hostile 
               <br />

               <br />
               Canada would never have been so persistent 
               <br />
               in striving to obtain representation based on 
               <br />
               population. She would have seen the im- 
               <br />
               possibility of obtaining it, and the inutility 
               <br />
               of asking for it, and would, in consequence, 
               <br />
               have abandoned it. But from the moment 
               <br />
               when that clause was removed from the 
               <br />
               Union Act, it was competent to the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture to enact a change in the Constitution by 
               <br />
               a mere majority; and it may consequently 
               <br />
               be said that through that inﬂuence which 
               <br />
               worked against us, Upper Canada now 
               <br />
               obtains <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> based on pOpulation. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The members from Upper 
               <br />
               Canada will observe that I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maintain</span> 
               <br />
               that the principle of representation based 
               <br />
               upon population is in itself an unjust prin- 
               <br />
               ciple; but I maintain that as they refused 
               <br />
               us the application of it when the population 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada was in a majority. it is 
               <br />
               unjust of them to demand it now because 
               <br />
               they are in a majority, and I cannot see by 
               <br />
               what right they wish to obtain it now. I 
               <br />
               say that if the application of that principle 
               <br />
               was unjust twenty years ago, it is also unjust 
               <br />
               to—day; and that if it is just to-day, it was 
               <br />
               equally just twenty years ago. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               A member considered it very extraordinary 
               <br />
               that the Rouge party—let us call it by that 
               <br />
               name, since it is the one by which the 
               <br />
               Liberal party is designated in this country, 
               <br />
               and we have no reason to take exception to 
               <br />
               it.—since the Rouge party in Canada have 
               <br />
               washed away from that name all the stains 
               <br />

               <br />

               I say, considered it extraordinary, and

               ridiculed the idea that the Rouge party
