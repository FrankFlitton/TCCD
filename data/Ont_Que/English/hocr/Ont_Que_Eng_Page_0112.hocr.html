               in exactly the same position. They have not

               ing many of the functions of government;

               but their General Government performs all

               the duties which in Upper Canada devolve

               upon our municipal councils, as well as upon 
               <br />
               Parliament. If then the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               had been asked to maintain their customs 
               <br />
               duties for federal purposes, and to impose on

               themselves by the same act direct taxation for 
               <br />
               all their local purposes, the chances of carrying

               the scheme of union would have been greatly 
               <br />
               lessened. (Hear, hear.) But I apprehend 
               <br />
               that if we did not succeed in putting this 
               <br />

               <br />
               the best, at least we did the next best thing. 
               <br />
               Two courses were open to us—either to sur- 
               <br />
               render to the local governments some source 
               <br />
               of indirect revenue, some tax which the Gene- 
               <br />
               ral Government pro to retain,——or col— 
               <br />
               lect the money by the federal machinery, and 
               <br />
               distribute it to the local governments for 
               <br />
               local p And we decided in favor of 
               <br />
               the latter. We asked the representatives of 
               <br />
               the diﬂ'erent governments to estimate how 
               <br />
               much they would require after the inaugura- 
               <br />
               tion of the federal system to carry on their 
               <br />
               local machinery. As at ﬁrst presented to us, 
               <br />
               the annual sum required for all the rovinces 
               <br />
               was something like ﬁve millions of do ars—an 
               <br />
               amount that could not ibly have been al— 
               <br />
               lotted. The great tron le was that some of 
               <br />
               the governments are vastly more expensive 
               <br />
               than others—extensive countries, with sparse 
               <br />
               populations, necessarily requiring more money 
               <br />
               per head for local government than countries 
               <br />
               more densely populated. But as any grant 
               <br />
               given from the common chest, for local ur- 
               <br />
               poses, to one province, must be extend to 
               <br />
               all, on the basis of papulation, it follows that 
               <br />
               for ev 81,000 given, for example, to New 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick,</span> we must give over 81,300 to Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, 84,000 to Lower Canada, and 86,000 
               <br />
               to Up Canada—thereby drawing from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               these provinces needed for ocal p . 
               <br />
               The course we adopted then was this: We 
               <br />
               formed a committee of Finance Ministers and 
               <br />
               made each of them over his list of expendi-

               <br />
               it is said that in addition to her eight cents

               <br />
               cutting down as I have exp ained the local 
               <br />
               expenditures to the lowest mark, it was found 
               <br />
               that New Brunswick and Newfoundland could 
               <br />
               not possibly carry on their local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wvernments</span>

               all the rest. New Brunswick imperatively 
               <br />
               required 863,000 per annum beyond her 
               <br />
               share, and we had either to ﬁnd that sum for 
               <br />
               her or give up the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hgpe</span> of union. The 
               <br />
               question then arose, we (1 it not be better to 
               <br />
               've New Brunswick a special grant of 
               <br />
               63,000 for a limited number of years, so that 
               <br />
               her local revenues might have time to be 
               <br />
               developed, rather than increase the subsidy to 
               <br />
               all the local governments, thereby lacing 
               <br />
               an additional burden on the federal exc equer 
               <br />
               of over eight hundred thousand dollars per 
               <br />
               annum ? We came unanimously to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that the extra sum needed by New 
               <br />
               Brunswick was too small to be allowed to stand 
               <br />
               in the way of union—we also determined that it 
               <br />
               would be the height of absurdity to im a 
               <br />
               permanent burden on the country of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$800,000</span> 
               <br />
               a year, simply to escape a payment of 863,000 
               <br />
               for ten years—and so it came about that New 
               <br />
               Brunswick got this extra grant—an arrange- 
               <br />
               ment which received and receives now my 
               <br />
               hearty approval. (Hear, hear.) It is onl 
               <br />
               right to say, however, that New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick</span> 
               <br />
               may possibly be in a position to do without 
               <br />
               this money. The House is aware that the 
               <br />
               Federal Government is to assume the debts of 
               <br />
               the several provinces, each province being en- 
               <br />
               titled to throw upon it a debt of 825 per 
               <br />
               head of its population. Should the debt of 
               <br />
               any province exceed 825 per head, it is to 
               <br />
               pay interest on the excess to the federal 
               <br />
               treasury; but should it fall below 825 per 
               <br />
               head, it is to receive interest from the feder- 
               <br />
               al treasury on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between its 
               <br />
               actual debt and the debt to which it is en- 
               <br />
               titled. Now, it so happens that the existing 
               <br />
               debt of New Brunswick is much less than it 
               <br />
               is entitled to throw on the Federal Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. It is, however, under liability for 
               <br />
               certain works, which if proceeded with would 
               <br />
               bring its debt up to the mark of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$25</span> a head. 
               <br />
               But if these works are not proceeded with
