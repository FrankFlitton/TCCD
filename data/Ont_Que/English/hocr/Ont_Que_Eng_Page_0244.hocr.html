               hon. friend opposite (Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jr.</span> CRAWFORD) 
               <br />
               look melancholy, because he foresees that, 
               <br />
               when the new Constitution is adopted, twelve 
               <br />
               months will not pass before that becomes 
               <br />
               law in Lower Canada, and all protection for 
               <br />
               proprietors, so far as that is concerned, 
               <br />
               brought to an end. But this is only one 
               <br />
               instance, signiﬁcant of what will take place. 
               <br />
               It is perfectly well known, and none can 
               <br />
               realize it better than those who have a much 
               <br />
               greater horror of the progress of pepular 
               <br />
               sentiments than I have, that the tendency 
               <br />
               in the popular mind is to break <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down‘</span> mon- 
               <br />
               opolies of every kind, and to go to extremes 
               <br />
               in dealing with vested rights, even those 
               <br />
               which are established and founded on sub- 
               <br />
               stantial principles of justice. Now, these 
               <br />
               rights, at the very least, ought certainly to 
               <br />
               be conﬁded to the highest legislative author- 
               <br />
               ity. I go further and maintain that naran- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tees</span> for those rights ought to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">placed</span> in the 
               <br />
               written Constitution, that they ought to be 
               <br />
               beyond the power of interference by the 
               <br />
               legislative authority, and that they should 
               <br />
               be guarded by the judicial decisions of the 
               <br />
               highest courts in the country. In that case 
               <br />
               there would be a protection for property, but 
               <br />
               in this Constitution there is no such protec- 
               <br />
               tion for property either in Upper or Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. And here is the pointto which 
               <br />
               I ask the attention of my honorable friends 
               <br />
               of all parties—a point which I think all of 
               <br />
               them have been too little concerned about, 
               <br />
               and which applies just as well to Upper as 
               <br />
               to Lower Canada. For I say that, if some 
               <br />
               security is not given to the people in one of 
               <br />
               these ways for maintaining vested rights 
               <br />
               and interests of this character, the most 
               <br />
               disastrous results will arise in every Local 
               <br />
               Parliament; because, when these parlia- 
               <br />
               ments are constructed, they will neces- 
               <br />
               sarily consist of a diﬁerent class of men from 
               <br />
               those who now compose the legislatures of 
               <br />
               the various provinces. There will be such 
               <br />
               inducements to men of the highest order to 
               <br />

               the proposed Federal Parliament is not in

               fact an abandonment of the elective prin- 
               <br />
               ciple, because the appointments are to be by 
               <br />
               the Ministry of the day, who must have the 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of the peeple. That is certainly 
               <br />
               a most extraordinary argument. If it held 
               <br />
               good at all, it should apply equally to both 
               <br />
               Houses, and the Legislative Assembly should 
               <br />
               be appointed by the Ministry, because the 
               <br />

               <br />
               have been elected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'by</span> the people. This is 
               <br />
               the clear, logical deduction from my hon. 
               <br />
               friend’s argument, if it is good for anything 
               <br />
               —because, if appointment by the Ministry 
               <br />
               is not an abandonment of the elective prin- 
               <br />
               ciple, you would still have an elective Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Assembly, although its members were 
               <br />
               appointed by the Government (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But this was also well answered on 
               <br />
               a former occasion by my hon. friend behind 
               <br />
               me (Hon. Mr. AIKINS.) It is not simply 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst appointment that we oppose. his 
               <br />
               the appointments afterwards, as the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               members die out or resign, and their suc- 
               <br />
               cessors are appointed on the nomination of 
               <br />
               the future local governments. Instead of 
               <br />
               this producing a favorable result, it appears 
               <br />
               to me it will have just the opposite effect. 
               <br />
               The reason is plain. If, in the very ﬁrst 
               <br />
               instance, the prerogative is exercised, not by 
               <br />
               the Sovereign or the Sovereign’s representa- 
               <br />
               tive, unbiassed, but is exercised by a party 
               <br />
               government, you have a House constituted 
               <br />
               at its very ﬁrst meeting of a party character. 
               <br />
               In the other branch that particular Govern- 
               <br />
               ment has a majority. But it is possible, 
               <br />
               that that party may not long retain power. 
               <br />
               In the nature of things it is not probable 
               <br />
               that they will. No party does. But the 
               <br />
               Upper House remains permanent, and you 
               <br />
               provide by your very ﬁrst operation for that 
               <br />
               dead-lock—that conﬂict between the Upper 
               <br />
