               ation was like that of the Roman Empire

               when near its fall. The union, as the Hon.

               Attorney General for Lower Canada (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. CARTIER) so well said, had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lasted</span> its 
               <br />
               time; it now became necessary to try some- 
               <br />
               thing else. It was necessary that the nation 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which,</span> of all the diﬁ'erent races which inhabit 
               <br />
               the British Provinces in North America, is 
               <br />
               foremost in duration, energy and prosperity, 
               <br />
               should take the lead and initiate that measure 
               <br />
               which was to deliver the country from its diﬂi- 
               <br />
               culties. Well, Mr. SPEAKER, the most natural 
               <br />
               remedy which occurred was thcscheme for the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the English Provinces on this 
               <br />
               continent, and as the opponents of the measure 
               <br />
               ——men who have thrown all their powers, cour- 
               <br />
               age and perseverance into their opposition— 
               <br />
               have never moved any other, it seemed to be 
               <br />
               the only one which found acceptance. This 
               <br />
               scheme has not had the effect of producing 
               <br />
               fear in my mind, as it has in several members 
               <br />
               who have spoken before me. After careful 
               <br />
               examination, I have arrived at the conclusion 
               <br />
               that it is practicable, and that it ought to be 
               <br />
               adopted. I am well aware that it is not per- 
               <br />
               fect, for there is nothing perfect in this nether 
               <br />
               world. It- was not possible to take every 
               <br />
               advantage for Lower Canada, and to leave 
               <br />
               nothing for Upper Canada and the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces. Some concessions were necessary 
               <br />
               to be made in common justice, as we were 
               <br />
               obtaining great material advantages, together 
               <br />
               with the preservation and protection of our 
               <br />
               dearest interests. In short, it was necessary 
               <br />
               that we and they should make what is gener- 
               <br />
               ally termed a compromise, and that compro- 
               <br />
               mise was such as to be in our favor in every 
               <br />
               ct. I do not profess to be a religious 
               <br />
               man, but I may venture to assert, without 
               <br />
               transgressing the-bounds of modesty, that I 
               <br />
               love and revere my religion as much as any 
               <br />
               other man in this House. Before, therefore, 
               <br />
               I could form any decided opinion on the 
               <br />
               question that is now before the House, and 
               <br />
               give my vote in favor of it, I did not omit to 
               <br />
               consult our priests. I have always blamed 
               <br />
               the conduct of those priests who interfered in 
               <br />
               elections and matters of policy, acting the 
               <br />
               parts of canvassers and ultra-partisans, instead 
               <br />
               of endeavoring from the pulpit—the very 
               <br />
               abode of truth—to calm the animosities of 
               <br />
               arties, and to aid the people in making an

               <br />
               demned. I love to ﬁnd in the members of

               they ought to be considered citizens, and to 
               <br />

               <br />
               class the endowments and privileges which 
               <br />
               belong to others, and that, as others have, so 
               <br />
               should they have a right to examine the new

               (Hear, hear.) I have no intention to name 
               <br />
               these two venerable men, who are known 
               <br />
               throughout the country as two of the most 
               <br />
               distinguished members of our Canadian 
               <br />
               clergy and most eminent citizens. Well, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I consulted those two men, and 
               <br />
               both agreed in making answer that they were 
               <br />
               favorable to the project of Confederation of 
               <br />
               the British North American Provinces on 
               <br />
               this continent. Resting, then, on my own 
               <br />
               convictions that Confederation is the best 
               <br />
               means we have at hand of escaping from the 
               <br />
               present diﬂicult position of the country, and 
               <br />
               on the authority of members of the clergy 
               <br />
               ——an authority which I take pleasure in 
               <br />
               mentionin , because the opponents of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               all the clergy in the country are opposed to
