               Ma. McGIVERIN—The honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAM- 
               <br />
               naox) has stated, that while he is an ad- 
               <br />
               vocate of union, he believed that a Legislative 
               <br />
               would be preferable to a Federal union. It is 
               <br />
               easy for honorable members to make that as- 
               <br />
               sertion. There are few, at least, of the 
               <br />
               English-speaking of this country who would 
               <br />
               not also be favorable to the principle of a 
               <br />
               legislative union. But can we get it? We 
               <br />
               have tried year after year to obtain represent- 
               <br />
               ation by population, with a view to bettering 
               <br />
               our condition in the western section of the 
               <br />
               province, by getting a fair and equal distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of the public moneys of the country, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to our wealth and population, and the 
               <br />
               measure in which we contribute to the public 
               <br />
               revenue. Few, I think, will deny that the 
               <br />
               western section—for whatever reason, whether 
               <br />
               because of its being more favorably situated, 
               <br />
               md having a better climate and more fertile 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soil,</span> or from whatever other cause—the fact is 
               <br />
               mdisputable that the western section of this 
               <br />
               province produces more and consumes more 
               <br />
               than the eastern section. And this formed 
               <br />
               the ground of complaint, the reason of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">zgitation,</span> that notwithstanding this fact, we 
               <br />
               0 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ilpper</span> Canada were not placed on an equal 
               <br />
               footing with the Lower Canadians in the le- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gislature</span> oi the country, and in the adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁ’airs.</span> Hence it is that popu- 
               <br />
               lar opinion in Upper Canada has declared so 
               <br />
               emphatically that a change is necessary. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(hear,</span> hear.) The honorable member for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> Ontario favors a kind of union which, 
               <br />
               tllough desirable in many respects, most 
               <br />
               people believe to be impracticable. Are the

               <br />
               Just and equal rights, willing to concede it ? 
               <br />
               I believe not. Even the liberal section of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span> Canada refused to concede to us a fair 
               <br />
               legislative union. The honorable member 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hochelaga—a</span> gentleman for whom I en- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tertain</span> the highest respect—I believe a more 
               <br />
               liberal or high-minded man does not sit in this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House—even</span> he, whilst we were acting with

               <br />

               <br />
               Canada in some policy that would remove 
               <br />

               in rejecting it, simply because in accepting it 
               <br />
               we were compelled for the time to allow party 
               <br />
               feelings to remain in abeyance, or because we 
               <br />
               had to work in harmony for a time with the

               <br />

               <br />
               for which we, as a party and as a people, had 
               <br />
               worked and agitated year after year, have re-

               ever opinions any might entcrtaiu of my con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               in justice to my country, 1 was bound to set 
               <br />
               aside party feeling and take that course which 
               <br />
               was for the best interests of our common

               ure. It was also stated by the honorable 
               <br />
               member for North Ontario, that instead of 
               <br />
               our preparing ourselves for the contingency of 
               <br />
               difﬁculties arising with our neighbors, we 
               <br />
               should remain quiet; we should, in other 
               <br />
               words, lie down and allow them to ride over 
               <br />
               us and trample us in the dust. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Mr. SPEAKER, that was not the 
               <br />
               sentiment, those were not the feelings which 
               <br />
               actuated the noble veterans of 1812—(hear, 
               <br />
               hear)——who, though few in number, with a 
               <br />
               country sparsely settled and an immense ex— 
               <br />
               tent of frontier, bravely did all that lay in 
               <br />
               their power to resist the foe; and they not 
               <br />
               only resisted but repelled him. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Though we are still comparatively few in 
               <br />
               number, we have nevertheless increased since 
               <br />
               that period in wealth and in population in 
               <br />
               an equal ratio with the United States. _ _And 
               <br />
               though this war has developed t mih 
               <br />
               resources on their part, I think shall be able 
               <br />
               to show that with the resources we have— 
               <br />
               with the force we can bring into the ﬁeld of 
               <br />
               at least six hundred thousand armed men _if 
               <br />
               needed —- (hear, hear)——and with the aid
