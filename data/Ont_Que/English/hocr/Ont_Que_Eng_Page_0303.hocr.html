               four. The next concession is to New Bruns—

               <br />

               made to the people of the eastern provin— 
               <br />
               ces. What do we get for all these conces- 
               <br />
               sions ? Do we get anything that we are not 
               <br />
               entitled to as a matter of right. We get 17 
               <br />
               additional members of the Lower House 
               <br />
               for Upper Canada—but that is nothing 
               <br />
               more than we are entitled to—at the 
               <br />
               same time that we get 47 added from the 
               <br />
               east. We are told that the reason for 
               <br />
               having so large anumber of members is to 
               <br />
               avoid narrow majorities. If everything 
               <br />
               works well, therefore, under the new consti- 
               <br />
               tution, we are told we will always have a

               strong Government, somewhat similar to

               <br />
               that they are satisﬁed with the arrangement ; 
               <br />

               <br />
               consider the matter still more fully? In my 
               <br />
               opinion, it is far better to take the thing up 
               <br />
               deliberately and proceed cautiously with it, 
               <br />
               than to attempt to force a measure upon 
               <br />
               the people. so hurriedly, that they will feel 
               <br />
               hereafter, if they do not now, that you are 
               <br />
