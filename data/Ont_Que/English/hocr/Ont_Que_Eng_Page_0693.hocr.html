               scheme. (Hear, hear.) Iwill now, Mr. SPEAK- 
               <br />
               EB, look at the scheme in its sectional aspect; 
               <br />
               and, in my judgment, it is in this respect a 
               <br />
               .fair one. The apportionment of the debt 
               <br />
               and other ﬁnancial arrangements is a theme 
               <br />
               upon which many remarks and explanations 
               <br />
               have been made in this, as well as in the 
               <br />
               other branch of the Legislature ; and charges 
               <br />
               are made of having bribed the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces into the scheme, and that the 
               <br />
               Canadian Delegates in the Conference sacri- 
               <br />
               ﬁced the interests of Canada in their 
               <br />
               eagerness to consummate a scheme that had 
               <br />
               its origin in their political necessities. One 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman complains that pepulatiou is 
               <br />
               not the proper basis upon which to distribute 
               <br />
               the burden of the public debt, and that by 
               <br />
               adapting it Canada has been saddled with 
               <br />
               many millions more than her share. “ Re- 
               <br />
               venue," it is contended, “ is the true test of 
               <br />
               ability to pay, therefore revenue is the basis 
               <br />
               upon which the apportionment should be 
               <br />
               made.” Were the taxation alike in all the 
               <br />
               provinces, there would, at least, be the 
               <br />
               appearance of justice in the argument ; but 
               <br />
               with revenue raised under the operation of 
               <br />
               different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬂs,</span> in the several provinces, I 
               <br />
               think population is a justcr basis than 
               <br />
               revenue. Taking, however, the revenues as 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd them under existing tariﬁ's, and 
               <br />
               adjusting the debt by that standard, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that it wrll <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ</span> but little from the appor- 
               <br />
               tionment that has been agreed upon; and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> the tariffs of the Maritime Provinces 
               <br />
               somewhat higher than they are now, I 
               <br />
               apprehend, sir, that the consuming ability 
               <br />
               of these provinces would demonstrate not 
               <br />
               only their ability to pay according to this 
               <br />
               test, but also that Canada is in no way 
               <br />
               imposed upon in regard to the amount of 
               <br />
               debt with which these provinces are to be 
               <br />
               permitted to enter the union. I believe that 
               <br />
               every one of the ﬁve provinces has had its in- 
               <br />
               terests well consulted in this scheme, and that 
               <br />
               it is so well balanced throughout in reference 
               <br />
               to those interests, that there is very little to 
               <br />
               complain of. (Hear, hear.) But speaking 
               <br />
               from an Upper Canadian point of view— 
               <br />
               which I deem it my duty to do, as one of the 
               <br />
               representatives of that section—I will glance 
               <br />
               at one or two of the objections urged by the 
               <br />
               honorable member for North Ontario, very 
               <br />
               brieﬂy. That honorable gentleman accuses 
               <br />
               Upper Canadians of disregarding and forget- 
               <br />
               ting their former professions on the represent-

               Honorable President of the Council, as the 
               <br />
               leader in the agitation for representation by 
               <br />
               population, has agreed to a measure that is a 
               <br />
               mere delusion, that in point of fact puts Up- 
               <br />
               per Canada in a worse position than she now 
               <br />
               occupies. He says that instead of occupying 
               <br />
               a position of equality in the legislature, as 
               <br />

               a majority of thirty arrayed against her. The 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman builds his argument upon 
               <br />
               false and erroneous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">premises,</span> when he says 
               <br />

               <br />
               representation according to its population; 
               <br />
               and when he points out that all the other 
               <br />

               <br />
               General Legislature by thirty votes, I submit, 
               <br />
               sir, that his ent is exceedingly unfair, 
               <br />
               and is founded on the assumption that Upper 
               <br />
               Canada asked for an increase of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representa</span> 
               <br />
               tion for the purpose of obtaining supremacy 
               <br />
               in the Government. Now, I deny that most 
               <br />
               emphatically on behalf, not only of myself, 
               <br />
               but of every man from Upper Canada who de— 
               <br />
               manded a change in the representation. We 
               <br />
               did not advocate that change for the purpose 
               <br />
               of' gaining the supremacy, but simply and 
               <br />
               solely as a measure of justice to the people 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada, and to place them on an 
               <br />
               equal footing, man for man, with the people 
               <br />
               ot Lower Canada. We had certain grievances 
               <br />
               and wrongs which we complained of, and 
               <br />
               which the granting of representation would 
               <br />
               not of itself redress; we complained that a 
               <br />
               larger proportion of the public revenues, to 
               <br />
               which we contributed seventy per cent, was 
               <br />
               spent in Lower Canada than in Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada; we complained also of legislative acts 
               <br />
               passed by majorities from Lower Canada and 
               <br />
               which concerned Upper Canada chieﬂy; we 
               <br />
               did not ask representation by population be» 
               <br />

               <br />
               away all this injustice, but because it would 
               <br />
               give us this advantage, that we would in tins

               <br />
               an equal, and no more than equal, voice In
