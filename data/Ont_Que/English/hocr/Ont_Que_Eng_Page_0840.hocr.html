               reservedly. And, sir, it is just because this

               seems to have been eﬂ'ectual in all essential

               among our children. For all these reasons, 
               <br />
               I say, I am disposed to give my hearty sup-

               port to the scheme as a whole, without 
               <br />
               criticising too narrowly the innumerable

               antiquated notions of the dangers which 
               <br />

               is true that here as elsewhere, there are

               free and sovereign elector of an autocratic

               President, whose very Minister can boast the

               <br />
               many reasons why we should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> unite in 
               <br />
               furthering this project. It is not merely 
               <br />
               because of the barriers to material progress 
               <br />
               which it will remove—though I am far from 
               <br />
               undervaluiug their importance; it is not 
               <br />
               merely because of the higher prizes which 
               <br />
               it will throw open to individual ambition-— 
               <br />
               though I do not affect to_despise this either ; 
               <br />
               but it is chieﬂy, after all, because I believe it 
               <br />
               will be found to have the most beneﬁcial

               results, in elevating our politics and in 
               <br />
               inspiring our people with those feelings of 
               <br />
               dignity and self-respect which lie at the

               bottom of all real national greatness. 
               <br />
               Sir, I can only liken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span> position for 
               <br />
               some time past to that of a youth 
               <br />
               who has been allowed to take possession of 
               <br />
               his inheritance at an age when he is not yet 
               <br />
               legally responsible for his actions. I do not 
               <br />
               believe that such a position is good either 
               <br />
               tor a nation or an individual, and I for one 
               <br />
               rejoice that it is about being brought to a

               weak to allow more than a few remarks.

               Still, sir, I do not wish to sit down without

               saying brieﬂy that I am glad to ﬁnd one

               while it does not require the possession of
