               adjournment of the House. Subsequently, 
               <br />
               interviews were bad between the members of 
               <br />
               the Government and the member for South 
               <br />
               Oxford, which, resulted in the present Co- 
               <br />
               alition Government. Sir, after a full con- 
               <br />
               sideration of the subject in all its bearings, 
               <br />
               I decided to give the new-Government my 
               <br />
               en port, trusting they would be able, as I 
               <br />
               be ieved they desired, to put the aﬁ'airs of 
               <br />
               this“ country on a more satisfactory and 
               <br />
               enduring basis. But, while I support this 
               <br />
               Government, I must not be understood as 
               <br />
               approving of coalitions generally. I hold 
               <br />
               that to a country enjoying representative 
               <br />
               institutions and responsible government, it 
               <br />
               is indeed a matter of very little consequence 
               <br />
               which of the political parties are in power, 
               <br />
               so long as there is a strong party to scruti- 
               <br />
               nise their acts, and exercise a general sur- 
               <br />
               veillance over them. When, however, the 
               <br />
               two great parties coalesce, and there is no 
               <br />
               strong party in the country‘ to watch them, 
               <br />
               there is more or less danger of abuses and 
               <br />
               corruption creeping in. I do not, however, 
               <br />
               desire that the gentlemen on the Treasury 
               <br />
               benches should understand that I apply this 
               <br />
               remark to them. They, sir, I believe, are 
               <br />
               not only pure, but, like CÆsan’s wife, above 
               <br />
               suspicion. And, if even a necessity existed 
               <br />
               in any country to justify a coalition, it was 
               <br />
               in Canada; and I rejoice to know that 
               <br />
               we had statesmen among us who could rise 
               <br />
               above the petty political and personal 
               <br />
               squabbles, in which they had been unfor- 
               <br />
               tunately too long engaged, to grapple with 
               <br />
               a great national diﬂiculty. (Cheers.) I 
               <br />
               think, too, it was most fortunate—providen- 
               <br />
               tial, I might say—that this country had a 
               <br />
               strong, vigorous Government during the

               it as a commercial enterprise; I look upon

               union between the Confederated Provinces. 
               <br />
               Sir, we have been told that the Imperial

               Government has been notiﬁed of the inten-

               mind this will be most unfortunate for

               bers of the Government who will shortly visit 
               <br />
               England will urge the Imperial Govern-

               do not partici te in the feeling that its
