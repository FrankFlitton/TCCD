               it; this Parliament has no power to dis 
               <br />
               ﬁnally of this question. The British ar- 
               <br />
               liament can act with or without the consent of 
               <br />
               this Parliament; therefore, it a pears to me 
               <br />
               that the cases cited are not app icable to our 
               <br />
               case, and I maintain that submitting the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions to the people would prevent irritation 
               <br />

               that if the measure is not passed now, the 
               <br />
               time will never occur again ? So far as 
               <br />
               Upper Canada is concerned, I think she might 
               <br />
               hope to obtain such a scheme as this at any 
               <br />

               Ma. JOHN MACDONALD (Toronto) 
               <br />
               said—MB. SPEAKER, before recording my 
               <br />
               vote on this question, I desire plainly to 
               <br />
               state the position which I occupy in regard 
               <br />
               to it. I desire to say that I am in favor of 
               <br />
               Confederation. (Hear, hear.) The ﬁrst reso- 
               <br />
               lution which was proposed at the Quebec 
               <br />
               Conference and agreed upon, namely, that 
               <br />
               a Confederation of all the British North 
               <br />
               America Provinces, on principles just to all, 
               <br />
               was desirable, I have no hesitation in saying, 
               <br />
               meets with my entire approval. We have 
               <br />
               been told that the Conference at Quebec 
               <br />
               exhibited one of the grandest spectacles 
               <br />
               which the world ever beheld. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I may be wrong, but I fail to see it 
               <br />
               in that light. I am prepared to award 
               <br />
               to honorable gentlemen all the sincerity 
               <br />
               in meeting together to settle the sec— 
               <br />
               tional diiiiculties of this country to which 
               <br />
               they can possibly lay claim, and it is a matter 
               <br />
               of great regret to me that I ﬁnd myself 
               <br />
               to-night compelled to record my Vote against 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen with whom it has been my 
               <br />
               pleasure to be associated ever sinceI entered 
               <br />
               political life. But, air, it is with me a matter 
               <br />
               of conscientious conviction, and I am bound, 
               <br />
               whatever the consequences may be, to follow 
               <br />
               those convictions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) Now, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I think that hon. gentlemen, in 
               <br />
               bringing this scheme down and saying that 
               <br />
               we must take it just as it is without making 
               <br />
               any amendment to it whatever, are asking 
               <br />
               too much. (Hear, hear.) That is assuming 
               <br />
               the document is perfect in every particular, 
               <br />
               or as nearly so as possible. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wevare</span> to 
               <br />
               undertake the discussion of this question, and 
               <br />

               although he id not agree with some of the

               <br />
               prepared to vote for it just as it stands.

               <br />
               if the appropriation of the debt between 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada isa minute detail?

               of the country is a minute detail ? And yet

               <br />
               the hon. gentleman says, that we should vote 
               <br />
               upon it in ignorance of these things, and 
               <br />
               leave the result, if wrong, to be righted by 
               <br />
               future legislators. Well, the member may

               vote in ignorance if he refers to do things 
               <br />
               in that way, but as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lpam</span> constituted (it

               I will never record a vote in this House
