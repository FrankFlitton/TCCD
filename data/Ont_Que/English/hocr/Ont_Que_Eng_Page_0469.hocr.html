               said that in our present exigencies we must 
               <br />
               look out for other markets for our produce 
               <br />
               than those we have been depending upon; 
               <br />
               that we must endeavor to become a manufac-

               <br />
               Lower Provinces and sending them our pro- 
               <br />
               duce in return. That is all very ﬁne, but 
               <br />
               it can be accomplished without entering into 
               <br />
               an extravagantly expensive arrangement 
               <br />
               such as this is. We could have a legislative 
               <br />
               union with one Legislature or Central Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, that would manage all our aﬁ'airs 
               <br />
               on a scale as economical as the affairs of the 
               <br />
               province of Canada have been conducted; 
               <br />
               but when you provide for a General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and then for a Local Government in 
               <br />
               each province besides, it stands to reason 
               <br />
               that the expenditure must be far in excess 
               <br />
               of that which would result from having a 
               <br />
               single legislature. The Hon. President 
               <br />
               of the Council has said that he is not, al- 
               <br />
               though all his other colleagues who have 
               <br />
               spoken on the ﬂoor of the House have ad- 
               <br />
               mitted that they are, in favor of a legislative 
               <br />
               union, if this union could be accomplished. 
               <br />
               The Hon. President of the Council thinks, 
               <br />
               perhaps, that this wouid be too damaging an 
               <br />
               admssion, so he says: “I would not have 
               <br />
               a legislative union if I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could.</span> There is 
               <br />
               nothing but a Federal union for me, be-

               would be impossible to control it with a 
               <br />
               Legislature sitting at Ottawa.” Now, is 
               <br />
               this so? Would four or ﬁve hundred 
               <br />
               additional miles of territory make all the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> ? -

               union was that in attending to the private

               business of the Lower Provinces, under a 
               <br />
               legislative union, we would be kept sitting 
               <br />
               at Ottawa for nine months of the year. It 
               <br />
               is, however, the case that the alfairs of 
               <br />
               United Canada can be transacted in a period 
               <br />
               of three or four months, while according to 
               <br />
               the Hon. the President of the Council, the 
               <br />
               affairs of the federated provinces would not 
               <br />
               be attended to in less than nine months in 
               <br />
               consequence of the private business which 
               <br />
               would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">added»</span> to the legislation from a 
               <br />
               people numbering only seven or eight hun- 
               <br />
               dred thousand. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) The business 
               <br />
               of two and a half millions can be disposed of 
               <br />
               in three months, whilst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alleged</span> that the 
               <br />
               business brought by the addition of seven or 
               <br />
               eight hundred thousand more would prolong 
               <br />
               the sessions of Parliament by six months. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I think that the position 
               <br />
               which the hon. gentleman took in reference 
               <br />
               to that, is just as untenable as his position 
               <br />
               that a Legislative union in itself would not 
               <br />
               be better than a Federal union. Now, it is 
               <br />
               said that our commercial aﬂ'airs will be very 
               <br />
               much advanced by this arrangement. It is 
               <br />
               said that the Reciprocity treaty is going to 
               <br />
               be abrogated. No doubt we have received 
               <br />
               notice of it. It is also said that it is 
               <br />
               possible — although the Hon. President 
               <br />
               of the Council does not think it is so—that 
               <br />
               the bonded system is to be done away with 
               <br />
               between Canada and the United States, and 
               <br />
               that, therefore, we would have no means of 
               <br />
               reaching the Atlantic except during the 
               <br />
               summer months of the year, in consequence 
               <br />
               of which it is very desirable that this great 
               <br />
               work of the Intercolonial Railway should 
               <br />
               be accomplished, and that this union of the 
               <br />
               provinces should take place. I presume it 
               <br />
               is a well understood fact that a people will 
               <br />
               always ﬁnd some channel into which to 
               <br />
               direct their energies—that there will be a 
               <br />
               channel for their commerce—that there 
               <br />
               will be a channel for their produce. Now, 
               <br />
               if the Reciprocity treaty is abrogated, and if 
               <br />
               the bonded system is put an end to, it will 
               <br />
               be done long before the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way can be established, and we must then 
               <br />
               remain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁering-</span> for a number of years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nail</span>
