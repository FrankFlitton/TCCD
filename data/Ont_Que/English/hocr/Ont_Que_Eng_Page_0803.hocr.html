               not impose upon us a Constitution other than 
               <br />
               that for which we ask. N ow, I have more 
               <br />
               conﬁdence than‘he has in the word of our 
               <br />

               mperial Government. Our public men 
               <br />
               having made a compromise, and asked a

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> Constitution for the British North American

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> which exist in the province, are 
               <br />
               we for a single instant to believe that when 
               <br />
               this scheme, which is framed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reestablish</span> 
               <br />
               that peace, harmony and concord of which 
               <br />
               we stand in need, is carried to England that 
               <br />
               a clause will be inserted which would raise 
               <br />
               the Lower-Canadians like one man ? In such 
               <br />
               a case we should see petitions pour into the 
               <br />
               House headed with the signatures of the 
               <br />
               principal members of the clergy, exclaiming 
               <br />
               against such injustice; in such a case we 
               <br />
               should see real petitions against this attack 
               <br />
               upon our religious rights. If our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions</span> 
               <br />
               should be so menaced, the Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               peeple would do themselves justice, if it 
               <br />
               was refused to them, and we should no 
               <br />
               longer enjoy that peace which new prevails 
               <br />
               in Canada between populations of diﬁ‘erent 
               <br />
               origins and belief, in consequence of the 
               <br />
               absence of disquietude among the peeple— 
               <br />
               (hear, hear)——I have conﬁdence enough in 
               <br />
               the clergy and bishops of Lower Canada to 
               <br />
               believe that if that clause, on which so much 
               <br />
               stress is laid, was of a nature to do any 
               <br />
               inj 'ry to our religious interests, they would 
               <br />
               loudly exclaim against it and have justice 
               <br />
               done us. Our bishops are not in the habit 
               <br />
               of standing in fear of the civil authorities, 
               <br />
               when their duty calls them to defend the 
               <br />
               interests which are entrusted to them. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It is stated also that the 
               <br />
               clergy are not in favor of the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation, because two or three of its 
               <br />
               members have written in newspapers and 
               <br />
               have signed petitions opposed to the scheme. 
               <br />
               But is that a manifestation of the opinion of 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               the clergy? No; for they do not write in

               <br />
               individual capacity as citizens; for they sign 
               <br />
               their writings under their title as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">citizens.</span> 
               <br />
               Certain members of the clergy may diﬁer 
               <br />
               widely in opinion from the remainder of 
               <br />
               their brethren; as citizens they may believe 
               <br />
               that the scheme of Confederation is a had 
               <br />
               one, but those who hold that opinion are 
               <br />
               certainly a minority, just as in the House it 
               <br />
               is the minority of the members who are 
               <br />
               opposed to Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Mention is also made of the use of the 
               <br />
               French language; it is said that it cannot 
               <br />
               be used in the Federal Parliament. But, 
               <br />
               for my part, I am of opinion that if the 
               <br />
               scheme is adapted, the French language will 
               <br />
               be more used and will be held in higher 
               <br />
               estimation in the Federal Parliament, than 
               <br />
               it has been in this Legislature for some 
               <br />
               years. It is feared that the laws, the 
               <br />
               documents and the proceedings of the 
               <br />
               Federal Parliament are not to be printed in 
               <br />
               the French language. But what does the 
               <br />
               46th clause of the resolutions say? It says :— 
               <br />
               Both the English and French language: may 
               <br />
               be employed in the General Parliament, and in 
               <br />
               its proceedings, and in the Local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, and also in the Federal courts, 
               <br />
               and in the courts of Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               Thus, if the use of the French language can 
               <br />
               be excluded, so also may the use of the 
               <br />
               English language be excluded, for both are 
               <br />
               on an equal footing. Because it is not 
               <br />
               stated that the laws and the proceedings of 
               <br />
               the Federal Parliament shall be printed in
