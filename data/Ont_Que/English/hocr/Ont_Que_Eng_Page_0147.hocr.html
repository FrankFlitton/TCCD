               It is astonishing how active has been the

               public mind in all those communities since 
               <br />
               the subject has been fairly launched. I have

               watched with great attention the expression 
               <br />

               vinces I have been able to read writings and 
               <br />
               speeches which would do no discredit to 
               <br />
               o der and more cultivated communities— 
               <br />
               articles and speeches worthy of any press and 
               <br />
               of any audience. The provincial mind, it

               risen at once to the true dignity of this

               satisfaction and assurance that, if we never 
               <br />
               went farther in this matter, we have put an

               <br />
               bitterer and smaller controversies. We have 
               <br />
               given the people some sound mental food, 
               <br />
               and to every man who has a capacity for 
               <br />

               the poor effort of advancing the ends of some 
               <br />
               paltry faction or party. I can congratulate

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,:hear.)</span> We on this side, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Briana,</span> 
               <br />
               propose for that better future our plan of 
               <br />
               union ; and, if you will allow me, I shall 
               <br />
               go over what appear to me the principal 
               <br />
               motives which exist at present for that 
               <br />
               union. My hon. friend the Finance Minister 
               <br />
               mentioned the other evening several strong 
               <br />
               motives for union—free access to the sea, an 
               <br />
               extended market, breaking down of hostile 
               <br />
               tariﬁ's, a more diversiﬁed ﬁeld for labor and 
               <br />
               capital, our enhanced credit with England, 
               <br />
               and our greater effectiveness when united 
               <br />
               for assistance in time of danger. (Cheers) 
               <br />
               The Hon. President of the Council also 
               <br />
               enumerated several motives for union in 
               <br />
               relation to the commercial advan which 
               <br />
               will ﬂow from it, and other powerful reasons 
               <br />
               which may be advanced in favor of it. But the 
               <br />
               motives to such a comprehensive change as 
               <br />
               we propose, must be mixed motives—partly 
               <br />
               commercial, artly military, and partly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">polio</span> 
               <br />
               tical; and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> go over a few—not strained 
               <br />
               or simulated—motives which are ente’rtained 
               <br />
               by many people of all these provinces, and 
               <br />
               are rather of a social, or, strictly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speaking,</span> 
               <br />
               political, than of a ﬁnancial kind. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place, I echo what was stated in the 
               <br />
               speech last night of my honorable friend, the 
               <br />
               President of the Council—that we cannot 
               <br />
               stand still; we cannot stave oﬁ‘ some great 
               <br />
               change; we cannot stand alone, province 
               <br />
               apart from province, if we would; and that 
               <br />
               we _are in a state of political transition. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All.</span> 
               <br />
               even honorable gentlemen who are opposed 
               <br />
               to this union, admit that we must do some- 
               <br />
               thing, and that that something must not be 
               <br />
               a mere temporary expedient. We are com- 
               <br />
               pelled, by warning voices from within and 
               <br />
               without, to make a change, and a great 
               <br />
               change. We all, with one voice, who are 
               <br />
               unionists, declare our conviction that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can.</span>
