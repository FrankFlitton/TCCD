               HON. Ma. DORION—Mr. Spsann, the 
               <br />
               honorable member fer Montmorency, who has 
               <br />
               just sat down, having given it as his opinion 
               <br />
               that all those who are Opposed to Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion are annexationists and inﬁdels, I must 
               <br />
               congratulate him upon having at last opened 
               <br />
               his eyes and escaped the danger of being 
               <br />
               drawn into the vertex of the American Union, 
               <br />
               and perhaps into something worse—(laughter) 
               <br />
               —-as but a short time ago he was in the bad 
               <br />
               company of those who are opposed to Confed- 
               <br />
               eration. He has even written a whole volume 
               <br />
               in opposition to the union Of the British 
               <br />
               North American Provinces. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I suppose that at that time he did not look 
               <br />
               upon himself as an annexationist, and still 
               <br />
               less as an inﬁdel, for the simple reason that 
               <br />
               hecombatted with all the owcr at his com- 
               <br />
               mand, not only Confederation, but also union 
               <br />
               of any kind with the British American Pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vinces.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) In that book, which 
               <br />
               I have just referred to, and which was writ- 
               <br />
               ten at the end of 1858, the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber, after having described the different sys—

               tems under which the union might be pro- 
               <br />
               jected, says :_“ We do not desire it, because 
               <br />
               we do not want union in any form, inasmuch 
               <br />
               as the same object will always be attained, no

               tablished.” That Object, according to the hon.

               member, was the depriving Lower Canada of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               that the honorable gentleman has written an- 
               <br />
               other book lately. According to that book he 
               <br />
               no longer sees any other danger for Lower Cm- 
               <br />

               <br />

               gers. Hear, hear, and laughter.) Once 
               <br />
               more congratulate him that he is now out 
               <br />
               of danger, and I will endeavor to follow him 
               <br />
               with his two books in his hand. As it is too 
               <br />
               late te-night, however, I will do it at the next 
               <br />
               sitting, and for that purpose I move that the

               HON. Mn. CAUCHON ——The honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga alludes to the two 
               <br />
               pamphlets which I have written, one in 1858, 
               <br />
               and the other in 1865, on the subject of the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the provinces. The differ- 
               <br />
               ence between the honorable member and me 
               <br />
               is simply this, that I do not deny what I have 
               <br />
               written, whilst in’ order that he may enjoy 
               <br />
               greater freedom of discussion, he has thought 
               <br />
               proper to deny his actions in the past. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> 
               <br />
               hear.) There is another contradiction which 
               <br />
               it is Of importance to remark. After having 
               <br />
               asserted, up to 1861, that there was danger 
               <br />
               for Lower Canada in not granting to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada representation based upon pOpulation, 
               <br />
               or its substitute, the Confederation of the 
               <br />
               two Canadas, and that the danger was so 
               <br />
               menacing that it was more prudent tegive 
               <br />
               way than to allow it to be forcibly taken by 
               <br />
               her—to-day he comes down and maintains 
               <br />
               that the horizon is quite serene; that there 
               <br />
               is no necessity for constitutional changes. 
               <br />
               Does he then so easily forget the days of 
               <br />
               1858, ’59, ’60 and ’61 ? (Hear, hear.) For 
               <br />
               my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I think we should 
               <br />
               be acting with more dignity, and would ren- 
               <br />
               der more service to the country, if we de-
