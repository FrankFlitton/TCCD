               orable friend the Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />
               for Upper Canada introduced the resolutions 
               <br />
               to the House, he gave us to understand that 
               <br />
               the question, or the details of the question, 
               <br />
               were scarcely to be considered as epen for 
               <br />
               debate. He told us plainly and squarely 
               <br />
               that the project must be viewed as a treaty

               <br />
               as a whole or rejected as a whole. I felt the 
               <br />
               force of the situation then, and when the 
               <br />

               phase of diﬁculty resulting from the turn

               taken by the elections in New Brunswick,

               announced that prompt and vigorous action

               was necessary, in a somewhat different direc-

               tion from that originally contemplated, I felt 
               <br />
               the force of the situation even more fully 
               <br />
               than at ﬁrst. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> And I would 
               <br />
               here ask to be allowed to digress a moment 
               <br />
               from the main question. I wish to take this 
               <br />
               opportunity of saying that I never had more 
               <br />
               than a sort of a half-conﬁdence in the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment as now constituted. When the 
               <br />
               leaders of the Conservative party, with whom 
               <br />
               I have always acted, saw ﬁt last yearto make 
               <br />
               certain political combinations which, even 
               <br />
               they must admit, astonished and startled the 
               <br />
               country—combinations resulting in the pre- 
               <br />
               sent Coalition Ministry—I claimed that I 
               <br />
               and every member of the Conservative party, 
               <br />
               in this House or out of it, who chose 
               <br />
               to dissent from the course adopted by r 
               <br />

               from all party ties and obligations whatever. 
               <br />

               hybrid position of an “ independent member,” 
               <br />
               I knew full well that it was to “ burn my

               political aspirations that warred with my own 
               <br />

               said—Before the House rose, I had expres- 
               <br />
               sed my beliel that the people of this country 
               <br />
               would be found equal to any emergency that 
               <br />
               might arise in working out the Constitution 
               <br />
               embraced in the resolutions, and would 
               <br />
               prove themselves capable of altering or 
               <br />
               amending it until it worked eﬁ'ectually and 
               <br />
               well for the beneﬁt of the whole country. 
               <br />
               And in making the choice which I know 
               <br />
               the people of this country will make—as 
               <br />
               between annexation to the United States and 
               <br />
               connection with Great Britain—as between 
               <br />
               republicanism' and monarchy—as between 
               <br />
               Canada our country, or Canada our state 
               <br />
               —-I believe they will be choosing that 
               <br />
               which will best advance the material pros— 
               <br />
               pects, and best ensure the future happiness 
               <br />
               and greatness of the country. If we were

               <br />
               a state of the union, that would in no way
