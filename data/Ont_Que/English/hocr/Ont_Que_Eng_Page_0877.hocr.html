               that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangement</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘is</span> a stroke of the

               salaries, rather than see them appointed by the 
               <br />
               local governments, who would be obliged to 
               <br />
               have recourse to direct taxation in order to 
               <br />
               '- pay their salaries. But setting aside this 
               <br />
               idea, I assert that the appointment of the

               <br />

               ference, an anomaly which cannot be too 
               <br />
               strongly opposed. (Hear, hear.) I am opposed 
               <br />
               to the scheme of Confederation, because the 
               <br />
               local governors would only be tools in the 
               <br />
               hands of the General Government, who would 
               <br />
               interfere in the local matters by the continual 
               <br />
               pressure they would bring to bear on them 
               <br />
               whenever they desired to change the opinions 
               <br />
               of the local parliaments, elected by the people 
               <br />
               in each province, on any question which they 
               <br />
               might have to discuss. Why have the local 
               <br />
               governments, with the insigniﬁcant powers 
               <br />
               which it is proposed to confer upon them— 
               <br />
               why, I say, have they not been allowed to 
               <br />
               elect their respective governors ? Would there 
               <br />

               They may try to make us believe that this

               <br />
               it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differs</span> in nowise from that exercised by the

               <br />
               that it would not be so. From the moment 
               <br />
               that you bring the exercise of the right of 
               <br />

               <br />
               parties, you increase the number of oppor-

               <br />
               open the door to intrigues. As, for instance, 
               <br />
               a party will oppose the passing of a law, and 
               <br />
               not succeeding in his opposition in Parlia-

               <br />
               favor that the law may be disallowed. Take 
               <br />
               an example. I suppose your Confederation to 
               <br />

               protection of settlers, such as we have seen 
               <br />
               pass the House six times in ten years without 
               <br />
               becoming law, on account of the opposition to 
               <br />
               it in the Legislative Council by the council- 
               <br />
               lors from Upper Canada; what would happen? 
               <br />
               The few interested parties who were apposed 
               <br />
               to the measure would rush to the Governor 
               <br />
               General to induce him to disallow the law. 
               <br />

               <br />
               respect due to acquired rights, and to other 
               <br />

               <br />
               the people on a measure which is just in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iwelf,</span> 
               <br />
               and which is sought for and approved of by

               is one instance out of a thousand, and will 
               <br />
               serve to illustrate the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of this right of 
               <br />
               veto. I am opposed to the scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, because I cannot see why, on the 
               <br />
               one h ~nd, it has been agreed to give all the 
               <br />
               public lands to the Government of each pre-

               ment should purchase the lands in the Island 
               <br />

               gives up the fertile lands of Upper and

               Lower Canada, but it purchases the barren
