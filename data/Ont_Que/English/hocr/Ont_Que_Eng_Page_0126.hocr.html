               —and while a still larger number thought

               defence of the province, still I did not meet one 
               <br />
               public man, of any stripe of politics, who did 
               <br />
               not readily and heartily declare that, in case 
               <br />
               of the invasion of Canada, the honor of Great 
               <br />
               Britain would be at stake, and the whole 
               <br />
               strength of the Empire would be unhesita- 
               <br />
               ﬁngly marshalled in our defence. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But, coupled with this, was the in- 
               <br />
               variable and most reasonable declaration that 
               <br />
               a share of the burden of defence, in ce and 
               <br />
               in war, we must contribute. And t is stipu- 
               <br />
               lation applies not only to Canada, but to every 
               <br />
               one of the colonies. Already the Indian Em- 
               <br />
               pire has been made to pay the whole expense 
               <br />
               of her military establishment. The Austra- 
               <br />
               lian Colonies have agreed to pay £40 sterling 
               <br />
               per man for every soldier sent there. This 
               <br />
               system is being gradually extended—and union 
               <br />
               or no union, assuredly every one of these 
               <br />
               British American Colonies will be called upon 
               <br />
               tobear her fair share towards the defence of 
               <br />
               the Empire. And who will deny that it is a 
               <br />
               just demand, and that great colonies such as 
               <br />
               these, should be proud to meet it in a frank 
               <br />
               and earnest spirit. ( Cheers.) Nothing, I 
               <br />
               am persuaded, could be more foreign to the 
               <br />
               ideas of the people of Canada, than that the 
               <br />
               people of England should be unfairly taxed 
               <br />
               for service rendered to this province. Now, 
               <br />
               the question presented to us is simpl this: 
               <br />
               will these contributions which Cana 8. and 
               <br />
               the other provinces must hereafter make to the 
               <br />
               defence of the Empire, be better rendered by 
               <br />
               a hardy, energetic, population, acting as 
               <br />
               one people, than as ﬁve or six separate 
               <br />
               communities? (Hear, hear.) There is no 
               <br />
               doubt about it. But not only do our 
               <br />
               Changed relations towards the Mother Country 
               <br />

               <br />
               defence—our changed relations towards the 
               <br />
               neighboring Republic compel us to do so. For 
               <br />
               myself, I have no belief that the Americans 
               <br />
               have the slightest thought of attacking us. I 
               <br />
               cannot believe that the ﬁrst use of their new- 
               <br />
               ‘found liberty will be the invasion, totally un- 
               <br />
               provoked, of a peaceful province. I fancy that 
               <br />
               they have had quite enough of war for a good 
               <br />
               many years to come—and that such a war as 
               <br />
               one with England would certainly be, is the 
               <br />
               last they are likely to provoke. But, Mr. 
               <br />
