               MB. A. MACKENZIE— Sir, having 
               <br />
               already voted for the whole of these resolu- 
               <br />
               tions as part of the scheme, I cannot have 
               <br />
               any hesitation in voting against the amend- 
               <br />
               ment, but in doing so I desire to explain my 
               <br />
               position. (Hear, hear.) If the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Cornwall (Hon. J. S. MACDONALD) 
               <br />
               had shown the same zeal against the separate 
               <br />
               schOol system when he had the power to 
               <br />
               prevent legislation on that subject, he would 
               <br />
               have saved himself and the party which 
               <br />
               kept him in power son e trouble. It seems 
               <br />
               curious that he who was so anxious to pro- 
               <br />
               mote the separate school system then should 
               <br />
               now be anxious in uite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">another‘</span> direc- 
               <br />
               tion. (Hear, hear.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%his</span> can only be done 
               <br />
               for the purpose of party strife, to put 
               <br />
               as many of us Upper Canadians as he can 
               <br />
               in a false position ; but I can only tell 
               <br />
               him that I, having struggled as much 
               <br />
               as any one to prevent legislation tend- 
               <br />
               ing to break up our common school system, 
               <br />
               and having found my eﬁ'orts utterly in- 
               <br />
               effectual, do not see that our position 
               <br />
               would be any worse if the resolutions 
               <br />
               are carried into law. (Hear) I formerly 
               <br />
               stated that I thought the separate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">school</span> 
               <br />
               system would not prove very disastrous if it 
               <br />
               went no further. I do not now think they 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               will do much harm, if they remain in the 
               <br />
               same position as at present, and therefore, 
               <br />
               though I am against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> school 
               <br />
               system, I am willing to accept this Con- 
               <br />
               federation, even though it perpetuates a 
               <br />
               small number of separate schools. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Under the presentlegislative union 
               <br />
               we are powerless in any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">movement</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the 
               <br />
               abrogation of the separate system ; it is even 
               <br />
               very doubtful if we could resist the demands 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> its extension. (Hear, hear.) We will 
               <br />
               not be in any worse position under the new 
               <br />
               system, and in one respect we will have a 
               <br />
               decided advantage, in that no further change 
               <br />
               can be made by the separate school advocates. 
               <br />
               We will thus substitute certainty for uncer- 
               <br />
               tainty. I deeply regret that the honorable 
               <br />
               member should have thought it necessary 
               <br />
               for any purpose to move this resolution.
