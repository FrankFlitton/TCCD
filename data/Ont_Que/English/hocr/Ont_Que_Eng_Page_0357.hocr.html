               that this measure is being hurried through 
               <br />

               the news of the assembling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the British 
               <br />
               Parliament, and I am glad to see a statement 
               <br />
               in Her Majesty’s Speech, that She has 
               <br />
               approved of the measure which is now under 
               <br />
               our consideration. Well, gentlemen, the 
               <br />
               Parliament of Great Britain will not sit for 
               <br />
               an unlimited time. Its session, this year, 
               <br />
               may be shorter than usual, for the natural 
               <br />
               dissolution of this and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assvmbling</span> of a 
               <br />
               new Parliament are drawing near, and con- 
               <br />
               tending parties generally make an eﬂ'ort, 
               <br />
               towards the close of a Parliament, to makea 
               <br />
               change in the Administration. Any one who 
               <br />
               reads the English papers and political docu— 
               <br />
               ments will see that a change of Ministry is 
               <br />
               conﬁdently expected by some people ; and if 
               <br />
               a defeat of the present Ministry takes place, 
               <br />
               and Parliament is dissolved, their own affairs 
               <br />
               will occupy the minds of British statesmen, 
               <br />
               so that when again called together, for a short

               turn north for further conquests, and try to 
               <br />
               humble a power which has not in every way

               HON. MB. PRICE—Honorable gentlemen, 
               <br />
               being one of the newly elected members of 
               <br />
               this House, I would like to say a few words, 
               <br />
               by way of deﬁning my position, before the 
               <br />
               vote is taken. Although I have said that I 
               <br />
               was in favor of Confederation as the only 
               <br />
               means by which we could make proper pro— 
               <br />
               vision for our defence, et, until I understood 
               <br />
               the details more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clearly</span> than what I could 
               <br />
               learn from the resolutions, I could not make 
               <br />
               up my mind to vote for it. Previous to the 
               <br />
               declaration at the election in my division, the 
               <br />
               press had circulated the views of the Confer- 
               <br />
               ence, and I went over the details so far as I 
               <br />
               was in possession of them, and the verdict of 
               <br />
               the people at the hustings was unanimously 
               <br />
               in favor of the scheme. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear?</span> I 
               <br />
               would like to enter into a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dmcussion</span> o the 
               <br />
               details, clause by clause, but it is impossible 
               <br />
               to do so at the present time. It is not sur- 
               <br />
               prising that almost every member of the 
               <br />
               House is opposed to one or more of the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions; it is impossible for us, even when we 
               <br />
               go into committee on almost any subject, to 
               <br />
               unanimously so on all the clauses. Before 
               <br />
               going further wish to thank my honorable 
               <br />
               friend the gallant ' t at the head of the 
               <br />
               Government, for his kind remarks with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to my father and myself, at the opening 
               <br />
               of this debate. For the last twenty years I 
               <br />
               have been known and resided in the consti- 
               <br />
               tuency which sent me here, and if I have been 
               <br />
               elected without much opposition, it was from 
               <br />
               friendship towards me on the part of my con- 
               <br />
               stituents. Although I represent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maple</span> hav- 
               <br />
               ing diﬁ'erent reli ious views, yet I believe 
               <br />
               only twenty-six rotestant votes were given 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l'or</span> me. I have had a great deal of personal 
               <br />
               friendship and intercourse with the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic clergy of Lower Canada, and must 
               <br />
               say I have always found them liberal and 
               <br />
               loyal in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views,</span> and, as a body, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">almost</span>
