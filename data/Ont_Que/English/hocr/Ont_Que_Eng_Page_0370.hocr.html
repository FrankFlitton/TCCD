               that drawn by Lord DURHAM in his day; 
               <br />
               things have changed ! In the Parliament of 
               <br />
               the United Canadas, the English are in a 
               <br />
               majority ; they have not to deal with a 
               <br />
               French majority. But, if circumstances 
               <br />
               have altered, men have not; place them in 
               <br />
               the same position in which they were pre- 
               <br />
               vicus to 1839, and again you will perceive 
               <br />
               in them the same sentiments as were depicted 
               <br />
               by Lord DURHAM. The seed lies hid in the

               Eastern Canada. 
               <br />
               At the mere idea of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature</span> in which 
               <br />
               the French element is to be in a majority in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, the passions described by 
               <br />
               Lord DURHAM are evinced. It is true that 
               <br />
               the Ministry are doing their best to reassure 
               <br />
               both parties, and to each party, separately, 
               <br />
               they make promises at the expense of the 
               <br />
               other. French-Canadians! do not allow 
               <br />
               yourælvee to be led away by those brilliant 
               <br />
               promises. An Italian poet describes the 
               <br />
               endeavors of a mother to induce her child to 
               <br />
               swallow a draught, which is intended to re- 
               <br />
               store him to health; to tempt him, she covers 
               <br />
               the edge of the cup with honey; in like man- 
               <br />
               ner, the edge of the cup which is presented 
               <br />

               <br />
               that cup contains poison and death. I do 
               <br />
               not believe that the/French-Canadians will 
               <br />
               share the power of their majority in Lower

               in the Council :—

               In political matters, a disinterested opinion

               a position which may prove to be a most

               Da. BEAUBIEN—I have conﬁdence in 
               <br />
               the conscience of the Federal Parliament. 
               <br />
               We ought not to attribute evil intentions to 
               <br />
               men, but rather suppose that they will treat 
               <br />
               us as they desire to bc treated themselves,

               interests so precious as those which are con-

               <br />
               the state of things which established harmony

               between the English and French races in

               Lower Canada, will destroy that harmon ,

               danger of intestine trouble there is much less 
               <br />
               great; true it is, that the enormous power of
