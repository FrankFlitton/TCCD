               discussion opened that were not before pro-

               perly understood. The question has not been

               suﬂiciently understood in the country, and 
               <br />

               branches of the Legislature. Constitutions are 
               <br />
               not usually made in a day, and they should 
               <br />
               not be passed in a week; they are matters of 
               <br />
               too grave a character. I trust, if we make a 
               <br />
               new Constitution, it will be one that will be 
               <br />
               sustained not for ten or twenty years, but for 
               <br />
               centuries. It is to be hoped that every change 
               <br />
               which is made will be of the right character, 
               <br />
               and in accordance with the interests of the

               desirous of pushing through this measure with 
               <br />
               undue haste. There are many reasons why 
               <br />
               the discussion of this question should be de- 
               <br />

               the question now befOre us is a very important

               one, and should be full considered in all its

               <br />
               understand, is in session, and by telegraphic

               communication, from day to day, we could 
               <br />
               ascertain the feeling of the people there. This 
               <br />
               would not at all retard the action of this 
               <br />
               House, for it is known that business is usually 
               <br />
               despatohed with more rapidity here than in the 
               <br />
               other. Nothing, it seems to me, will be lost, 
               <br />

               <br />
               porary postponement of the debate. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I desire to place my views on the 
               <br />
               whole subject before this House, but I desire 
               <br />
               to give them only after the matter has been 
               <br />
               calmly and deliberately discussed. The ques- 
               <br />
               tion 18 one which concerns us all. I do not 
               <br />
               think the discussion of it should be entered 
               <br />
               upon with any party spirit or any party feel- 
               <br />
               ing. Our interests are all the same, whether 
               <br />
               for weal or woe. If the measure be a 
               <br />
               one—if the project for our Confederation be 
               <br />
               a salutary one—if it be a panacea for all the 
               <br />
               existing evils of our body politic—a little 
               <br />
               time given for reﬂection can do it no harm. 
               <br />
               (Hear.) When we come to the discussion of 
               <br />
               the scheme, there are several important points 
               <br />
               to be cleared up. We have yet to ascertain 
               <br />
               the respective and relative powers of the 
               <br />
               federal and local governments, and it is desir- 
               <br />
               able that ample time should be given to the 
               <br />
               Government for the answering of questions 
               <br />
               upon this subject. Then we have to receive 
               <br />
               explanations about'the export duty on coal 
               <br />
               and other minerals—whether this export duty 
               <br />
               is to be levied by or on behalf of the Local 
               <br />
               Government of Nova Scotia after Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, and whether it is to be levied on all 
               <br />
               coal exported, or not upon coal exported to 
               <br />
               other sections of the proposed union. Again, 
               <br />
               in regard to the export duty on the lumber of 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, is it to be applied, as I 
               <br />
               understand it, to the local revenue of that 
               <br />
               province ? Then, as to the stumpage duty 
               <br />
               on that portion of the Crown domain ap r- 
               <br />
               taining to Lower Canada,isthat to be ap ied 
               <br />
               to the purposes of the Local Government of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada ?
