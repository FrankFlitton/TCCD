               Another of the delegates to the Quebec Con-

               ference, Hon. Mr. WHELAN, of Prince Edward

               ation, I do think the Government ought to have 
               <br />
               given more time to deliberate upon and perfect 
               <br />
               this measure; and, at any rate, to leave it 
               <br />
               over till another session of Parliament before 
               <br />
               demanding a ﬁnal decision upon the question.

               Failing to do that, and failing to consent

               <br />
               it is our duty to refer it to the ple 
               <br />

               <br />

               that they had entered into a bad bargain, 
               <br />
               they would have no one to blame but them- 
               <br />
               selves, and I have no doubt would, under 
               <br />
               such circumstances, bear it more patiently. 
               <br />
               But if we take the opposite course, if we

               close this arrangement on terms disadvan-

               <br />
               other provinces, inasmuch as it will open up 
               <br />

               <br />

               (Hear, hear.) The complaint that has been 
               <br />
               made against the working of the present union 
               <br />
               is that in Lower Canada the people do not 
               <br />
               pay as much in taxes to the general rev- 
               <br />
               enue, man for man, as the people of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. It was contended, I believe, by 
               <br />
               the present Attorney General East, at a 
               <br />
               speech delivered some years since to his eon- 
               <br />
               stituents at Verehercs, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emenditure</span> 
               <br />
               for the redemption of eeigniorial rights did not 
               <br />
               aﬂ'ect Lower Canada ve much, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span> 
               <br />
               Upper Canada paid two-thirds of the revenue 
               <br />
               of the country; and all the advocates of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">western</span> section, who have urged its rights 
               <br />
               before the people, have taken the ground that 
               <br />
               it contributed in that proportion to the publie 
               <br />
               exchequer. Now, if there be any truth in 
               <br />
               this statement, it must follow that under this 
               <br />
               arrangement Canada, at all events, will have 
               <br />
               to pay more, man for man, than the eastern 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> to the general revenue, because it 
               <br />
               cannot be contended, I apprehend, that Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island, Newfoundland, or either of 
               <br />
               the other Maritime Provinces, however pros- 
               <br />
               p:rous their condition may be, have a popula—

               one that will contribute as much in taxœ to 
               <br />
               the General Government. If then, during the 
               <br />
               past, Lower Canada has paid less than Upper 
               <br />
               Canada to the revenue, while enjoying the
