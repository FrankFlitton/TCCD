            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               HON. J. S. MACDONALD—I rise, sir, 
               <br />
               to propose another amendment. (Signs of 
               <br />
               impatience.) I assure the House that I never 
               <br />
               knew a measure of anything like this import- 
               <br />
               ance go through with so few attempts to 
               <br />
               amend it. Nor do I rise for the mere purpose 
               <br />
               of putting my amendment on record, for I 
               <br />
               do feel that the views I am about toexpress, 
               <br />
               and which I have ever held since I have been 
               <br />
               a member of this House, may not commend 
               <br />
               themselves to any considerable number of 
               <br />
               hon. members. I have no desire that the 
               <br />
               rights of the Roman Catholic minority of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada shall be abridged, nor that the 
               <br />
               rights and privileges of any other denomi- 
               <br />
               nation shall be interfered with in any respect. 
               <br />
               But I wish hon. members to bear in mind 
               <br />
               that the experience we have had in this 
               <br />
               country—not to allude to that of the neigh- 
               <br />
               boring States. proves that a denial of the 
               <br />
               right of the majority to legislate on any 
               <br />
               given matter has always led to grave con- 
               <br />
               sequences. I need only mention the Clergy 
               <br />
               Reserve question. This, it must be recol- 
               <br />
               lected, was forbidden to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislated</span> upon 
               <br />
               by the Union Act; yet it was the cause of 
               <br />
               ﬁerce strife and legislation for many years.

               <br />
               States prohibited the question of slavery 
               <br />
               from being interfered with by Congress; yet 
               <br />
               an agitation for its suppression was early 
               <br />
               commenced, and has at last terminated 
               <br />

               the Clergy Reserve question produced a 
               <br />
               rebellion in Upper Canada. I say, sir, that 
               <br />
               by making a constitutional restriction in re- 
               <br />
               spect to the schools of the minority, we are 
               <br />
               sowing the seeds from which will in the end 
               <br />
               arise a serious conﬂict, unless the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion be amended. The minority will be quite 
               <br />
               safe on a question relating to their faith and 
               <br />
               their education in a colony under the sway 
               <br />
               of the British Crown ; but if you expressly 
               <br />
               withdraw that question from the control of 
               <br />
               the majority, the rights of the minority will 
               <br />
               not be safe in either section of the province, 
               <br />
               if you distrust the action of the majority. 
               <br />
               It is our duty, sir, to see that a question 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘ccts</span> us so dearly as the education 
               <br />
               of our children —a question which has before 
               <br />
               now created no little excitement in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada—shall not be withdrawn from the 
               <br />
               management of the Local Legislature. We 
               <br />
               ought not to deprive them of a power which 
               <br />
               they will want to exercise, just because they 
               <br />
               are deprived of it, and provoke a desire on 
               <br />
               their part to alter the system. You may rely 
               <br />
               upon it other religious bodies will be sure 
               <br />
               to protest against any particular creed having 
               <br />
               special rights, or an exclusive monopoly of 
               <br />
               certain privileges, whatever they may be. I 
               <br />
               should be astonished if any one in this House 
               <br />
               would say, either to the Protestant minority in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada or to the Roman Catholic min- 
               <br />
               ority in Upper Canada—“You are notto trust 
               <br />
               to the justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the majority.” Have they 
               <br />
               ever known a country where the majority 
               <br />
               did not control affairs, and where the minority 
               <br />
               had not to_submit ? Does not the majority 
               <br />
               rule and the minority submit in En land 
               <br />
               and. in France ? I have never heard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0%</span> any 
               <br />
               state where this was not the case. The 
               <br />
               minority is safe against undue encroachment 
               <br />
               on its rights, and I am willing to trust to the 
               <br />
               sense of justice of the majority in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada to preserve the religious and edu-

               cational liberties of the Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada. I am now getting some-

               of saying, though perhaps not on the ﬂoor of
