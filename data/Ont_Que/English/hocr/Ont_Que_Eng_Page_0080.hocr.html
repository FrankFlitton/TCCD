               how a feeling against the Federation roject 
               <br />
               was raised in the minds of a few of the ritish

               <br />
               very inconvenient nature, Mr. PAPINEAU not

               <br />
               ing the im rtance of these measures. He

               considered r. PAPINEAU was right in the

               proved of the course he took with reference to 
               <br />

               <br />
               sures for the improvement of the country. 
               <br />
               Bnt this precedent could not be urged as an 
               <br />
               objection to Federation, inasmuch as it 
               <br />
               would be for the General Government to deal 
               <br />
               with our commercial matters. There could 
               <br />
               be no reason for well unded fear that the 
               <br />
               minority could be m e to suﬂ'er by means of 
               <br />
               any laws aﬁ'ecting the rights of property. If 
               <br />
               any such enactments were passed, they would 
               <br />
               fall upon the whole community. But even 
               <br />
               supposing such a thing did occur, there was a 
               <br />

               tion. he magnitude of the so eme now sub- 
               <br />
               mitted was, perhaps, the reason why those who 
               <br />
               had not made themselves conversant with the 
               <br />
               question felt some apprehension in contem- 
               <br />
               plating it ; but, when we came to discuss it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">danse</span> by clause, he would be ready to state 
               <br />
               that no interest would be harmed in any way

               <br />
               (Laughter.) Mr. DOUGALL loudly pro- 
               <br />
               claimed that the British Protestant minority

               would be entirely placed at the mere of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of the enemies of the scheme, said that if it 
               <br />
               were adopted the French Canadians were 
               <br />
               doomed; while his brother in violence, the 
               <br />
               Witness, said that the Protestants were doomed. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear, and laughter.) At a meeting re- 
               <br />
               cently held in Montreal on the subject, he (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. CARTIER.) observed that Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CHI-188.118</span> 
               <br />
               had enrolled himself among the enemies of the 
               <br />
               project. Well, this ﬁne, quiet, old gentleman 
               <br />
               announced that he had come out of his politi- 
               <br />
               cal retirement for the purpose of opposin Fe- 
               <br />
               deration. All he (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coulä</span> say 
               <br />
               was that he never knew Mr. CHERBIBB was a 
               <br />
               strong politician. However, it appeared that 
               <br />
               he had come out once more on the political 
               <br />

               CARTIER! (Laughter and cheers.) Allusion 
               <br />
               had been made to the opinion of the clergy. 
               <br />
               Well, he would say that the opinion of the 
               <br />
               clergy was for Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Those who were high in authority, as well as 
               <br />
               those who occupied more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">humble</span> positions, 
               <br />
               were in favor of Federation, not only because 
               <br />
               they saw in it so much security for all the 
               <br />
               held dear, but because it was just to their 
               <br />
               Protestant fellow-subjects as well, because they 
               <br />
               were opposed to political bickering and strife. 
               <br />
               This opposition to a state of political dissen-
