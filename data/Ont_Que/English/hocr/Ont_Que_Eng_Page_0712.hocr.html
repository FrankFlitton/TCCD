               HON. Mn. CAUCHON --.‘lr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               I received intelligence this evening that the 
               <br />
               Hon. member for Hochelaga was about to 
               <br />
               reply to my speech of the 2nd of March, and 
               <br />
               that is why I came here. Otherwise, as I have 
               <br />
               not yet quite recovered, I should have re- 
               <br />
               mained at home; but I frankly acknowledge 
               <br />
               that if I had foreseen that 1 should have 
               <br />
               had to listen to such a speech as that which 
               <br />
               we have just heard, I should not have put 
               <br />
               myself out of the way for so little. Any one 
               <br />
               hearing him speak must have said: “ Either 
               <br />
               he is not a very powerful reasoner, or this 
               <br />
               hon. member has but a poor idea of the 
               <br />
               intelligence of this House and but little 
               <br />
               respect for his colleagues.” But for my two 
               <br />
               pamphlets and for the speech of the Hon. 
               <br />
               Solicitor General, which he read and com 
               <br />
               mented upon as he knows how to do, he 
               <br />
               would very speedily have found himself 
               <br />
               aground; but by deriving assistance in the 
               <br />
               way I have mentioned, he contrived to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the means of speaking for three hours. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Is it necessary for me to 
               <br />
               repeat that I have never denied the opinions 
               <br />
               which I held in former days? Nor will I 
               <br />
               deny them to-night. I acknowledge freely 
               <br />
               that my opinions on certain matters have 
               <br />
               changed. Of what advantage, then, can it he 
               <br />
               to him to spend his time in repeating what 
               <br />
               I admit myself? If I proved to him that 
               <br />
               he had changed several times himself, I did 
               <br />
               not do so to lay blame upon him, but to 
               <br />
               reproach him with denying his past career, 
               <br />
               in order that he might be more at his case 
               <br />
               in that which he is at present following. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But, for that matter, what 
               <br />
               does it signify to the country that he or 1 
               <br />
               held one opinion yesterday and that we hold 
               <br />
               another to—day? W hat the country requires 
               <br />
               to know is whether the scheme of Confeder— 
               <br />
               ation which is submitted to nsby the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment is good or bad. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               man who declares that he has never changed 
               <br />
               his opinion on any subject whatever is, to 
               <br />
               my thinking, a simpleton. The public re- 
               <br />
               quirements change with circumstances, and 
               <br />
               necessarily bring with them other ideas. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We do not eat when we are
