               HON. MR. CAMPBELL—I had not the 
               <br />
               honor of having a seat in this House at the 
               <br />
               time, but I am happy to hear that it was 
               <br />
               unanimously carried. Next, a change was 
               <br />
               asked for in the composition of this House. 
               <br />
               This House was at one time nominative, and 
               <br />
               was, in 1856, made elective. Was that not a 
               <br />
               change of the Constitution ? Nobody, how- 
               <br />
               ever, urged at that time the idea that this 
               <br />
               House had no power to pass such a resolution. 
               <br />
               We stand exactly in the same position now, 
               <br />
               and it seems to me a most futile and illogical 
               <br />
               argumentto say that we have not the power 
               <br />
               to do what it is proposed to do in passing 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> resolutions, that is, to pray the Queen 
               <br />
               so to change the Constitution of this province 
               <br />
               that we may unite in one Government with 
               <br />
               the other provinces of British North America. 
               <br />
               I am quite satisﬁed that, when honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen reﬂect upon it, they will see that they 
               <br />
               are not in any way exceeding -the powers 
               <br />
               committed to them by their constituencies. 
               <br />
               My honorable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> from Niagara suggests 
               <br />
               this amendment in a spirit that is compara- 
               <br />
               tively poor to that in which it is supported 
               <br />
               by m honorable friend opposite. He says 
               <br />
               he is m favor of the union, but is opposed to 
               <br />
               some of the details. It is painful to me that 
               <br />
               any honorable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gt</span> ntleman, who professesa desire 
               <br />
               to advance the union, should yet shelter him- 
               <br />
               self, in Opposing it, under an objection to some 
               <br />
               of the details. Does my honorable friend se- 
               <br />
               riously propose to submit to the country all 
               <br />
               those various details ? Can he imagine that 
               <br />
               he could get an intelligent expression from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> part of the country on those details? 
               <br />
               A] he could t would be a general opinion 
               <br />

               <br />
               tisﬁed that he would have that. I believe 
               <br />
               there are but two or three honorable mem- 
               <br />
               bers in this House who are really op sed to

               tions on which Confederation rests, not perhaps

               before this House. I say, honorable gentlemen, 
               <br />
               if the people could express their opinions as 
               <br />
               we may express ours to-night, they would all 
               <br />
               concur in the ﬁrst resolution. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Well, ntlemen, it being granted that we are 
               <br />
               all in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁver</span> of union, how are the details tobe

               settled? Is it possible that the nearly four

               millions of people who compose the provinces 
               <br />
               to be affected by the union, should meet 
               <br />
               together en mam and settle those details? It 
               <br />
               is not possible, and those who argue that the 
               <br />
               scheme should originate with the le, 
               <br />
               know very well that it is not possible. ell, 
               <br />
               then, could the parliaments of all these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces assemble together and agree <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> a 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation? Look at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dim-</span>

               culties that we have to encounter on every

               <br />
               through this House, and judge for yourselves

               whether the parliaments of all the provinces

               could meet ther, and originate and decide 
               <br />
               upon the details of Confederation. There is
