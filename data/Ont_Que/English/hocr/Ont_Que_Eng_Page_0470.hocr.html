               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It has been said that the

               that it has never been made a question up

               hon. gentlemen who occupy the Treasury

               of the beneﬁts to result from this measure, 
               <br />

               <br />
               people for the fullest consideration. In 
               <br />
               1841 the people of this country obtained 
               <br />
               responsible government, and it was declared 
               <br />
               to them then that they should have a con- 
               <br />
               trolling voice in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> of the country— 
               <br />
               that no important change, in fact, should 
               <br />
               take place without their having an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of pronouncing upon it. And yet 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen now disclaim the right of 
               <br />
               appeal to the people, and arrogate to them- 
               <br />
               selves an amount of wisdom to suppose that 
               <br />
               the tens of thousands of people of this pro- 
               <br />
               vince have not the capacity to understand 
               <br />
               the meaning or the magnitude of this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. They exclude from these men the 
               <br />
               right of pronouncing an opinion; and is it 
               <br />
               not singular that it is the people of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Canada who are treated in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Way</span> ? 
               <br />
               It is not so in the Lower Provinces. New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, for instance, dissolves its House, 
               <br />
               and gocsto the people. And why should New 
               <br />
               Brunswick do that which is denied toCanada? 
               <br />
               Why should the people of New Brunswick 
               <br />
               be treated as more able and more ca able 
               <br />
               of understanding and pronouncing an intel- 
               <br />
               ligent opinion than the people of Canada? 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The people of Canada, I 
               <br />
               appreheud, are just as capable of compre- 
               <br />
               hending a measure of this importance as the 
               <br />
               people of New Brunswick, and they ought 
               <br />
               to have the same opportunity of pronouncing 
               <br />
               upon it. (Hear, hear.) The Honorable 
               <br />
               President of the Council has said that a hos- 
               <br />
               tile feeling had arisen between both sections 
               <br />
               of the province to such a degree, that the 
               <br />
               government and legislation of the country 
               <br />
               had almost come to a dead stand. N ow, was 
               <br />
               there such a feeling of hostility existing 
               <br />
               between the peeple of the different pro- 
               <br />
               vinces? Was such the fact? Did honor- 
               <br />
               able gentlemen of French extraction meet 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen of British extraction 
               <br />
               upon the ﬂoor of this House with any feeling 
               <br />
               of hostility whatever? Did we not meet as
