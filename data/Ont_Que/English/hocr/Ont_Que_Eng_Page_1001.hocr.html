               on the subject leads me to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that it was a legislative union they proposed ; 
               <br />
               and when the delegates to the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference spoke to their constituents, they put 
               <br />
               forward the idea that a legislative union 
               <br />
               would have been better than the one pro- 
               <br />
               posed At any rate this scheme has been 
               <br />
               rejected in one of the provinces, and if car- 
               <br />
               ried into operation, it will have to be forced 
               <br />
               upon the people of one or other of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Well, if you are going tq force a 
               <br />
               Constitution upon any part of the people, it

               <br />
               service to the country than the scheme 
               <br />
               under consideration. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               people of Lower Canada presented the 
               <br />
               appearance of being against representation 
               <br />
               by population ; they thought that it would 
               <br />
               be the annihilation of their peculiar institu- 
               <br />
               tions—that by its adeption their laws would 
               <br />
               be interfered with, their language extin- 
               <br />
               guished, and their religion destroyed; and 
               <br />
               yet how readily did they concede the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple in this Confederation scheme. They 
               <br />
               granted representation by population in the 
               <br />
               Lower House of the Federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature.</span> 
               <br />
               (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> And why had they done so? 
               <br />
               Because, they say, under the Local Govern- 
               <br />
               ment our local affairs and interests will be 
               <br />
               safe in our own keeping—our laws will be 
               <br />
               safe, our language will be safe, our reli- 
               <br />
               gion will be safe. Now, if they were 
               <br />
               assured that all these interests would be 
               <br />
               equally as safe and well protected under any 
               <br />
               form of government that might be chosen 
               <br />
               for the good of the whole country, can any 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman assume <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> say that they 
               <br />
               would be opposed to that form of govern- 
               <br />
               ment? (Hear, hear.) It is well to under- 
               <br />
               stand that hon. gentlemen representing 
               <br />
               Lower Canada constituencies and the peeple 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada have been educated to fear 
               <br />
               aggression on the part of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               especially if representation by population 
               <br />
               were granted; and they have been so 
               <br />
               educated in consequence of the manner in 
               <br />
               which the Hon. President of the Council, 
               <br />
               his organ, and the organs of his party, have 
               <br />
               agitated that question in times past; but 
               <br />
               when the people of Lower Canada under- 
               <br />
               stand that there is an opportunity of con- 
               <br />
               ceding that which they have hitherto refused, 
               <br />
               and at the same time of securing the enjoy- 
               <br />
               ment of those rights and privileges which 
               <br />
               they all hold dear, I cannot believe that 
               <br />
               they will longer oppose that which all of 
               <br />
               them cannot fail to see must come sooner or 
               <br />
               later. (Hear, hear.) They must see that it 
               <br />
               is better for them to make terms now when 
               <br />
               they may; for I apprehend that they would 
               <br />
               not carry their resistance to a just principle 
               <br />
               to the length of a revolution ; for it is quite 
               <br />
               clear that they could not be successful in 
               <br />
               any such movement, or set themselves up as 
               <br />
               an independent power in this country, while 
               <br />
               Upper Canada and the other provinces re- 
               <br />
               main a part of the British possessions ; nor 
               <br />
               could they become a part of the United
