               lative union, which is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">description</span> of 
               <br />
               union into which I trust to see the present 
               <br />
               imperfect Constitution, or proposed Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion, eventually merge. For the reasons 
               <br />
               stated I have looked upon this Federal 
               <br />
               scheme of union with dislike and distrust. 
               <br />
               But the promoters of the scheme, most of 
               <br />
               whom, it must be admitted, have appeared 
               <br />
               here rather as its apologists than as its 
               <br />
               upholders, tell us that it is a necessity of 
               <br />
               circumstances, an unavoidable consequence 
               <br />
               of difference in language, laws and local 
               <br />
               interests between Upper and Lower Canada 
               <br />
               on the one part, and an absence of commu- 
               <br />
               nity of local interests between us here in 
               <br />
               Canada and the Maritime Provinces on the 
               <br />
               other hand. The latter part of the argument 
               <br />
               is undoubtedly correct; but, admitting the 
               <br />
               whole of the premises, for argument sake, 
               <br />
               the other question naturally suggests itself : 
               <br />
               Is Confederation, even in the faulty form in 
               <br />
               which it is laid before us, to be accepted as 
               <br />
               a likely remedy for the evils under which 
               <br />
               we now labor in Canada, and as a possible 
               <br />
               antidote against the greater evils which 
               <br />
               threaten us in the near future? I would 
               <br />
               answer that question in my own way, and 
               <br />
               from my own point of view by and by; 
               <br />
               meanwhile I would ask _to be permitted to 
               <br />
               say a word in respect of the ﬁnancial phase 
               <br />
               of the Confederation project; and upon that 
               <br />
               point I feel it diﬁicult to agree with my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the Hon. Finance Minister, in assum- 
               <br />
               ing that the joint expenses of the two local 
               <br />
               governments here in Canada may be kept 
               <br />
               so much below what we are now paying for 
               <br />
               our single form of government, as to leave a 
               <br />
               wide margin towards dcfraying, if not ally 
               <br />
               to cover, our proportion of the expenses of 
               <br />
               the General Government. I can hardly 
               <br />
               venture to take such a coulear-de-r‘ose view 
               <br />
               of our position as that. I will not weary the 
               <br />
               House with estimates and ﬁgures, which, 
               <br />
               aﬁer - all, can be but problematical and 
               <br />
               conjectural ; but. I would venture to predict 
               <br />
               that under our new condition of existence, 
               <br />
               with its quasi national obligations, our 
               <br />
               expenditure must increase largely beyond 
               <br />
               the present limits that we have hitherto 
               <br />
               been accustomed to. I believe that to be 
               <br />
               an inevitable result of the Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion; but Ialso believe that there is a future 
               <br />
               looming upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us—Confederationbr</span> no Con- 
               <br />
               federation—which will involve us in duties 
               <br />
               and responsibilities which we must not 
               <br />
               shirk—whieh, in fact, we cannot shirk if we 
               <br />
               would. The signs of the times are not to be

               <br />
               But if, in bringing about a union of all these 
               <br />
               provinces, we were in reality laying the sure

               foundation of social, commercial, and politi- 
               <br />
               cal prosperity—if we felt that in reality we 
               <br />
               were laying the ground-work, as it were, of 
               <br />
               a new nation on this continent-—we might

               justly, along with the great beneﬁts we be- 
               <br />

               our generation, cannot hope to enjoy in their 
               <br />
               fulness—bequeath to them also the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               burden which would seem to be the ordained 
               <br />
               and inevitable accompaniment of progressive 
               <br />
               nationality. And if I felt assured in my 
               <br />
               own mind that this measure of Confederation, 
               <br />
               faulty as it is, promised even a fair chance for 
               <br />
               successfully solving agreat political diﬂiculty, 
               <br />
               I for one would not fear to take my share 
               <br />
               of the responsibility of increasing the ex- 
               <br />
               penses of government and adding to the 
               <br />
               debt of the country. I have alluded to the 
               <br />
               expenses attendant on Confederation as 
               <br />
               being, to a certain extent, conjectural and 
               <br />
               problematical; but there is -one item of its 
               <br />
               cost which is not of that character. The 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway is a vital part of the 
               <br />
               Confederation proj ect—-the latter could have 
               <br />
               no useful, practical existence without the 
               <br />
               former. As a commercial undertaking, the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway presents no attrac- 
               <br />
               tions, it offers no material for a ﬂattering 
               <br />
               prospectus ; we could not invite to it the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of European capitalists as presenting an 
               <br />
               eligible investment for their surplus funds. 
               <br />
               But for the establishing of those intimate 
               <br />
               social and commercial relations indispensable 
               <br />
               to political unity between ourselves and the 
               <br />
               sister rovinces, the railway is anecessity. It 
               <br />
               will, t erefore, have to be undertaken and 
               <br />
               paid for purely as a national work, and it is 
               <br />
               right that the eople of Canada should know 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand</span> in the outset what the pro—

               bable addition to our public debt would be 
               <br />
               in connection with the 68th resolution. I 
               <br />
               do not think the proportion of the cost of the 
               <br />
