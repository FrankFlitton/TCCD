               would grant that there would be much force 
               <br />
               in the argument that it might sever our ties 
               <br />
               with England, if we were circumstanced as 
               <br />
               some of the smaller states of Europe—if we

               of all these provinces were to take place, it

               might lead to practical independence. of

               result which we so much deprecate might 
               <br />
               possibly follow. We should, probably, in 
               <br />
               time aspire to have foreign relations of our

               must always be relative, and none of us can

               <br />

               of the republic which adjoins us, and to 
               <br />
               which, I think, it is neither the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest</span> nor

               the inclination of any member of this House

               ever fate may be in store for us, that is a 
               <br />
               destiny to which no one looks with favor. 
               <br />
               The genius and instincts of our people are 
               <br />
               monarehical and conservative—theirs level-

               have said that I was disposed to look upon 
               <br />
               this question—the danger of Federation 
               <br />
               rendering us independent of England, quite 
               <br />
               apart from the considerations that spring out 
               <br />
               of sentiments of loyalty, yet I believe that 
               <br />
               those attachments will be increased tenfold 
               <br />
               by this proposed union. We will have a 
               <br />
               sentiment of nationality among ourselves; 
               <br />
               and I consider it to be one of the ﬁrst duties 
               <br />
               of a statesman to inculcate that national 
               <br />
               feeling that gives the people a strong interest 
               <br />
               in their country’s welfare. We will feel that 
               <br />
               we have something here, in the way of 
               <br />
               constitutional blessings due to our union 
               <br />
               with England, and that we have stable 
               <br />
               material interests which we can transmit to 
               <br />
               our posterity. We shall feel very differently
