               a great extent, prevail ? I am not going into 
               <br />
               these questions minutely, but I must be al- 
               <br />
               lowed to make a remark or two as to the 
               <br />
               Opinion expressed by Her Majesty’s Govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ready, to some extent, alluded to the dispatch 
               <br />
               of the Colonial Secretary; but in this con— 
               <br />
               nection, I must allude to it a little further. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It is clear from that dis- 
               <br />
               patch that the Colonial Secretary wrote under 
               <br />
               these impressions: ﬁrst of all, he was under 
               <br />
               the idea that this scheme had been drawn up 
               <br />
               by the representatives of every province, 
               <br />
               chosen by the respective governors, without 
               <br />
               distinction of party. That was not quite the 
               <br />
               case. There were representatives from the 
               <br />
               two leading parties in each of the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, but it was not so as regarded Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. (Hear, hear. The Colonial Se- 
               <br />

               <br />
               gether, they gave the matters before them the 
               <br />
               most mature deliberation. He says :-—“ They 
               <br />
               have conducted their deliberations with patient 
               <br />

               ties.” The “ patient sagacity ” was exercised 
               <br />
               for seventeen or nineteen days, ‘and the “ un-

               fact; with all this, Her Majesty’s Government 
               <br />
               have only come to the point of giving a very 
               <br />
               general, and, as any one who reads the dis- 
               <br />
               patch can see, a very qualiﬁed approval of the 
               <br />
               scheme. First, an objection is raised as to 
               <br />
               the want of accurate determination of the 
               <br />
               limits between the authority of the Central 
               <br />
               and that of the local legislatures. I will not 
               <br />
               read the words, as I read them last night, but 
               <br />
               no one can read the dispatch without seeing 
               <br />
               that the language of the Colonial Secretary on 
               <br />
               that point is the language of diplomatie disap— 
               <br />
               proval. (Hear, hear.) Though he gives a gen- 
               <br />
               eral approval, he criticises and evidently does 
               <br />
               not approve. He sees an intention, but calls 
               <br />
               attention to the fact that that intention is not 
               <br />
               clearly and explicitly expressed. He then 
               <br />
               goes on and makes another objection—the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial. His language is this :—
