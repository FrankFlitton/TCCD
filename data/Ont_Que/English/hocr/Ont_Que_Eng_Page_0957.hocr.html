               the House that either he himself or some

               000—it was variously stated—but £200,000. 
               <br />
               Well, sir, we have the extended report at 
               <br />
               length, and it appears that £50,000 is the 
               <br />
               sum to be placed in the estimates this year. 
               <br />
               They look to the expenditure of £200,000 in 
               <br />
               the course of four years, beginning this year 
               <br />
               with an appropriation of £50,000. It appears 
               <br />
               from this that they do not consider the case 
               <br />
               as so very urgent—not, at all events, so urgent 
               <br />
               as to require the business of the Parliament 
               <br />
               of this country to be suspended, in order that 
               <br />
               Ministers may hasten thither to make provi- 
               <br />
               sion for the defence of the country. (Hear 
               <br />
               hear.) So much would follow from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facé</span> 
               <br />
               of their spreading the £200,000 over four 
               <br />
               years. But that is not all. Very startling 
               <br />
               statements on the subject of the defence of 
               <br />
               Canada were made in this debate in the House 
               <br />
               of Lords. We know how persistently our 
               <br />
               own Government have refused us the necessary 
               <br />

               ing, in the absence of that information, un- 
               <br />

               their clumsy contrivances, is adopted by 
               <br />

               tence may be len hened out for a few months 
               <br />
               longer. Hear, ear. The whole amount

               which ° be uir for permanent fortiﬁ— 
               <br />
               cations, as sta in a leading article in the 
               <br />
               the Times, is £1,300,000 sterling—about 
               <br />
               $7,000,000, of which the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment propose to expend £200,000, or about 
               <br />
               $1,000,000. We therefore learn that our 
               <br />
               Government have really bargained for the 
               <br />
               expenditure by Canada of $5,000,000 to 
               <br />
               $6,000,000 towards the permanent defen- 
               <br />
               ces of the country, in respect of which we 
               <br />
               have had no information whatever. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) There can be no doubt that they 
               <br />
               have made this bargain, because I have 
               <br />
               quoted the words of Earl DI Gm stating in 
               <br />
               precise terms that the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governmmt</span> 
               <br />
               had agreed to it, subject to the approval of 
               <br />
               our Parliament. I say that this is a startling
