               Now the point of this (Mr. CARDWELL'B)

               <br />
               this House, there are certain of the clauses 
               <br />
               in these resolutions which, I think, might 
               <br />
               have been improved. I, for instance, might 
               <br />
               have preferred the Confederate seat of gov- 
               <br />
               ernment being established elsewhere than at 
               <br />
               Ottawa; and, with reference to this subject, 
               <br />
               I have been much struck with a remark, 
               <br />
               which I will cite, from a recent writer, who 
               <br />
               says that—“Any country compelled to fore- 
               <br />
               go the use of its natural chief city, and make 
               <br />
               some inferior and ill—placed town the seat of 
               <br />
               its government, labors under incalculable 
               <br />
               disadvantages.” Everybody, however, has 
               <br />
               his own little bantling, and thinks it 
               <br />
               the handsomest in the world ; and I 
               <br />
               doubt very much if, after all, we should 
               <br />
               have made the plan of Confederation much 
               <br />
               better, had every one of as been consult- 
               <br />
               ed and taken into the Con terence, at Charlotte- 
               <br />
               town or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec,</span> to urge our own special views. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I rather infer, from the dif- 
               <br />
               ferences of opinion I have heard around me 
               <br />
               in these debates, that the compromise system 
               <br />
               would not have been so easily adopted by us 
               <br />
               as by the gentlemen who composed these 
               <br />
               conferences. I hope, however, that we shall 
               <br />
               adopt that system now, and get through the 
               <br />
               debate in the faith that they have done what 
               <br />
               is best for the interests at the country, and 
               <br />
               that the measure is so important, as a whole, 
               <br />
               as to render it unwise to place minorimpedi- 
               <br />
               ments in its way to interrupt its course. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I have marked several sec— 
               <br />
               tions of the resolutions which I think are 
               <br />
               open to objection or susceptible of improve- 
               <br />
               ment, and I hope the honorable and gallant 
               <br />
               Knight at the head of the Government will 
               <br />
               give some explanations respecting the views 
               <br />
               which animated the Conference in reference 
               <br />
               to them. One of them is a matter in which 
               <br />
               Lower Canada is somewhat peculiarly inter- 
               <br />
               ested—the system of marriage and divorce, 
               <br />
               which, I see, is to be left in the hands of the 
               <br />
               Federal Government. I hope nothing will 
               <br />
               be done by the General Government, in rela- 
               <br />

               tion to this action, which will outrage the 
               <br />
               feelings of ower Canada, or lead to the 
               <br />
               laxity, in dealing with the marriage tie, 
               <br />
               which prevails south of the line 45°. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Again, emigration is a subject which 
               <br />
               is left to the Local as well as the General 
               <br />
               Government to deal with. I think it should 
               <br />
               be under the care of the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment entirely. Then, as to the question of 
               <br />
               education, I be e the Government will secure 
               <br />
               to Roman Ca olics in Upper Canada the 
               <br />
               same rights which will be extended to Pro— 
               <br />
               testants in Lower Canada. To have the same 
               <br />
               privileges is only equal justice, which I trust 
               <br />
               and believe will be granted. Having been 
               <br />
               in communication with several of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic clergy. I can say that the desire to 
               <br />
               have every justice done to their rotestant 
               <br />
               fellow-subjects, but expect to have the same

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pyivileges</span> granted to Roman Catholics in

               <br />

               <br />
               also refer to the clause which gives to local

               governments the right of dividing the see—

               tions of the Confederation into constituencies 
               <br />
               and electoral divisions. This power may 
               <br />
               become very dangerous and lead to great 
               <br />
               practical injustice, and should, I think, he

               <br />
               way extension, and this is a matter which 
               <br />
               seems to have been a serious stumbling-block 
               <br />
               to a great number of those who are really 
               <br />
               favorable to the measure of Confederation. 
               <br />
               N ow, I do not think the Intercolonial Railway 
               <br />
               will be a proﬁtable concern, all at once; but 
               <br />
               I think I can remove a few of the objections 
               <br />
               which have been raised to this art of the
