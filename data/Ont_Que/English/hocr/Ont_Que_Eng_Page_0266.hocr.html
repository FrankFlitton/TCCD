               <br />
               again in the latter part of 1850, when the 
               <br />
               Toronto Convention took lace. I should, 
               <br />
               however, ﬁrst say that, w en the BROWN- 
               <br />
               DOBION Administration was formed, the 
               <br />
               Ben. the President of the Council urged 
               <br />
               very strongly that representation by popula- 
               <br />
               tion should be taken up as the method by 
               <br />
               which to settle the constitutional question ; 
               <br />
               while, on the contrary, I saw the diﬂieulty 
               <br />
               of so taking it up, even with such checks 
               <br />
               and guarantees as were s okeu of, and made 
               <br />
               the counter-proposition t a Confederation 
               <br />
               of the two provinces should be formed. Of 
               <br />
               course as our Administration was so short— 
               <br />
               lived, the subject was not discussed in all its 
               <br />
               bearings; but if we could have come to an 
               <br />
               agreement on one or the other mode, that 
               <br />
               one would have been submitted as the solu- 
               <br />
               tion for the evils complained of—it being 
               <br />
               however distinctly understood that I would 
               <br />
               not attem t to carry any such measure 
               <br />
               through Without obtaining for it a majority 
               <br />
               from Lower Canada. I would never have 
               <br />
               tried to make any change in the Constituion 
               <br />
               without ascertaining that the people in my 
               <br />
               own section of the province were in favor of 
               <br />
