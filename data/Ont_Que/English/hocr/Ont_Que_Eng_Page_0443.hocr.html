               MB. A. MACKENZIE—And, as soon as

               our former political friends in Lower Canada 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ceased‘to</span> take advanced ground on that ques—

               ground, it became clearly our duty to unite

               with that party who held opinions in com-

               <br />
               above all others. (Hear, hear.) At the 
               <br />
               time of the formation of the MACDONALD- 
               <br />
               SIOOTTE Government, I was, with many 
               <br />
               others, strongly blamed, because we allowed 
               <br />
               that Government to come into existence at 
               <br />
               all. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It'</span> is quite possible we were wrong; but 
               <br />
               I think after all it was fortunate that the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Cornwall (Hon. J. S. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MACDONALD)</span> had a fair opportunity to try 
               <br />
               his favorite remedy for our constitutional 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculties—the</span> “ double majority principle.” 
               <br />
               That principle had been pressed on the 
               <br />
               attention of the country for ten years as one 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> which the existing political system

               <br />
               and laughter.) The existence of that 
               <br />
               Government, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it‘</span> served no other purpose, 
               <br />
               showed the utter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impracticability‘</span> of the 
               <br />
               one means, by which my hon; friend

               hoped to accomplish what he, in com-

               hear.) In its main features it is the very 
               <br />
               scheme which was proposed by the Toronto 
               <br />
               Convention—only carried to a greater extent 
               <br />
               than the convention thought advisable or 
               <br />
               possible at the time. The speeches which 
               <br />
               were delivered at that convention, as well 
               <br />
               as'the resolutions which were passed, shewed 
               <br />
               clearly that it was the opinion of the dele- 
               <br />
               gates there present, that a Confederation of 
               <br />
               the whole provinces would be desirable, if 
               <br />
               it were possible to attain it as speedily, as 
               <br />
               they expected they could obtain a Feder- 
               <br />
               ation of the two Provinces of Canada. 
               <br />
               That, I believe, was the sole reason 
               <br />
               why resolutions were not moved and adopt- 
               <br />
               ed in favor of the larger instead of the 
               <br />
               smaller scheme. But we have been told by

               <br />
               (Hou. Mr. DOBION)-—that the scheme of the 
               <br />
               Toronto Convention took no hold upon the 
               <br />
               public mind. As to this I have to say that
