               <br />
               has been said about it, that it is now, I won’t 
               <br />
               say thoroughly, but very nearly worn out. 
               <br />
               And for my own part, in common, I suppose, 
               <br />
               with all who will have to speak at this stage 
               <br />
               of the debate, I feel reluctant to trespass on 
               <br />
               the time of the House. At the same time, 
               <br />
               I cannot properly call it a tres ass, but 
               <br />
               must rather consider it a duty. n a mat-

               <br />
               the interests of so large a portion of this con-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tinent,</span> I think it behoves most of us to ex— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">press</span> our opinions with the best ability that 
               <br />
               we can bring to the subject. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We have had this question discussed from so 
               <br />
               many points of view, and, I presume, by the 
               <br />
               ablœt men who occupy public positions in 
               <br />
               Canada, that a humble individual like myself 
               <br />
               must feel eat diﬂidence in saying another 
               <br />
               word on the subject. But it is no small en- 
               <br />
               couragement to know—at any rate I feel it to 
               <br />
               be an encouragement in speaking in advocacy 
               <br />
               of the scheme—that I am in such good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com.</span> 
               <br />
               pany, that the leading men in this province, 
               <br />
               the leading men in the British Provinces gen- 
               <br />
               erally, and I may even say the leading men in 
               <br />
               the British Empire, are all agreed as to the 
               <br />
               desirableness of what is now proposed, and as 
               <br />
               to the wisdom which has been displayed in 
               <br />
               the framing of the scheme now submitted for 
               <br />
               our adoption. 1 do not expect to say anything 
               <br />
               new, and the fear of repeating what has already 
               <br />
               been said makes me reluctant to say anything 
               <br />
               at all; and were I to consult my own feelings, 
               <br />
               I have no doubt I should be silent, and would 
               <br />
               rise only when you call on us, Mr. SPEAKER, to 
               <br />
               give our votes either for or against the reso-

               lutions in your hand. I think every honor-

               <br />

               <br />
               The more we consider it, the more we look

               into the future in connection with our present

               <br />
               it must assume in our minds. It not only 
               <br />
               affects the interests of Canada, but of all the 
               <br />
               British Provinces of this continent. Its pro- 
               <br />
               bable results will materially affect the future, 
               <br />

               <br />
               the future of the world at large. I do not 
               <br />
               think that I am using languge at all ex r- 
               <br />
               ated. From the best consideration <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iaäe</span> 
               <br />
               been able to give to this subject, I believe 
               <br />
               there are under-lying the question now before 
               <br />
               us principles of the greatest importance to 
               <br />
               the world. I believe there are principles in- 
               <br />
               volved in our present action that must very 
               <br />
               much determine the character of the institu- 
               <br />
               tions that will generally prevail. The im— 
               <br />
               pression upon my own mind is, that if suc- 
               <br />
               cessful, we shall give greater stability and a 
               <br />
               more permanent foothold to the principles that 
               <br />
               obtain in the British Constitution; but that 
               <br />
               failing in our present object, we shall see the 
               <br />
               decadence of these principles on this contin- 
               <br />
               ent, and the advance of those principles which 
               <br />
               obtain in the neighbouring republic. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The more I consider it, the stronger 
               <br />
               am 1 of the opinion, that at the present time 
               <br />
               the principles of democracy and of monarch- 
               <br />
               ism—if I may so express it—are at stake; 
               <br />
               and, considering it in this view, I look upon 
               <br />
               the scheme before us as calling for the most 
               <br />
               cordial and earnest support of every man who 
               <br />
               has learned to value the stability, the mo- 
               <br />
               deration, and the justice which have cha- 
               <br />
               racterized the British nation as compared 
               <br />
               with any other nation that exists on the 
               <br />
               face of the globe. The great question 
               <br />
               before us is that of union—a practicable 
               <br />
               and attainable union—a union of pro- 
               <br />
               vinces owning allegiance to the same Crown, 
               <br />
               possessing, generally, similar institutions, 
               <br />
               similar systems of government, the same lan- 
               <br />
               guage, the same laws, the same dangers, the 
               <br />
               same enemies. Our institutions are 0renerally 
               <br />
               similar, although, no doubt, from havmg been 
               <br />
               isolated for so great a length of time, and 
               <br />
               having had no intercourse one with the other 
               <br />
               to speak of, there is an idiosyncracy attached 
               <br />
               to each of the provinces as they now exist, 
               <br />
               and the longer we remain separate the greater 
               <br />
               the divergence must be, and the more difﬁcult 
               <br />
               union between us will be of accomplishment. 
               <br />
               The advocates of this scheme propose the 
               <br />
               union of all these provinces. It is a trite
