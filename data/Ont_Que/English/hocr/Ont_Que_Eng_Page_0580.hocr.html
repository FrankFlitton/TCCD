               <br />

               he has been so wonderfully inspired. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span>

               <br />
               be any mutual conﬁdence among men ; if we 
               <br />
               were for ever destined to fear and suspect each 
               <br />
               other reciprocally, we would be obliged to

               <br />
               all the relations of social life The very 
               <br />
               laws which protect persons and property 
               <br />
               would be without value, because <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> are 
               <br />
               upounded by men. (Hear, hear.) For- 
               <br />
               tunately such is not the case, as our own 
               <br />
               history suﬁiciently proves. Before the 
               <br />
               union. the parliamentary majority in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada was Catholic, and although it was 
               <br />
               long involved in a struggle with power, was 
               <br />
               it ever guilty of an injustice towards the 
               <br />
               Protestant minority? (Hear, hear.) On 
               <br />
               the contrary, did it not emancipate the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">latter,</span> civilly and religiously, and did it not 
               <br />
               give that minority privileges which it had 
               <br />
               not hitherto possessed? If our people 
               <br />
               are inﬂexibly attached to our faith, it is 
               <br />
               a‘so full of toleration, of good-will towards 
               <br />
               those who are not of the same belief. Since 
               <br />
               the union the parts have changed. Protes- 
               <br />
               tantism dominates in the government and in 
               <br />
               the legislature, and yet has not Catholicity 
               <br />
               been better treated, and has it not been 
               <br />
               better develoPed, with more liberty and more

               <br />
               we are certain that the Protestants of Lower

               The hon. member for Hochelaga has declared 
               <br />
               that he was willing to accord to the Protest- 
               <br />
               ants the guarantees of protection which they 
               <br />
               sought for the education of their children ; 
               <br />
               but in this he has been forestalled by the 
               <br />
               Quebec Conference and by the unanimous 
               <br />
               sentiment of the Catholic population of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. If the present law be in- 
               <br />
               suﬂicient. let it be changed. Justice demands 
               <br />
               that the Protestant minority of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               shall be protected in the same manner as the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority of Upper Canada, and that 
               <br />
               the rights acquired by the one and the other 
               <br />
               shall not be assailed either by the Federal 
               <br />
               Parliament or the local legislatures. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) This is all I feel called upon to say, 
               <br />
               on this occasion, res ecting aquestion which 
               <br />
               will again arise in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> course of the debate. 
               <br />
               The hon. member for Lotbiniere has attacked 
               <br />
               the scheme as being too federal, and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga has condemned it as 
               <br />
               not being sufﬁciently federal, and as tending 
               <br />
               too much towards unity. Neither une nor 
               <br />
               the other is strictly accurate—it is not ab- 
               <br />
               solute unity, nor the federal principle in the 
               <br />
               American sense. In the American Confed- 
               <br />
               eration, supreme authority proceeded at the 
               <br />
               outset from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span> of the states, 
               <br />
               which nevertheless divested themselves of it 
               <br />
               forever—at least according to the opinion of 
               <br />
               the Northern jurisconsults, who hold that no 
               <br />
               state is free to break the compact of 1788. 
               <br />
               In the scheme of the Quebec Conference 
               <br />
               there was no delegation of the supreme 
               <br />
               authority, either from above or below, inas- 
               <br />
               much as the provinces, not being independ- 
               <br />
               ent states, received, their political organiza- 
               <br />
               tions from the Parliament of the Empire. 
               <br />
               There are only distinct attributes for the one 
               <br />
               and the others. (Hear, hear.) Unity does 
               <br />
               not obtain in an absolute sense, because local 
               <br />
               interests and institutions required in the local 
               <br />
               constitutions, guarantees and protections 
               <br />
               which they feared they would not ﬁnd in the. 
               <br />
               united Parliament and Government. But it is 
               <br />
               as complete as possible,inasmuch as unity gives 
               <br />
               to institutions chances of duration, and an 
               <br />
