               perhaps the greatest, an appeal was made to 
               <br />
               the people. It was not until long after the 
               <br />
               matter was ﬁrst mooted that the union 
               <br />
               between England and Scotland was brought 
               <br />
               about. It was questioned at that time—just 
               <br />
               as afterwards, in 1799, with reference to the 
               <br />
               union of Ireland—whether the Scottish Par- 
               <br />
               liament had power to deliver up the fran- 
               <br />
               chise of the pe0ple into the hands of the 
               <br />
               English Parliament. With reference to the 
               <br />
               union of Scotland with England, the matter 
               <br />
               was brought before the people—not in one, 
               <br />
               or in two, but in many ways. There were 
               <br />
               oommissioners appointed, and conventions, 
               <br />
               and various attempts to bring about that 
               <br />
               union before it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnally</span> consummated. 
               <br />
               It was attempted in JAMES the First’s time, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ii‘aARLES</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">id</span> irst’s time, in CROMWELL’B 
               <br />

               <br />
               LIAM, and ﬁnally carried out in the reign of 
               <br />
               Queen ANNE. The proclamation summon- 
               <br />
               ing the Scottish Parliament of 1702 declared 
               <br />
               that among other things, it was to treat of 
               <br />
               the union of Scotland with England. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) We have still extant in the books 
               <br />
               the very words of that proclamation, which 
               <br />
               declared that that Parliament was sum- 
               <br />
               moned in Scotland for the very purpose of 
               <br />
               treating of this question. That Parliament 
               <br />
               did not ﬁnally decide upon the matter, but 
               <br />
               the following Parliament did, and the union 
               <br />
               was consummated. And that Parliament 
               <br />
               was in exactly the position of that of 1702, 
               <br />
               having been called together by precisely the 
               <br />
               same kind of proclamation. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               That matter of the union between England 
               <br />
               and Scotland was, I believe, the only subject 
               <br />
               that was discussed. And, although subse- 
               <br />
               quently the greatest hostility was aroused, 
               <br />
               and troops had to be sent from the north of

               culties of their present position. I say this,

               although I should be glad that it was not 
               <br />

               as it is shewn by the petitions which have

               <br />
               recollect that the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circunatances</span> to a 
               <br />
               great extent existed. In the case of the 
               <br />
               Scottish union, there were those desolatiug 
               <br />
               wars between England and Scotland in 
               <br />
               which the best blood of both lands had 
               <br />
               been shed, and there had long existed a 
               <br />
               perpetual feud and hostility which had left 
               <br />
               the border country—now a smiling and fer- 
               <br />
               tile territory—a barren and desolate waste. 
               <br />
               Then again, when the union of Ireland 
               <br />
               with Great Britain took place, there 
               <br />
               was a rebellion just quenched—there were
