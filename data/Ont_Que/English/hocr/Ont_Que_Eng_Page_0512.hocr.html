               satisfactory arrangement, if one is to think 
               <br />
               of our House of Commons at all treading in 
               <br />
               the footsteps of its great namesake, I confess 
               <br />
               I can hardly imagine. There everything 
               <br />
               favors that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">combined</span> steadiness and variety 
               <br />
               of local inﬂuences upon the representative 
               <br />
               machinery which is at once characteristic of, 
               <br />
               and essential to, the British system, and 
               <br />
               without which neither public parties nor 
               <br />
               public men can act or last as it requires they 
               <br />
               should. Here everything is to be allowed to 
               <br />
               tend in precisely the opposite direction. Nor 
               <br />
               is this all. At home, while the constitu- 
               <br />
               encies are wisely kept as lasting as they can 
               <br />
               be, the members they return are all held 
               <br />
               members of the one House of Commons, as 
               <br />
               little distinguished by the English, Scotch, 
               <br />
               Irish or Welsh location of their constituen- 
               <br />
               cies as they well can be. Here, again, this 
               <br />
               United States system which we are asked to 
               <br />
               copy, is the reverse, and the reverse of sound 
               <br />
               judgment. The House of Representatives 
               <br />
               is an aggregate of state delegations, and our 
               <br />
               mock House of Commons is to be an aggre- 
               <br />
               gateof provincial delegations. Each man is 
               <br />
               to come to it ticketed as an Upper or Lower 
               <br />
               Canadian, a New Brunswicker, a Nova 
               <br />
               Scotian, N ewfoundlander, a Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Islander, or what not. These distinctions, 
               <br />
               which, if we are to be a united 
               <br />
               people, we had better try to sink, we 
               <br />
               are to keep up and exaggerate. The 
               <br />
               system will do that, and but too well. 
               <br />
               There is, however, one marked contrast as 
               <br />
               tothis, between the system of the United 
               <br />
               States and that proposed here. In the 
               <br />
               United States, for the House of Represen- 
               <br />
               tatives, the system is at least sure to work, 
               <br />
               whether for good or evil. Theirs is a true 
               <br />
               Federation. Its founders took care, when, 
               <br />
               with the foresight of statesmen, they arranged 
               <br />
               the details of their constitution, to frame it 
               <br />
               so as to work in all its important arts, and 
               <br />
               with that end they left it main y to the 
               <br />
               several states to work out the arithmetical 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rule</span> laid down for these decennial revisions, 
               <br />
               giving them such powers as to make sure 
               <br />
               that the thing intended would be really 
               <br />
               and punctually done. I thought when I 
               <br />
               read these resolutions ﬁrst, that it was, of 
               <br />
               course, the intention of their framers to 
               <br />
               adopt that system here; but we are now 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">authoritatively</span> told that it is not so. The 
               <br />
               General Parliament is alone to do the whole 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work</span> of these re-divisions of the consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies throughout the provinces. But,

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Suppose</span> that for any cause, such as readily

               <br />
               Well, then, Mr. SPEAKER, I turn next to 
               <br />
               our Legislative Council — too little like 
               <br />
               the House of Lords, to bear even a mo- 
               <br />
               ment’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comparison.</span> in that direction. It 
               <br />
               must be compared with the Senate of the 
               <br />
               United States; but the differences here are 
               <br />
               very wide. The framers of this Constitution 
               <br />
               have here contrived a system quite diﬂ'erent 
               <br />
               from that; and when we are told (as it seems 
               <br />
               we are) that the Legislative Council is to 
               <br />
               represent especial] the Federal element in 
               <br />
               our Constitution, do not hesitate to aﬂirm 
               <br />
               that there is not a particle of the Federal 
               <br />
               principle about it ; that it is the merest sham 
               <br />
               that can be imagined. (Hear, hear.) To 
               <br />
               show the contrast. The Senate of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Senate consists of just two senators from 
               <br />

               case of any casual vacancy power is given to 
               <br />
