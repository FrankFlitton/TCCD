               to the country—and they propose, therefore, 
               <br />
               to steal a march on the people, and will 
               <br />
               come back with a bill manufactured in 
               <br />
               London, as was done in 1840, and press it 
               <br />
               on the people of Canada. We know how it 
               <br />
               was in 1852 or 1853, when an act came 
               <br />
               over to us, making an alteration in our Con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               representation in Parliament, of which no 
               <br />
               one to this day has been able to trace the 
               <br />
               origin. What was done on that occasion 
               <br />
               may be done again. They will be met in 
               <br />
               England by gentlemen from New Brunswick 
               <br />
               and Nova Scotia, and they will manufacture 
               <br />
               there a Constitution for the people of Ca- 
               <br />
               nada—which the people of Canada will be 
               <br />
               compelled to take, or else expose themselves 
               <br />
               to be called traitors and rebels. They will 
               <br />
               come out with the authority of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and invoke the name of the Queen, 
               <br />
               and will attempt to impose the Constitution 
               <br />
               thus manufactured on all the colonies, stig- 
               <br />
               matising as traitors all who oppose them. 
               <br />
               This is not the ﬁrst time that that game has 
               <br />
               been played. Honorable gentlemen, failing 
               <br />
               to obtain the assent of an unwilling people 
               <br />
               here, will take that course—especially when, 
               <br />
               as is well known, the people and Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of England are only too anxious to 
               <br />

               <br />
               our interests, and, as the price of it, will

               perhaps come back with high-sounding
