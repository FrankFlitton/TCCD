               is now struggling in the horrors of civil war. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Honorable gentlemen do not 
               <br />
               desire Confederation, because there must be 
               <br />
               an outlay for its defence. But are those, who 
               <br />
               argue thus, lo’gical ? If two and two did not 
               <br />
               make more than four a moment ago, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why.</span> 
               <br />
               would they make ﬁve now ? If each province, 
               <br />
               standing in an isolated position, would be 
               <br />
               obliged to expend money to organize the 
               <br />
               defence of its territory, why would the com- 
               <br />
               bination of all these various outlays in 
               <br />
               Confederation amount to more than the total 
               <br />
               of these same expenses otherwise added up ? 
               <br />
               Would this be the case because a single 
               <br />
               organization ought to be, necessarily, 'less ex- 
               <br />
               pensive than six distinct commands ? The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Hochel a has exag- 
               <br />
               gerated the expenses of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Coiifederation,</span> as 
               <br />
               he has everything else; as he exaggerated 
               <br />
               and perverted, the other day, the words of the 
               <br />
               Hon. President of the Council.

               HON. MR. CAUCHON—That question 
               <br />
               will naturally come up in its turn. But it is 
               <br />
               not the less true that all the provinces come 
               <br />
               into the Confederation on an equal footing, as 
               <br />
               their debt is placed in equilibrium; and as, 
               <br />
               for the purposes of the union, the arrangement 
               <br />
               is strictly based on the total population of 
               <br />
               each of them. On a previous occasion, as I 
               <br />
               have elsewhere quoted, the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Hochelaga stated that the Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces did not choose our alliahce, because our 
               <br />
               debt was too great. Now he does not choose 
               <br />
               their alliance, because he is afraid we shall 
               <br />
               have to pay for them. Now that the debt is 
               <br />
               perfectly equal, in proportion to the total 
               <br />
               population, and the Conference <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hasr</span> so equal-

               <br />
               justice, the Atlantic Provinces consent to the

               the Quebec Conference, if New Brunswick 
               <br />

               the terminus of the Intercolonial Railway

               <br />
               to it ; her writers and her statesmen positively 
               <br />
               assert it. For our part, we require an ont- 
               <br />
               let upon the Atlantic seaboard, and that we 
               <br />
               can only have by means of Confederation. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) To those who cherish diﬂ‘er-

               ent ideas, I can conceive that this matteris 
               <br />
               not one of equal importance, for they wish 
               <br />
               to ﬁx their terminus at another point on the 
               <br />
               Atlantic seaboard. (Hear, hear.) I feel 
               <br />
               that I have already spoken at length, andI 
               <br />
               have yet some important points of the 
               <br />
               scheme to examine. I will not, then, enter 
               <br />
               into calculations of ﬁgures to prove the 
               <br />
               extravagance and absurdity of those of the

               hon. member for Hochelaga, preferring, 
               <br />
               moreover, to leave them in the more skilful

               and powerful hands of the Hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance. I shall content myself with telling 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Hochelaga—and that 
               <br />
               will suﬁce for myself as well as for the 
               <br />
               House and the country—that I prefer Con- 
               <br />
               federation with its prospects of expense, to 
               <br />
               annexation to the United States with an 
               <br />
               actual debt of close upon three thousand 
               <br />
               millions, and with an annual tax of ﬁve hun- 
               <br />
               dred millions of dollars. The 34th paragraph 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:?ch</span> clause of the scheme reads 
               <br />
               thus: “The establishment of a General 
               <br />
               Court of Appeal for the Federated Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces.” What is the object—what will be 
               <br />
               the character of the tribunal? These two 
               <br />
               questions will naturally present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves</span> 
               <br />
               to those who have given any attention to 
               <br />
               that part of the scheme which refers to the 
               <br />
               civil and criminal law, and the working of 
               <br />
               the judiciary. The whole of the clauses 
               <br />
               which refer to the latter are as complete as 
               <br />
               the most ardent supporters of union could

               <br />
               means of which the provinces have wished
