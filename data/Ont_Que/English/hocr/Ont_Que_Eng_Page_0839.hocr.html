               jobhery and intrigue for doing so. To me, 
               <br />
               air, this appears a matter of great moment. 
               <br />
               It is only too notorious how much of the 
               <br />
               misery and misfortune which has belallen 
               <br />
               the United States, is to be traced to the sys- 
               <br />
               tematic degradation of their public men. It 
               <br />
               is well for us that the matter is still in our 
               <br />
               own power. It is well for us that we have 
               <br />
               still the choice whether we will have states- 
               <br />
               men or stump orators to rule over us— 
               <br />
               whether this House shall maintain its hon- 
               <br />
               orable position as the representatives of a 
               <br />
               free people, or whether. it shall sink into a

               mere mob of delegates, the nominees of cau— 
               <br />
               cuses and of wire—pullers. It is still in our 
               <br />
               power to decide whether we shall secure a 
               <br />
               fair share of the best talent we possess to 
               <br />
               carry on the affairs of the country, or whether 
               <br />
               we will ostracise from our councils every 
               <br />
               man of superior ability, education or intelli- 
               <br />
               gence—with what practical results we need 
               <br />
               not look far abroad to see; and I think, 
               <br />
               sir, it is fast becoming apparent that 
               <br />
               in this, as in other matters, the people 
               <br />
               of Canada are well disposed to adhere 
               <br />
               to the traditions of their British ancestry. 
               <br />
               There is one objection, Mr. SPEAKER, which 
               <br />
               has been advanced perpetually throughout 
               <br />
               this debate by some hon. gentlemen who, 
               <br />
               while unable or unwilling to show an valid 
               <br />
               reason against Confederation in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itself,</span> pro- 
               <br />
               fess themselves bitterly scandalised at the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> combination by which it is likely to 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               e brought about. Now, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sir,’I</span> admit at 
               <br />
               once that there is a prejudice, a just and 
               <br />
               wholesome prejudice, against all coalitions in 
               <br />
               the abstract. I admit that that prejudice is 
               <br />
               especially strong in the minds of English- 
               <br />
               men, and that, in point of fact, a coalition is 
               <br />
               always an extreme measure, only to be had 
               <br />
               resort to in cases of extreme emergency. A 
               <br />
               coalition, Mr. SPEAKER, may be a very base 
               <br />
               act, but it may also be a very noble one. It 
               <br />
               may be a mere conspiracy, for purposes of 
               <br />
               revenge or plunder, on the part of men hating 
               <br />
               and detesting each other to the uttermost— 
               <br />
               or it may be an honorable sacriﬁce of private 
               <br />
               personal enmity before the pressure of over- 
               <br />
               whelming public necessities, to escape from

               <br />

               attachment to the Empire in fair ﬁght, to 
               <br />
               know that our apathy and negligence in

               taking steps for our own defence was fast 
               <br />
               making us the byword to both friend and 
               <br />

               and support of at least a large majority of

               us at such a crisis to ﬁnd ourselves the 
               <br />
               victims of a mere political see-saw—to be 
               <br />
               sure only of this one fact, that whatever course 
               <br />
               of policy was adopted, the circumstance that 
               <br />
               it emanated from one party would cause it 
               <br />
               to be viewed with jealousy and suspicion by 
               <br />
               the whole remaining moiety of the nation? 
               <br />
               I would not have it thought, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Spsaxna.</span>

               struggle. So far from this I believe that it
