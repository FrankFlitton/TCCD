               is similar at the present time. I believe 
               <br />
               that it is really the desire, the object and 
               <br />
               the aim of our neighbors ultimately, whether 
               <br />
               by force of arms or by the course they have 
               <br />
               recently adopted, to bring us into the Amer- 
               <br />
               ican union. By crippling our resources, by 
               <br />
               destroying our trade and by threatening us 
               <br />
               with invasion, they hope to bring about, soon- 
               <br />
               er or later, a feeling of dissatisfaction among 
               <br />
               the peeple of Canada and adesire for union. 
               <br />
               There is no question that, unless we take 
               <br />
               proper steps, the people of Canada will be- 
               <br />
               come dissatisﬁed. By union with the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, it is evident that we will be en- 
               <br />
               abled to increase our trade to the amount of 
               <br />
               ﬁve or six millions of dollars, which is of 
               <br />
               itself a very strong inducement, aside from 
               <br />
               the other considerations that I have alluded 
               <br />
               to. I believe there are many members of 
               <br />
               this House in favor of the scheme, but 
               <br />
               who look upon it as so large a question that it 
               <br />
               ought, they say, to be submitted to a vote of 
               <br />
               the people. (Hear, hear.) It has been said by 
               <br />
               several members, and by the honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               man who preceded me—“ Shall we take away 
               <br />
               the rights of the people? Shall we enter 
               <br />
               upon a scheme of this importance without 
               <br />
               allowing them a voice? Have there been any 
               <br />
               petitions in favor of this scheme?” (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) That would certainly appear an argu- 
               <br />
               ment that had great force; but if we take 
               <br />
               into consideration the effect of the agitation 
               <br />
               of any uestion in this House upon which the 
               <br />
               people eel strongly, we have a right to ask 
               <br />
               why has not a single petition been presented 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> it? We have the effect of this ques- 
               <br />
               tion well illustrated in the introduction, by 
               <br />
               the honorable member for West Brant, of a 
               <br />
               railway bill. That question the people of 
               <br />
               Western Canada have very strong feelings 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon,</span> and I think they have good reasons for 
               <br />
               it. We scarcely ﬁnd that measure placed on 
               <br />
               the records of this House before we have 
               <br />
               petitions from all sections of the west, de- 
               <br />
               nouncing the bill as an attack upon the liber- 
               <br />
               _tles of the people. They fear the power that

               perfect liberty to support this measure. Per- 
               <br />
               haps I was the ﬁrst to agitate and to lay the

               question before the people of the west in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my</span> 
               <br />
               own county. I stated to the people that 
               <br />
               was in favor of representation according to 
               <br />
               population as a principle of justice, but that I 
               <br />
               believed that that question could be settled, 
               <br />
               arid with it all our difﬁculties could be ar-

               <br />
               union of all the provinces. Many honorable

               gentlemen who oppose this scheme freely 
               <br />
               admit the importance of some change, but 
               <br />
               they have not preposed any substitute that 
               <br />
               would improve the scheme. I am satisﬁed 
               <br />
               that if the question were brought before the 
               <br />
               people of Canada, side issues, political and 
               <br />
               personal feeling and party questions would 
               <br />
               enter more largely into its consideration than 
               <br />
               Federation itself, and that therefore a correct 
               <br />
               verdict might not be obtained. I have en-

               dents for submitting such a question to the 
               <br />
               people, and I have failed to ﬁnd one precedent 
               <br />
