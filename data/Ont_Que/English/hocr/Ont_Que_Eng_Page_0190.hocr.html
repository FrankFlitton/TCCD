               been admitted by the several governments of 
               <br />
               these provinces, but, owing to a want of some 
               <br />
               power to control all, and a natural jealousy of

               each other, together with our own political

               differences, the scheme for its construction has 
               <br />
               always fallen through. When visiting the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces last summer, I told our 
               <br />
               friends there that the railway could only be

               <br />
               railway was sure to follow. I come now to 
               <br />
               consider the amendment of my honorable 
               <br />
               friend from the Wellington Division, and to 
               <br />
               which, according to the strict rules of debate, 
               <br />
               this discussion should have been conﬁned; but 
               <br />
               I have taken the same course as honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have preceded me have done, 
               <br />
               namel , to consider the whole scheme. The

               amen ment brings up the question of members 
               <br />

               <br />
               elected for a term of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yearsrlgy</span> the people. I 
               <br />
               am among those of the arm party who 
               <br />
               think that making the members of this House 
               <br />
               elective was a step in the wrong direction; 
               <br />
               and though I am free to admit that but for 
               <br />
               the elective principle having been a plied to 
               <br />
               this House, I should never have had 0 honor 
               <br />
               of a seat within its walls, yet I am prepared to 
               <br />
               re-aﬁrm that opinion on the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House by my voting, as I shall do, against 
               <br />
               this amendment of my honorable friend from 
               <br />
               Wellington, and to sanction a return to the 
               <br />
               nomination of members for life by the Crown, 
               <br />
               under the advice of Ministers responsible to 
               <br />
               the people through the Legislative Assembly. 
               <br />
               I deny that the extension of the elective 
               <br />
               principle to this House was ever sought for, 
               <br />
               or petitioned for by the people at the time of 
               <br />
               its consummation. It is quite true, honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, that before the union of Upper 
               <br />

               <br />
               days of the Family Compact and the irrespon- 
               <br />
               sibility of the Government, when the Assembly 
               <br />
               had no control over the Executive, except b 
               <br />
               stopping the supplies, the Legislative Council 
               <br />
               was chosen for the mere pnrpoæ of opposing 
               <br />
               the public will, and they did it most eﬁ'ectually. 
               <br />
               Every measure calculated to elevate the people 
               <br />
               and promote their best <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> was sure to

               tution, fancied the only remedy was by making 
               <br />
               this House elective. But the memorable 
               <br />
               resolutions of the 3rd September, 1841, at 
               <br />
               Kingston, established the true British principle 
               <br />
               of responsible government, and I maintain

               <br />
               who agree with each other on this point—the 
               <br />
               nomination of members to this House—come 
               <br />
               to the same conclusion by a very different 
               <br />
               process of reasoning. They hold that the 
               <br />
               elective principle applied to this branch of 
               <br />
               Parliament gives too much power to the 
               <br />
               people, while I, on the other hand, argue that 
               <br />
               they have not by it as quick and as sharp a 
               <br />
               remedy against a stubborn Council as they had 
               <br />
               under the system of nomination. The great 
               <br />
               beauty of the old system was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promptneu</span>

               with which at the critical moment it could be 
               <br />
               brought to bear, and the history of its 0 re-
