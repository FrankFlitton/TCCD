               Well, Sir, I have not a word of all this 
               <br />
               to take back. I still hold to the same 
               <br />
               views, the same opinions. I still think that 
               <br />
               a Federal union of Canada might hereafter 
               <br />
               extend so as to embrace other territories 
               <br />
               either west or east; that such a system is 
               <br />
               well adapted to admit of territorial expan-

               sion without any disturbance of the federal

               plain sentence should be considered by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ever been in favor of Confederation with 
               <br />
               the other British Provinces. There is 
               <br />
               nothing I have ever said or written that can

               <br />
               favor of such a proposition. On the con-

               trary, whenever the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ïuestion</span> came up I set 
               <br />
               my face against it. asserted that such a 
               <br />
               confederation could only bring trouble and 
               <br />
               embarrassment, that there was no social, no 
               <br />
               commercial connection between the pro-

               Of course I do not say that I shall be
