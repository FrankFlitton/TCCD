               <br />

               MB. DUNKIN—Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I 
               <br />
               did suppose that I should have had an 
               <br />
               immediate answer as to whether this seig- 
               <br />
               niory is to be a provincial asset or not; but 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman does not seem inclined 
               <br />
               to give any information upon the point. By 
               <br />
               these resolutions it is provided, that all 
               <br />
               ordnance properties are to be taken by the 
               <br />
               General Government; and I never heard but 
               <br />
               that the seigniory of Sorel is an ordnance 
               <br />
               property. But from the statement made 
               <br />
               here the other day, it would seem that 
               <br />
               although this printed document purports to 
               <br />
               be the scheme, it does not give us true in- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ihr-mation</span> on this point. The wording of 
               <br />
               the 55th resolution is, that the “ property 
               <br />
               transferred by the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               and known as ordnance property ” is to 
               <br />
               belong to the General Government; if any 
               <br />
               part of it is really a provincial asset, it must 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bcome</span> so by one of those explanations or 
               <br />
               glosses which we are not allowed to insert 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instrument</span> now, but are to take our 
               <br />
               chance of for some future time. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Passing .over the mystery that seems to 
               <br />
               hang over the subject, I refer then to a mat- 
               <br />
               ter about which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> can be no mistake. 
               <br />
               There certainly cannot be a doubt that the 
               <br />
               lands, mines, and minerals of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               are to be a Federal asset ; and there is not 
               <br />
               any doubt either that the Federal Govern- 
               <br />
               ment will have to pay $150,000 a year for 
               <br />
               them. It is perfectly certain that these 
               <br />
               lands will cost that money; and it is per- 
               <br />
               fectly certain, I think, that the administration 
               <br />
               of them will also cost a certain amount of 
               <br />
               trouble and dispute, as to the manner in 
               <br />
               which it is to be carried on. But if human 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nature</span> remains human nature, we may rea- 
               <br />
               sonably and probably surmise that they will 
               <br />
               not yieldso great a revenue to the General 
               <br />

               <br />
               will be found that the management of these 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> great country. And the consequence 
               <br />
               will be many little passages between the 
               <br />
               province and the Federal Government, not 
               <br />
               advantageous to the latter, but illustrativeof 
               <br />
               the way in which governments too often

               have to deal with things for which they 
               <br />
               have had to pay. Well, sir, I pass to the

               no mistake about that; though there might

               seem to be a mistake about the resolutions

               ought to say, falls short of it. But it
