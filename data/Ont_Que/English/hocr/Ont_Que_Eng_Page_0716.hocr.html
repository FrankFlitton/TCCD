               <br />
               lags? (Hear, hear.) The honorable member 
               <br />
               for Hochelaga spoke of public meetings 
               <br />
               held in certain counties in the district 
               <br />
               of Montreal; but those meetings are far 
               <br />
               from possessing the importance which he 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assigns</span> to them. We all know how they 
               <br />
               can be got up everywhere, and what they 
               <br />
               amount to. However the case may be there, 
               <br />
               there have been none such in the district of 
               <br />
               Quebec, and even in the district of Three 
               <br />
               Rivers, against Confederation, and it cannot 
               <br />

               <br />
               these districts, and who vote for this mea- 
               <br />
               sure, are acting in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oppodtion</span> to the wishes 
               <br />
               of their constituents. Such meetings are 
               <br />
               only found to occur in the district of Mon- 
               <br />
               treal, where the party of the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber is most strongly represented; but an 
               <br />
               epinion may be formed as to those meetings 
               <br />
               from what is going on at Quebec at this 
               <br />
               moment. While the whole body of citizens 
               <br />
               are calling for the suspension of the present 
               <br />
               municipal council, some individuals inter- 
               <br />
               ested in keeping it in authority are calling 
               <br />
               public meetings in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themooks</span> and corners of 
               <br />
               the suburbs. (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
               <br />
               member made tremendous efforts to prove 
               <br />
               that the interests of our religion, our na- 
               <br />
               tionality and our institutions would be in a 
               <br />
               position of much greater safety in his hands 
               <br />
               than they would be in those of the majority. 
               <br />
               For my part, I am willing to leave to public 
               <br />
               opinion the care of deciding that question; 
               <br />
               and as he declares himself to hold that 
               <br />
               Opinion in great respect, I must suppose 
               <br />
               that he will agree with me on this point. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I would not assert that the 
               <br />
               honorable member is himself personally hos- 
               <br />
               tile to the religion and the institutions of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada; but I may say that all the 
               <br />
               tendencies of the party which he represents 
               <br />
               are adverse to those same institutions. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) There is suﬁicient proof of 
               <br />
               this in the writings and the acts of that 
               <br />
               party. As to my opinion respecting Confed- 
               <br />
               eration, I may repeat here what I have 
               <br />
               already said on a former occasion, and that 
               <br />
               is, that no one knew what that opinion was, 
               <br />
               how I should write, and on what side I 
               <br />
               should write, when I began my work. I 
               <br />
               kept silence that I might not be annoyed 
               <br />
               either by friends or by opponents, and in 
               <br />
               order that I might be able to judge of the

               <br />
               dangers of Confederation. I know that 
               <br />
               every question has its dangers, and it is 
               <br />
               probable that this one presents some such in 
               <br />
               the same way as all others do; but the 
               <br />
               greatest danger that we could incur would 
               <br />
               be the bringing on of a conﬂict between the 
               <br />
               Catholics and Protestants, by appeals like 
               <br />
               those which certain members on the left 
               <br />
               have made to the religious passions of our 
               <br />
               population. (Hear, hear.) In what posi- 
               <br />
               tion should we ﬁnd ourselves, we Catholics, 
               <br />
               if we provoked such a conﬂict? The 
               <br />
               258,000 Catholics of Upper Canada are re- 
               <br />
               presented in this House by but two mem-

               ers, those for Cornwall and Glengarry 
               <br />
               (Hon.J. S. and Mr. D. A. MACDONALD), 
               <br />
               whilst the Protestants of Lower Canada are 
               <br />
               represented by ﬁfteen or sixteen members; 
               <br />
               and in case of a conﬂict between the Catho- 
               <br />
               lies and the Protestants, what would become 
               <br />
               of us? (Hear, hear.) From the justice, 
               <br />
               the wisdom and the liberality of our acts 
               <br />
               alone have we hitherto found our strength 
               <br />
               and our protection to proceed, and from 
               <br />
               them shall we again ﬁnd them to proceed 
               <br />
               under Confederation. (Hear.) The hon- 
               <br />
               orable member for Hochelaga quoted a 
               <br />
               garbled portion of my ﬁrst pamphlet, to give 
               <br />
               it a meaning which it does not convey ; hc 
               <br />
               then accuses me of having changed my 
               <br />
               opinion as to the Constitution of the Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Council. But I can tell him that I 
               <br />
               have never changed my opinion on that 
               <br />
               question ; I have never been in favor of the 
               <br />
               elective principle being applied to the Le- 
               <br />
               gislative Council; and if in 1858 I prepared 
               <br />
               and introduced the law which changed the 
               <br />
               constitution of that body, it was only that I 
               <br />
               might gratify the universal opinion which 
               <br />
               desired an elective Legislative Council.
