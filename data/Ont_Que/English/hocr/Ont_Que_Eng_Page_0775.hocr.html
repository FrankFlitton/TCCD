               wick if the people of Upper Canada desire to

               <br />
               prevent Upper Canada from having hers

               the 43rd resolution I consider objection- 
               <br />
               able. The ﬁrst clause of that resolution 
               <br />
               authorizes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New~</span> Brunswick to impose du- 
               <br />

               spars, deals, and sawed lumber. If this In-

               <br />

               <br />
               large portion of the year, and I suppose it 
               <br />
               will do a large business in freight. Like other 
               <br />
               railways, it will be the means of conveying a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dal-ge</span> quantity of timber to the seaboard. It

               appears to me that any one interested in the

               which this arrangement arose. For myself, I 
               <br />
               regret it should be put in that shape, for I am 
               <br />
               opposed to all export duties. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Of course it was arranged that the Local Gov- 
               <br />
               ernments should have the lands, mines, min- 
               <br />
               erals and Crown timber of their respective 
               <br />
               provinces. From our Crown timber here we 
               <br />
               receive a large revenue in the shape of stump- 
               <br />
               age, which is to go to Upper and Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada respectively for their local purposes. But 
               <br />
               the New Brunswick delegates Said—“ We do 
               <br />
               not levy a stumpage duty on our Crown tim— 
               <br />
               her as you do; we ﬁnd it better to levy it 
               <br />
               in the shape of an export duty ”—and we com- 
               <br />
               plied with their desire that they should have 
               <br />
               their local revenue in that shape as an offset 
               <br />
               to our stumpagc duty.

               from South Oxford has not come to the 
               <br />
               point, which is this, that it is not right for 
               <br />
               the people of New Brunswick to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charîe</span> this 
               <br />
               duty on timber. What right have t y to 
               <br />
               levy an export duty on our timber? Yet 
               <br />
               this resolution, it appears to me, would give 
               <br />
               them that right.
