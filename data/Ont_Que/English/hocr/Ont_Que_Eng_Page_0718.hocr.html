               the Reform Bill in 1832, what would have 
               <br />
               happened if WILLIAM IV. had refused to 
               <br />
               overwhelm it by numerous nominations to 
               <br />
               the peerage? Does any one believe that it 
               <br />
               would have persisted to the last? No; 
               <br />
               after having long resisted, it would have 
               <br />
               bent before the storm which threatened to 
               <br />
               sweep it away. (Hear, hear.) In 1832 the 
               <br />
               struggle was between the great prOprietors 
               <br />
               and the middle classes, who wished to make 
               <br />
               their way ; for the English people, properly 
               <br />
               termed the populace, have no political privi- 
               <br />
               leges; they are of no account in the Consti- 
               <br />
               tution, they hold no political position, and 
               <br />
               have no energy for the struggle, which, 
               <br />
               moreover, would not be productive of any 
               <br />
               beneﬁt to them. It resembles in no respect 
               <br />
               the pepulations of the great towns in France, 
               <br />
               which make and unmake governments by 
               <br />
               insurrections or revolutions. In England it 
               <br />
               is the middle classes who make revolutions 
               <br />
               or who threaten to make them. Growing 
               <br />
               richer daily, they advance slowly but surely 
               <br />
               towards the securing of political privileges 
               <br />
               and immunities. The Radical school of 
               <br />
               Manchester at bottom wishes for nothing 
               <br />
               more, although it asserts that it is de- 
               <br />
               sirous of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obtaining</span> privileges for the peo- 
               <br />
               ple. If the great nobility, in 1832, 
               <br />
               offered such determined Opposition to the 
               <br />
               Reform Bill, it was because they feared that 
               <br />
               it would annihilate their inﬂuence and place 
               <br />
               them at the mercy of the will of the masses. 
               <br />
               But we have no caste here, and fortune, like 
               <br />
               political honors, is the property of every man 
               <br />
               who labors to attain it. Here every one, if 
               <br />
               he chooses, can almost without an eﬁ'crt be- 
               <br />
               come a proprietor and possess the right of 
               <br />
               having a deliberative voice in the discussion 
               <br />
               of national questions of the highest import- 
               <br />
               ance. To be a legislative councillor it will 
               <br />
               be sufﬁcient to possess real estate of the value 
               <br />
               of four thousand dollars. The legislative 
               <br />
               councillors will form part of the peOple, will 
               <br />
               live with the people and by their Opinions, 
               <br />
               and will know and appreciate their wants; 
               <br />
               the only difference that there will be between 
               <br />
               them and the members of the House of 
               <br />
               Commons will be, that being appointed for 
               <br />
               life, they will not be as directly brought 
               <br />
               under external inﬂuence ; that they will 
               <br />
               have more freedom of action and of thought, 
               <br />
               and that they will be able to judge with 
               <br />

               then would they provoke contests which 
               <br />
               would neither be conducive to their interests

               <br />
               for Hochelaga said in his last manifesto, and 
               <br />
               repeated here, that if we applied to England 
               <br />
               to amend our Constitution, we should expose 
               <br />
               ourselves to having alterations, for which we 
               <br />
               do not ask, made by some mischievous hand. 
               <br />
               The thing is possible I admit. It is possi- 
               <br />
               ble, as it is also possible for the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament to change our Constitution with. 
               <br />
               out even waiting for us to take the initiative, 
               <br />
               as it did in 1840, but if there is any harm 
               <br />
               nowin askin Great Britain for the Confed- 
               <br />
               eration of a l the provinces, because she 
               <br />
               may subject us to something which is not 
               <br />
               contained in the scheme, why did the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Hochelaga wish for constitutional 
               <br />
               changes in 1858? Did he hope to change 
               <br />
               the Constitutional Act of 1840 without the 
               <br />
               concurrence of the Imperial Parliament? 
               <br />
               And will he be good enough to tell us by what 
               <br />
               supernatural proceeding he hoped to succeed 
               <br />
               in doing so? If there is danger in 1865, 
               <br />
               there must also have been danger in 1858. 
               <br />
               Why then should he, to day, impute to others 
               <br />
               as a crime that which he wished to do him- 
               <br />
               self then? Has he forgotten all that ? 
               <br />
               Does he wish to deny it? Diﬂering slightly 
               <br />
               from the Bourbons, he has learned nothing 
               <br />
               and has forgotten everything. (Hear, and 
               <br />
               laughter.) To frighten us, he also spoke of 
               <br />
               direct taxation, to which we should have to 
               <br />
               submit, if we had Confederation. Now, in 
               <br />
               his constitutional scheme of 1858, with 
               <br />
               which we are all acquainted, he gave to the 
               <br />
               Federal Government the customs revenue. 
               <br />
               We should, therefore, have had to have re- 
               <br />
               course to direct taxation to meet the expen- 
               <br />
               diture of the local governments. The plan of 
               <br />
               Constitution which is submitted to us treats 
               <br />
               us better than that, for it gives us enough, 
               <br />
               and more than we require, to ensure the 
               <br />
               easy working of the local organizations.
