               rial Government. One hon. gentlemen, to 
               <br />
               whom I have particular reference (Hon. 
               <br />
               JOSEPH HOWE) declared it was unreasonable 
               <br />
               toexpect that we should defend ourselves 
               <br />
               against a foreign power, when we had no 
               <br />
               voice either in the declaring of war or the 
               <br />
               making of peace—that while we were quite 
               <br />
               ready, as in times past, to expose our persons 
               <br />
               and property to meet the invader at the 
               <br />
               threshold of our country, we were unwilling 
               <br />
               to take upon ourselves, as colonists, a duty 
               <br />
               which belonged to the parent state. But- 
               <br />
               .does this correspond with the views that are 
               <br />
               now adopted by the Ministry of the day ? I 
               <br />
               hold in my hand an extract from a speech 
               <br />
               delivered by one of the most prominent mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Government at a recent banquet 
               <br />
               in the cit of Toronto. And what did that 
               <br />
               hon. gen eman say? Speaking of the Con- 
               <br />
               ference at Quebec, he stated that “ the 
               <br />
               delegates unanimously resolved that the 
               <br />
               United Provinces of British North America 
               <br />
               shall be placed at the earliest moment in a 
               <br />
               thorough state of defence.” Hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               I was not aware that the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment had ever cast off the burden of the 
               <br />
               defence of this province. But we are told 
               <br />
               by an hon. gentleman, high in the Execu— 
               <br />
               tive, that this Conference, self-appointed as 
               <br />
               it was, by a resolution that we do not see 
               <br />
               laid upon the table, promised to place the 
               <br />
               province in a thorough state of defence. Hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen, what does that mean ? It means 
               <br />
               an expendeture here of four or ﬁve millions 
               <br />
               of dollars annually, or else the statement 
               <br />
               exceeded the truth. Again the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man stated :—“ The Conference at Quebec 
               <br />
               did not separate before entering into a pledge 
               <br />
               to put the military and naval defences of 
               <br />
               the united provinces in the most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> com- 
               <br />
               plete and satisfactory position.” Before 
               <br />
               we discuss this scheme further—before 
               <br />
               we are called on to give a vote upon 
               <br />
               it-——I say we ought to know something more 
               <br />
               with reference to this important matter. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear). Hon. gentlemen may perhaps 
               <br />
               argue that there is no necessity for this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">puestion</span> going to the peeple —— no necessity 
               <br />
               or further time being allowed to the people 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada or of Canada generally to 
               <br />
               consider this matter. Why, hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               has it not been stated by every hon; member 
               <br />
               who has taken the ﬂoor to address the House 
               <br />
               on this question, that it is the most impor- 
               <br />
               tant question ever submitted to this or any 
               <br />
               other British Colonial Legislature? And yet 
               <br />
               many of those hon. members are unwilling

               <br />
               gentlemen assign as a reason why the matter 
               <br />
               should not be submitted to the people—that 
               <br />
               we have had a number of elections to this 
               <br />
               House since it was known that the scheme 
               <br />
               of Confederation was under the consideration 
               <br />
               of the Government, and that these elections 
               <br />
               went favorably to the scheme. I would ask, 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, how many elections have 
               <br />
               we had in Upper Canada since the scheme 
               <br />
               was printed and laid before the people ? I 
               <br />
               would like to see the hon. gentleman stand 
               <br />
               up, who has been elected to come here to 
               <br />
               vote upon this scheme since it was submitted 
               <br />
               to the people. It is true we have had one 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">election</span> in Upper Canada since that time-— 
               <br />
               my hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> near me (Hon. Mr. SIMPSON) 
               <br />
               alluded to it yesterday—the election in South 
               <br />
               Ontario, a constituency until recently repre- 
               <br />
               sented by one of the hon. ntlemen who

               MOWAT. What did the candidates say at 
               <br />
               that election ? Both of them, as stated by 
               <br />
               my honorable friend, in asking the suf- 
               <br />
               frages of the people, had to promise that, if 
               <br />
               elected to Parliament, they would vote 
               <br />
               for a submission of this scheme to the 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               eople. (Hear, hear.) And that is the 
               <br />
               est election we have had in Upper Canada. 
               <br />
               It is true that many honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               now present, in their addresses to their 
               <br />
               several constituencies, when seeking election 
               <br />
               last fall, said they were in favor ot'a union 
               <br />
               ol the British North American Provinces. 
               <br />
               But, hon. gentlemen, there is not a man in 
               <br />
               this chamber, within the sound of my voice, 
               <br />
               who would not say the same. I am myself 
               <br />
               as much in favor of Confederation to-day as 
               <br />
               ever I was in my life ; and I will challenge 
               <br />
               any one to say that at any time, on any public 
               <br />
               occasion, I ever said aught against the scheme 
               <br />
               of the Confederation of the British North 
               <br />
               American Provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) But, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, when I look at this 
               <br />
               scheme, im perfect as I conceive it to be, 
               <br />
               it receives my opposition, not because it is a 
               <br />
               scheme for the Confederation of British 
               <br />
