               these ﬁgures to show hon. gentlemen that 
               <br />
               these colonies have other and very valuable 
               <br />
               resources besides those which have been 
               <br />
               stated by some members, namely, ﬁsh 
               <br />
               and coal. (Hear, hear.) It was stated 
               <br />
               by the honorable member for North 
               <br />
               Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMEBON)—and I 
               <br />
               think ingeniously stated—that this union 
               <br />
               would produce an enormous increase of tax- 
               <br />
               ation on the people of Canada; that the 
               <br />
               partnership would be a very unproﬁtable 
               <br />
               oneto us. Now I think he failed to make 
               <br />
               a point on that. It has been shown that we 
               <br />
               enter into this union with a debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twenty</span> 
               <br />
               ﬁve dollars a head, and that the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, instead of bringing a load upon us 
               <br />
               by coming into the partnership, occupy a de- 
               <br />
               cidedly favorable position with regard to this 
               <br />
               country. (Hear, hear.) The ban member 
               <br />
               for North Ontario also stated that the union 
               <br />
               of the provinces would involve this country 
               <br />
               in a great local debt, a statement which I 
               <br />
               think is also erroneous. He is favorable to 
               <br />
               a union, but would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prefer,</span> a legislative one. 
               <br />
               But does he pretend to say that such a 
               <br />
               union would tend less to the swamping of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, which he fears under the 
               <br />
               Confederation? His ﬁnancial argument, 
               <br />
               that our debt and our taxation would in- 
               <br />
               crease, has failed, except thus far, that the 
               <br />
               machinery of the Government may be too 
               <br />
               expensive. If the present Government fail 
               <br />
               to discharge their duty and adopt an unduly 
               <br />
               expensive machinery, it is by that means 
               <br />
               alone that an increased expenditure can 
               <br />
               arise. It does not depend on the fact of the 
               <br />
