               contrary to all precedent, union is not strength. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But I will state why this 
               <br />
               union is calculated to prolong our connection 
               <br />
               with Britain. It is well known that there 
               <br />
               has been an entire and radical change of late 
               <br />
               in the colonial policy of England. That policy 
               <br />
               has been to extend to us the utmost liberty in 
               <br />
               our relations to the Empire. What is after 
               <br />
               all the nature of the bond which links us to 
               <br />
               Great Britain, apart from our allegiance and 
               <br />
               loyalty? What is it but a Federative bond ? 
               <br />
               That is what links us to Britain ,and I feel quite 
               <br />
               satisﬁed, in the words of an English publicist of 
               <br />
               some eminence, that “ the new colonial policy 
               <br />
               is calculated to prolong the connection of the 
               <br />
               ' colonies with the Mother <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Country.”</span> I believe 
               <br />
               it will raise these provinces as part of the 
               <br />
               British Empire, and so secure to us the per- 
               <br />
               manency of British institutions, and bind us 
               <br />
               more closely to the Crown. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I believe it will, in the words of that far-seeing 
               <br />
               statesman, Lord <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DURHAM,</span> “raise up to the 
               <br />
               North American colonist a nationality of his 
               <br />
               own by elevating those small and unimportant 
               <br />
               communities into a society having some objects 
               <br />
               of national importance, and give these inhab- 
               <br />
               itants a country which they will be unwilling 
               <br />
               to see absorbed into that of their powerful 
               <br />
               neighbors.” And, sir, our neighbors so see it. 
               <br />
               Shortly after the visit of the Duke of NEW— 
               <br />
               CASTLE to this country, attention was directed 
               <br />
               to the question of the union of the colonies, 
               <br />
               not only in this country, but in England and 
               <br />
               in the United States. The New York Courier 
               <br />
               and Inquirer, in an article published at that 
               <br />
               time, came to the conclusion “ that the union 
               <br />
               would, in fact, be an argument for a continu- 
               <br />
               ance of the existing relations between the two 
               <br />
               countries as a matter of policy and gratitude, 
               <br />
               and that such a change of government could 
               <br />
               be met with no objection of any weight.” 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I invite the attention of the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Chateauguay to that 
               <br />
               statement. But, Mr. SPEAKER, it is a sin- 
               <br />
               gular study, looking back over the history of 
               <br />
               the past, to see how this question has come 
               <br />
               up in the experience of the various colonies. 
               <br />
               Before the American revolution, BEN- 
               <br />
               JAMIN FRANKLIN suggested a plan for a 
               <br />
               Federation of the old colonies of Britain on 
               <br />
               this continent, which, he afterwards said,would, 
               <br />
               according to his deliberate opinion, have pre- 
               <br />
               vented the severance of the connection between 
               <br />
               the colonies and the Mother Country. I will 
               <br />
               quote a passage written by him after the 
               <br />
               revolution, in which he makes allusion to this 
               <br />
               project. He said :—

               thought there was too much prerogative in it,

               diﬁicultics then existing between the colonies,

               <br />
