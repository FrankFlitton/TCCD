               <br />
               while giving his support to the amendment, 
               <br />
               entertains very diﬂ'erent views from those 
               <br />
               which were enunciated by the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Niagara, who moved it. My honor- 
               <br />
               able friend says, “ If there is to be delay, let it 
               <br />
               be a substantial delay; let it be such a delay 
               <br />
               as will ensure a dissolution of parliament; 
               <br />
               such a delay as will enable the people to speak 
               <br />
               in that mmmer, and in that manner only, that 
               <br />
               is known to the British Constitution.” I can 
               <br />
               respect that sentiment. There is something 
               <br />
               real in an argument based on that foundation. 
               <br />
               I do him the justice to believe that he takes 
               <br />
               that view with a sincere desire that the delay 
               <br />
               should not militate against the scheme, but 
               <br />
               that it should be adopted by the people when 
               <br />
               referred to them. But, honorable gentlemen, 
               <br />
               contrast that view with the idea suggested by 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman who moved this re- 
               <br />
               solution. What view does he take? Not 
               <br />
               that there should be such a delay as would 
               <br />
               enable the people to express themselves in the 
               <br />
               manner in which Great Britain and all her 
               <br />
               colonies speak, but in that sort of way which, 
               <br />
               as my honorable friend (Hon. Mr. DIOKBON) 
               <br />
               has graphically described, is more nearly 
               <br />
               allied to the peddling of clocks than to any— 
               <br />
               thing connected with British constitutional 
               <br />

               done with twenty days or a month’s delay ? 
               <br />
               Is it possible for the people to speak in any 
               <br />
               constitutional way in twenty days or a month? 
               <br />
               The honorable gentleman knows very well that 
               <br />
               it is not possible, and that under no system of

               suggested, by any possibility be sanctioned by 
               <br />
               the Legislature. Would the people of New 
               <br />
               York state, or any of the States of the Union, 
               <br />
               sanction a proceeding of that kind ? On the 
               <br />
               contrary, they would adept the course at once 
               <br />
               of having the scheme submitted to a direct 
               <br />
               vote of the people. If you adept the British 
               <br />
               constitutional way, then there will have to be 
               <br />
               a dissolution of Parliament; but, if you adopt 
               <br />
               the American system, the people will be called 
               <br />
               upon to vote“ yea or nay ” on the scheme as 
               <br />
               it stands. Let it be expressed in one way or
