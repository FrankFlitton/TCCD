               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Spams,</span> it is not surprising that the

               French-Canadian population of Lower Ca-

               <br />
               (hear, hear)—and I do not fear to declare 
               <br />
               that our Ministers are committing an act of 
               <br />
               very great imprudence in forcing upon the 
               <br />
               people constitutional changes of so serious a 
               <br />
               character, and so loudly denounced as an 
               <br />
               attack on their rights and their privileges. 
               <br />
               Never, at any period of our history, have 
               <br />
               there been seen such changes of constitu-

               tion under such extraordinary circumstances. 
               <br />
               And exactly at the moment when we are 
               <br />
               preparing to resist the invading army of a

               <br />
               iberties which we enjoy after having secured 
               <br />
               them by a century of struggles. But it 
               <br />
               seems to me that new guarantees of security 
               <br />
               ought rather to be given us, in order to in-

               ten times more numerous than ourselves, and 
               <br />

               hostile to our race than the proposed Con-

               federation. Have not the present Ministry 
               <br />
               taught us to look upon the semblance of 
               <br />
               local government, which they propose to us, 
               <br />
               as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁcient</span> protection for all that we hold 
               <br />
               most dear, and to accept the position of a

               powerless minority in the General Govern-

               ment, because commercial interests only 
               <br />
               will be brought in question there? If this 
               <br />
               proposition is a just one, the Constitution of 
               <br />
               the United States, with the recognized sove- 
               <br />
               reignty of Lower Canada, aﬂ'ords much

               greater security for our institutions, our lan- 
               <br />
               guage and our laws. For the sovereignty of 
               <br />
               the state implies their preservation in the 
               <br />
               state, which yields up- nothing to the Gene-

               ral Government except a very restricted 
               <br />
               number of powers. Yes, Mr. SPEAKER, in 
               <br />
               proposing a change of Constitution the Min- 
               <br />
               lstry have committed a serious fault, and 
               <br />
               they have no right to endeavor to prevent 
               <br />
               the people of this province from examining 
               <br />
               the question of possible changes in all its 
               <br />
               bearings. Scarcely six months ago the 
               <br />
               French-Canadians lived happily, relying 
               <br />
               upon the security given them by the exist- 
               <br />
               ing Constitution. N ow such can hardly be 
               <br />
               the case, when the proposed changes threaten

               of two evils they must choose the least,

               and that on a comparison between Con- 
               <br />
               federation and annexation, the least evil 
               <br />
               will not, unfortunately, he found to be Con- 
               <br />
               federation. Before marching on to certain 
               <br />
               slaughter, the soldier will ask himself for 
               <br />
               what he is going to ﬁght, and whether the 
               <br />
               Constitution which he is oing to defend is 
               <br />
               worth the sacriﬁce of his life’s blood. The 
               <br />
               day upon which the French-Canadian soldier 
               <br />
               puts this question to himself, will be the last 
               <br />
               day of the English power in America. I hope 
               <br />
               I may be mistaken, Mr. SPEAKER, and I 
               <br />
               would wish to believe that the views of the 
               <br />
               Government are sounder than mine, at a 
               <br />
               time when they propose a measure so full of 
               <br />
               danger as that which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submitted</span> to us. I 
               <br />
               would wish to believe, above all, that they 
               <br />
               have no intention of skilfully leading us into 
               <br />
               a collision with our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neighbors,</span> which would 
               <br />

               <br />
               would strike a mortal blow at English 
               <br />
               domination on this continent. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> con- 
               <br />
               clude, Mr. SPEAKEB, b ; summing up my 
               <br />
               remarks. The union of the two Canadas 
               <br />
               has not yet done all its work. There is ' 
               <br />
               still room for progress under it, and it must‘ 
               <br />
               be continued. The Hon. Attorney General for 
               <br />
               Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER) main- 
               <br />
               tains on the contrary that it has no longer 
               <br />
               any grounds of existence, and that we must 
               <br />
               have a new political organization. Well, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I venture to hold an Opinion differ- 
               <br />
               ent from that of the hon. member for Mon- 
               <br />
               treal East, and I have no hesitation in say- 
               <br />
               ing that under the union we can yet double 
               <br />
               our prosperity and our numbers, if we intro- 
               <br />
               duce into the administration of affairs a little 
               <br />
               less party spirit and a little more patriotism. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I say, further, that the demand 
               <br />
               for representation based on population has 
               <br />
               no cause of existence, that it was repudiated 
               <br />
               by Upper Canada, at ﬁrst by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservap</span> 
               <br />
               tive party, and afterwards by the Liberal 
               <br />
               party under the MACDONALD-SICOTTE Ad- 
               <br />
               ministration. When we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ha:</span> . seen the most 
               <br />
               energetic and most since partisans of 
               <br />
               representation based on pepulation abandon 
               <br />
               that principal basis of their politics, and 
               <br />
               make of it, in their government, a question 
               <br />
               against which they engaged to vote, I say 
               <br />
               that it is very wrong to use it as one of the 
               <br />
               reasons to compel us to accept the scheme 
               <br />
               of Confederation. That cry, raised by fan-
