               <br />
               federation, because it is proposed to ensure, 
               <br />
               to guarantee the fulﬁlment of all engage- 
               <br />
               ments which shall have been entered into 
               <br />
               with the Imperial Government by all the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces up to the time of union on the subject 
               <br />
               of the defence of the country, without the

               nature and extent of those engagements 
               <br />
               being known. There is perhaps no question 
               <br />
               in all the resolutions of the Conference of 
               <br />
               higher importance than this. Yet it is— wished 
               <br />
               to make us ratify all these engagements with 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span> eyes shut. What do we know about the 
               <br />
               engagements which the Governments of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island may have entered into 
               <br />
               on the subject of their respective defences? 
               <br />
               What do we know even of the engagements 
               <br />
               entered into by our own Government with 
               <br />
               the English Government in relation to the 
               <br />
               same question ? Nothing; we can know 
               <br />
               nothing of them. We are told that the cor- 
               <br />
               respondence on the subject of the defences 
               <br />
               cannot be submitted to Parliament under 
               <br />
               existing circumstances. Why then should we 
               <br />
               blindly vote on questions of such grave im- 
               <br />
               portance ? I am opposed to Confederation, 
               <br />
               because it is wished to make us enter into a 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial arrangement which it is frightful to 
               <br />
               consider, and one which is most diametri- 
               <br />
               cally opposed to the interests of Canada. 
               <br />
               Let us see what is proposed in this respect.

               offered to us by Confederation. All this is

               exclusive of the enormous expense of the

               <br />
               the sums just mentioned will not be payable at

               amount to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">845</span> for each man, woman and

               child, and of that debt we should have to pay 
               <br />
               the interest. (Hear, hear.) I am Opposed 
               <br />
               to Confederation, because I cannot see the use

               may gain considerably by uniting. W’hat do

               the Lower Colonies produce ? Do they not 
               <br />
               live in a climate similar to ours? Do they 
               <br />
               not produce similar grain to that grown in 
               <br />
               Canada? What trade could there be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">betweæ</span> 
               <br />
               two farmers who produced nothing but oats? 
               <br />
               Neither one nor the other would want for 
               <br />
               them. They might stand and stare at each

               <br />

               require a third person—a purchaser. In such
