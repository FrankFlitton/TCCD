               how gentlemen come to this House and dis- 
               <br />
               regard the pledges they have made their 
               <br />
               constituents. Once in their places here, 
               <br />
               they forget the vows by which they ob- 
               <br />
               tained them. I could give a long list, in 
               <br />
               my experience of a quarter of a century in 
               <br />
               this House, of members who have betrayed 
               <br />
               the conﬁdence reposed in them by the 
               <br />
               people who elected them. (Hear, hear.) Is

               it vain to a to members now to control

               us, after we have protested against this sort

               fused those explanations which should be 
               <br />
               given to this House; when the country is 
               <br />
               deeply embarrassed, I fear, beyond redemp- 
               <br />
               tion? (Hear, hear.) I have to apologise to 
               <br />
               the House for thelength of time durin which 
               <br />
               I have occupied its attention. But hope 
               <br />
               the House will believe this, that I am not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.actuated</span> by any factions motives in this 
               <br />
               matter. (Hear, hear.) I stand here asone 
               <br />
               who has no vote of his to recall; as one who 
               <br />
               has always maintained that, under our Con— 
               <br />
               stitution, as it is, prosperity and enjoyment 
               <br />
               might be secured, with all their concomitante, 
               <br />
               were we free from demagogueism, which 
               <br />
               has produced a very large proportion of the 
               <br />
               diﬁiculties by which we are surrounded. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I think I have demonstrated 
               <br />
               that there is .suﬁcient cause for alarm to 
               <br />
               make us anxious lor the future. For all 
               <br />
               we know, we may ﬁnd ourselves in a very 
               <br />
               awkward predicament when the question 
               <br />
               turns 11 on Confederation or annexation. I 
               <br />
               sincer y regret to notice the prevalence of 
               <br />
               this tone of annexation, and I say that, since 
               <br />
               the honorable gentlemen opposite got on the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches, this tone has been much 
               <br />
               more decided on this question than ever 
               <br />
               before. (Hear, hear. Sir, I need onl 
               <br />
               refer to the declaration of the honors 
               <br />

               <br />
               ation scheme was calculated to arrest. I 
               <br />
               regret also, as much as any one, the position 
               <br />
               in which we are placed, and that, with such 
               <br />
