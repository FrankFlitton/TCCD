               men here, however, have said that they were 
               <br />
               in favor of direct taxation for the support of 
               <br />
               the local governments, because it would lead 
               <br />
               those who have to pay the taxes to look more 
               <br />
               closely into what was going on, and the man- 
               <br />
               ner in which their money was expended. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) There seems also to have been 
               <br />
               a feeling in the Lower Provinces in favor of 
               <br />
               a legislative union, and the Hon. Mr. GREY 
               <br />
               seems to be combatting that idea. He says 
               <br />
               that with a legislative union, municipal insti- 
               <br />
               tutions, and direct taxation in every province, 
               <br />
               would be the only means of getting along. 
               <br />
               He exprœsed himælfas opposed to that and 
               <br />
               in favor of a Federal union, which he thought 
               <br />
               would afford them all the advantage that could 
               <br />
               be attained, commercially, by union, and 
               <br />
               would allow each province to retain control 
               <br />
               over its own local affairs. The local legisla- 
               <br />
               tures, he said, were tobe deprived of no power 
               <br />
               over their own affairs that they formerly 
               <br />
               . But in Canada it was represented 
               <br />
               that the local legislatures were to be only the 
               <br />
               shadow of the General Legislature—that the 
               <br />
               were to have merely a shadow of power, as 
               <br />
               their proceedings were to be controlled by 
               <br />
               the Federal Government. That is the posi- 
               <br />
               tion taken by the advocates of the measure 
               <br />
               on this ﬂoor. So it seems that those gentle- 
               <br />
               men who have represented to us that they 
               <br />
               acted in great harmony, and came to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com.</span> 
               <br />
               mon decision when they were in conference, 
               <br />
               take a widely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> view of the questions 
               <br />
               sapposed to have been agreed upon, and give 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vçry</span> diﬁ’erent accounts of what were the 
               <br />
               news of parties to the conference on the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">venous</span> subjects. (Hear, hear.) In the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces they were strongly opposed 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> direct taxation, while here it was present- 
               <br />
               ed as one of the advantages to accrue from 
               <br />
               the Federation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cries</span> of No, no.) Well, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, I say yes. That view of the 
               <br />
               case has been taken. If the amount allowed 
               <br />
               for the expenses of local legislation—the 80 
               <br />
               cents per head—was found insuﬁeient, the 
               <br />
               local parliaments must resort to direct taxa- 
               <br />
               tion to make up the deﬁciency, while in the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces, it seems, nothing of that 
               <br />
               kind was to follow. Now, all the gentlemen 
               <br />
               who have spoken on the Government side of 
               <br />
               the House have declared that this scheme 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> scheme ; but they have declined

               great scheme. Well, if it is a great scheme, 
               <br />
               and they continue to deal with it and with 
               <br />
               this House in this way, are not they, the 
               <br />
               architects and fabricators of this great 
               <br />
               scheme, fairly entitled to be called great 
               <br />
               schemers? (Laughter.) Are they not treating 
               <br />
               us as a lot of school-boys ? As an evidence 
               <br />
               of the excellence and popularity of their 
               <br />
               scheme, they point to the circumstance that 
               <br />
               they have formed a strong government upon 
               <br />
               the question, with a majority of seventy in

               <br />
               ing them could each only muster a majority 
               <br />
               of two. And because they are so strong 
               <br />
               they feel themselves at liberty to deny to 
               <br />
               the people’s representatives the right to 
               <br />

               ter of this kind—information they would 
               <br />
               not have dared to withhold if they were 
               <br />
               weak. (Hear, hear.) When a motion is

               placed on the notice paper of this House for 
               <br />
               several days, requiring a statement of the 
               <br />
               portion of the debt which Lower Canada and 
               <br />
               Upper Canada respectively will have to pay, 
               <br />
               they tell us that they cannot submit to the

               House any information of that kind. In it 
               <br />
               possible that the hou. gentlemen composing 
               <br />
               the Government have not determined that 
               <br />
               question at this stage of the roceedlng, 
               <br />
               and that they have not yet ma e up their 
               <br />
               minds respecting it? If they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span> not, 
               <br />
               it shows that they have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trailing</span> 
               <br />
               with their position, and have not been dis-

               charging the duties devolving —upon them. 
               <br />
               It has also been represented that this matter
