               <br />
               they have done. If we are not to have a 
               <br />
               legislative union in name, we shall have 
               <br />
               something very cloSely resembling it. In

               fact, to have expected that any body 'of dele-

               gates, representing a number of diﬁerent 
               <br />
               provinces and a great variety of conﬂicting

               <br />
               would prove acceptable to everyone, would 
               <br />
               have been most unreasonable ; and I think 
               <br />
               it ought to be admitted that the Administra- 
               <br />
               tion are entitled to the gratitude of the

               country, for the great pains and patient labor 
               <br />
               they have evidently devoted to the consider- 
               <br />
               ation of this project. It must be borne in 
               <br />
               mind, sir, that the scheme of Federation 
               <br />
               agreed upon by the delegates is not ﬁnal; 
               <br />
               and we should remember that the House ol 
               <br />
               Commons, or Parliament of British America, 
               <br />

               <br />
               the working of the Federal system is 
               <br />
               objectionable, that the people would rather 
               <br />
               have their local affairs managed by muni-
