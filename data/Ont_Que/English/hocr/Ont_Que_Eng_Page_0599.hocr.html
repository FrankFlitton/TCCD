               <br />
               slightly hinted itas an objection to the compe-

               <br />
               at the outset in the following manner. Mr. PITT 
               <br />
               said :—-“ The ﬁrst objection is what I heard alluded 
               <br />
               to by the honorable gentleman opposite to me, 
               <br />
               when His Majesty’s message was brou ht down, 
               <br />
               namely, that the Parliament of Irelan is incom- 
               <br />
               petent to entertain and discuss the question or 
               <br />
               rather, to act upon the measure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> wit out 
               <br />
               having previously obtained the consent of the 
               <br />
               people of Ireland, their constituents. This point, 
               <br />
               sir, is of so much importance that I think! ought 
               <br />
               not to suffer the opportunity to pass without illus- 
               <br />
               trating more fully what I mean. If this principle 
               <br />
               of the incompetency of Parliament to the deci- 
               <br />
               sion of the measure be admitted, or if it be con- 
               <br />
               tended that Parliament has no legitimate author- 
               <br />
               ity to discuss and decide upou it, you will be 
               <br />
               driven to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessity</span> of recognizing a principle 
               <br />
               the most dangerous t at ever was ado ted in any 
               <br />
               civilized state, I mean the principle at Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment cannot adopt any measure, newin its nature 
               <br />
               and of great importance, without appealing tothe 
               <br />
               constituent and delegating authority for direction. 
               <br />
               If that doctrine be true, look to what an extent it 
               <br />
               will carry you. If such an argument could be 
               <br />
               set up and maintained, you acted without any le- 
               <br />
               gitimate authority when you created the repre- 
               <br />
               ‘seutation of the Principahty of Wales or of either 
               <br />
               of the counties palatine of England. Every law 
               <br />
               that Parliament ever made, without that appeal, 
               <br />
               either as to its own frame and constitution, as to 
               <br />
               the qualiﬁcation of the electors or the elected, as 
               <br />
               to the great and fundamental point of the succes- 
               <br />
               sion to the Crown, was a breach of treaty and an 
               <br />
               act of usurpation.” Then, Mr. Pl'r'r asked. if 
               <br />
               they turned to Ireland herself, what would they 
               <br />
               say to the Protestant Parliame t that destroyed 
               <br />
               the exclusive Protestant franchise, and admitted 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics to vote without any fresh 
               <br />
               appeal? Mr. Pt'rr went on :—
