               a ship canal from Georgian Bay in that

               <br />
               would conclude by saying that I think union 
               <br />
               desirable, not only because of its present ad- 
               <br />
               vantages, but on account of our future pros- 
               <br />
               pects. Looking at the future, I do not think 
               <br />
               it desirable that one government should exer- 
               <br />
               cise sway over the whole of the North Ameri- 
               <br />
               can continent. (Hear, hear.) Nor do I 
               <br />
               think it desirable that such a government 
               <br />
               should be a republican government. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Taking this view of the case; looking 
               <br />
               back to the history of the past; reﬂecting 
               <br />
               upon the evils which have followed hasty 
               <br />
               constitution-making, and the troubles that 
               <br />
               have occurred in consequence of blundering 
               <br />
               at the outset, it becomes as to consider 
               <br />
               whether the scheme which has now been 
               <br />
               laid before us has in it the elements of 
               <br />
               stability. I think it has, so far as human 
               <br />
               foresight can determine. (Hear, hear.) Geo- 
               <br />
               graphically this country covers a vast extent 
               <br />
               of territory. We can lean our backs on the 
               <br />
               snows of the north, and from that quarter no 
               <br />
               enemy can attack us ; and if we have no great 
               <br />
               breadth from north to south, we have a large. 
               <br />
               expanse westwards. Although, too, we are 
               <br />
               in a northern clime, although our latitude is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> higher than that of our southern neighbor, 
               <br />
               yet this is no obstacle to the growth 
               <br />
               of pepulation or to the increase ot” ros- 
               <br />
               parity. (Hear, hear.) Teaming mil ions

               we are called upon now to lay deep and

               freedom and universal toleration ; institutions 
               <br />
               that have made the parent land great, and 
               <br />
               that mark it out as the one bright spot in
