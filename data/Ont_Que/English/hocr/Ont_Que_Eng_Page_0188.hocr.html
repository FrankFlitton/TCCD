               ferenee, and cites the case of the American 
               <br />
               Constitution, when its framers took, I (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. MCCREA) know not how many months 
               <br />
               longer than our own Conference. But the 
               <br />
               honorable member should recollect that we 
               <br />
               had all their experience. We could com- 
               <br />
               mence where they left oﬁ'. Their work was 
               <br />
               ready to our hands. We had also the ex- 
               <br />
               perience of the working of their Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion, and knew what to avoid. Besides, the 
               <br />
               honorable member should recollect that we 
               <br />
               live in an age of railroads and lightning tel- 
               <br />
               egraphs, of which the revolutionary fathers 
               <br />
               knew nothing; and there is no doubt that 
               <br />
               speed in travelling and communication has a 
               <br />
               great deal to do in quickening the perceptions of 
               <br />
               mankind. Instead of its being made a ground of 
               <br />
               accusation against the Government that they 
               <br />
               have accomplished so much in so short a time, it 
               <br />
               ought rather to redound to their credit. And yet 
               <br />
               the honorable member for the Niagara Division 
               <br />
               complains that the measure was not infallible.

               HON. MB. C URRIE—I did not make that

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               HON. MR. McCREA—Well, the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man said that it ought to have been “ as infal- 
               <br />
               lible as fallible men could make it," and that 
               <br />
               “it should do complete justice to all and injus- 
               <br />
               tice to none.” I took down the exact words of 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman at the time, and if 
               <br />
               the last words do not imply infallibility, they 
               <br />
               certainly come very near it. I venture to 
               <br />
               assert that if the honorable gentleman were 
               <br />
               employed to draw up a simple document of a 
               <br />

               <br />
               revision of any competent person, it would 
               <br />
               be found subject to some criticism. How 
               <br />
               much less then must we ex t a State docu— 
               <br />
               ment like this, the work o so many hands— 
               <br />
               where so many conﬂicting elements were to be 
               <br />
               reconciled—where so much had to he insisted 
               <br />
               upon on one side and resisted on the other—— 
               <br />
               should do complete justice to all and injustice to 
               <br />
               none, according to the notions of my honor- 
               <br />
               able friend from Niagara? The wonder is, 
               <br />
               not that some fault can be found, but that the 
               <br />
               opponents of the measure can ﬁnd so little. 
               <br />
               But it is a little singular that all the gentlemen 
               <br />
               who have yet spoken against the resolutions 
               <br />
               of the Conference have declared themselves 
               <br />
               in favor of Confederation, and yet, by their 
               <br />
               motions and their speeches, they are doing 
               <br />
               everything in their power to delay and embar- 
               <br />
               rass the measure—certainly a very left-handed 
               <br />
               way of showing their support. Honorable
