               of becoming a faction, forgetful of national

               obligations, and only actuated by a desire to

               <br />

               The third and only means of solution for our 
               <br />
               diﬂicultiee was the junction of the provinces 
               <br />
               either in a Federal or a Legislative Union. 
               <br />
               Now, as regards the comparative advantages 
               <br />
               of a Legislative and a Federal Union, I have 
               <br />
               never hesitated to state my own opinions. I 
               <br />
               have again and again stated in the House, 
               <br />
               that, if practicable, I thought a Legislative 
               <br />
               Union would be preferable. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I have always contended that if we could 
               <br />
               agree to have one government and one par- 
               <br />
               liament, legislating for the whole of these 
               <br />
               peoples, it would be the best, the cheapest, 
               <br />
               the most vigorous, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strongest</span> system 
               <br />
               of government we could adopt. ( Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But, on looking at the subject in the Con- 
               <br />
               ference, and discussing the matter as we did, 
               <br />
               most unreservedly, and with a desire to ar- 
               <br />
               rive ata satisfactory conclusion, we found 
               <br />
               that such a system was impracticable. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, it would not meet the assent 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">œcple</span> of Lower Canada, because they 
               <br />
               felt that in their peculiar position—being 
               <br />
               in a minority, with a diﬁ'ercnt language, 
               <br />
               nationality and religion from the majority,— 
               <br />
               in case of a junction with the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, their institutions and their laws 
               <br />
               might be assailed, and their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ancestral</span> asso- 
               <br />
               ciations, on which they prided themselves, 
               <br />
               attacked and prejudiced; it was found that 
               <br />
               any proposition which involved the absorp-

               <br />

               <br />
               receiv with favor by her people. We 
               <br />
               found too, that though their people speak 
               <br />

               fore, we were forced to the conclusion that 
               <br />
               we must either abandon the idea of Union

               <br />
               Because, although the law of those prov- 
               <br />
               inces is founded on the common law of 
               <br />

               <br />
               amount of law of its own—colonial law 
               <br />
               framed by itself, and affecting every relation 
               <br />
               of life, such as the laws of property, muni-

               <br />

               <br />
               great interests contemplated in legislation ; 
               <br />
               we found, in short, that the statutory law 
               <br />
               of the different provinces was so varied and 
               <br />
               diversiﬁed that it was almost impossible to 
               <br />
               weld them into a Legislative Union at once. 
               <br />
               Why, sir, if you only consider the innumer- 
               <br />
               able subjects of legislation peculiar to new

               colonies had particular laws of its own, to 
               <br />
               which its people have been accustomed and

               local as well as general laws of the whole of

               Upper Canada un erstand from the nature 
               <br />
               and operation of our peculiar municipal 
               <br />

               wishes and fulﬁl the requirements of the sev- 
               <br />
               eral provinces. Even the laws considered the 
               <br />
               least important, respecting private rights in 
               <br />
               timber, roads, fencing, and innumerable other 
               <br />
               matters, small in themselves, but in the ag-

               gregate of great interest to the agricultural 
               <br />
               class, who form the great body of the people, 
               <br />
               are regarded as of great value by the portion 
               <br />
               of the community <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ'ected</span> by them. And 
               <br />
               when we consider that every one of the 
               <br />
               colonies has a body of law of this kind, and 
               <br />
               that it will take years before those laws can 
               <br />
               be assimilated, it was felt that at ﬁrst, at all 
               <br />
               events, any united legislation would be almost 
               <br />
               impossible. I am happytostate—and indeed 
               <br />
               it appears on the face of the resolutions them- 
               <br />
               selves—that as regards the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, a great desire was evinced for the ﬁnal 
               <br />
               assimilation of our laws. One of the re— 
               <br />
               solutions provides that an attempt shall 
               <br />
               be made to assimilate the laws of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces and those of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, for the purpose of eventually estab- 
               <br />
               lishing one body of statutory law, founded

               <br />
