               labors is the plan which is now laid before 
               <br />
               us. But there is more to besaid, for before 
               <br />
               the present Ministry had entered upon the 
               <br />
               consideration of the plan, with their col- 
               <br />
               leagues of the Gulf provinces, His Excellency 
               <br />
               had alluded to it in his Speech, and had said 
               <br />
               that it was absolutely nec that a con— 
               <br />
               clusion on the subject should be come to. 
               <br />
               And besides, the leading papers of this pro- 
               <br />
               vince and of the Lower Provinces, have 
               <br />
               long been engaged in the discussion of the 
               <br />
               question. The details have been examined 
               <br />
               in all their hearings to satiety. In view of 
               <br />
               all these facts, I would ask how it can be 
               <br />
               said that the people do not know what the 
               <br />
               'on'is? No; thisismerely a pretext 
               <br />
               which is made use of to overthrow the plan. 
               <br />
               But another fact which goes to prove that 
               <br />
               the people have not been taken by surprise 
               <br />
               in this matter is, that within the last ten 
               <br />
               months, there have been twelve ,elections of 
               <br />
               legislative councillors, and it cannot be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aid</span> that when those elections took place, 
               <br />
               the question of Confederation was not before 
               <br />
               the public. This would be to state a false- 
               <br />
               hood in the full glare of noonday. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Lanaudière Hon. Mr. Cums), 
               <br />
               yaterday said that a ontreal paper had 
               <br />
               stated that he had declared himself opposed 
               <br />
               to Confederation, and he hastened to con- 
               <br />
               tradict the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">awertion.</span> But I must say that 
               <br />
               when he appeared before his constituents 
               <br />
               and talked of retrograde steps -when he said 
               <br />
               that, for his part, he should consider it a 
               <br />
               step back in civilization, if he voted against 
               <br />
               the election of members of this House, I 
               <br />
               consider that it was idle of him to say that 
               <br />
               he had not declared himself opposed to Con- 
               <br />
               federation.

               their duty, must have spoken of the Con-

               federation, and above all, of the manner in 
               <br />
               which the Legislative Council would be 
               <br />
               treated in that Confederation. And if these 
               <br />
               details were entered into, the people are 
               <br />
               ° ted with the subject in question. 
               <br />
               And not only have there been elections, but 
               <br />
               there have been public meetings in large 
               <br />

               at any rate knew what subject was under

               discussion. The honorable member for

               perty. I am astonished to hear such lan- 
               <br />
               guage from the lips of a man who, like 
               <br />
               myself, represents a division more than 
               <br />
               one-half of the population of which is 
               <br />
               French Canadian and Catholic, for that fact 
               <br />
               in itself is a proof of the liberslity of our 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen. I heard that remark 
               <br />
               with pain ; but I can tell him that the Pro— 
               <br />
               testant minority of Lower Canada have 
               <br />
               nothing to fear from the Catholic majority 
               <br />
               of that province: their‘religion is guaranteed 
               <br />
               by treaty, and their schools and the rights 
               <br />
               which may be connected with them, are to 
               <br />
               be settled by legislation to take place here- 
               <br />
               after, and when that legislation is laid before 
               <br />
               the Houses, those members who so greatly 
               <br />
               tremble now for the rights of the Protes- 
               <br />
               tant minority will have an opportunity of 
               <br />
               protecting that minority; they may then 
               <br />
               urge their reasons, and insist that the Pro- 
               <br />
               testants shall not be placed in a position of 
               <br />
               the slightest danger. But even granting 
               <br />
               that the Protestants were wronged by the ho- 
               <br />
               cal Legislature of Lower Canada, could they 
               <br />
               not avail themselves of the protection of the 
               <br />

               lance over the action of the local legislatures 
               <br />
               in these matters? Why should it be sought

               Canada? I say imaginary, because the 
               <br />
               liberality of the inhabitants of Lower Cana- 
               <br />
               da—a liberality of which they gave proof 
               <br />
               long, long ago, by enacting the emancipa- 
               <br />
               tion of the Jews before any other nation in 
               <br />
               the world had dreamed of such a measure— 
               <br />
               is well known. No; far from wishing to 
               <br />
               oppress other nationalities, all that the 
               <br />
