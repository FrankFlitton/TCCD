               says my honorable friend, “ the Lower Pro-

               <br />

               <br />
               sir, is not this just? Is it not fair that the 
               <br />
               richest portion of the community should pay 
               <br />
               the most taxes? Does my honorable friend 
               <br />
               mean to say that those who consume most 
               <br />
               ought not to pay most to the revenue ? And 
               <br />
               if the people of Upper and Lower Canada are 
               <br />
               larger consumers than the people of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, ought they not to contribute ac- 
               <br />
               cording to their consumption to the revenue? 
               <br />
               “But, oh," says my honorable friend, “the 
               <br />
               people of the Lower Provinces get their 
               <br />
               80 cents per head, and we get no more, 
               <br />
               although we are much larger contributors 
               <br />
               to the revenue.” And, he adds, “the 
               <br />
               amount tn be derived from the contribu- 
               <br />
               tions to the revenue by the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces will be very inﬁnitesimal.” But grant- 
               <br />
               ed, for argument’s sake, that this is so, I think 
               <br />
               we ought not to undervalue in this discussion 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> the collateral advantage which the control of 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries will give to the united govern- 
               <br />
               ment in the union to be formed. Remember 
               <br />
               _ that these ﬁsheries will form an important 
               <br />
               part in the future negotiations with the Uni- 
               <br />
               ted States in reference to reciprocity, which 
               <br />
               Upper Canada attaches so much importance 
               <br />
               to. Hence Canada in this union will have 
               <br />
               the control of the policy in regard to the con-

               cession of ﬁshing rights to the American 
               <br />

               the future commercial position ol' the Upper 
               <br />

               <br />
               chant will be enhanced by the fact that the

               concession of the ﬁsheries will procure for 
               <br />
               them advantages in other branches of trade; 
               <br />
               for I repeat that the future policy will be di- 
               <br />
               rected in a great measure by the inﬂuence 
               <br />
               wielded by Canada in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation——</span> 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) My honorable friend, however, 
               <br />
               goes on to say, “But you are about to incur a 
               <br />
               large amount of debt. Lower Canada entered 
               <br />
               into the present union with a debt of only 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$300,000</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,000,</span> and the united debt 
               <br />
               of the two provinces is now $67,000,000.” 
               <br />
               Well, sir, this is quite true. But Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, when she entered the union, had only 
               <br />
               a pepulation of 600,000, and Upper Canada 
               <br />
               a population of 400,000. There was not at

               not see that the chain of canals which have

               <br />
               of the most substantial kind to Lower Canada ? 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) What but these very facilities 
               <br />
               have increased the shipping of Montreal some 
               <br />
               ﬁve hundred per cent. within the last few 
               <br />
               years. Does my honorable friend mean to 
               <br />
               say that the connection of the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               with the western railways of the United 
               <br />
               States is not a beneﬁt to Lower Canada? 
               <br />
               Does he mean to assert that the slides con- 
               <br />
               structed on the Ottawa so as to bring lumber 
               <br />
               to Quebec is of no advantage to Lower Cana- 
               <br />
               da ? Surely he does not measure everything 
               <br />
               that is done in the way of improvement by a 
               <br />
               petty, narrow, sectional standard, which would
