               are told that this last phrase is synonymous 
               <br />

               <br />
               I am reminded of a saying current in the

               Railway is to be done “immediately, if not

               <br />
               to wait till “immediately, if not later.” They 
               <br />
               are to be prosecuted as soon as the state of

               <br />
               these works are to be. The communications

               <br />
               where are they to begin ; what are they to 
               <br />
               be; and where are they to end? And the 
               <br />
               other improvements to be carried out-—the 
               <br />
               communications with the seaboard—the 
               <br />
               enlargement of the canals—how much en- 
               <br />
               largement, sir, and of how many and what 
               <br />
               canals? An honorable friend near me says 
               <br />
               canal enlargement is or should be productive. 
               <br />
               No doubt, but at what rate? I remember 
               <br />
               reading in a Lower Province paper the other 
               <br />

               <br />
               in which he said that at the Quebec Confer- 
               <br />
               ence they went into a calculation of the pro- 
               <br />
               ductive value of the entire outlay of these 
               <br />
               provinces upon productive public works, 
               <br />
               and found them to be yielding an average 
               <br />
               of one and an eighth of one per cent., 
               <br />
               or something like that, of yearly return upon 
               <br />
               their cost. I admit there may be in the 
               <br />
               widening of these canals a something of pro- 
               <br />
               ductiveness; but to say that it will be anything 
               <br />
               like proportionate to the outlay, is absurd.

               The politicians of the eastern provinces, I 
               <br />
               have no doubt, are thoroughly in earnest in 
               <br />
               their demand for the construction of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               Intercolon'al road, and are quite willing to 
               <br />
               have the western improvements begun about 
               <br />
               as soon as they can'be ; and I am quite sure 
               <br />
               that the friends of this scheme in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the—'est</span> 
               <br />
               want their western works instantly gone on 
               <br />
               with. I even believe they both think they 
               <br />
               will get what they want; but I am surprised 
               <br />
               at their credulity, for I do not see how they 
               <br />
               can. I believe they are deceiving themselves 
               <br />
               and their friends with the bright pictures 
               <br />
               their fancy has been painting, and that my 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">western</span> friends, at any rate, are doomed to 
               <br />
               some disappointment. Whenever a Federal

               <br />
               a question of grave interest whether or not 
               <br />
               the state of the ﬁnances will admit of the

               <br />
