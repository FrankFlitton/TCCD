               they honored me with this seat. I admit that 
               <br />
               the proposed system is not the same as the old 
               <br />
               one, because it limits the numbers, and to this 
               <br />
               limitation I have the most serious objections; 
               <br />
               but I am not going to hazard the success of 
               <br />
               the union scheme, as I sincerely believe I

               would, by voting for the amendment, but I 
               <br />
               shall take it as it is, with the hope and belief 
               <br />
               that in the new Parliament, when the union is 
               <br />
               consummated, the constitution of this House 
               <br />
               may be set right. Honorable gentlemen seem to 
               <br />
               talk as if this scheme and the Imperial Act to be 
               <br />
               founded upon it, are ﬁnalitics. I do not look 
               <br />
               upon any human act as aﬁnality, and I have 
               <br />
               no doubt a way will be found by which this 
               <br />
               amendment may be made. Was not the Consti- 
               <br />
               tutional Act of 1840 amended ? And will 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen tell us that the act to be
