               sum one-half was applied to local purposes 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada. Now, our argument 
               <br />
               was, that of this money taken out of the 
               <br />
               public chest, Upper Canada contributed 
               <br />
               seventy per cent., and Lower Canada the 
               <br />
               remainder. If this was true—and I think it 
               <br />
               was incontrovertibly so—then it was perfectly 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clear</span> that we in Upper Canada had to pay not 
               <br />
               only the appropriations made for local pur- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pom</span> in that section, but also nearly one-half 
               <br />
               of the appropriations for local purposes in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. Let me remark here that I 
               <br />
               do not think any man will complain that we 
               <br />
               in Upper Canada are paying this large portion 
               <br />
               of the public revenue. Under our system of 
               <br />
               indirect taxation, or indeed under any system, 
               <br />
               it must be that the richest part of the com- 
               <br />
               munity shall bear the largest share of the 
               <br />
               public burdens, and they have a right to do 
               <br />
               so. I do not complain that the people of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada pay a larger amount of the 
               <br />
               revenue of the country than those of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, because if they choose to consume 
               <br />
               the imported articles upon which duties are 
               <br />
               levied, they do so because they are able to pay 
               <br />
               for them. They are not required to consume 
               <br />
               them, but if they do, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> made to pay 
               <br />
               indirectly to the public exchequer, they. have 
               <br />
               no right to complain that the people of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, more frugal and economical, consume 
               <br />
               less dutiable goods and therefore contribute 
               <br />
               less to the revenue. We in Upper Canada do 
               <br />
               not complain of this, but we give it as a 
               <br />
               reason why we should have our just share of 
               <br />
               inﬂuence in the legislature and government 
               <br />
               of the country. We do not argue that because 
               <br />
               we contribute more we ought to have a larger

               will be to that of any man who examines the

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               half a million of dollars yearly, for the sup-

               <br />
               and if the honorable member for North On- 
               <br />
               tario will balance the proportion that Upper 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">byithe</span> plan now proposed for our acceptance. 
               <br />
               ( ear, hear.) We have thus, Ithinlr, gained 
               <br />
               by this scheme, not only representation by 
               <br />
               population, saving us from the imputation of 
               <br />
               having sacriﬁced this principle in order to 
               <br />
               obtain Confederation, but we have also, bythe 
               <br />
               same measure, gained a substantial redress of 
               <br />
               the grievances to remove which representation 
               <br />
               by population was demanded. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Not only has a saving of money been effected, 
               <br />
               but also a removal from this Legislature of 
               <br />
               those subjects upon which angry, intemperate, 
               <br />
               and painful discussions have taken place in 
               <br />
               times past. For these reasons, I think it is 
               <br />
               a most desirable thing that the scheme should 
               <br />
               be carried out. (Hear, hear.) It is marvel- 
               <br />

               men show themselves to be in their desire to 
               <br />
               oppose this measure. The honorable member 
               <br />
               for Lotbiniére, speaking of it from a sectional 
               <br />
               point of View, has also, I think, exposed him- 
               <br />
               self to this charge. He charges the Honor-
