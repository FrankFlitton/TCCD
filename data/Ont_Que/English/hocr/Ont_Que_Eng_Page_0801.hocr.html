               from Lord MACAULAY. As may be seen, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, this author is not opposed to 
               <br />
               a Federal union ; he simply points out the 
               <br />
               defects of the union of Utrecht. Thatunion 
               <br />
               had been rudely formed, in the midst of : 
               <br />
               revolution, for the purpose of meeting imme- 
               <br />
               diate exigencies. But our plan of union 
               <br />
               was weighed with deliberation, in a time of 
               <br />
               tranquillity, and this tranquillity is certainly 
               <br />
               the result of the formation of the present 
               <br />
               Coalition Government. Therefore, the author 
               <br />
               who has been quoted merely demonstrates 
               <br />
               one thing, and that is, that we should be 
               <br />
               wrong to await the convulsions of a revolu- 
               <br />
               tion, or of an invasion, in order to discuss 
               <br />
               the bases of a Federal union. (Hear, hear.)
