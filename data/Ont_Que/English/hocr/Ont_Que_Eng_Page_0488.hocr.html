               the hon. member for North Ontario is favor- 
               <br />
               able, except that he would rather see it built 
               <br />
               without the union than with it, because the 
               <br />
               union will add so much to the expenses of 
               <br />
               the country. In referenceto that, the increase 
               <br />
               of the expenditure will depend entirely on 
               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen who have now the charge 
               <br />
               of the government of the country. If they 
               <br />
               are extravagant; if they have a governor 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">::</span> retinue, and for each of the provin-

               ces an expensive staff, and all the appliances 
               <br />
               of royalty, then I believe that the union would 
               <br />
               add greatly to the expenses of the country. 
               <br />
               But I do not understand that such is their 
               <br />
               Opinion. I believe their desire is—and I 
               <br />
               am satisﬁed that if they have not this desire 
               <br />
               the peeple will require it- Of them—that it 
               <br />
               shall be conducted on principles of economy, 
               <br />
               and in such amanner that increased taxation 
               <br />
               will not necessarily be the result. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Now, sir, in reference to this great 
               <br />
               country which I have brieﬂy adverted to, I 
               <br />
               wish it to be distinctly understood by the 
               <br />
               members of the Government that I for one 
               <br />
               support them on this understanding, and on 
               <br />
               this understanding only—that the union of 
               <br />
               the provinces and the construction of the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway, the opening up Of the 
               <br />
               North-West and the enlargement Of our 
               <br />
               canals, shall be considered part of this 
               <br />
               scheme, with a view to developing our great 
               <br />
               natural resources and placing this country in 
               <br />
               a prominent position, not only as a colony 
               <br />
               but as a community, that will command the 
               <br />
               respect of nations. (Hear, hear.) We must 
               <br />
               have these promises respecting the N orth- 
               <br />
               West and the canals fairly carried out, and 
               <br />
               not be placed in such a position that after 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial Railway shall have been 
               <br />
               constructed, there will be a combination of 
               <br />
               eastern interests to prevent the accomplish- 
               <br />
               ment of these other works and swam the 
               <br />
               great North-West. If there is to be a oubt 
               <br />
               upon that point, I for one, without any 
               <br />
               hesitation, will state that I will not support 
               <br />
               a scheme that will admit of it. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I am most decidedly Opposed to the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway as a commercial under-

               proﬁtable commercial work. But this I do 
               <br />
               believe, that situated as we are, with the 
               <br />
               probability of being shut out from the mar- 
               <br />

               tion and having our resources developed, 
               <br />
               fairly, properly and honestly to carry out 
               <br />

               <br />
               tages it will confer. The farmers of the 
               <br />
               grain-producing districts of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               have the same market to sell their surplus 
               <br />
               products as the farmers of the States, that 
               <br />
               is, the English market. Now. I think it is 
               <br />
               impossible to show that the produce of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada can be conveyed by this 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway to the seaboard, and 
               <br />
               thence to Liverpool, as proﬁtably as the 
               <br />
               Americans can carry it to the seaboard at 
               <br />
               New York and thence to the English mar- 
               <br />
               ket. If by the one route the grain cannot 
               <br />
               be carried as cheaply as by the other, it is 
               <br />
               impossible for the Canadian farmer or mer- 
               <br />
               chant to be placed in as good a position as 
               <br />
               the American. But if', having constructed 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial Railway, our Government 
               <br />
               says, “ We will compete with the Americans; 
               <br />
               we will put the rates of transportation so low 
               <br />
               as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> our farmers as cheap a route by it 
               <br />
               as by the States,” then the cost of this will 
               <br />
               have tO be borne by the people in another 
               <br />
               way, for the road failing to pay even expenses, 
               <br />
               the excess of expenditure will become 
               <br />
               a charge upon the country for years. View 
               <br />
               it then in any light, and the proposed 
               <br />
               road cannot be made proﬁtable. But for 
               <br />
               purposes of defence, and as a means of com- 
               <br />
               munication, if we desire to be united with 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces and retain our connec- 
               <br />
               tion with Great Britain, the construction of 
               <br />
               the road is a necessity. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               desire, Mr. SPEAKER, to state what in my 
               <br />
               Opinion will be some of the commercial 
               <br />
               results of this union. If the North-West 
               <br />
               contains land, as I believe it does, equal to 
               <br />
               almost any on this continent, it should be 
               <br />
               placed in precisely the same position as 
               <br />
               regards Canada that the Western States 
               <br />
               occupy in relation to the Eastern. I believe 
               <br />
               we should endeavor to develope a great 
               <br />
               grain producing district; for whatever 
               <br />
               may be said, there is not any appreciable 
               <br />
               quantity of grain-producing land in the 
               <br />
