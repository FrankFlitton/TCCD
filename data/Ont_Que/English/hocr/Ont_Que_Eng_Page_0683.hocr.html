               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated</span> in the honorable gentleman’s ﬁrst speech. 
               <br />
               I have been accused of being so unpatriotie as 
               <br />
               to take a mischievous pleasure in any check 
               <br />
               upon the scheme. What I said was, that I 
               <br />
               had mischievous pleasure in seeing that the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman who had charged the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government with bad faith had been 
               <br />
               defeated and ousted from his place. And I 
               <br />
               say that, if this scheme were likely to prove 
               <br />
               for the advantage of the peeple of this province, 
               <br />
               no one would rejoice more than I in seeing it 
               <br />
               carried. But I have always felt, and do now 
               <br />
               feel, that the Constitution of this country can 
               <br />
               be well worked out. I have never given a 
               <br />
               vote for Federation. I have never given a 
               <br />

               <br />

               that this Government could not deal directly 
               <br />
               with the American Government with regard 
               <br />
