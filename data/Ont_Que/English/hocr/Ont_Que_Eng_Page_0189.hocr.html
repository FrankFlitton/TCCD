               HON. MR. MCCREA—Well, I take the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman’s explanation. Does he 
               <br />
               wish to enter into a compact with the Mari- 
               <br />
               time Provinces by which we shall not pay our 
               <br />
               fair proportion of our expenses according to 
               <br />
               our numbers and our means ? Is he so unjust 
               <br />
               as to ask so unfair an advantage? The fact is, 
               <br />
               that the talk about the expenses and stringing 
               <br />
               together long rows of ﬁgures, is only calcu- 
               <br />
               lated to bewilder and frighten the friends of 
               <br />
               the scheme. Three millions of dollars a year, 
               <br />
               exclaims the member for Niagara, without 
               <br />
               making it very plain how, will be added to our 
               <br />
               expense for all time to come. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               HON. MR. CURRIE—More than that.

               HON. MR. MCCREA—More than that. 
               <br />
               Well, what of that? The amount of debt is 
               <br />
               nothing to him who has the means and is wil- 
               <br />
               ling to pay. It is only unpleasant to the 
               <br />
               bankrupt who cannot pay, and to the miser 
               <br />
               who hates to part with his gold. Some one has 
               <br />
               said that it was a very great drawback to the 
               <br />
               morals and prosperity of London, that there 
               <br />
               should be ﬁfty-thousand thieves within its 
               <br />
               walls. But it was well replied, that it was 
               <br />
               rather a source of congratulation that the 
               <br />
               metropolis should be able to support so many. 
               <br />
               So instead of regretting that we shall have 
               <br />
               so much to pay, we ought rather to rejoice 
               <br />
               that we shall be able to pay it. Instead of 
               <br />
               complaining that in the construction of the 
               <br />
               railway, we shall have to pay ten-twelfths, 
               <br />
               according to the estimate of my honorable 
               <br />
               friend from the division of King, it ought to 
               <br />
               be rather a source of pride and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfaction</span> 
               <br />
               to us that we have a large population and 
               <br />
               greater resources than our eastern neighbors. 
               <br />
               I am as much opposed to needless and extra- 
               <br />
               vagant expenditures as any member of this 
               <br />
               honorable House, but if the Intereolonial 
               <br />
               Railway has become a necessity, we must

               not be afraid to undertake it. I am free 
               <br />

               <br />
               and expenditure in the construction of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               there is a single honorable member of this

               <br />
               us back where we were before the ﬁrst sod 
               <br />
               was turned in that great undertaking. If 
               <br />
               war be imminent between us and the United

               <br />
               become an absolute military necessity. And 
               <br />
               who can tell but. that, at any moment, the 
               <br />
               turning of a hand, looking at what has 
               <br />
               already happened, we may not be launched 
               <br />
               into the very midst of a war. It is, I be— 
               <br />
               lieve, very well known, that as soon as it was 
               <br />
               learned in W ' n that the St. Alban's 
               <br />
               raiders had escaped through the bungling and 
               <br />
               ineompetency, to say the least of it, of the 
               <br />
               Montreal ofﬁcials, the ﬁrst order of Mr. 
               <br />
               SEWARD was one of non-intercourse, but it 
               <br />
               was afterwards modiﬁed to the passport sys- 
               <br />
               tem. What, honorable gentlemen, would have 
               <br />
               been our situation had that order been sent 
               <br />
               out, and what guarantee have we that it may 
               <br />
               not be sent out at any moment? But my 
               <br />
               honorable friend from Niagara says that the 
               <br />
               union of these provinces would not tend to 
               <br />
               strengthen our means of defence if, unfortu— 
               <br />
               nately, we should be invaded by the United 
               <br />
               States forces, because our frontier would be 
               <br />
               extended more than in proportion to the in— 
               <br />
               crease of our numbers. Does not every one 
               <br />
               know that it is the settled conviction of the 
               <br />
               military authorities of the States that their 
               <br />
               mistake in the last war was invading these 
               <br />
               provinces in different places at the same time, 
               <br />
               and that, in the event of a second war, their 
               <br />
               policy will be to concentrate all their strength 
               <br />
               on some one given point—Montreal for in- 
               <br />
               stance ? And will my honorable friend con— 
               <br />
               tend that the union and the railway will not 
               <br />
               enable us to concentrate a greater force, and 
               <br />
               more rapidly, on whatever point danger may 
               <br />
               be threatened, and also that they will not 
               <br />
               enable us to obtain aid from the British 
               <br />
               troops more quickly at any season of the 
               <br />
               ear? Then, as to the commercial necessity 
               <br />
               of the railway, it does seem to me plain that 
               <br />
               when our own Grand Trunk has a connection 
               <br />
               with Halifax; when the Cunard and other 
               <br />
               steamers will discharge their valuable freight 
               <br />
               and their passengers destined for the far 
               <br />
               west at Halifax; when Toronto will be 
               <br />
               brought, in point of time, as near to London 
               <br />
               and Liverpool as New York ; it must not only 
               <br />
               increase the business of the Grand Trunk, 
               <br />
               but also the business of the railways in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yova,</span>
