               something delusive and perish-able ; for, as the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Peel and other honor- 
               <br />
               able members who advocate this measure 
               <br />
               say, it is only a temporary expedient to tide 
               <br />
               us over our diﬂiculties—a scheme of union 
               <br />
               to serve for the present, and not intended to 
               <br />
               endure for all time. (Hear, hear.) We are 
               <br />
               not, in fact, building up the frame-work of a 
               <br />
               Constitution that is to stand for ever, but 
               <br />
               something that we will have to tinker up 
               <br />
               from time to time, till we at length succeed 
               <br />
               either in destroying it altogether or making 
               <br />
               it a passably fair erection. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It appears to me, sir, that when this country 
               <br />
               was given responsible government—when 
               <br />
               the peeple of Canada were taught the lesson 
               <br />
               that they were henceforth to exercise the 
               <br />
               right of thinking for themselves—it is a 
               <br />
               sort of rude interference with that right 
               <br />
               when a certain number of gentlemen from 
               <br />
               Canada enter into a contract with certain 
               <br />
               other gentlemen from the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               —thirty-three in number altogether—sign 
               <br />
               that contract, and then declare that the 
               <br />
               representatives of the people in these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces shall ﬁrst Le bound by it, that the 
               <br />
               people themselves shall next be bound by it, 
               <br />
               that neither representatives nor people shall 
               <br />
               have the power to alter or amend it, and 
               <br />
               then that if we do insist upon our right to 
               <br />
               alter it, we shall be thrown back into that 
               <br />
               state of diﬂiculty which has been held 
               <br />
               up by some honorable gentlemen as a 
               <br />
               bug-bear to frighten us into submission, the 
               <br />
               country being represented as having been 
               <br />
               bordering on revolution, into which it would 
               <br />
               assuredly be thrown if this measure were not 
               <br />
               accepted in its entirety. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               think that this proposal will not go down— 
               <br />
               that it will not meet with that full accept- 
               <br />
               ance which honorable gentlemen imagine. 
               <br />
               The people have too much intelligence to 
               <br />
               intrust the arrangement of so important a 
               <br />
               subject as this, which so intimately affects 
               <br />
               their future prosperity and happiness, to the 
               <br />
               hands of any set of men, however able and 
               <br />
               talented they may be; and if this scheme is 
               <br />
               carried without giving the people achance of 
               <br />
               pronouncing their Opinion, honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men will be told, when they go back to their 
               <br />
               constituents, that the peeple have rights to 
               <br />
               be respected, that they like to be consulted 
               <br />
               about the character of the Constitution 
               <br />
               under which they are to live, and that before 
               <br />
               it is adopted ﬁnally, they like to have a word 
               <br />
               to say in regard to it, as well as those who 
               <br />

               like them to have a full opportunity of saying 
               <br />

               as honorable gentlemen opposite seem to 
               <br />
               think. (Hear, hear.) I have been told

               that I have violated my pledges in opposing 
               <br />
               this scheme, and that my constituents sent

               me here because the thought me to be in 
               <br />

               <br />
               from them; for I have heard no complaint 
               <br />
               from them against my action, and have had 
               <br />
               one letter fully approving of it, and it so 
               <br />
               happens that itwas written by a warm friend 
               <br />
               of the Honorable President of the Council 
               <br />
               in the old time. (Hear, hear.) I am not 
               <br />
               aware that the people anywhere approve of 
               <br />
               the scheme and say ditto to it, as the Hon- 
               <br />
               orable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> of Agriculture tells us; and 
               <br />
               when the next election takes place, I pre-

               sume we will have the ditto in some shape.

               Now, the Honorable President of the Coun-

               opposition from me. (Hear, hear.) If I

               understand myself at all, I desire to promote 
               <br />
               the interests and advance the prosperity of 
               <br />
               my country ; but I do not believe those 
               <br />
               interests or that prosperity advanced by the 
               <br />
               adoption of this scheme. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               believe a scheme of union could be devised 
               <br />
               which would be serviceable to all of these 
               <br />
               provinces, but I do not believe that Confed- 
               <br />
               eration is that scheme. I do not think it is 
               <br />
               desirable to adept this, and then trust to the 
               <br />
               chance of obtaining a change afterwards. 
               <br />
               Honorable gentlemen from Lower Canada 
               <br />
               are only postponing the time when they will 
               <br />
               stand like other men in the community, 
               <br />
               having voice for voice with the rest, and 
               <br />
               nothing more. But if we change the Con- 
               <br />
               stitution now, is it wise or prudent to make 
               <br />
               the change only of such a character as to 
               <br />
               require future amendment, and ive rise to 
               <br />
               future agitation? and is it not etter that
