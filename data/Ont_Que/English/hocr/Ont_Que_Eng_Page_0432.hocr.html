               beyond what the Minister of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Finance</span> stated 
               <br />
               -——that it could not in any case add to the

               ments cannot be more expensive than the

               present Government, and therefore all we 
               <br />
               need to add at the very most is the expense 
               <br />
               of the General Government. I do not see 
               <br />
               how it is possible to add any more. I would,

               another statement made the other evening 
               <br />
               by the hon. member from Hochelaga. [le 
               <br />

               <br />
               posing that we were discussing a question of 
               <br />
               colonial union. Confederation, he said, was 
               <br />
               simply tacked on to the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion</span> of Mr. WATKIN, and 
               <br />
               that the whole arrangement was merely a 
               <br />
               nicely planned scheme for the beneﬁt of the 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> not to see through such an attempt as that? 
               <br />
               The argument was used to get the support

               of the opponents of railways in this House

               build up another gigantic railway monopoly 
               <br />

               <br />
               deceived by this imaginary project, and it 
               <br />
               would seem too, sir, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nl</span> r. WATKIN, pos-
