               of separation is by any means the dominant

               <br />

               <br />
               rather think Mr. COBDEN, Mr. BRIGHT,

               <br />

               Of the British public, views which have such 
               <br />
               weight with the Imperial Government as may 
               <br />
               go some way to account for the acceptance— 
               <br />
               the qualiﬁed acceptance—which this scheme 
               <br />
               has met with at their hands. It is recom- 
               <br />
               mended at home—strongly recommended, just 
               <br />
               On this account, by those who there most 
               <br />
               favor it—as a great step towards the inde- 
               <br />
               pendence of this country. Now, I am not 
               <br />
               desirous that our acceptance of the scheme 
               <br />
               should go home to be cited (as it would be) 
               <br />
               ' to the people of England, as a proof that we 
               <br />
               so view it-—a proof that we wish to be 
               <br />
               separated from the Empire. I am quite 
               <br />
               satisﬁed separation will never do. We are 
               <br />
