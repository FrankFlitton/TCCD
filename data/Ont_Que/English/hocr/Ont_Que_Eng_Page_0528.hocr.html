               have this war. Or, if on the other hand, 
               <br />
               the policy of the Federal Executive should

               of principle, still then you will have this 
               <br />
               war. The local minorities—threatened with 
               <br />
               elimination, in their alarm and jealousy, 
               <br />
               will be simply desperate, ready for any out-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">break</span> of discontent at any moment. Take a 
               <br />
               practical case. Suppose the rule adopted, 
               <br />
               of not having an Executive Council inconve- 
               <br />
               niently large, Lower Canada, as we have 
               <br />
               seen, can then only have three members of 
               <br />
               it; and if all these three are French-Cana- 
               <br />
               dians—-as they almost must be, because the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French</span> cannot put up with less than three 
               <br />
               out of twelve—how will not the Irish Catho— 
               <br />
               lies and the British Protestants feel them- 
               <br />
               selves aggrieved? You cannot help it. 
               <br />
               They must in that case feel deeply aggrieved, 
               <br />
               and so feeling, they will cause troubles. The 
               <br />
               Irish Catholics will be told, I suppose, “ (‘h, 
               <br />
               you will have an Irish Catholic member of 
               <br />
               the Government to look to from Newfound- 
               <br />
               land;" and if so, they will have to guide 
               <br />
               themselves by some sort of Irish-Catholic 
               <br />
               Newfoundland rule of policy, and not by any 
               <br />
               rule ever so little savoring of a regard for 
               <br />
               larger or higher principle. The British 
               <br />
               Protestants, in their turn, will be told: “You 
               <br />
               have a majority of your own tongue and 
               <br />
               faith from Upper Canada and the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces; you must be content with that, 
               <br />
               and look to their members of the Government 
               <br />
               for such care as you may need in the matter 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> your aﬂ'airs.” “ Oh, we must, must 
               <br />
               we?” will be the answer; “then we will 
               <br />
               square our conduct, not by any rule for 
               <br />
               British America or even Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               but by the shifting exigencies of preju-

               dice or passion, whatever they may be, in

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tueur,</span> hear.) These discontented elements 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada, depend upon it, will 
               <br />
               create no small confusion ; and among 
               <br />
               those thus driven into making trouble, there 
               <br />

               legitimate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of this system ; and if any

               do not need, as I stand here, to defend my- 
               <br />
               self from any charge of bigotry as against 
               <br />
               any sect or party. There was a time in Ca- 
               <br />
               nada when it was most difﬁcult for any 
               <br />
               person who spoke my tongue to stand up 
               <br />
               and say that the French-Canadians ought 
               <br />
               not to be politically exterminated from the 
               <br />
               face of the earth. I stood out steadfastly 
               <br />
               against that doctrine then. I remember 
               <br />
               well the painful events of that sad time. 
               <br />
               I foresee but too distinctly the fearful 
               <br />
               probability there is of that time coming 
               <br />
               again, through the adoption of these reso- 
               <br />
               lutions. And I do t shrink from the 
               <br />
               danger of being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misuixrstood</span> or misrepre- 
               <br />
               sented, when I now stand up here and warn 
               <br />
               the country of this danger. If trouble of 
               <br />
               this sort ever arises, it is one that will ex- 
               <br />
               tend very rapidly over the whole Confederacy. 
               <br />
               In all parts of it, in every province, there 
               <br />
               are minorities that will be acted upon by 
               <br />
               that kind of thing. In the Lower Provinces, 
               <br />
               and in Newfoundland, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span> are but too 
               <br />
               ripe for the outburst of hostilities of this 
               <br />
               description. Talk, indeed, in such estate of 
               <br />
               things, of your founding here by this means 
               <br />
               “ a new nationality ”—of' your creating such 
               <br />

               SPEAKER, is such a thing possible? We 
               <br />
               have a large class whose national feelings 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tarn</span> towards London, whose very heart is 
               <br />
               there ; another large class whose sympathies 
               <br />
               centre here at Quebec, or in a sentimental 
               <br />
               way may have some reference to Paris; an- 
               <br />
               other large class whose memories are of the 
               <br />
               Emerald Isle; and yet another whose com- 
               <br />
               parisons are rather with Washington; 
               <br />
               but have we any class of people who are 
               <br />
               attached, or whose feelings are going to be 
               <br />

               <br />
               that is to be created? In the times to
