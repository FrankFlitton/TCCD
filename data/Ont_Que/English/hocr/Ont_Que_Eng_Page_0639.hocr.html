               ruinously expensive war footing? And what 
               <br />
               could we do against an invading army of two 
               <br />
               or three hundred thousand men, with our 
               <br />
               treasury exhausted by the fortiﬁcations, and 
               <br />
               with hardly any assistance from England, 
               <br />
               whose policy at this moment is anti-colonial? 
               <br />
               I cannot understand how, in face of the danger 
               <br />
               which is impending over us, and for which 
               <br />
               we are so little prepared, the Government 
               <br />
               can thus cast deﬁance in the teeth of 
               <br />
               the powerful nation who are adjacent to 
               <br />
               us, and whose armies now in the ﬁeld 
               <br />
               could set at naught any resistance to 
               <br />
               immediate invasion. I assert it positively, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, the United States have not 
               <br />
               the least intention of attacking us, so long as 
               <br />
               we remain peaceable spectators of their fra- 
               <br />
               tricidal struggle, and so long as we continue 
               <br />
               to conﬁne ourselves to peaceful occupations. 
               <br />
               But if, on the contrary, we create here a 
               <br />
               hostile military power, if we establish here 
               <br />
               the throne of a viceroy or of a foreign mon- 
               <br />
               arch, in deﬁance of the principles which form 
               <br />
               the groundwork u on which rests the politi- 
               <br />
               cal system of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States, we may then 
               <br />
               rest assured that the neighbouring republic 
               <br />
               will sweep away that monarchical organiza- 
               <br />
               tion, established in rivalry to its own demo— 
               <br />
               cratic system. (Hear, hear.) Such, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, is the question in its most serious 
               <br />
               aspect. I shall not enlarge upon the details 
               <br />
               of the scheme of Confederation, which have 
               <br />
               been so ably criticised by the hon. members 
               <br />
               who have preceded me; and besides I shall 
               <br />
               have an opportunity of discussing them 
               <br />
               when the amendments to the scheme are 
               <br />
               submitted to the House. But I may now 
               <br />
               say that those details cannot be accepted by 
               <br />
               the pe0ple. We have already received nu- 
               <br />
               merous petitions praying for the rejection of 
               <br />
               the measure, and those etitions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continue</span> to 
               <br />
               reach us every day. ow, I ask you. Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, what the sentiments of the people 
               <br />
               will be if that scheme is adopted, and if in 
               <br />
               the course of two months it is returned to 
               <br />
               us from England, after having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receivt</span> d the 
               <br />
               sanction of the Imperial Parliament, without 
               <br />
               its having been possible for us to alter the 
               <br />
               most triﬂing of its details? Is it sup osed, 
               <br />
               after a Constitution shall have been orced 
               <br />
               on the French-Canadians, which they have 
               <br />
               opposed to the utmost, that they will be 
               <br />
               very enthusiastic in the defence of that Con- 
               <br />

               to ensure the adoption of the present scheme? 
               <br />
               The hostile majority of Upper Canada have 
               <br />
               obtained representation based on population,

               against which Lower Canada has so

               energetically struggled for ﬁfteen years, 
               <br />
               because she saw in that concession the 
               <br />
               annihilation of our inﬂuence as a race. 
               <br />
               Under these circumstances, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> 
               <br />
               is it supposed that reliance is to be placed 
               <br />
               on the assistance of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French—Canadiens.,</span> 
               <br />
               Who were formerly so terrible in the attack, 
               <br />
               and who fought, without hesitation, one 
               <br />
               against ten, a proportion in which we shdl 
               <br />
               again ﬁnd ourselves opposed to the Americans 
               <br />
               in the probable event of a war? To hope 
               <br />
               that they will ﬁght with the same impulse 
               <br />
               now, when they are being deprived of the 
               <br />
               surest guarantees of their natural existence 
               <br />
               and of their most sacred political rights,is 
               <br />
               greatly to deceive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ourselves,</span> and to betray 
               <br />
               ignorance of what has always been the cause 
               <br />
               of their heroism in the conﬂict. Under the 
               <br />
               Constitution as it is, they would again ﬁght 
               <br />
               with similar courage, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regardless</span> of numbers. 
               <br />
               because they love that Constitution which 
               <br />
               secures to them all that they hold most dear, 
               <br />
               and because they wish to preserve it. Under 
               <br />
               Confederation, on the contrary, we have 
               <br />
               nothing left to defend; our inﬂuence as a 
               <br />
               race is gone, and sooner than be absorbed in 
               <br />
               a Confederation, the existence of which will 
               <br />
               prove a source of constant strife without 
               <br />
               bringing with it compensating advantages, 
               <br />
               the peOple dissatisﬁed will seek other and 
               <br />
               more advantageous political and commercial 
               <br />
               alliances, and for this reason it is that I 
               <br />
               consider that the scheme of Confederation 
               <br />
               will lead us directly to annexation to the 
               <br />
               United States. When the commissioners 
               <br />
               from the North and the South recently had 
               <br />
               an interview in order to decide'the possible 
               <br />
               conditions of an honorable peace, one of the 
               <br />
               three propositions submitted by the North 
               <br />
               was to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> that the two armies should 
               <br />
               not be disbanded after the cessation of 
               <br />
               hostilities, but should be united for the 
               <br />
               purpose of carrying on a foreign war. Now, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, what does the expression, 
               <br />
               “foreign war,” when used by the United 
               <br />
               States, mean, except war upon Canada? 
               <br />
               And what could the ﬁfty battalions which 
               <br />
               England could send us do against the com- 
               <br />
               bined armies of the North and the South, 
               <br />
