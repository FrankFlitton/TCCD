               Well, Mr. SPEAKER, if I am not mistaken, 
               <br />
               that reverenrl gentleman, a member of our 
               <br />
               clergy, seems to be somewhat less convinced 
               <br />
               than our Ministers and the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Vaudreuil of the safety of our religious 
               <br />
               interests, and of our nationality. Are not his 
               <br />
               expressions sufﬁciently energetic and signiﬁ- 
               <br />
               cant. But let us now see whether the rever— 
               <br />
               end gentleman has grounds for his alarm, and 
               <br />
               whether he is not somewhat carried away by 
               <br />
               his seal and patriotic anxiety for the welfare 
               <br />
               of his fellow-countrymen. Let ussee whether, 
               <br />
               on the contrary, he does not appreciate more 
               <br />
               correctly than our LoWer Canada Ministers

               I will tell you, Mr. SPEAKER, w y there are 
               <br />
               so many crosses; it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because,</span> previous to

               the union of the Cnnadas, the Legislative

               Council was composed of enemies of the Lower

               <br />
               our Lower Canada schools. Thanks to this 
               <br />
               tyrannical prescription, the schools were closed 
               <br />
               by hundreds, and the children of our people
