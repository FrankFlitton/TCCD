               Canada, as'well as the Attorney General for

               Lower Canada, in addressing the House last 
               <br />
               night, were anxious to have it understood that 
               <br />
               — this scheme for uniting British America 
               <br />
               under one government, is something <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> 
               <br />
               from “representation by population,” — is 
               <br />
               something <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘erent</span> from “joint authority," 
               <br />
               —-—hut is in fact the very scheme of the 
               <br />
               Government of which they were members in 
               <br />
               1858. Now, sir, it is all very well that my 
               <br />
               honorable friends should receive credit for the 
               <br />
               large share they have contributed towards 
               <br />
               maturing the measure before the House; 
               <br />
               but I could not help reﬂecting while they 
               <br />
               spoke, that if this was their very scheme in 
               <br />
               1858, they succeeded wonderfully in bottling 
               <br />
               it up from all the world except themselves— 
               <br />
               (hear, hcar)—and I could not help regretting 
               <br />
               that we had to wait till 1864 until this 
               <br />
               m serious plantof 1858 was forœdto fruition. 
               <br />
               ( ear, hear, and laughter.) For myself, sir, I 
               <br />
               care not who gets the credit of this scheme, 
               <br />
               ——I believe it contains the best features of all 
               <br />
               the suggestions that have been made in the 
               <br />
               last ten years for the settlement of our troubles ; 
               <br />
               and the whole feeling in my mind now is 
               <br />
               one of joy and thankfulness that there were 
               <br />
               found men of position and inﬂuence in Canada 
               <br />
               who, at a moment of serious crisis, had nerve 
               <br />
               and patriotism enough to cast aside political
