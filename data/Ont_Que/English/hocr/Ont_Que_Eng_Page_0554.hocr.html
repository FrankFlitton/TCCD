               sir, that this feeling has been got up in Eng- 
               <br />
               land to an extent very much to be regretted. 
               <br />
               In this connection I have yet to notice some 
               <br />
               passages—and I shall deal with them as 
               <br />
               brieﬂy as I can—from the very important 
               <br />
               article I quoted last night, which is contained 
               <br />
               in the E iinburgh Review for January, and 
               <br />
               which, I am sorry to say, expresses this feel- 
               <br />
               ing in the strongest possible form. But 
               <br />
               before citing them, I am bound to say that I 
               <br />
               by no means believe the views they express 
               <br />
               are universally or even generally entertained 
               <br />
               at home. I do believe, though, that they are 
               <br />
               entertained by many, and that there is much 
               <br />
               danger of their doing avast deal of mischief. 
               <br />
               That they are loudly avowed, does not admit 
               <br />
               of doubt; and when we ﬁnd them set forth 
               <br />
               in the pages of so inﬂuential an organ of 
               <br />
               Opinion as the Edinburgh Review, the case 
               <br />
               assumes a very serious aspect. There are 
               <br />
               other passages in the article to the same 
               <br />

               It is not unnatural that the desire to maintain

               a connection with the power and wealth of the
