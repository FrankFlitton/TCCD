               era Government for any amount? No,thefact 
               <br />
               is that these lands are utterly useless for cul- 
               <br />
               tivation, that the whole island does not produce 
               <br />
               hay enough for the town of St. Johns, and 
               <br />
               that every year large quantities of it are im- 
               <br />
               ported. I know a farmer in Three Rivers 
               <br />
               who has sent cargoes of hay to Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               and who is now only waiting for the naviga- 
               <br />
               tion to open to send more—and these are the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               come into the Confederation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Bean)</span> But 
               <br />
               there is also another matter for consideration 
               <br />
               with respect to this arrangement regarding 
               <br />
               the public lands. I am of opinion that it is 
               <br />
               more advantageous to the progress of coloni- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ration</span> of our wild lands that they should 
               <br />
               remain in the hands of the present Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, rather than come into the possession of 
               <br />
               a local government, which might, perhaps, be 
               <br />
               obliged to maintain itself by direct taxation; 
               <br />
               for in that case the very uttermost farthing due 
               <br />
               on these lands will have to be collected. In 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> like Lower Canada, with its 
               <br />
               rigorous climate, colonization must be aided 
               <br />
               and encouraged if reasonable progress is de- 
               <br />
               manded. In that view the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> have 
               <br />
               made free grants, and have remitted many 
               <br />
               claims for interest on the public lands. Had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> not done so, the population in certain 
               <br />
               sections would have been forced to leave the 
               <br />
               country. Remissions and free grants will dis- 
               <br />
               appear with the appearance of direct taxation. 
               <br />
               1 am Opposed to the scheme of Confederation, 
               <br />
               because it is most unjustly proposed to enrich 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces with annuities and dona- 
               <br />
               tions, to persuade and induce them to enter 
               <br />
               into a union which will be injurious to all 
               <br />
               the contracting parties. I am opposed to the 
               <br />
               scheme of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> because the division 
               <br />
               of the public debts of the several provinces 
               <br />
               has been made in an unjust way, and because 
               <br />
               no portion of these debts ought to have been 
               <br />
               imposed on the local governments, which, in 
               <br />
               the event of the union, ought to have begun 
               <br />
               anew without being burthened with debt. I am 
               <br />
               opposed to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> becau- e I foresee 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> without number in relation to the 
               <br />
               concurrent powers on several points conferred 
               <br />
               on the general and local governments. Col-

               <br />
               863,000 per annum for ten years. The sum 
               <br />
               to pay this will have to be borrowed every 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               portion to their respective populations. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I am opposed to the scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, because it has been agreed to con- 
               <br />
               struct the Halifax Railway without a notion 
               <br />
               of what it will cost, and at a time when we 
               <br />
               have already as much to pay as our resources 
               <br />
               can bear, without plunging into ruinous and 
               <br />
               unproductive enterprises of this kind. There 
               <br />
               is no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exaggeration</span> in the statement that at 
               <br />
               least $20,000,000 will be required for the ex- 
               <br />
               ecution of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cute.</span> prise. Of what use will 
               <br />
               it be? Doubly useless in a military and in a 
               <br />
               commercial point of view. We are not in a 
               <br />
               position to undertake it for the mere pleasure 
               <br />
               of having a road which will place us in direct 
               <br />
               communication with the sea over English ter- 
               <br />
               ritory. What would the Intel-colonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way be worth i I a commercial point of- view? 
               <br />
               In sum ner we have the St. Lawrence, which 
               <br />
               affords means of communication much more 
               <br />
               economical in their nature than any railway.
