               were well understood, there would be no 
               <br />
               anxiety about our institutions. The hon. 
               <br />
               member also stated that he did not want to 
               <br />

               election of the members of the Le 'slative 
               <br />
               Council. In reply to that, I won d state 
               <br />
               that the elective principle, as applied to the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, becomes unnecessary in 
               <br />
               view of the numerical strength of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada in the Federal Parliament, for the 
               <br />
               House of Commons is the body that will 
               <br />
               make and unmake ministers. Why have 
               <br />
               the elective principle for the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council, since we shall haveit for the House 
               <br />
               of Commons, since we shall have a responsi- 
               <br />
               ble Government and a Federal Government, 
               <br />
               composed of members elected by the people? 
               <br />
               The hon. member has stated that he desired 
               <br />
               to advance with the intellect of the people, 
               <br />
               and not to take a backward step. These 
               <br />
               are great words——the intellect of the people! 
               <br />
               progress! But for my part, I do not hesi- 
               <br />
               tate to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assert,</span> that the people will gladly 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce the election of the members of the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, in view of the control 
               <br />
               of all the matters I mentioned before. 
               <br />
               The hon. member has said that the elective 
               <br />
               principle would have been the safe-guard of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. I— can understand this to be 
               <br />
               the casein a House which is able to make 
               <br />
               and unmake administrations, but in a House 
               <br />
               which is indissoluble, I cannot discover its 
               <br />
               importance. The safety of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               depends, not on the elective principle, but 
               <br />
               on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility</span> of the members of the 
               <br />
               Executive to the House of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commons.</span> I may 
               <br />
               be permitted to say one word on the subject 
               <br />
               of the elective right, as it is the grand pan- 
               <br />
               acea for all the ills incident to humanity. 
               <br />
               We must not shut our eyes against evidence. 
               <br />
               Have we, since the union of several counties 
               <br />
               to form electoral divisions, seen persons of 
               <br />

               <br />
               not seek to make againful pursuit of politics,

               ation has been made, namely, that having

               <br />
               If those who talk thus had taken time to

               consider the matter more carefully, they 
               <br />
               would not hold this Opinion. It is evident 
               <br />
               that with the means of communication already 
               <br />

               <br />
               a section of Upper Canada should be invaded 
               <br />
               by the enemy, the combined forces of the

               wilfully blind not to see this. It has also
