               HON. Ma. CHRISTIE—A number of 
               <br />
               the representatives in the Federal Congress 
               <br />
               who voted for it were democrats, and with- 
               <br />
               out their coucurrenze and support it could 
               <br />
               not have been carried. Besides, that was 
               <br />
               only an amendment, not a revision of the 
               <br />
               Constitution. The Constitution of the United 
               <br />
               States was not the work of a party. The 
               <br />
               revision of the Constitution of the State of 
               <br />
               New York, in 1846, was not the work of a 
               <br />
               party It is not desirable that any Consti- 
               <br />
               tution should be the work of a party; in 
               <br />
               so important an undertaking all party spirit 
               <br />
               should be laid aside. (Hear, hear.) Why? 
               <br />
               Because men of all parties are alike interested 
               <br />
               in the formation of a Constitution, and 
               <br />
               because in the construction of such an in- 
               <br />
               strument, the collective wisdom of the lead- 
               <br />
               ing men ol all parties is needed. Besides, 
               <br />
               a Constitution so framed will be more likely, 
               <br />
               as my hon. friend from Wellington has so 
               <br />
               well said, to live in the hearts and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affections</span> 
               <br />
               of the people. (Hear, hear.) To shew the 
               <br />
               good sense of our neighbors on this point, 
               <br />
               they do not give the revision of a Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion—and the work of the Conference was 
               <br />
               a revision of our Constitution—to any party, 
               <br />
               but to men specially chosen for the purpose, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> all parties ; and I think the Governor 
               <br />
               General, and the Lieutenant-Governors of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acted</span> most wisely 
               <br />
               when they selected men of all shades of 
               <br />
               political Opinion to compose this Conference 
               <br />
               and to prepare this Constitution, because all 
               <br />
               party views and feelings being laid aside, 
               <br />
               the whole object and motive of the members 
               <br />
               of the body was to devise a scheme which 
               <br />
               would best tend to promOte the good of their 
               <br />
               common country. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
               <br />
               member from Wellington has suggested a 
               <br />
               very important objection to the scheme; 
               <br />
               and l am free to admit that, if the position 
               <br />
               he took were a correct one, then it would not 
               <br />
               be my duty, or that of any elected member 
               <br />
               of this House, to assent to the measure. 
               <br />
               In order that I may not misrepresent the 
               <br />
               position taken by the hon. gentleman, let 
               <br />
               me quote his language, as reported in the 
               <br />
               newspapers. He held :-- 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               That the elective members had received a 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               how could they conceive they had the power 
               <br />

               <br />
               to do; they would be doing that which they could 
               <br />

               Now, it must be frankly admitted that if 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman’s position be correct, 
               <br />

               elected member giving his concurrence to 
               <br />
               the scheme of the Conference. But, hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen, let us enquire what is the posi- 
               <br />
               tion of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative.</span> Two elements 
               <br />
               enter into t e idea of representation— 
               <br />
               namcly, power and duty. A representative 
               <br />
               derives the former from his constituents 
               <br />
               acting by their majority, under the Consti- 
               <br />
               tution. From what source does he derive 
               <br />
               the latter? Obviously not from his constitu~ 
               <br />
               outs, because even the majority are not 
               <br />
               agreed on all points connected with the dis- 
               <br />
               charge of his duty. My hon. friend (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SANBORN)</span> has spoken of the position of 
               <br />
               a representative, as being that of a trustee. 
               <br />
               I shall quote from a very able work on the 
               <br />
               British Commonwealth, in which that posi- 
               <br />
               tion is, to my mind, very fully and very satis- 
               <br />
               factorily proved to be incorrect. Cox says :— 
               <br />

               Any trust, to be obligatory in conscience, 
               <br />

               <br />
               be derived from identically the same authoritv, 
               <br />
               for it obviously would be contrary to morals, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> 
               <br />
               it is to law, that a man would be bound in con-

               choose? By whom of those who appoint him 
               <br />
               is he to be guided in preference to the rest ? At

               <br />
               respect to the source of his power there is no 
               <br />
               ambiguity; it is derived from his constituents 
               <br />
               acting by their majority. But from whom does 
               <br />
               he derive the duty of expressing this or that 
               <br />
               opinion in Parliament? In what particular are 
               <br />
               the trust-makers agreed? The very majority 
               <br />
               who voted for him are rarely, perhaps <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">never,</span> all
