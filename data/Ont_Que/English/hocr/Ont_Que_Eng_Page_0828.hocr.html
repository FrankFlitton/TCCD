               <br />
               written in reference to it, some urging that 
               <br />

               congratulate ourselves, sir, that while our

               republican neighbors are engaged in bloody 
               <br />
               strife, one portion spilling its best blood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in,</span> 
               <br />
               order to obtain a new Constitution, we can 
               <br />
               discuss the propriety of making a change in 
               <br />
               our own, which has not been inaptly termed 
               <br />
               a “ bloodless revolution,” without let or 
               <br />
               hindrance, but on the contrary with the full 
               <br />
               consent and authority of the power to which 
               <br />
               we owe allegiance. (ﬂeur.) The provisions 
               <br />
               of this new Constitution have been widely 
               <br />
               disseminated. and in some sections thorough- 
               <br />
               ly discussed. In the riding which I have 
               <br />
               the honor to represent, public attention was 
               <br />
               drawn to Confederation during the recent 
               <br />
               election, and I am fully justiﬁed in stating, 
               <br />
               that with a few exceptions here and there, 
               <br />
               t ere were not to be found many dissentients 
               <br />
               to it. (Hear, hear.) It is true that upon 
               <br />
               one or two occasions there were found lead- 
               <br />
               ing men who took the ground that they did 
               <br />
               not think it desirable to enter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'into</span> this
