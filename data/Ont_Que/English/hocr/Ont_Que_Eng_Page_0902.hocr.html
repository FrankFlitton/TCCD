               <br />
               and spoke of their being opposed to each

               other before, and said that it was impossible 
               <br />
               for them to unite now for any good object. 
               <br />
               I think, sir, it will scarcely be denied that 
               <br />
               in looking back upon the antecedents of our 
               <br />
               public men, there is hardly one of any note 
               <br />
               who has not, during some portion of his life, 
               <br />
               found himself in such a position as to render 
               <br />
               it necessary for him to abandon views which 
               <br />
               he had previously maintained, and that no 
               <br />
               government has been successful which has 
               <br />
               not been founded upon mutual concessions. 
               <br />
               It is necessary that public men on both 
               <br />
               sides should unite in great emergencies in 
               <br />
               order to promote the general weltare. We 
               <br />
               know very well that those who are open to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conviction</span> very frequently change their 
               <br />
               course, and it is no disgrace to any one 
               <br />
               that under the inﬂuence of increased 
               <br />
               knowledge he has shaped his conduct in 
               <br />
               accordance with the degree of light which 
               <br />
               has surrounded him. The honorable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'gen-</span> 
               <br />
               tleman knows very well that we must 
               <br />
               judge the actions of individuals not merely 
               <br />
               by their motives—for these we cannot often 
               <br />
               penetrate—but by the character and results 
               <br />
               of their actions. And so we must look upon 
               <br />
               the scheme now before us as it really is. 
               <br />
               We must examine it for ourselves, and un- 
               <br />
               less we see clear evidence to the contrary, 
               <br />
               we ought to give its promoters credit for 
               <br />
               honesty and sincerity. I have no sympathy 
               <br />
               with those who willingly attribute the ac- 
               <br />
               tions of public men to the inﬂuence of 
               <br />
               unworthy motives, when they may fairly 
               <br />
               claim to originate in the higher qualities of 
               <br />
               the mind and heart. It is the duty, I think, 
               <br />
               of all right-minded men to give this Govern- 
               <br />
               ment the credit of acting from high-minded 
               <br />
               motives. But supposing, for the sake of 
               <br />
               argument, that these honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               had united for dividing among themselves 
               <br />
               oﬁces of proﬁt and emolument. It is fortu- 
               <br />
               nate that the germs of evil <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seldom</span> attain to 
               <br />
               their complete development. Professions of 
               <br />
               patriotism do not always betoken the absence 
               <br />
               of selﬁshness. He has read history to little 
               <br />
               purpose who has not discovered that political 
               <br />
               dishonesty has frequently been not only 
               <br />
               harmless, but has been practically the min- 
               <br />
               ister of public good. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERONd) stated 
               <br />
               the other day, that under Confe eratiou 
               <br />
               Upper Canada would contribute an un- 
               <br />
               equally large proportion of the amount 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁgures before him; but as I took no notes 
               <br />

               be considered, that under Confederation

               there will be a uniformity in the tariffs of 
               <br />
               the several provinces, and if the tariff of 
               <br />
               Canada is reduced so as to bring it into 
               <br />
               conformity with those of the Maritime

               An hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> who afterwards addressed 
               <br />
               the House, and who, I regret, is absent from 
               <br />
               the House by reason of indisposition—the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brome (Mr. DUNKIN)—I 
               <br />
               understood to say that nations and constitu- 
               <br />
               tions and governments owed their origin to 
               <br />
               that creative power to which all are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indebtéd</span> 
               <br />
               for existence and the means of perpetuating 
               <br />
               it. The idea is well expressed in the words 
               <br />
               of a celebrated writer :—“ There isaDivinity 
               <br />
               that shapes our ends, rough hew them as we 
               <br />
               may.” He (Mr. DUNKIN) then went on to 
               <br />
               question the honesty of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpore</span> of those 
               <br />
               gentlemen, Hon. Messrs. Ross, GAL'I‘ and 
               <br />
               CARTIER, who signed the despatch of 1858, 
               <br />
               which resulted in the Conference of last Sep- 
               <br />
               tember. He described all the intermediate 
               <br />
               stages as “ accidents,” and then found 
               <br />
               fault with every item of the conterential 
               <br />
               arrangement. The hon. gentleman, on his 
               <br />
               own principles, should not criticise too se- 
               <br />
               verely the action of the Government. They 
               <br />
               might be only instruments in the hands of 
               <br />
               the Supreme Architect. 'l‘he reasonable 
               <br />
               method would be to examine the arrange- 
               <br />
               ments or agreements of the Conference, and 
               <br />
               if the scheme is found to be based upon just 
               <br />
               and equitable principles, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nﬁst</span> recommend 
               <br />
               itself to favorable consideration, and the ins- 
               <br />
               vitahle conclusion is that it ought to be 
               <br />
               adopted. I confess I admire the arrange- 
               <br />
               ment, which has no doubt been arrived at 
               <br />
               after much care and deliberation. The com- 
               <br />
               mercial and ﬁnancial parts of the scheme 
               <br />
               seem to me to be as just as, under the circum- 
               <br />
               stances, they possibly could be. It is a very 
               <br />
               ordinary accomplishment to be able to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               fault. It is much easier to destroy than to build 
               <br />
               up. We know that those so disposedmighttake 
               <br />
               up the best schemes ever devised by human 
               <br />
               ingenuity, and draw improper conclusions 
               <br />
               therefrom. In fact there is no form of 
               <br />
               government in the world but what, if badly 
               <br />
               administered, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be productive of evil. 
               <br />
               On the other hand, a scheme somewhat 
               <br />
               defective in itself, if placed in the hands of 
               <br />
               good and patriotic men, might be made to 
               <br />
