               Mn. COWAN—I cannot agree altogether, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, with the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Cornwall as to the causes which led to 
               <br />
               the prosperity of this country from 1854 to 
               <br />
               1858, nor yet with the picture he draws of 
               <br />
               our present circumstances. That lion. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman attributes our prosperityto the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repeal</span> 
               <br />
               of the Usury laws. 1 do not doubt but that 
               <br />
               the repeat—of the Usury laws had some effect, 
               <br />
               but there were other causes which had much 
               <br />
               more to do in producing that prosperity 
               <br />
               than the repeal of the Usury laws. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place we imported money by the million 
               <br />
               to build our railways, and in the second 
               <br />
               place, not only had we abundant harvests, 
               <br />
               'but short crops in other countries gave 
               <br />
               us fabulous prices for everything we raised. 
               <br />
               Instead of eighty or ninety cents, wheat was 
               <br />
               worth two dollars a bushel and upwards, 
               <br />
               with millers scouring the country with teams 
               <br />
               to carry it from the barn to the mill. Such 
               <br />
               a tide of prosperity, M r. SPEAKER, never set 
               <br />
               in on any country; the result was that it 
               <br />
               unhinged the sober calculation of almost 
               <br />
               everybody, and we ran into debt individually, 
               <br />
               municipally, and provincially, as if pay-day 
               <br />
               had never been to come. Well-to-do farm- 
               <br />
               ers, with perhaps a thousand dollars or two 
               <br />
               in their pocket, thought they might purchase 
               <br />
               an adjoining farm, but it was well if they 
               <br />
               escaped with the loss of the money paid 
               <br />
               down. In many instances the homestead 
               <br />
               was sacriﬁced ere the new farm was paid for, 
               <br />
               while houses planned and built then have 
               <br />
               not yet received their furniture. But, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, if our prosperity was unprece- 
               <br />
               dented, so were our reverses. The commer- 
               <br />
               _ cialcrisis of 1858 came o_n us when we were

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               almost without a crop. The disastrous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">front</span> 
               <br />
               of the 11th of June destroyed the one-half, 
               <br />
               if not three-fourths, of the fall wheat.— 
               <br />
               Spring wheat—all except the Fife sort, then 
               <br />
               but sown—was so blighted as in many 
               <br />
               instances not to be worth the cutting. And 
               <br />
               many a farmer was not only destitute of 
               <br />
               potatoes to eat, but had even to purchase his 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next</span> year’s seed. The only article from 
               <br />
               which numerous farmers got any return was 
               <br />
               surplus stock, which that season brought 
               <br />
               fair prices—lean as well as fat—in the 
               <br />
               American markets. But these reverses were 
               <br />
               not without a salutary eﬂ'ect. All speculation 
               <br />
               was instantly stopped. Farmers began to 
               <br />
               practice anew frugality and economy, and 
               <br />
               turned their attention to rearing stock as well 
               <br />
               as cereals. The consequence is that the 
               <br />
               country has in a eat measure recovered 
               <br />
               from the shock of 1858, and, notwithstanding 
               <br />
               rather short crops and comparatively <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">low</span> 
               <br />
               prices, I cannot help thinking that the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Cornwall takes altogether too 
               <br />
               gloomy a view of the state of the country. 
               <br />
               But though I cannot coincide with the 
               <br />
               gloomy views of the member lor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cornwall,</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               descriptive of the agricultural interest, 
               <br />
               generally, throughout the province. It is 
               <br />
               all very well for my hon. friend, who resides
