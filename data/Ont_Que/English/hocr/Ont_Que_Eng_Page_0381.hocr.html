               <br />
               with us is now becoming an honorable pursuit; 
               <br />
               the man of education is no longer ashamed to

               which we can learn the science of agriculture.

               The French-Canadians hold a distinguished

               position in the commerce of the country ; 
               <br />
               they have founded banks and savings banks ;

               <br />
               the communications with the great towns are 
               <br />
               easy ; we have railways, and we new measure

               have a literature peculiarly our own ; we have

               are the pillars of our nationality. Nothing de-

               erature ; education has penetrated everywhere ; 
               <br />
               we have several excellent colleges, and an uni—

               learn in the military schools how to defend

               the question ; let their opinion on the subject

               <br />
               to last for centuries, why should we not at

               least endeavor to make it as perfect as possi-

               understood? In conclusion, I object to the 
               <br />
               proposed Confederation, ﬁrst, as a Canadian, 
               <br />
               without reference to ori 'n, and secondly, as 
               <br />
               a French-Canadian. Brom either point of 
               <br />
               view, I look upon the measure as a fatal error; 
               <br />
               and, as a French-Canadian, I once more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appeal</span> 
               <br />
               to my fellow-countrymen, reminding them of the

               <br />
