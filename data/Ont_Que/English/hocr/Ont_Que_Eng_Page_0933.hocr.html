               COL. RANKIN—Certainly; but though 
               <br />
               I did not approve of a Federation of Canada 
               <br />
               alone, I did not feel that it was part of my 
               <br />
               duty to rise and protest against any such 
               <br />
               project. I felt it was right to empower 
               <br />
               these hon. gentlemen to frame that scheme, 
               <br />
               which they found to be the best and most 
               <br />
               practicable—although I certainly had a 
               <br />
               mental reservation with reference to the 
               <br />
               point I have mentioned; and I did not then, 
               <br />
               nor will I at any future day, assent to a 
               <br />
               Federation of the Canadas alone, with a 
               <br />
               local government for each section. Rather 
               <br />
               than accept such a Constitution, I would pre- 
               <br />
               fer to remain as we are; for I never 
               <br />
               can be a consenting party to the making 
               <br />
               of two or three paltry provinces out of 
               <br />
               Canada. But I am prepared to give my 
               <br />
               hearty support to the project now.under 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration—not</span> because I consider it 
               <br />
               perfect; for if I were so disposed, I might 
               <br />
               raise many valid objections to the scheme ; 
               <br />
               but I am not so disposed. I really believe 
               <br />
               the gentlemen who have taken it in hand 
               <br />
               have applied themselves to the task com- 
               <br />
               mitted to them in a spirit of patriotism and 
               <br />
               faithfulness to their trust, and I shall not 
               <br />
               permit myself to indulge in any remark 
               <br />
               With reference to the position they occupied 
               <br />
               toWards each other previous to the Coalition 
               <br />
               now established. While on this subject, 1 
               <br />
               may remark that the Hon. President of the 
               <br />
               Council seemed most favorable to the idea 
               <br />
               of a Federation of the two provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada alone, and I am bound to say, when 
               <br />
               he made his explanations, he appeared deep- 
               <br />
               ly impressed With the gravity of the step he 
               <br />
               Was about to take, and perfectly well aware 
               <br />
               that he was exposing himself to be assailed 
               <br />
               by parties unfriendly to him, on points 
               <br />
               where he was, perhaps, open to attack. I do 
               <br />
               not say he is not vulnerable, but I, at all 
               <br />
               events, shall not assail him now. If I have 
               <br />
               any attacks to make upon him, I shall 
               <br />
               suspend them till some future time ; and if 
               <br />
               he succeeds in carrying out this project, 
               <br />
               he will ﬁnd in me one who will always be 
               <br />
               ready to accord to him the highest meed

               MB. RANKIN—We ought all to profit 
               <br />
               by the lessons of experience. In the course 
               <br />
               of this discussion, it has been a pleasure to 
               <br />
               me to observe the general spirit of loyalty 
               <br />
               which has been displayed by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               who have addressed the House. Even those 
               <br />
               who‘are adverse to the scheme have not 
               <br />
               been behind its greatest advocates in their 
               <br />
               declarations of attachment to British insti- 
               <br />
               tutions and British rule on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continent</span> 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) And I am not disposed to 
               <br />
               insinuate that there is a solitary member of 
               <br />
               this House who entertains sentiments of 
               <br />
               disloyalty to Great Britain. We all have 
               <br />
               a right to express our views, and in 
               <br />
               fact it is our_duty to do so, since we are 
               <br />
               sent here to consider what is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best</span> for the 
               <br />
               interests of Canada ﬁrst; for though we 
               <br />
               owe allegiance to England, Canada is our 
               <br />
               country, and has the strongest and best 
               <br />
               claims to our devotion. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I, sir, am not one of those Canadians who 
               <br />
               place the interests of England ﬁrst, and 
               <br />
               hold those of Canada in secondary estima- 
               <br />
               tion. It would be better if we could regard 
               <br />
               the interests of both with the same degree 
               <br />
               of concern—and I trust they always may 
               <br />
               be united; but we ought not to permit 
               <br />
               ourselves to lose sight of the fact, that with 
               <br />
               nations as with individuals, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.time</span> does 
               <br />
               arrive when it becomes each person to be 
               <br />
               responsible for himself, and when he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cw</span> no 
               <br />
               longer look to his parents to give him a 
               <br />
               standing in the world. Sir, the time must 
               <br />
               come, sooner or later, when this country 
               <br />
               must cease to be a colony dependant on 
               <br />
               Great Britain; and whatever we do, what- 
               <br />
               ever arrangements for the future we may 
               <br />
               make, we ought always to keep the fact 
               <br />
               plainly before our eyes, that passing events 
               <br />
               are calling upon us, either to commence the 
               <br />
               establishment of a nationality for ourselves, 
               <br />
               or make up our minds <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">toje</span> absorbed in the

               <br />
               I, sir, do not desire to see the latter state of 
               <br />
               things brought about. Nothing could-be 
               <br />
               more distasteful to me than to become what
