               <br />
               Equality, Fraternity! How many sad and 
               <br />
               mournful memories are connected with those 
               <br />

               Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, in the year 
               <br />
               1793, that country saw the best of kings led 
               <br />
               to the guillotine, provinces laid waste, blood 
               <br />
               ﬂowing like water ; the standard of rebellion

               and insubordination raised and borne triumph-

               <br />
               teries, the desecration of the altar; priests, 
               <br />
               nuns, old men, women, and even children, 
               <br />
               murdered! Those three magic words were 
               <br />
               the signal and vindication of the “ drownings 
               <br />

               <br />
               Yes, Mr SPEAKER, civil war rages among 
               <br />
               our neighbors; but let us hope that Divine 
               <br />
               Providence will guard these new countries 
               <br />
               from the disasters and the horrid crimes 
               <br />
               which, to the eternal shame of civilization, 
               <br />
               stain the history of certain portions of Eu- 
               <br />
               rope at the close of the last century. It 
               <br />
               was after a civil war that the terrible pro- 
               <br />

               the earth, the ﬁres of revenge burst forth; 
               <br />
               then woe to those who have given offence to 
               <br />
               men of the type and character of the famous 
               <br />
               General BUTLER. What is incumbent on us, 
               <br />
               then, if we would escape sharing the horrors 
               <br />
               of the situation ? What but to unite, one 
               <br />
               and all—to combine all our means, our re-

               England that we intend to emerge from the

               intend to organize a system, so as to be pre- 
               <br />
               pared to do our part in the hour of danger ? 
               <br />
               We have every assurance that England will 
               <br />
               spend her last man, her last shilling, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dc</span>

               fending and protecting us. Having a Fed-

               eral union, all the wealth which abounds in 
               <br />

               why are there so man small states in

               <br />
               ing at Mexico, is so deeply interested in the 
               <br />
               affairs of this continent—would not join with 
               <br />
               England in a war between that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> andthe

               <br />
               of the St. Lawrence ? When a nation, strong 
               <br />
               in its rights, is determined to preserve them, 
               <br />
               it is often invincible. When <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Xnnxu,</span> with

               driven back with the total loss of his immense 
               <br />
               army ? When war was declared against the 
               <br />
               South, was not the North, with its population 
               <br />
               of twenty millions, going to annihilate the 
               <br />
               South in three months? It is now more 
               <br />
               than four years that the war has been raging, 
               <br />
               and the South, without friends, without allies, 
               <br />
               is not yet conquered and made to pass under 
               <br />
               the yoke. The history of Prussia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afords</span> a 
               <br />
               proof of what bravery can achieve, even when 
               <br />
               opposed to an enemy inﬁnitely superior in 
               <br />
               numbers. In 1740, "the youthful Prince 
               <br />
               FREDERIC ascended the Throne of Prussia. 
               <br />
               The country contained no more than 48,000 
               <br />
               square miles, and had a population of only 
               <br />
               two millions and a half, less than the popula- 
               <br />
               tion of Canada alone, as it now is. Her fron- 
               <br />
               tier northward was a wall of ice, all the sea- 
               <br />
               ports were closed during the winter season; 
               <br />
               her only ally was lukewarm ; to the east, west 
               <br />
               and south, she was bounded by werful em- 
               <br />
               pires, the pepulation of each 0 which alone 
               <br />
               far exceeded that which she could boast. 
               <br />
               The country was long and narrow; it was ﬂat 
               <br />
               and well adapted at all points for the move- 
               <br />
               ments of troops; no country could be more 
               <br />
               exposed to an invasion ; nevertheless the 
               <br />
