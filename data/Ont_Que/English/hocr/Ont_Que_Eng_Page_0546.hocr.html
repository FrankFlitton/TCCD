               England alone has more population and re-

               <br />
               parison. We are continually hearing of 
               <br />
               what Confederation is to do for ourselves, 
               <br />
               how it is going to make us a great power in 
               <br />
               the world. It is going to do nothing of the 
               <br />
               kind. But a ain—and here is a third ques- 
               <br />
               tion that in t is connection we have got to 
               <br />
               answer—how is the temper of the United 
               <br />
               States going to be aﬁ'ected, on the one hand, 
               <br />
               by the policy here urged on us, of what I 
               <br />
               may call hostile independent eﬂ'ort—eﬂ'ort 
               <br />
               made on our part, with the avowed object of 
               <br />
               setting ourselves up as a formidable power 
               <br />
               against them; or on the other hand, by a 
               <br />
               policy such as I have been urging, of un- 
               <br />
               obtrusive development of our institutions in 
               <br />
               connection with the British Empire? In 
               <br />
               which of the two cases are they likely to be 
               <br />
               the more amiable, or, (which is perhaps more 
               <br />
               to the point), the less aggressive or practically 
               <br />
               unamiable, as our neighbors? Besides, 
               <br />
               there comes up still another question. What 
               <br />
               is to be the attitude of Great Britain under 
               <br />
               either of these two suppositions? As I have 
               <br />
               said, the question is, ﬁrst, as to our own 
               <br />
               resources; next, as to the comparative re- 
               <br />
               sources of the United States; then, as to 
               <br />
               their attitude and temper towards us, upon 
               <br />
               one or other of these two suppositions; then, 
               <br />
               as to the attitude and temper of Great 
               <br />
               Britain, in reference to each of these suppo- 
               <br />
               sitions ; and lastly, as to the reaction (so to 
               <br />
               speak) upon ourselves, of these respective 
               <br />
               attitudes of the two countries in either case.
