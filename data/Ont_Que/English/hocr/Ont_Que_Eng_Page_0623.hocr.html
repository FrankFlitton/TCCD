               General for Lower Canada read us several 
               <br />
               passages from our history, to prove to us

               vented the annihilation of English domin-

               ation on this continent. But he did not

               country? At this period it was that an 
               <br />
               address was sent to the Canadians by the 
               <br />
               American Congress, calling upon them to 
               <br />
               unite with them in the insurrection against 
               <br />
               the Mother Country:—“Seize," said the 
               <br />
               Congress, “ seize the opportunity which 
               <br />
               Providence itself aﬂ'ords you; if you act 
               <br />
               in such way as to preserve your liberty, 
               <br />
               you will be effectually free.” Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               everyone knows the reply made by the 
               <br />
               Canadians to this appeal. Armies invaded 
               <br />
               our territory, and took possession of a 
               <br />
               part of the country. Quebec alone held 
               <br />
               out, thanks to a garrison composed in part 
               <br />
               of French-Canadians. And if we are now 
               <br />
               sheltered beneath the folds of the British 
               <br />
               ﬂag, it is to French-Canadians that we owe 
               <br />
               it, and it is them that England ought to thank. 
               <br />
               But if it is proposed now to thrust upon ns a 
               <br />
               political system, the sole object of which is 
               <br />
               to submerge us in a hostile majority, we have 
               <br />
               to thank the English for it—the English for 
               <br />
               whom our fathers saved the country in 1775. 
               <br />
               After the defeat of the Americans before 
               <br />
               Quebec, Congress did not lose courage. A 
               <br />
               second manifesto was despatched to Canada, 
               <br />
               promising fresh reinforcements; eminent 
               <br />
               men even came into the country; FRANKLIN, 
               <br />
               CHASE and CARROLL in vain solicited the 
               <br />
               Canadians to unite with them. Dr. CARROLL, 
               <br />
               who died in 1815 Bishop of Baltimore, was 
               <br />
               sent among the Canadian clergy with no bet- 
               <br />
               ter success, and all hope of obtaining posses- 
               <br />
               sion of this important colony had at last to 
               <br />
               be relinquished. These facts necessarily 
               <br />
               tended to enlighten public opinion, and Eng- 
               <br />
               land perceived that it would be better for her 
               <br />
               to comply with the just demands of the 
               <br />
               Canadian people, in order that reliance

               might be placed upon them in the day of
