               MR. BEAUBIEN—It is true that the 
               <br />
               actual vote by which that government was 
               <br />
               upset was given by us, because there was in 
               <br />
               that Government an excess of the element I 
               <br />
               have just referred to, and for other reasons; 
               <br />
               but it was that party that betrayed and 
               <br />
               spurned those who had enabled them to 
               <br />
               carry their elections. (Hear, hear.) Is 
               <br />
               that not the truth? Then, that persistent 
               <br />
               and constant opposition to everything, shows 
               <br />
               that the members of that party were inspired 
               <br />
               by passions, not to be found in the generality 
               <br />
               of men. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative</span> party has always 
               <br />
               opposed representation by p0pulation under 
               <br />
               the present union, because under this union 
               <br />
               we are face to face with the population of a 
               <br />
               country of which the products are different 
               <br />
               from ours, and of which the interests are 
               <br />
               not always identical with ours. This question 
               <br />
               was strongly agitated. The whole people of 
               <br />
               Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> resisted that demand, and 
               <br />
               the whole Conservative party ﬁrmly refused 
               <br />
               to consent to it, while the other party—the 
               <br />
               Opposition party—held out hopes to those 
               <br />
               who demanded that measure, and allied 
               <br />
               themselves with them. This is a statement, 
               <br />
               the truth of which cannot be denied, for 
               <br />
               documents proving the facts exist, and have 
               <br />
               been laid before this House and the country. 
               <br />
               This cause of dissension has always existed, 
               <br />
               and will always exist in Upper Canada, not 
               <br />
               because it is necessary to the support of 
               <br />
               such or such a party, but because it is the 
               <br />
               result of a provision of the Constitution, and 
               <br />
               because the interests of Upper Canada are 
               <br />
               not the same as ours. And if we do not 
               <br />
               eﬁ'eèt a settlement of this question now, 
               <br />
               these dissensions will, ere long, be renewed 
               <br />
               and the difﬁculties increased. Here is an 
               <br />
               opportunity of removing these difﬁculties by 
               <br />
               uniting ourselves with the Lower Provinces; 
               <br />
               and I think Lower Canada would do well 
               <br />
               not to lose the opportunity. Under Con- 
               <br />
               federation, the political parties into which 
               <br />
               the provinces will be divided will ﬁnd it 
               <br />
               necessary to form alliances, and our alliance 
               <br />
               will be courted by all, so that we shall in 
               <br />
               reality hold the balance of power. More- 
               <br />
               over, I am quite convinced that we have no 
               <br />
               grounds for fear in that respect. I have 
               <br />
               always remarked that material interests are 
               <br />
               of great weight in the formation of parties, 
               <br />
               and the conduct of the French-Canadians, 
               <br />
               with reference to their religious institutions, 
               <br />
               never inspired any uneasiness or distrust in 
               <br />
               our fellow-countrymen of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> origin 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> ours, when they found it their interest 
               <br />
               to form an alliance with us; and I am 
               <br />

               the hon. member for Lotbiniere has said in

               <br />
               sound sense and judgment of the people of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada will satisfy them that they 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd in the project which has been sub-

               <br />
               and for everything they hold dear, and that 
               <br />
               the measure will meet all their wants; and 
               <br />
               on the other hand, the sound sense and judg-

               <br />

               regards our being in a minority, are we not
