               had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> them during the Conference at

               which the resolutions in favor of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion were originated. It cannot be denied 
               <br />
               that when the Hon. Finance Minister and his 
               <br />
               colleagues agreed that $150,000 should be 
               <br />
               paid for the unoccupied lands in Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               they must have had some information before 
               <br />
               them as to the value of those lands, and whether 
               <br />
               they consisted of one acre or a million. There 
               <br />
               is no doubt that when they agreed upon what 
               <br />
               part of the public debt of Canada should 
               <br />
               form part of the debt of the Confederation, 
               <br />
               they had a statement laid before them upon 
               <br />
               which that agreement was based. If I re 
               <br />
               collect aright, I saw in the newspapers 9. state- 
               <br />
               ment that the Conference had adjourned for 
               <br />
               a day or two in order to allow the Finance 
               <br />
               Ministers of the several rovinces to make 
               <br />
               up and bring before the onference a state- 
               <br />
               ment respecting the debts and ﬁnancial po- 
               <br />
               sitions of the several provinces. Well, this 
               <br />
               is all we want to obtain. We want the same 
               <br />
               information that the honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               had before them when they agreed to those 
               <br />
               resolutions in conference. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We’do</span> not sup-

               pose that they went into the consideration of

               these matters without any information before 
               <br />
               them. We do not suppose that they merely

               guessed that the debt of Canada was 862, 
               <br />
               500,000, and guessed in the same way at 
               <br />
               the debts of the other rovinces. We want 
               <br />
               the same opportunity 0 understanding these

               an hour’s delay more than is absolutely 
               <br />
