               <br />
               been aggrieved or injured here.” Sir, if it had 
               <br />
               been possible for the Governor General to have 
               <br />
               given such an answer at that time to the angry

               <br />
               same position towards the British Crown that 
               <br />
               Scotland and Ireland stood in before they 
               <br />
               were legislatively united with England ; a some-

               <br />
               the one tie of fealty to the British Crown—a 
               <br />
               tie which in the cases, ﬁrst, of Scotland, and 
               <br />
               then of Ireland, was found, when the pinch 
               <br />
               came, to be no tie at all; which did not
