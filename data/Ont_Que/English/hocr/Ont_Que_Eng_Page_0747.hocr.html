               obstructing and delaying the debate on this 
               <br />
               scheme. (Hear, hear.) When I say that 
               <br />
               there is an intimate connection between these 
               <br />
               two questions of defence and Confederation, I 
               <br />
               mean this: that the progress of recent events 
               <br />
               —events which have occurred since the com- 
               <br />
               mencement of this debate—has increased the. 
               <br />
               necessity of immediate action, both with re-

               gard to defence and to this scheme. Honor-

               able gentlemen Opposite havebeen in the Gov-

               ernment—they have been behind thc scenes— 
               <br />
               and they know that the question of the de- 
               <br />
               fence of British North America is of great 
               <br />
               and pressing importance, and they know that 
               <br />
               the question of the defence of Canada cannot 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separated</span> from it. And honorable gentle-

               men avo been informed, and will ﬁnd by the 
               <br />
               scheme itself, that the subject was considered 
               <br />
               by the Conference, and that it was arranged 
               <br />
               that there should be one organized system 
               <br />

               <br />
               at the cost of the whole. Well, it is now of

               the greatest importance that some members

               this opposition is either one or the other of 
               <br />
               two things—it is either for the sake of party

               <br />
               that honorable gentlemen opposite entertain 
               <br />
               any wish to become connected with the

               neighboring republic, and therefore I am

               forced to the conviction that they are actuated 
               <br />
               by the miserable motive of gaining a little 
               <br />
               parliamentary or party success. There are 
               <br />

               HON. MR. HOLTON—I have the satis- 
               <br />
               faction of having provoked from the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman altogether the best speech he has 
               <br />
               delivered during this debate. So much I 
               <br />
               freely admit, and I think his own followers 
               <br />
               will confess that this is the ﬁrst time he has 
               <br />
               spoken with anything like his usual spirit 
               <br />
               and force during the whole debate. This 
               <br />
               was perhaps inevitable, because in his other 
               <br />
               speech, and notably in his introductory 
               <br />
               speech, he labored under the consciousness 
               <br />
               that the scheme was at variance with his 
               <br />
               own antecedents,and was not approved ot by 
               <br />
               anybody. We had, therefore, at that time 
               <br />
               none of that vivacity, none of that strength 
               <br />
               of deelamation, none of that humor with 
               <br />
               which his brief speech this evening has 
               <br />
               overﬂown. But, sii’, to return to the point 
               <br />
               to which I called your attention when you 
               <br />
               resumed the chair. To that point the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has not been pleased to speak. 
               <br />
               He has gone off on all sorts of subjects He 
               <br />
               has said he will not hold himself bound by 
               <br />
               the arrangements which he himself entered 
               <br />
               into at the opening of the debate. He 
               <br />
               says he does not consider himself so 
               <br />
               bound ; and I must be allowed to say a word 
               <br />
               or two in reference to his excuse for his de— 
               <br />
               parture from that agreement. He says that 
               <br />
               I and other hon. gentlemen on this side 
               <br />
               have been instrumental in wasting the time 
               <br />
               of the House. Emphatically I. deny that 
               <br />
               statement. (Hear, hear.) That we did re— 
               <br />
               sist the unfair attempts on the other side of 
               <br />
               the House to change the order of the debate
