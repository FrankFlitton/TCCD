               <br />
               Itated that the legislation of the Federal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3overnment</span> would merely go the length of

               present Ministers are not easily susceptible of 
               <br />
               alarm. But if we take the trouble of inter- 
               <br />
               preting that clause of the resolution in its 
               <br />
               true sense, it must be admitted that the legis- 
               <br />
               lation of the Federal Government on marriage 
               <br />
               and-divorce may'in many ways run counter 
               <br />
               to our sentiments as Catholics, since it may 
               <br />
               declare that marriage is nothing more than a 
               <br />
               civil contract, and that religious marriages 
               <br />
               contracted either by Protestants or Catholics, 
               <br />
               and not ratiﬁed by a magistrate, shall not be 
               <br />
               valid. Let us now see what will be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> 
               <br />
               of these provisions as regards our laws. The 
               <br />
               Honorable Attorney General for Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cana</span> 
               <br />
               ada gave us a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pomfpous</span> eulogy of our civil 
               <br />
               code; he went so ar as to state that it was 
               <br />
               inﬁnitely superior to the French code, and to 
               <br />
               any-code he was acquainted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with.</span> 'We are 
               <br />
               told'that our institutions and our civil laws 
               <br />
               will be fully protected, and that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span> 
               <br />
               Legislature can only legislate on the laws of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> other provinces, our civil law‘s being placed 
               <br />
               yond its reach. If this provision relating 
               <br />
               marriage and divorce be adopted, what will 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> on our civil <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laws?!</span> The Hon. Soli- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iitor</span> General for Lower Canada told us that the 
               <br />
               object of that resolution was to render valid 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throughout</span> the Confederation a marriage con- 
               <br />
               tracted in any one of the provinces. It seems 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lo</span> me very extraordinary, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pgentleman</span> in the position of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lier</span> for Dorchester, and who, in virtue of that 
               <br />
               ition, may aspire to a seat on the bench, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Find</span> who already enjoys precedence over the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of the Bar of Lower Canada, should 
               <br />
               ïtvince such deplorable ignorance of our civil 
               <br />
               law. In article 19, title 5 of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Civil</span> Code, 
               <br />
               relative to marriage, I ﬁnd the following :-“A 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lmariiage</span> celebrated out of Lower Canada be-

         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 95 5161 1474 5242">

               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 1504 644 2977 4681">

               <br />
               go there with the intention of evadingthe law." 
               <br />
               Thus, Mr. SPEAKER, since the marriage of a 
               <br />
               Lower Canadian contracted in another coun- 
               <br />
               try in accordance with its laws, is valid in this 
               <br />
               country, the explanation and interpretation 
               <br />
               given b the Honorable the Solicitor General, 
               <br />
               of the c ause relating to marriage and divorce, 
               <br />
               has no force whatsoever, and the clause may 
               <br />
               as well be struck out of the resolutions. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) If I rightly understand that clause, 
               <br />
               the l 'slaturc will have power to deal with a 
               <br />
               host <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Œimatters</span> relating to marriage; thus it 
               <br />
               may change that part of the civil code which 
               <br />
               deﬁnes the age at which a child may marry 
               <br />
               without the consent ol parents; it may alter 
               <br />
               the mode of contracting marriage, change the 
               <br />
               mutual rights and duties of married persons; 
               <br />
               it will also <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> power to modify our civil 
               <br />
               code in the matter of our obligations arising 
               <br />
               from marriage, in the matter of tutorship, 
               <br />
               paternal authority, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Etc.,</span> &amp;c., in fact in a mul— 
               <br />
               titude of its provisions. If that be the great: 
               <br />
               protection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afforded</span> by the new Constitution to 
               <br />
               our laws, to our religious and civil institutions, 
               <br />
               there is every reason to fear that they may one 
               <br />
               day receive a fatal blow. I will now call tho 
               <br />
               attention of the House, and particularly of the 
               <br />
               French-Canadian members, to the forty-sixth 
               <br />
               resolution, which relates to the use of the 
               <br />
               French language in the Federal Legislature. 
               <br />
               It is as follows 2—“ The English and French 
               <br />
               languages may be used simultaneously in 
               <br />
               the proceedings of the Federal Legislature 
               <br />
               as well as in the islature of Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and also in the Federal courts and in 
               <br />
               the courts of Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.”</span> 
               <br />
               examination of this resolution shews at once 
               <br />
               that it does not declare that the French 
               <br />
               language is to be on the same footing as the 
               <br />
               English language in the Federal and Local Le- 
               <br />
               gislatures; in place of the word “ shall,” which 
               <br />
               ought to have been inserted in the resolution, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               the word used is “ may,” so that if the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish majority decide that the Votes and Pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings and Bills of the House shall be 
               <br />
               printed only in English, nothing can prevent 
               <br />
               the en'aotment taking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁect.</span> Of course we 
               <br />
               shall be allowed to use the French language 
               <br />
               in debate, but on the other hand, it is evi-
