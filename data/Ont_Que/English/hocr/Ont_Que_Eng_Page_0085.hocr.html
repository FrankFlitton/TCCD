               From these returns it would appear that the

               an outlay of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$884,613;</span> Newfoundland, with a

               <br />

               <br />
               are such that they will enter the Con <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feder-</span>

               <br />
               inferior to that of Canada. If an objection

               regard to its ﬁnancial position, it would be
