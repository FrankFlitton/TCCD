               to get a subsistence. (Laughter.) Yet were 
               <br />
               these states poor ? Had they no resources 
               <br />
               from their trade and manufactures ? If they 
               <br />
               did not produce wealth in one way they cer-

               tainly did in others, and so it was with New 
               <br />
               Brunswick. If it did not produce wheat, it 
               <br />
               produced timber in immense quantities. It 
               <br />

               <br />
               a source of great wealth. Some honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen would perhaps remember what an 
               <br />
               eminent man from Nova Scotia—the Hon. 
               <br />
               JOSEPH HOWE—had said at a dinner in this’ 
               <br />
               country in 1850, that he knew of a small 
               <br />
               granite rock upon which, at a single haul of 
               <br />
               the net, the ﬁshermen had taken 500 barrels 
               <br />
               of mackerel. That was a great haul no 
               <br />
               doubt—(laughter)—but the honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               man had not given the size of the barrels. 
               <br />
               Lau hter.) Still no one could deny that the

            </p>

               ulf rovinces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were,of</span> immense importance, 
               <br />
               if only in respect of their ﬁsheries. Then 
               <br />
               they were rich in minerals. Their coal alone 
               <br />
               was an element of great wealth. It had been 
               <br />
               said that where coal was found the country was 
               <br />
               of more value than gold. Look at England, 
               <br />
               and what was the chief source of her 
               <br />
               wealth if not coal? Deprived of coal, she 
               <br />
               would at once sinkto the rank of a second or 
               <br />
               third rate power. But Canada had no coal, 
               <br />
               and notwithstanding all her other elements 
               <br />
               of greatness, she required that mineral in 
               <br />
               order to give her completeness. What 
               <br />
               she had not, the Lower Provinces had; 
               <br />
               and what they had not, Canada had. 
               <br />
               Then as to ship-building, it was an industry 
               <br />
               prosecuted with great vigor and success in

               were not beggars, nor did they wish to come 
               <br />

               provinces, able to keep up their credit, and 
               <br />

               not be surpassed anywhere ; in fact he believed

               they were unequalled in the world. He would

               <br />

               <br />
               by the compass, and of an extent suﬁcient to 
               <br />

               cations erected at the mouth, and the entrance

               <br />
               ﬂeet could ever get through. He did not 
               <br />
               suppose the ﬂeets of England would ever need 
               <br />
               to take refuge there—(hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bar)—although</span> 
               <br />
               it had been loudly alleged that they couldbe

               blown out of the water in an incredibly short 
               <br />
               space of time—(laughter)——but it might afford 
               <br />
               shelter to isolated vessels, in case they were 
               <br />
               hard pushed by superior numbers. Well, - 
               <br />
               under the union, Canada would become a 
               <br />
               partner in these advantages, and with the 
               <br />
               harbours of Halifax and Quebec, they might 
               <br />
               well feel proud of their country. On the _ 
               <br />
               whole, he thought that the Confederation of 
               <br />
               all the Provinces had become an absolute 
               <br />
               necessity, and that it was for us a question of 
               <br />
               to be or not to be. If we desired to remain 
               <br />
               British and monarchical, and if we desired to, 
               <br />
               pass to our children these advantages, this 
               <br />
               measure, he repeated, was a necessity. But 
               <br />
               there were other motives and other reasons 
               <br />
               which should induce us to agree to the scheme. 
               <br />
               Every honorable gentleman in the House knew 
               <br />
               the political position of the country, and were 
               <br />
               acquainted with the feelings of irritation which 
               <br />
               have prevailed for many years. They knew it 
               <br />
               happily not by their experiencein this House, 
               <br />
               but by the tone of the public press, and by the 
               <br />
               discussions in another place where taunts and 
               <br />
               menaces were freely ﬂung across the ﬂoor by 
               <br />
               contending parties. They knew what human 
               <br />
               passions were, and how, when bitter feelings 
               <br />
               continued for along time, the distance between 
               <br />
               exasperation and actual conﬂict was not very 
               <br />
               great. They had now before their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eyes</span> 
               <br />
               an example of the etfects of such disagreements. 
               <br />
               It was persistently believed by many that the 
               <br />
               rival interests would never come to a rupture, 
               <br />
               but for three years they had been waging a 
               <br />
               conﬂict which had desolated and ruined the 
               <br />
               fairest portion of the country, and in the course 
               <br />
               of which acts of barbarity had been committed 
               <br />
               which were only equalled by the darkest ages. 
               <br />
               We in Canada were not more perfect, and the 
               <br />
               time had arrived when, as he believed, all the 
               <br />
               patriotic men in the country ought to unite in 
               <br />
