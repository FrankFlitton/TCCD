               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I say that the people of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada are alarmed at the scheme 
               <br />
               of Confederation, and the unknown changes 
               <br />
               which are on foot. I do not say that this

               feeling prevails in the district of Quebec, 
               <br />

               <br />
               manner, and peeple would be greatly in

               at the expense proposed to be made to

               organize what is called the defences of the

               country, and naturally ask each other whe-

               ther it is right to call upon them to bear a

               <br />
               shedding their blood and paying their 
               <br />
               money. They ask, moreover, whether it 
               <br />
               would not be better to remain in our present 
               <br />
               condition—whether it would not be better, 
               <br />
               even, to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smaller</span> than to seek greatness— 
               <br />
               to try to compete with our neighbors in 
               <br />
               order that we may be the sooner crushed. 
               <br />
               They say, moreover, that a struggle between

               us and the United States would be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strut:-</span>

               the Crimean war, it will be very evident,

               English troops? It would not be nineteen 
               <br />
               men to a mile. (Hear, hear.) No, we are 
               <br />
               not to imagine that a war with the United 
               <br />

               <br />
               that a company of 60 men would put the

               <br />

               the resources of the country inexhaustible. 
               <br />
               In four years they have built 600 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vessels</span> of 
               <br />
               war; and the number of their soldiers is told 
               <br />
               by hundreds of thousands. Now, peace will 
               <br />
               be made between the North and South, 
               <br />
               although it may happen not to please our 
               <br />
               politicians, who are friends to slavery, and 
               <br />
               have always despised and depreciated the 
               <br />

               <br />

               and stronger than ever in the affections of

               adopted exactly the same system when they 
               <br />
