               <br />
               here, then, is the reason why Federal union

               <br />

               <br />
               “In this last order of things the increase 
               <br />

               placed me in a position to rule Lower Canada

               <br />
               in spite of my former declarations.” Either 
               <br />
               he must think us very blind, or else he 
               <br />
               must expect that placing the question in

               Be kind enough to observe, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               that under the old system, the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council possessed the same elements of 
               <br />
               existence as the House of Lords, and that 
               <br />
               the Crown could increase its numbers at 
               <br />
               need; it augmented it in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1849,</span> as it threat-

               ened to augment the House of Lords in 
               <br />
               1832. Observe, again, that it is precisely 
               <br />
               this control exercised by the Crown over 
               <br />

               But there is a more rational manner of 
               <br />
               appreciating the part sustained by the House 
               <br />
               of Lords in the British Constitution. No 
               <br />

               <br />
               right of increasing at will the House of 
               <br />
               Lords; but such right has never been exer- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cised</span> but for the purpose of rewarding men

               <br />
               the representative body of the great landed 
               <br />
               nobility, it was because the country was

               were wounded by the electoral system of England, 
               <br />
               when such a rock, such a building, such a hamlet 
               <br />
               belonging to noble families sent representatives 
               <br />
               to Parliament, where cities of 100,000 inhabi- 
               <br />
               tants were not represented, where corporations 
               <br />
