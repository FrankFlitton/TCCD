               cil his cherished measure, I shall leave to 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman himself the task of 
               <br />
               answering. We heard him declare in this

               representation based upon population, and

               that that gentleman having refused to

               East, who gave him all he asked. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, there is some— 
               <br />
               thing still more important than that. A 
               <br />
               few days ago, the Hon. President of the 
               <br />
               COuncil, addressing the hon. members for 
               <br />
               Hochelaga and Chateauguay, said, “I had 
               <br />
               long considered that you were the best 
               <br />
               friends ofUpper Canada, but I can see today 
               <br />
               that your are not, and that our real friends 
               <br />
               are the Hon. Attorney <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> for Lower 
               <br />
               Canada and his Lower Canada colleagues.” 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) After havin granted the favor- 
               <br />
               ite measure of the great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Clear</span> Grit chief, the 
               <br />
               Lower Canada delegates doubtless considered 
               <br />
               that that was not suﬁcient, since they also 
               <br />
               made another important concession to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada and to the Protestants of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, by vesting in the Federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment the power of legislating on marriage 
               <br />
               and divorce—(hear, hear)—-two questions 
               <br />
               upon which the French-Canadians were 
               <br />
               united by the bonds of a common faith, and 
               <br />
               on which they could not tolerate any discus- 
               <br />
               sion ; and the Ministers, therefore, ought 
               <br />
               not to have made those concessions, which 
               <br />
               are utterly opposed to the religious doctrines 
               <br />
               they themselves profess. I say that power 
               <br />
               has been given to the Federal Government 
               <br />
               to legislate on divorce and to legalize it, and 
               <br />
               I am not mistaken in saying it, for the 
               <br />
               principle is adopted by the fact or giving to 
               <br />
               the Federal Legislature the right of legislat- 
               <br />
               ing on this question. This power ought to 
               <br />
               have been granted to the It cal legislatures, 
               <br />
               and not to the Federal Legislature, as has 
               <br />
               been done; and l shall prove it in this way:

               for Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LANGEVIN)</span> 
               <br />
               told us, that as regards Lower Canada, there 
               <br />
               was no necessity for granting to its legisla-

               <br />
               because, said he, “ the religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anthoritia</span> 
               <br />
               are recognized; but it was necessary and 
               <br />
               proper to grant that power to Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada”</span> 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Now,'I ask, if Lower Canada 
               <br />
               did not require that power of legislating, 
               <br />
               why has it been given to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Faleral</span> Legis- 
               <br />
               lature, which will be composed in great 
               <br />
               majority of Protestants, who do not hold the 
               <br />
               same opinion that we do on these questions, 
               <br />
               when it is evident that that Legislature will 
               <br />
               probably grant bills of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dim</span> ree to all persons 
               <br />
               who apply for them, without considering 
               <br />
               whether the parties are Catholics or Pro- 
               <br />
               testants? If divorce is condemned by the 
               <br />
               Catholic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religion,</span> I maintain that it is 
               <br />
               wrong to grant that power to a Legislature 
               <br />
               which will be composed in great part of 
               <br />
               Protestant members, ready to legislate on 
               <br />
               divorce, and to grant divorces to those who 
               <br />
               bring forward what they may consider 
               <br />
               reasonable grounds, sufﬁcient to entitle them 
               <br />
               to obtain divorce, without considering 
               <br />
               whether the religious faith of the parties 
               <br />
               permits or does not permit divorce. If 
               <br />
               divorce be condemned by the Catholic Church 
               <br />
               —--and all the world knows that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,-is</span> so 
               <br />
               condemned in the most formal manner-the 
               <br />
               power of the Legislature in this matter ought 
               <br />
               to have been restricted, and not made general, 
               <br />
               as it is proposed to make it in the scheme of 
               <br />
               Con federation submitted to us. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKIB,</span> 
               <br />
               I have shown, I think, that Lower Canada 
               <br />
               has gained nothing, but that she has con- 
               <br />
               ceded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everything</span> in this compromise ; true, 
               <br />
               in order to cover these guilty concessions, 
               <br />
               we are told, “But the protection of our 
               <br />
               institutions and the maintenance of our laws 
               <br />
               are fully and amply guaranteed to us by the 
               <br />
               new Constitution.” In the ﬁrst place. under 
               <br />
               the Confederation , our institutions will not be 
               <br />
               protected—as it has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vainly‘been</span> attempted to 
               <br />
               demonstrate they will ; but, even though 
               <br />
               it were the case, does not the Constitution 
               <br />
               under which we now live <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span> us inﬁnitely 
               <br />
               better guarantees for all our dearest liberties? 
               <br />
               Let us examine. for a moment, what species 
               <br />
               of guarantee we have under tne present 
               <br />
               system, and what guarantees we shall have 
               <br />
               under the Federal system The guarantee 
               <br />
               which the Frennh—Canadians have under the
