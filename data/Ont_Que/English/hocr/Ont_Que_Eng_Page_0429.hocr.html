               Lower Canada—and l call the attention of 
               <br />
               my hon. friends from Upper Canada to the 
               <br />
               fact—that there has been any excitement, or 
               <br />
               movement, or agitation on the part of the 
               <br />
               English Protestant population of Lower Ca- 
               <br />
               nada in reference to the common school 
               <br />
               question. (Hear, hear.) It is the ﬁrst time 
               <br />
               in the history of the country that there has 
               <br />
               been any serious apprehension aroused 
               <br />
               amongst them regarding the elementary edu- 
               <br />
               cation‘ of their children. I am not aware 
               <br />
               that there has ever been any attempt in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada to deprive the minority of 
               <br />
               their just rights in respect to the education 
               <br />
               of their youth. I do not state this simply 
               <br />
               as my own Opinion, or as the result of obser- 
               <br />
               vations which I have made alone. I‘ have 
               <br />
               received letters from those who have been 
               <br />
               cognizant of the educational system in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada for many years, conﬁrmatory of this 
               <br />
               in the strongest degree. It was also observ- 
               <br />
               ed and'commented upon by the three com- 
               <br />
               missioners who came out from England to 
               <br />
               this country in 1837, and who in their re- 
               <br />
               port said it was one of the most remarkable 
               <br />
               circumstances that came under their notice, 
               <br />
               that they found two races, speaking dilferent 
               <br />
               languages and holding different religions 
               <br />
               opinions, living together in harmony, and 
               <br />
               having no diﬂ'erence or ill-feeling in respect 
               <br />
               to the education of their children. N ow we, 
               <br />
               the English Protestant minority of Lowe 
               <br />
               Canada, cannot forget that whatever right of 
               <br />
               separate education we have was accorded to 
               <br />
               us in the most unrestricted way before the 
               <br />
               union of the provinces, when we were in a 
               <br />
               minority and entirely in the hands of the 
               <br />
               French population. We cannot forget that 
               <br />
               in no way was there any attempt to prevent 
               <br />
               us educating our children in the manner we 
               <br />
               saw ﬁt and deemed best; and I would be 
               <br />
               untrue to what is just if I forgot to state that 
               <br />
               the distribution of State funds for educational 
               <br />
               purposes was made in such a way as to cause 
               <br />
               no complaint on the part of the minority. 
               <br />
               I believe we have always had our .fair 
               <br />
               share of the public grants in so far as the 
               <br />
               French element could control them, and not 
               <br />
               only the liberty, but every facility, for the 
               <br />
               establishment of separate dissentient schools 
               <br />
               wherever they were deemed desirable. A 
               <br />
               single person has the right, under the law, 
               <br />
               of establishing a dissenticnt school and 
               <br />
               obtaining a fair share of the educational 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span> forget that in the past this liberality

               desired of the French majority in respect to 
               <br />
               education, they were, if it was at all reason- 
               <br />
               able, willing to concede. (Hear, hear.) We

               have thus, in this also, the guarantee of the

               <br />
               everything we desire will be as freely given 
               <br />

               <br />
               from whence comes the practical diﬁculty of 
               <br />
               dealing with the uestion at the present mo- 
               <br />
               ment? We shou d not forget that it does 
               <br />
               not come from our French-Canadian brethren 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada, but that it arises in this 
               <br />
               way—and I speak as one who has watched 
               <br />
               the course of events and the opinion of 
               <br />
               the country upOn the subject—that the 
               <br />
               Protestant majority in Upper Canada are 
               <br />
               indisposed to disturb the settlement made 
               <br />
               a couple of years ago, with regard to 
               <br />
               separate schools, and rather to hope that the ' 
               <br />
               French majority in Lower Canada should 
               <br />
               concede to the English Protestant minority 
               <br />
               there, nothing more than is given to the 
               <br />
               minority in the other section of the province. 
               <br />
               But still it must be conceded that there are 
               <br />
               certain points where the present educational 
               <br />
               system demands modification—points in 
               <br />
               which the English Protestant minority of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada expect a modiﬁcation. I 
               <br />
               would ask my honorable friend the Attorney 
               <br />
               General East, whether the system of educa- 
               <br />
               tion which is in farce in Lower Canada at 
               <br />
               the time of the proclamation is to remain and 
               <br />
               be the system of education for all time to 
               <br />
               come; and that whatever rights are given 
               <br />
               to either of the religious sections shall con- 
               <br />
               tinue to be guaranteed to them? We are 
               <br />
               called upon to vote for the resolutions in 
               <br />
               ignorance, to some extent, of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantees</span> 
               <br />
               to be given by subsequent legislation, and 
               <br />
               therefore my honorable friend will not take 
               <br />
               it amiss if I point out to him where the 
               <br />
               Protestant minority desire a change, with a 
               <br />
               view of ascertaining how far the Government 
               <br />
               is disposed to meet their views by coming 
               <br />
               down with a measure in which they may be 
               <br />
               embodied. The first thing I wish to men- 
               <br />
               tion has caused a good deal of diﬁiculty in 
               <br />
               our present system, and that is, whether 
               <br />
               non-resident preprietors shall have the same 
               <br />
               right of designating the class of schools to 
               <br />
               which their taxes shall be given as actual 
               <br />
               residents. That is one int-— whether a
