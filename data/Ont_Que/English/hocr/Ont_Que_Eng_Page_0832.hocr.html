               Mn. J ON ES-—-The way in which I look at 
               <br />
               this question does not at all depend on 
               <br />
               whether this hon. gentleman or that hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman may he at the head of affairs in this 
               <br />
               country; or whether we may have a 
               <br />
               Coalition Government or a pnrely party 
               <br />
               Government ; but I consider we should look 
               <br />
               at the sheme on its own merits, and deal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with-it</span> as a whole, giving a fair and square 
               <br />
               vote on the resolutions as a whole. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I think, therefore, that the course 
               <br />
               which has been taken by the Government to 
               <br />
               obtain such a vote is the wise and honest 
               <br />
               course. (Hear, hear.) I think they deserve 
               <br />
               credit for the step they have taken with a 
               <br />
               view to bringing this debate to a close. We 
               <br />
               have been debating this question day after 
               <br />
               day for a number of weeks, and I must say 
               <br />
               that the opposition given by hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men on the 'other side has been of a very 
               <br />
               factions character; time after time they 
               <br />
               have risen to make motions on this, that, 
               <br />
               and the other thing, keeping the House 
               <br />
               from addressing itself to the matter really 
               <br />
               under debate, and protraeting unnecessarily 
               <br />
               the decision of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quistion.</span> Only the night 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> last, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> an hon. gentleman had 
               <br />
               risen for the purpose of addressing the 
               <br />
               House, they cried out that it was too late, 
               <br />
               and called for an adjourment of the debate ; 
               <br />
               and yet, when that was agreed to, they 
               <br />
               wasted two or three hours in moving addi- 
               <br />
               tions to that motion for adjournment. This 
               <br />
               was done, too, by iron. gentlemen who were 
               <br />
               well conversant with the rules of this House, 
               <br />
               and who must have known that these motions 
               <br />
               were not in order. At midnight they were 
               <br />
               too tired to allow the debate to go on, and 
               <br />
               yet they kept the House sitting after that 
               <br />
               till three in the morning, discussing 
               <br />
               mere points of order. (Hear, hear.) Th. t 
               <br />
               has been the course pursued by hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite. And what, on the other hand, 
               <br />
               has been the course <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pursued,</span> by the Admin- 
               <br />
               istration ? Did they not put a motion on the

               notice paper—a motion which the factiousuess 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ef'lton.</span> gentlemen opposite prevented from 
               <br />
               being put to the vote—to give further time

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the discussion of this question, by resolv-

               half-past seven, it should be taken. up at

               three, the whole time of the House being

               cry out that they are gagged. Even after 
               <br />
               the House began to discuss the question at

               to see if something might not turn up against 
               <br />
               the scheme. Now, at last, they have got 
               <br />
               something. Something has turned up in

               <br />
               what that has to do with the question before 
               <br />
               us. It is now submitted in a practical form 
               <br />
               for our decision, and what we have to do 
               <br />
               is to give a square vote, yea or nay, that we 
               <br />
               are in favor ot this Confederation, or that we 
               <br />
               are against it. Our circumstances have 
               <br />
               changed within the last few years ; but it is 
               <br />
               noton thataccount merely that I now support 
               <br />
               this union. I have always, upon every occa-

               sion, on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hustings,</span> at public meetings 
               <br />
               and elsewhere, advocated a union of the 
               <br />
               British North American Provinces ; and 
               <br />
               were our relations with the United States in 
               <br />
               the same favorable form that existed some 
               <br />
               ﬁve or six years since, I would still give my 
               <br />
               support to a union. It is, therefore, sir, not 
               <br />
               because I think there is .a great present 
               <br />
               necessity for the scheme being brought to a 
               <br />
               speedy conclusion that I new support it. 
               <br />
               That present necessity, however, now exists, 
               <br />
               and I do not see why other hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               after a lapse of ﬁve or six years, when times 
               <br />
               have changed, and a greater urgency has 
               <br />
               arisen for such a union, should not be allowed 
               <br />
               to change their minds. "‘ Wise men change

               (Hear, hear.) Shortly before the meeting 
               <br />
               of this House, I advertised that I would 
               <br />
               hold a series of' meetings in the riding of 
               <br />
               South Leeds, for the purpose of placing my 
               <br />
               views upon this question before my consti-

               tuents, and to see whether their views 
               <br />
               accorded with my own; men of all shades 
               <br />
               of politics were requested to attend these 
               <br />
               meetings, and they were very numerous-1y 
               <br />
               and respectably attended, not only by these 
               <br />
               who supported me, but also by those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who,</span> 
               <br />
               were my most bitter opponents at the last
