               by the representations that were made to the 
               <br />
               representatives of the Lower Provinces, they 
               <br />
               abandoned their project of meeting together 
               <br />
               for the purpose of consolidating their govern—

               <br />
               Federal union of a the provinces. I believe, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, that if the inducements 
               <br />
               held out to the delegates convened at Char- 
               <br />
               lottetown to abandon their ﬁrst scheme were 
               <br />
               fully known, it would be found that chief 
               <br />
               among them was the construction of the In- 
               <br />
               tercolonial Railway. It strikes me very for- 
               <br />
               cibly from all that I heard in the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces during a recent tour, that if there 
               <br />
               was one thing more than another to which 
               <br />
               the ple gave prominence, it was the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway. Now, with reference to this 
               <br />
               subject, the plan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ëevionsl</span> adopted was, that 
               <br />
               Canada was to rnish twelfths of the 
               <br />
               money, and the Maritime Provinces seven- 
               <br />
               twelfths. It a by the resolutions laid 
               <br />
               on the table o this House, that if the Con— 
               <br />
               federation scheme is carried out, the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway is to be built. I admit it is 
               <br />
               a matter of necessity that it should be built 
               <br />
               in that case. There is no doubt about it. 
               <br />
               We cannot have union without it. But the 
               <br />
               fact does exist, that instead of Canada con- 
               <br />
               tributing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁve-twdfths</span> of the cost of construc- 
               <br />
               tion, it will be called upon to contribute 
               <br />
               about ten-twelfths. (Hear, hear.) I merely 
               <br />
               mention the fact to show that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appear;</span> to 
               <br />
               me that some strong inducement must have 
               <br />
               been held out to the delegates from the Low- 
               <br />
               er <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> to enter into this t scheme, 
               <br />
               when we ﬁnd, as it 'm very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">women,</span> that 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial Railway has been one of those 
               <br />
               objects that has been ﬁrst and foremost in 
               <br />
               the mindsofthepeopleofalmostallthe 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces. It would open up for 
               <br />
               them a vast section of new country, and the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts to be derived would certainly be par- 
               <br />
               amount tothem above any ' Canada could 
               <br />
               derive from its construction. t is therefore 
               <br />
               evident to my mind that this inducement has 
               <br />
               been held out in order to induce those prov— 
               <br />
               inœs to come into the proposed union. Again, 
               <br />

               measures in the interests of the rovince of 
               <br />
               Canada was concerned in this Convention. 
               <br />
               For if they voted by provinces, the little 
               <br />
               Island of Prince Edward, and Newfoundland,

               nada. ow, honorable gentlemen, when we 
               <br />
               consider the position of Canada, our resources, 
               <br />
               and the amount that this province will bring 
               <br />
               into the common treasury, it does appear to 
               <br />
               me that Canada was not equitably represented 
               <br />
               in the Convention. I would not for one mo- 
               <br />
               ment attribute to the delegates from Canada 
               <br />
               neglect of their duty in any particular, but 
               <br />
               when there became a necessity that certain 
               <br />
               arrangements were to be made with the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, then I can understand that if they 
               <br />
               were more favorable to the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               than to Canada, the vote would preponderate 
               <br />
               in favor of the former. There is another

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               int, honorable gentlemen, to which I would 
               <br />
               ike to draw your attention, namely, the in- 
               <br />
               crease of the expense of government under 
               <br />
               the new arrangement. It does appear to me, 
               <br />
               that if the scheme is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adopwd,</span> it will nwes— 
               <br />
               sarily increase the burdens of the people, and, 
               <br />
               I believe that we will be obliged to resort to 
               <br />
               direct taxation to sustain the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments. It a pears to me impossible to have 
               <br />
               so many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">locargovernments,</span> and, also, a Gene- 
               <br />
               ral Government, without greatly adding tothe 
               <br />
               expense. There is yet another point on which 
               <br />
               I feel more deeply than on any of the preced- 
               <br />
               ing. It places Lower Canada in a false <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(posh</span> 
               <br />
               tion. The Anglo-Saxon race of Lower ana- 
               <br />
               da is nearly one-fourth of the population, and 
               <br />
               in the Local Government the will be com— 
               <br />
               pletely under the control o the people of 
               <br />
               French origin; not that I believe but that the 
               <br />
               latter would endeavor to give all their just 
               <br />
               due, but still it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">does</span> appear to me that it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">places</span> the people of Anglo-Saxon origin in a 
               <br />
               alse position. Then the French pulation 
               <br />
               in the Federal Government is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lacegoin</span> a false

               position, for there they will be rn a very small 
               <br />
               minority—in the same position, relatively, as 
               <br />
               the Anglo-Saxon race in the Local Govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               dressed the House so very ably and eloquent-

               it was rather than risk any alteration. It has 
               <br />
               also been said by honorable tlemen of the 
               <br />
