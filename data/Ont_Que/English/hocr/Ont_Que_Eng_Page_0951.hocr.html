               Mr. SPEAKER, I am glad to ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               I am not the only man resident in the 
               <br />
               South Riding of Wentworth who questions 
               <br />
               in a very slight degree the honesty of 
               <br />
               purpose of some members of the Govern-

               <br />
               kind, whilc, at the same time, refusing to 
               <br />
               give the House that information by which it 
               <br />
               ought to be accompanied. My correspondent 
               <br />
               goes on to say :—

               I do not believe there is so much patriotism as 
               <br />
               is pretended amoncr the advocates, or at least the 
               <br />
               parents of the sc eme. I fear they see in it a

               nice arran <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cement</span> by which they can extend their

               urrylng the resolutions through the House with- 
               <br />
               out giving the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> to consider them; 
               <br />
               their great reluctance to give information on the 
               <br />
               subject, and some other things, lead me to doubt 
               <br />
               whether they are actuated solely by patriotic mo- 
               <br />
               tives. I should not have been so uncharitable as 
               <br />
               to doubt their sincerity, had not their conduct on 
               <br />
               former occasions been characterized by a lack of 
               <br />
               that quality. 
               <br />
               And I must say, Mr. SPEAKER, that to a 
               <br />
               certain extent I entertain the same opinion. 
               <br />
               I do not propose to go over the whole ground 
               <br />
               in discussing this scheme. _I do not feel 
               <br />
               competent to that task. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> But since this 
               <br />
               debate commenced, I have listened carefully 
               <br />
               to almost every speech that has been made, 
               <br />
               with the view of receiving that light which 
               <br />
               would qualify me to give a vote satisfactory 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mﬁelf</span> and to my constituents. And I 
               <br />
               have come to the conclusion that taking this 
               <br />
               scheme all in all, I am not in a position to 
               <br />
               approve of it. (Hear, hear.) The refusal 
               <br />
               on the part of the Government to submit it 
               <br />
               to the people of this country, who have the 
               <br />
               deepest interest in it, proves conclusively to 
               <br />
               me that there is something in it which they 
               <br />
               do not wish the people to know. ’l‘heir 
               <br />
               refusal, also, to give the fullest information 
               <br />
               on a matter of such importance, imparts to 
               <br />
               me a suspicion, that to use a homely but 
               <br />
               expressive phrase, “ there’s a nigger in the 
               <br />
               fence.” (Laughter.) It has been contended 
               <br />
               that with a view to our security, it was ne- 
               <br />
               cessary to combine our strength. Now the 
               <br />
               strength, in my humble judgment, which we 
               <br />
               would obtain by consummating this union, is 
               <br />
               just that kind of strength which a ﬁshing rod 
               <br />
               would obtain by fastening to it some ad- 
               <br />
               ditional joints. (Hear, hear.) If you can,

               But, under our actual circumstances, you 
               <br />

               <br />
               must allude to one matter, which is to- 
               <br />
               bring upon us almost unlimited and un- 
               <br />
               known expenses, if this union is consum- 
               <br />
               mated. To undertake the construction of

               the Intercolonial Railroad is, in my judg— 
               <br />
               ment, to start upon a career of extravagance 
               <br />
               which will swampthis young country. As 
               <br />
               one of the agriculturists of Canada, and 
               <br />
               speaking in their name, I beg to assure the 
               <br />
               House—if it needs any assurance on a point 
               <br />
               so palpable—that the agriculturists of Canada 
               <br />
               are not in a very ﬂourishing condition. The 
               <br />
               failure of the crops, with low prices, and 
               <br />
               the heavy burdens they have hitherto borne, 
               <br />
               have left them in a bad position to bear 
               <br />
               increased burdens. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               balance-sheet of our public ﬁnancial oper- 
               <br />
               ations, I think,should be a warning to every 
               <br />
               one of us, that no uncalled-for or unnecessary 
               <br />
               expense should be entered upon, but that 
               <br />
               our means should be economised, and that a 
               <br />
               balance should, if possible, be shewn in our 
               <br />
               favor for the ﬁrst time in ten years. We 
               <br />
               also see many of our business men at present 
               <br />
               rushing into the bankrupt courts. I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               no fewer than 905 insolvent notices in the 
               <br />
               Canada Gazette, from the lat September to 
               <br />
               the 24th December laSt. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Ms. A. MACKENZIE—But did all these 
               <br />
               become bankrupts during the year? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               Mn. RYMAL—I cannot say. They at all 
               <br />
               events gave the notice during the year. And 
               <br />
               I believe the misfortunes which have befal- 
               <br />
               len these men will, in each case, aﬂ'ect at least 
               <br />
               half a dozen, making an aggregate of 5,000. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I am satisﬁed, therefore, 
               <br />
               that this is not the pr0per time for these 
               <br />
               increased burdens being thrown upon the 
               <br />
               people of Canada. I think hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               must agree with me, that we have lived as 
               <br />
               it were too fast, that we have gone beyond 
               <br />
               our means, and that we are reaping now the 
               <br />
               bitter fruits of this in the heavy debt which 
               <br />
               we at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> bear. Without enlarging upon 
               <br />
               the reasons why I feel it my duty to oppose 
               <br />
               this measure, I may mention some half
