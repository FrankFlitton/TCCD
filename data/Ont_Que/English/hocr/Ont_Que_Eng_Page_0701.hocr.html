               <br />
               at which the hon. member arrived in 1858, 
               <br />
               after a careful examination of the whole 
               <br />
               question. In 1865, matters are completely 
               <br />
               changed, and the hon. member has discover- 
               <br />
               ed that the only possible safety for Lower 
               <br />

               <br />
               federation of all the provinces which he 
               <br />
               rejected with all his might. in 1858. This 
               <br />
               is the conclusion at which he arrived in his 
               <br />
               latest pamphlet. “After having carefully 
               <br />
               considered the various schemes of union 
               <br />
               with their various conditions of existence we, 
               <br />
               have proved that Confederation was, in our 
               <br />
               present circumstances, the system best calcu—

               ated for our protection and for securing our 
               <br />
               prosperity in the future.” The hon. member 
               <br />
               or Montmorency explains this complete 
               <br />

               changed his opinions of 1858. I ﬁnd in the

               from 1858. The honorable member was
