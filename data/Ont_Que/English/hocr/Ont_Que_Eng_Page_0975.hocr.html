               <br />
               and knowing as I do, Mr. SPEAKER, the great 
               <br />
               desire that is felt by the honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the Treasury benches, and also, I am ready

               to admit, by the large majority of the honor- 
               <br />
               able members of this House, that discussion 
               <br />
               should not be continued unnecessarily, and 
               <br />
               that no obstructions should be thrown in the 
               <br />
               way of an immediate decision on the question 
               <br />
               before us, I beg to state that it is not from 
               <br />
               choice but from necessity, that it is not from 
               <br />
               any desire of self-gratiﬁcation, but from a deep 
               <br />
               sense of duty, that I rise to say a single word 
               <br />
               upon this occasion, particularly as so much 
               <br />
               has been said, and as the night is now so far 
               <br />
               advanced. I hope, therefore, that as I have 
               <br />
               remained silent during the debate up to the 
               <br />
               present moment, the House will bear with me 
               <br />
               while I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brieﬂy.</span> express my views on this all- 
               <br />
               important matter, and assign a few of the 
               <br />
               reasons that induce me to record my vote in 
               <br />
               the manner which I design. Sir, I would 
               <br />
               say that I stand here in a different position 
               <br />
               from that of many honorable members who 
               <br />
               submitted the resolutions embodying the 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme to their constituents, 
               <br />
               and who held public meetings on the subject, 
               <br />
               and who received from them positive instruc— 
               <br />
               tions as to how their vote should be recorded. 
               <br />
               I received a circular from the Government, 
               <br />
               marked “ Private,” but took no action to 
               <br />
               ascertain public Opinion on its contents, so 
               <br />
               that I am, I regret to sa , without a single 
               <br />
               word of advice as to how 
               <br />
               matter. I may say, sir, that after reading 
               <br />
               the resolutions over again and again, I found 
               <br />
               many things in them thatIcould not endorse. 
               <br />
               I felt that they were not that which we had 
               <br />
               expected from the Government, when we gave 
               <br />
               our assent to the Coalition that was formed 
               <br />
               for the purpose of bringing down some pro- 
               <br />
               position for the settlement of our sectional 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties. I had expected that if a union 
               <br />
               of the colonies took place at all, and a change 
               <br />
               of our Constitution in that direction was ro- 
               <br />
               posed, we would not have had a Federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> 
               <br />
               a Legislative form of Government. It has 
               <br />
               been stated, since we had the pleasure of 
               <br />
               meeting together in the present session, that

               have had upon this Constitution, then I shall 
               <br />
               feel that though no amendments have been 
               <br />
               allowed on the ﬂoor of this House, yet the 
               <br />
               discussion has been productive of some good 
               <br />
               purpose. (Hear, hear.) I had resolved upon 
               <br />
               offering amendments upon various points in 
               <br />
               the scheme before us, but the motion for the 
               <br />
               “previous question” has shut them out, 
               <br />
               which I very much regret. It istoo late now 
               <br />
               to enter into an explanation of these several 
               <br />
               amendments I was about to move, or to state 
               <br />
               what I contemplated accomplishing by pro— 
               <br />
               posing them. It is suﬁcient for me to say 
               <br />
               that the previous question having been pro- 
               <br />
               posed, I feel that there has not been that op- 
               <br />
               portunit for the full consideration of the 
               <br />
               scheme in all its parts that was expected, or 
               <br />
               that ought to have been given to this House, 
               <br />
               in view of the fact that the people are not to 
               <br />
               be consulted in any other manner than by a 
               <br />
               vote of their representatives. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) 
               <br />
               Being one of those, sir, who earnestly sought 
               <br />
               for a constitutional change, and who joined 
               <br />
               in the very just complaint of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               that she was compelled to labor under great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grievances—the</span> lack of equal rights with

               <br />
               while she also contributed much the larger 
               <br />
               proportion of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue—it</span> is needless for 
               <br />
               me to say that I earnestly desired some 
               <br />
               change, that I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sympathized</span> with the pre- 
               <br />
               vailing sentiment of Upper Canada, and

               used my best endeavors, in the House and 
               <br />
               out of it, to assist in bringing about a 
               <br />
               remedy for our political and sectional ills. 
               <br />
               But, sir, we found we could not get repre-

               sentation according to papulation ; and since 
               <br />
