               with the English-speaking people. They are, 
               <br />
               as a people, more extravagant, more eager for 
               <br />

               different from the French-Canadians in their

               tastes and habits. Of course a comparison 
               <br />
               would be invidious, and I do not desire 
               <br />
               to institute one. But I am not at liberty 
               <br />
               to ignore the facts. Let us see how, under 
               <br />
               this proposed Constitution, the English-speak- 
               <br />
               ing people would be placed in reference to 
               <br />
               their peculiar interests and their peculiar 
               <br />
               ideas. In the ﬁrst place, I would desire to 
               <br />
               direct your attention to the 14th resolution, 
               <br />
               by which it is provided how, especially after 
               <br />
               the local governments are established, the Le— 
               <br />
               gislative Council of the General Government 
               <br />
               is to be constituted—by its members being 
               <br />
               appointed by the Federal Government on the 
               <br />
               nomination of the respective local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ments. We must bear in mind that in this 
               <br />
               Local Legislature which will be imposed on 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, the English element will not 
               <br />
               certainly be more than one-ﬁfth in number. 
               <br />
               Under these circumstances, and under the 
               <br />
               peculiar provisions with reference to the powers 
               <br />
               granted to the local governments, by which 
               <br />
               the legislative councillors are to be appointed 
               <br />
               by the General Government on the recommen- 
               <br />
               dation of the local governments, and in the 
               <br />
               case of Lower Canada, when its Local Govern- 
               <br />
               ment will be four-ﬁfths <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French-Canadian</span> and 
               <br />
               only one-ﬁfth of English origin, think you 
               <br />
               how many English members from Lower Ca- 
               <br />
               nada would ever ﬁnd their way to the Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Council? How would it be possrble, 
               <br />
               when the Legislative Council is to be a 
               <br />
               pointed on the recommendation of the Local 
               <br />
               Government, and that Local Government 
               <br />
               four-ﬁfths French-Canadian, for the English 
               <br />
               element to obtain fair representation in the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council? When, I say, would an 
               <br />
               English-speaking inhabitant of Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada ever receive such a recommendation, un- 
               <br />
               less he approved himself more French than 
               <br />
               English? (Hear, hear.) Again, by the 
               <br />
               23rd resolution, it is provided that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“"the</span> Le—

               arrange <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> bounds in such a manner that 
               <br />
               the English-speaking element would be ocu-

               very ﬁrst session of the Local Legislature.

               Constitution, are conferred on the Loca‘ Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. The ﬁrst I ﬁnd is the power of 
               <br />
               direct taxation. In the case of all govern- 
               <br />
               ments, thc power of taxation is ,the most im- 
               <br />
               portant power they can possess. It is that 
               <br />
               which concerns all portions and all classes of 
               <br />
               the community, and which gives rise to the

               greatest controversy, and the greatest amount 
               <br />
