               miuds of some readers. The Government, 
               <br />
               knowing well how much the people fear 
               <br />
               direct taxes, tell them that Confederation 
               <br />
               involves them in no such risk. What new 
               <br />
               method are they going to invent then for 
               <br />
               raising money? It is srfectly clear that 
               <br />
               Confederation will large y increase our ex- 
               <br />
               penditure. Then, for instance, Canada, 
               <br />
               which has now but one Government to 
               <br />
               maintain (and it is as much as she can do to 
               <br />
               maintain it), will have three to maintain, or 
               <br />
               nearly so: the Government of Upper Cana- 
               <br />
               da, the Government of Lower Canada, and 
               <br />
               nine-twelfths of the Federal Government; 
               <br />
               it will be the same as regards the legisla- 
               <br />
               tures. Canada, with a pulation forming 
               <br />
               nine-twelfths of the Con ederation, will have 
               <br />
               tobuild <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nineotwelfths</span> of the Intercolonial 
               <br />
               Railway, in place of the ﬁve-twelfths she 
               <br />
               was to have been charged with, under the 
               <br />
               arrangements of 1863. With reference to 
               <br />
               the opening of the allbut boundless territory 
               <br />
               of the North-West, and the construction of 
               <br />
               the fortiﬁcations which are e oken of only 
               <br />
               in whispers as yet, lest we a ould become 
               <br />
               alarmed, it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impouible</span> to calculate the 
               <br />
               expenditure these works will involve. And, 
               <br />
               in face of this increased expenditure, our 
               <br />
               chief source of revenue is to be considerably 
               <br />
               diminished. I refer to the import customs 
               <br />
               duties. Here is the justiﬁcation oﬂ'ered by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance for the reduction :— 
               <br />
               It is evident since the Atlantic Provinces cou- 
               <br />
               mm a far larger quantity of articles paying 
               <br />
               im duties than we do, that we shall be com— 
               <br />
               led, in order to assimilate all the customs 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ü</span> to diminish the import duties we pay in 
               <br />
               C a. The Atlantic Provinces cannot adopt a 
               <br />
               customs tariff so high as ours. 
               <br />
               Ithink I have shown that our expenditure 
               <br />
               must infallibly increase ; and as our revenue 
               <br />
               will diminish, to what new tax will the Go- 
               <br />
               vernment have recourse in order to make up 
               <br />
               the deﬁcit? We are told that Lower Canada 
               <br />
               will have a revenue of nearly a million and 
               <br />
               ahalf to meet her local expenditure; with 
               <br />
               what shall we meet our roportion of the 
               <br />
               Federal expenditure, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> will be far lar- 
               <br />
               ger? But I shall new deal with the advan- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tiges</span> which we are told must certainly result 
               <br />
               from Confederation. They may be divided 
               <br />
               into three classes—political, military and 
               <br />
               commercial. The honorable member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency tells us that we are to have 
               <br />
               the advantage of a seat at the banquet 
               <br />
               of nations. The perspective is a highly 
               <br />
               ﬂattering one, I admit, but we must be

               <br />
               ness of a State is proportioned to the great- 
               <br />
               ness of its debt, announces to us that our 
               <br />
               credit will be considerably increased, and 
               <br />
               that we shall be enabled to borrow much 
               <br />
               more extensively than we have hitherto done, 
               <br />
               a prospect at which he seems greatly to re- 
               <br />
               jorce. This facility of borrowing is not 
               <br />
               always an unmixed good; but it must be 
               <br />
               remembered that our credit will depend en- 
               <br />
               tirely on the success of our Confederation. 
               <br />
               If it should not succeed, if any serious dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty should arise within it-—a thing which 
               <br />
               is possible—public opinion will be more 
               <br />
               prompt to take alarm, in that our Federal 
               <br />
               form of government does not afford strong 
               <br />
               guarantees for the maintenance of order and 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of the Council enumerated all our provinces, 
               <br />
               comparing one after another, as regards su- 
               <br />
               perﬁcial extent, with the great states of Eu- 
               <br />
               rope. He ﬁnished with the Hudson’s Bay 
               <br />
               territory, stating that it is as large as Euro- 
               <br />
               pean Russia; but will it ever be capable of 
               <br />
               supporting, like European Russia, a popula- 
               <br />
               tion of sixty millions, and feeding, with its 
               <br />
               surplus corn, a great part of Europe? The 
               <br />
               vastness of territory in which the honorable 
               <br />
               minister takes so much pride is precisely what 
               <br />
               inspires me with uneasiness; we shall have 
               <br />
               the outward form of a giant, with the strength 
               <br />
               of a child ; we shall be unable to stand up. 
               <br />
               Hasty and remature growth is as fatal to 
               <br />
               states as it is'to men ; a state should extend 
               <br />
               its limits only in proportion as its strength in- 
               <br />
               creases. The Roman Empire did not attain 
               <br />
               in a day its colossal proportions ; its growth, 
               <br />
               like that of the oak, was slow but sure. Let 
               <br />
               us not allow ourselves to be dazzled by the 
               <br />
               ambition of becoming all at once a great

               maybe, that now envies their greatness ? Let 
               <br />
               us be content with our lot ; few nations have 
               <br />
               a better one. The territorial formation of 
               <br />
               the future Federation will also be an insur- 
               <br />
               mountable obstacle to the establishment of a

               strong government ' it amounts to a deform-
