               Having said so much on the general

               were it not that I wished to keep faith

               grounds w 'ch recommend this scheme, 
               <br />
               I will now say a few words in reference to 
               <br />
               the obj ections which have been urged against 
               <br />
               its character, vis., because it embraces those 
               <br />
               elements of disruption which are to be found 
               <br />
               in every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fethral</span> union. That is the objec- 
               <br />
               tion of many who, while they would be will- 
               <br />
               ing to go for a purely legislative union, object 
               <br />
               to one of a federal character. They see in it 
               <br />
               that which tends to a disruption, and collision 
               <br />
               with the Central Government. Now, sir, I 
               <br />
               do not deny that if a legislative union, pure 
               <br />
               and simple, had been practicable, I, for one, 
               <br />
               would have preferred it; but I cannot dis- 
               <br />
               guise from myself that it was, and is at pre- 
               <br />
               sent, utterly impracticable, and I cannot help 
               <br />
               expressing m astonishment and extreme 
               <br />
               ' tion,t tñve colonies whiehhad been 
               <br />
               so many years separate from each other, 
               <br />
               had so many separate and distinct interests 
               <br />
               andlocal diﬁ‘erences, should come together and 
               <br />
               upon such a scheme. Remembering the 
               <br />
               diﬁculties that had to be encountered in the 
               <br />
               shape of local interests, personal ambition, and 
               <br />
               separate governments, I certainly am sur- 
               <br />
               prised at the result, and I cannot withheld 
               <br />

               one of vital importance to the country. I

               historical detail of all the antecedent diﬁeul-

               ties which existed in our political ition. 
               <br />
               That honorable gentleman told us w at were

               at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> periods,—commented on their

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">project.</span> Well, sir, I do not care what may 
               <br />
               ave been the views of one member or ot 
               <br />
               another, or how inconsistent he may have 
               <br />
               been. What we have to consider is the 
               <br />
               scheme which is new resented to us. Let 
               <br />
               us forget the past; et us for t former 
               <br />

               starting fresh in life, or as the term has 
               <br />
               been used, that we are entering upon a new 
               <br />
               era of national existence. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear?</span> 
               <br />
               Let us cast aside past recriminations and 100 
               <br />
               at the merits of this scheme. I have only 
               <br />
               to say that a man who does not change his 
               <br />
               opinions is a very unsafe man indeed to 
               <br />
               guide the affairs of a nation. Such a man 
               <br />
               is like an old sign-post on a road that is no 
               <br />
               longer used for travel. The sign-pest is 
               <br />
               consistent enough, it remains where it had 
               <br />
               been placed, but though a ty e of consistency 
               <br />
               it is an emblem of error. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(ﬂeur,</span> hear.) The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Hochelaga spoke of his 
               <br />
               consistency and the inconsistency of others, 
               <br />
               but he was like the sign-post which pointed 
               <br />
               out a road that existed twenty years ago, but 
               <br />
               which no one could now pass over. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear, and laughter.) I think, therefore, 
               <br />
               that instead of endeavoring to ﬁnd objections 
               <br />
               to this scheme because it does not give as a 
               <br />

               men who came together and prepared it. 
               <br />
