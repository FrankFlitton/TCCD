               none might escape, the most profound secrecy 
               <br />
               was enjoined up to the moment ﬁxed for the re-

               <br />

               prepared with perﬁdious skill, invited them to

               meet in certain places under the most severe

               <br />
               amilies, relying on the British faith, so assembled 
               <br />
               on the 5th of September in the Church of Grand- 
               <br />
               Pré. Colonel Wmsmw went thither with a large 
               <br />
               attendance. There he showed them the commis- 
               <br />
               sion which he held from the Governor, and in- 
               <br />
               formed them that they had been called together 
               <br />
               to hear the ﬁnal decision of the King with respect 
               <br />
               to them. He declared to them that, although the 
               <br />
               duty which he had to perform was a most painful 
               <br />
               one to him, he was compelled, in obedience to 
               <br />
               his orders, to inform them “ that their lands and 
               <br />
               their cattle, of al. kinds, were conﬁscated to the 
               <br />
               Crown, together with all their other propertv, ex- 
               <br />
               cept their money and their clothing, and that they 
               <br />
               themselves were to be deported from the ro- 
               <br />
               vince.” No motive was assigned for this decision, 
               <br />
               and none could be assigned. in full civilization 
               <br />
               and in a time of political and religious quiet, such 
               <br />
               an act of spoliation was inexcusable, and, like 
               <br />
               the usurer, had to conceal its criminality by 
               <br />
               silence. A body of troops which had been kept 
               <br />
               concealed up to that point, emerged from their 
               <br />
               ambush and surrounded the church. The iu- 
               <br />
               habitants, taken by surprise and unarmed, offered 
               <br />
               no resistance. The soldiers collected the women 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">children;</span> 1,023 men, women and children 
               <br />
               were collected at Grand—Pre alone. Their cattle 
               <br />
               consisted of 1,269 oxen, 1,557 cows, 5,007 calves, 
               <br />
               493 horses, 3,690 sheep, and 4,197 swine. A few

               Acadians having escaped into the woods, the 
               <br />
               country was devastated to prevent their obtaining 
               <br />
