               <br />
               point of view, the marriage was still valid 
               <br />
               until it should have been declared null by a 
               <br />
               civil tribunal. It became necessary, there- 
               <br />
               fare, to carry the cause before the Superior 
               <br />
               Court, and my honorable friend, the member 
               <br />
               for Beauce, who took the case in hand with 
               <br />
               his usual zeal and legal address, obtained from 
               <br />
               the court, after a suitable inquiry, a judgment 
               <br />
               declaring the marri ge null in a civil sense, 
               <br />
               and ordering that it should be registered as 
               <br />
               such in all laces where it should be needful. 
               <br />
               If this aﬂ'air had occurred in Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               what recourse would the parties have had? 
               <br />
               The parties being Catholics, the case would 
               <br />
               have been brought before the bishop, who 
               <br />
               would also have declared the marriage null 
               <br />
               after suitable inquiry; but the cause would 
               <br />
               not have had the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusion</span> in the civil 
               <br />
               court, particularly had it depended On certain 
               <br />
               impediments which have force in Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada, but none in Upper Canada. It would 
               <br />
               have become necessary to go to Parliament to 
               <br />
               pray for an act, which, in a Catholic point of 
               <br />
               view, would be a mere decree of separation, 
               <br />
               but which the Parliament would have termed 
               <br />
               m act of divorce. This power to grant a 
               <br />
               separation is therefore necessarily vested in 
               <br />
               the Parliament, by whatever name such separ- 
               <br />
               ation may be designated, and we are not to 
               <br />
               be reproached for the interpretation which 
               <br />
               others may give to such name, different from 
               <br />
               that which we assign to it. I thought it 
               <br />
               right to make myself understood on this 
               <br />
               point, because I do not choose that people 
               <br />
               should be able to say we are afraid of explain— 
               <br />
               ing our position with regard to the question 
               <br />
               of divorce and marriage, and I believe that I 
               <br />
               have shown that our position is consistent 
               <br />
               with our religious laws and our principles as 
               <br />
               Catholics. I regret that I have dwelt so long 
               <br />
               on the matters touched upon by the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga; but after his speech, 
               <br />
               and considering the position he assumed, he 
               <br />
               must have expected an answer. And, hav- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               honorable member has endeavored to prove 
               <br />
               that all confederations die of consumption, 
               <br />
               and has cited, in support of his argument, the 
               <br />

               of Garibaldi, and reﬂected that if he h sno-

               and even the kingdom of Naples for the beno- 
               <br />
               ﬁt of the king of Sardinia, it was because the 
               <br />
               Italian States, being divided as he found 
               <br />
               them, were too weak to resist an invasion, and 
               <br />
               that, had they been confederated, neither Gari-

               <br />
               succeeded in getting the upper hand of them. 
               <br />
               And what happened when the little states of 
               <br />
               Italy were banded together with Piedmont ? 
               <br />
               This happened—when Garibaldi aimed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               making conquests on his own account, he soon 
               <br />
               found out that the small states no 1 ex- 
               <br />

               out of their fragments, the consequence of 
               <br />
