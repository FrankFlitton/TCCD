               on the whole, the ablest deliberative body

               <br />

               members of the Senate, almost without 
               <br />

               there is certainly no proportion of small men;

               fully borne out by constitutional writers of 
               <br />

               <br />
               CHEVALIER, and others. They say that the

               were it doubtful whether or not in this respect

               can be no doubt at all. As intended for the

               a very able, deliberative body, of moderate 
               <br />
               numbers, carefully chosen on the strictest

               principle of federation, changing constantly, 
               <br />
               and having, on every matter of importance, 
               <br />
               a voice and veto of the most efﬁcient kind.

               For stopping everything, for bringing about

               <br />

               <br />
               as far as possible, from the small number of

               since; and until that panel is exhausted, no

               other person in any province is to be taken ; 
               <br />
               and hereafter, Mr. SPEAKER, as vacancies 
               <br />

               <br />
               —and this is the strangest thing of all—not 
               <br />
               by the provincial legislatures, nor by any 
               <br />
               authority or under any avowed inﬂuence of 
               <br />
               the local kind, but possibly by the General 
               <br />
               Government. And forsooth, this is called 
               <br />
               the Federal feature of our system ! Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The vacancies, to be sure, in wer 
               <br />
               Canada are to be ﬁlled by selection of indivi- 
               <br />
               duals having or holding property in Lower

               Canada,—and more than that, in articular 
               <br />
               territorial divisions of Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> ! But 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               even of Lower Canada, or with any necessary 
               <br />
               reference to their wishes in that behalf ? 
               <br />
               Bless you, no! not at all. That would go 
               <br />
               towards makings Federal body of this House! 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It might then be something 
               <br />
               of a Federal check upon the General Govern— 
               <br />
               ment, and that would never do. But suppose 
               <br />
               this should happen—and honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite must admit that it may,—that

               Canada, or any other, no matter which—
