               I never understood that they had stated that

               amendments could not be proposed. It was

               HON. MR. MCDOUGALL—I apprehend 
               <br />
               there are few honorable gentlemen in the 
               <br />
               House whose impressions on the subject are 
               <br />
               similar to those of the honorable gentleman. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It was fully understood by the 
               <br />
               House that the scheme was brought before 
               <br />
               Parliament as the result of the Conference of 
               <br />
               all the colonial governments, and as a Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment measure. I think, sir, it was further 
               <br />
               distinctly stated that being in the nature of a 
               <br />
               treaty, it was absurd to suppose that it would 
               <br />
               be competent for any of the legislatures to amend 
               <br />
               the scheme, because the moment the door is 
               <br />
               thrown open to amendments in one legislature, 
               <br />
               the same privilege would be claimed by each 
               <br />
               of the others. What kind of a scheme would 
               <br />
               it be after each legislature had tinkered it to 
               <br />
               suit its own views, and what length of time 
               <br />
               does the honorable gentleman think it would 
               <br />
               take to arrive at a common agreement if that 
               <br />
               course were pursued? In the very nature 
               <br />
               of things, whether this is the best or the worst 
               <br />
               scheme that could have been devised, we can- 
               <br />
               not get around the fact that it is of the nature 
               <br />
               of a treaty, and, therefore, must be voted upon 
               <br />
               by a simple yea and nay. (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               is in that view that the Government have sub- 
               <br />
               mitted it to this House, and it is upon that 
               <br />
               view that the verdict of this House must be 
               <br />
               pronounced. As I have already stated, the 
               <br />
               determination to which the Government has 
               <br />
               come is to press the main motion, pure and 
               <br />
               simple, upon the attention of the House, and 
               <br />
               to use every legitimate parliamentary means 
               <br />
               to get a decision, and by that decision we are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span> to stand or fall. I hope there will 
               <br />

               <br />
               able members. It is not the intention of the 
               <br />
               Government, in any manner, to deprive hon-

               HON. J. S. MACDONALD—I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think,</span> 
               <br />
               sir, that the large majority of the member: 
               <br />
               of this House will agree with me that the 
               <br />
               proposition made by the leader of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to prevent amendments being sub. 
               <br />
               mitted by moving “ the previous question," 
               <br />
               has taken us all by surprise. I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> 
               <br />
               House should hold this step to be a gross 
               <br />
               breach of the understanding which was en- 
               <br />
               tered into at the time it was agreed that 
               <br />
               the House should be considered as in com— 
               <br />
               mittee of the whole, with you, sir, in the 
               <br />
               chair. For it was then fully understood that 
               <br />
               though no amendment would be allowed to 
               <br />
               be adopted, if the Government could prevent 
               <br />
               it, yet there would be no objection to their 
               <br />
               being moved in the ordinary way. It was 
               <br />
               therefore understood that this House was, 
               <br />
               for all practical purposes, in Committee of the 
               <br />
               Whole, and as “ the previous question” could 
               <br />
               not be moved in Committee of the Whole, it 
               <br />
               was consequently out of order to move it 
               <br />
               now. I would ask hon. gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches, if they did not solemnly 
               <br />
               enter into a compact of that nature with this 
               <br />
               House? If they committed an error in de- 
               <br />
               ciding to retain the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER</span> in the chair on 
               <br />
               the conditions referred to,they are now taking 
               <br />
               advantage of their own wrong. Sir, the 0p- 
               <br />
               position proper have abstained from placing 
               <br />
               on the paper any notice of amendments. 
               <br />
               They found that several amendments which 
               <br />
               embraced their views were to be moved by 
               <br />
               gentlemen who were friendly to the Admin- 
               <br />
               istration. Those gentlemen could not sup- 
               <br />
               pose for a moment that their motions were 
               <br />
               to be choked off, whatever might be the 
               <br />
               intention of the Government in relation to 
               <br />
               similar amendments if proposed from this 
               <br />
               side of the House. But “ the previous ques- 
               <br />
               tion,” thus moved, applies ruthlessly to friends 
               <br />
               and foes. To quote the language of the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Carleton :—-“ It is 
               <br />
               now quite clear that they (the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government)</span> 
               <br />
               are going to put the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> gag on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> 
               <br />
               friends that they devised for their opponents.” 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Let us enquire who are those 
               <br />
               who compose the Administration, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who;</span> 
               <br />
               after violating their solemn agreement, now 
               <br />
               venture to trample upon the rights and 
               <br />
               privileges of the representatives of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span>
