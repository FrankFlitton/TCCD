               the Hon. Solicitor General for Lower Canada

               very sincere in his opposition to the Benning 
               <br />
               Bill. (Hear, hear.) There is one certain 
               <br />
               fact, and that is that the Protestants of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada have said to the Government, 
               <br />
               “ Pass a measure which shall guarantee to us 
               <br />
               the stability and protection of our educational 
               <br />
               system and of our religious institutions, and 
               <br />
               we will support your scheme of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion; unless you do, we will never support 
               <br />
               you, because we do not wish to place our- 
               <br />
               selves at the mercy of a Local Legislature 
               <br />
               the three-fourths of the members of which 
               <br />
               will be Catholics.” They were perfectly 
               <br />
               justiﬁable in acting as they did, although it 
               <br />
               is generally admitted that we Catholics have 
               <br />
               much more liberality than the Protestants— 
               <br />
               and this is to a certain extent proved by the 
               <br />
               fact that several of cur Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               counties are represented by Protestants. 
               <br />
               I do not, however, Mr. SPEAKER, I do 
               <br />
               not wish to reproach the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestant</span> min- 
               <br />
               ority of Lower Canada for having pro- 
               <br />
               tected its own interests. I admit that in 
               <br />
               doing this they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only‘done</span> their duty; 
               <br />
               for who can say, after all, what ten years 
               <br />
               may bring forth? Ten years hence ideas 
               <br />

               the Ministry cannot say that this journal

               does not speak the truth, as it is the organ 
               <br />
               of the present Government—if it be true 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cﬂtht</span> lic clergy are an encroaching

               liberty of reading a few extracts from that
