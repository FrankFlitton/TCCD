               pect and maintain forever in their integrity. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I am not of the same opinion 
               <br />
               as the hon. member for Brome, who pretends 
               <br />
               to see in those clauses that the judges would 
               <br />
               be under two masters at the same time. If 
               <br />
               they could possibly be controlled at all, it 
               <br />
               would be by the Federal Government, which 
               <br />
               alone will appoint them, pay them, and have 
               <br />
               the power of dismissing them in certain 
               <br />
               cases. There is no anomaly here, because 
               <br />
               one thing follows another; all are linked 
               <br />
               together and harmonize perfect] . If any- 
               <br />
               thing could possibly arise, it woul be danger. 
               <br />
               However, so far as we can see, there will be 
               <br />
               no danger in the administration of justice— 
               <br />
               the question of veto, and reserve with regard 
               <br />
               to legislation, being a totally different thing, 
               <br />
               and suggesting considerations of a different 
               <br />
               nature. But here is the point to which I 
               <br />
               wish to draw the attention of this House. 
               <br />
               Among all the things guaranteed to Lower 
               <br />
               Canada in the Constitution, and in fact to 
               <br />
               all the provinces, we ﬁnd their own civil 
               <br />
               laws. Lower Canada has been so tenacious 
               <br />
               of its civil <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">code,</span> that it is laid down in the 
               <br />
               project before us that the Federal Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment shall not even be able to suggest logis- 
               <br />
               lation by which it may be affected, as it will 
               <br />
               have the right to do for the other provinces. 
               <br />
               The reason is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obvious-the</span> civil laws of the 
               <br />
               other provinces are nearly similar; they 
               <br />
               breathe the same spirit and the same prin- 
               <br />
               ciples; they spring from the same source 
               <br />
               and the same ideas. But it is not so 
               <br />
               with regard to those of Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               with their origin from almost entirely 
               <br />
               Latin sources; and we hold to them as to a 
               <br />
               sacred <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legacyf;</span> we love them because they 
               <br />
               suit our customs, and we ﬁnd under the 
               <br />
               protection for our property and our families. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The Conference has under- 
               <br />
               stood and respected our ideas on this point. 
               <br />
               However, if a Court of Appeal should one day 
               <br />
               be placed over the judiciary tribunals of all 
               <br />
               the provinces, without excepting those of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, the result would be that those 
               <br />
               same laws would be explained by men who 
               <br />
               would not understand them, and who would, 
               <br />
               involuntarily perhaps, graft English juris- 
               <br />
               prudence upon a French code of laws.— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) Such was the spectacle pre- 
               <br />
               sented in Canada after the conquest, and no 
               <br />
               one, I am sure, would wish to see a repetition 
               <br />
               of the scene. (Hear, hear.) We have, it
