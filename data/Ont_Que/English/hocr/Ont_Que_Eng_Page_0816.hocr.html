               MR. J. S. ROSS—I will not attempt to 
               <br />
               address the House at any great length at 
               <br />
               this late hour of the evening, as I think 
               <br />
               it very desirable that this debate should be 
               <br />
               brought to a close at as early a day as 
               <br />
               possible; and believing that that is the 
               <br />
               prevailing opinion in this House, I shall 
               <br />
               endeavor to be as brief as I can. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman who has just taken his seat has 
               <br />
               referred to one matter on which I shall not 
               <br />
               at present say anything, on which I shall 
               <br />
               not commit myself. I suppose that it will 
               <br />
               be very well understood what I refer to, 
               <br />
               without my alluding to it more particularly.

               <br />
               change—on which I shall dwell shortly, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 
               <br />
               endeavor to show that there was a necessity 
               <br />
               for a change. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span> be in the recollection 
               <br />
               of every hon. member in this House, that 
               <br />
               one year ago affairs were in such a state- 
               <br />
               such difﬁculties presented themselves, that 
               <br />
               legislation was becoming almost impracticable. 
               <br />
               No better proof of this could be desired 
               <br />
               than that the Government ol'the day found 
               <br />
               themselves so surrounded With diﬂiculties in 
               <br />
               the House, that they declared themselves 
               <br />
               unable to carry on the administration of the 
               <br />
               aﬁaim of the country in a satisfactory man- 
               <br />
               ner. Now, why should a Government 
               <br />
               possessing so much talent and ability as 
               <br />
               that Government did, make that declaration, 
               <br />
               if there was no necessity for it? (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.)

               did acknowledge that there were difﬁculties 
               <br />
               in the way. A motion was made by the

               Now, this was signed by twelve gentlemen, 
               <br />
               and among them I ﬁnd the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Chateauguay, who then declared that 
               <br />
               there was a necessity for some change. I 
               <br />
               think, Mr. SPEAKER, that this clearly shows 
               <br />
               that the matter was not brought upon us in 
               <br />
               a hurry, that the scheme now before us is a 
               <br />
               subject which has been looked forward to for 
               <br />
               some time. When we refer to that period, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that the, Government of the day 
               <br />
               placed their resignations in His Excellency’s 
               <br />
               hands, a new Government was formed 
               <br />
               which met the House on the 3rd of May, 
               <br />
               and on the 14th of June they were 
               <br />
               defeated. At that time, I believe, they 
               <br />
               had obtained from His Excellency per- 
               <br />
               mission to dissolve the House. An <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effort</span> 
               <br />
               was made, however, to eﬂ'ect a change in the 
               <br />
               Administration, in order that it might com- 
               <br />
               mand a majority of this House, and be 
               <br />
               enabled to carry ou the business of the 
               <br />
               country. After some time, a reconstruction 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affected,</span> and in the programme which 
               <br />
               the present Government adopted, they did 
               <br />
               announce that they would take up this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and that when they met the House the 
               <br />
               next session, they would be prepared to lay 
               <br />
               before the House a measure for the purpose 
               <br />
               of removing existing diﬁculties, by intro- 
               <br />
               ducing the Feueral principle into Canada, 
               <br />
               coupled with such provision as will permit 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces and the N orth-West 
               <br />
               territory to be incorporated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nith‘the</span> same 
               <br />
               system of government. If there were 
               <br />
               objections to a change, why were they not 
               <br />
               made at that time? Did not the House 
               <br />
               commit itself, then, by receiving it without 
               <br />
               any objection ? Hence I think that the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment pursued a manly, straightforward 
               <br />
               course in coming down and announcing what 
               <br />
               their scheme was 3 and whether that scheme 
               <br />
               is a good or a bad one, they have redeemed 
               <br />
               their pledges; they have met this House 
               <br />
               with a scheme for the Confederation of the 
               <br />
               British North American Provinces. (Hear.)
