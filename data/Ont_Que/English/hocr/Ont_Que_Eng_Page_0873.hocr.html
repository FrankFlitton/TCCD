               a reward. The Hon. Solicitor General also 
               <br />
               says that the Hon. Attorney General deserves 
               <br />
               areward for having introduced the French

               law of Lower Canada into the townships. 
               <br />
               But here again he awards him praise and 
               <br />
               reward which are not his due, for it was 
               <br />
               Bon. Judge LORANGER who made that law, 
               <br />
               _and had it passed and enacted by the House. 
               <br />
               For this law, then, also he is not deserving 
               <br />
               of reward. (ﬂeur.) These are the three 
               <br />
               reasons for which the Hon. Solicitor General 
               <br />
               says that the Hon. Attorney General is enti- 
               <br />
               tled to a reward ; but I consider that he hardly 
               <br />
               deserves any, as it was not he who brought 
               <br />
               about the passing of the ﬁrst and the last of 
               <br />
               those laws, and the other two are so ill-made 
               <br />
               that he deserves anything but a reward for 
               <br />
               having conferred them upon the country. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Yet I must say that he 
               <br />
               deserves a reward, but from whom, and 
               <br />
               why ? Ah l he deserves a reward from 
               <br />
               England for having done exactly what Lord 
               <br />
               DURHAM advised the doing of in relation to 
               <br />
               the Canadians, in his famous report on the 
               <br />
               means to be taken to cause us to disap- 
               <br />
               pear ; he deserves a reward for having 
               <br />
               caused the setting aside of the French 
               <br />
               laws and the substitution for them of Eng- 
               <br />
               lish laws; he deserves a reward for having 
               <br />
               done the will of England in every respect ; 
               <br />
               and, lastly, he deserves a reward for having 
               <br />
               devised the present scheme of Confederation, 
               <br />
               and caused it to be accepted by a majority 
               <br />
               of this House. (Hear, hear.) While on 
               <br />
               this subject, and to show how he has deserved 
               <br />
               and received rewards, it will be well to read 
               <br />
               a passage from Lord DURHAM’S report, in 
               <br />
               which he points out the means to be adopted 
               <br />
               to corrupt the leaders and to get the mastery 
               <br />
               of the Lower Canadian people. The follow- 
               <br />
               ing is the passage to which I allude :—

               attach very great importance to the inﬂuence

               the ﬁve counties, when he donned the cap 
               <br />
               of liberty. (Hear, hear.) Lord DURHAH

               <br />
               you will see how they will sacriﬁce their

               the union has saved us l” have been re—

               MR. J. B. E. DORION—Before I proceed 
               <br />
               to examine the question which engages our 
               <br />
               attention, Mr. SPEAKER, I wish to premise 
               <br />
               that in any expression of my sentiments, I 
               <br />
               speak on behalf of no political party, but for 
               <br />
               myself only. In discussing a proposition 
               <br />
               which so intimately affects the destiny of 
               <br />
               Canada, and all that we value most, I would 
               <br />
               rise above personal and party considerations, 
               <br />
               in order that I may look at it from a vantage 
               <br />
               point removed from party inﬂuences. Why, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, are we engaged this evening 
               <br />
               in discussing a Confederation of the Provinces 
               <br />
               of British North America ? Because we had, 
               <br />
               last year, a Ministerial crisis, from which 
               <br />
               arose a proposal for the union of the two 
               <br />
               political parties who divided public opinion.
