               <br />

               <br />
               is something behind the scenes to account 
               <br />
               for such singular conduct. Of these we get 
               <br />
               glimpses from day to day. Some of those 
               <br />
               reasons are 'patent to every one. One of 
               <br />
               those is that the Coalition which has been 
               <br />
               formed out of the most incongruous mate- 
               <br />
               rials, is supported by the greatest medley of 
               <br />
               politicians anybody ever saw. Of course, it 
               <br />
               is to bc supposed that we will have an elec- 
               <br />
               tion before another year is out. Members 
               <br />
               now supporting the Treasury benches, with 
               <br />
               some of whom I have worked for many 
               <br />
               years, have suffered very much from expensive 
               <br />
               elections through which they have been called 
               <br />
               upon to pass in that period. I know it is 
               <br />
               very unpalatable that they should have to go 
               <br />
               back again for reelection, after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">voting,r</span> here 
               <br />
               against theexpress wishes of their constitu- 
               <br />
               ents. Under this Coalition arrangement 
               <br />
               they evidently expect that they will be able 
               <br />
               to go to their constituencies and be returned 
               <br />
               by acclamation, because the two extremes-— 
               <br />
               abandoning their old principles—coalesced. 
               <br />
               But it is a vain hope, sir. Let the elections 
               <br />
               for North Ontario and the town of Niagara 
               <br />
               tell how unfounded is the expectation. The 
               <br />
               failure of the Hon. Provincial Secretary 
               <br />
               was the ﬁrst failure, and I may here sa

               committed towards him on the part of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               happy to see that he has got over it very

               <br />
               [am very much mistaken if the indignant

               voice of several constituencies will not urge
