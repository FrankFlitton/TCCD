               tleman forgets that he has the Intercolonial

               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I do not desire to go over the

               ﬁgures the honorable gentleman has laid before 
               <br />

               <br />
               in such an eminent degree. I ﬁnd in the 
               <br />
               resolutions now proposed a ‘few propositions 
               <br />
               to which I would call the attention of the 
               <br />
               House. The ﬁrst thing that the Confed- 
               <br />
               eration will have to provide for is the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway, which will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certainly</span> cost 
               <br />
               twenty millions of dollars, the interest upon 
               <br />
               which, at 5 r cent., will amount to one 
               <br />
               million of dollars annually. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Then to Newfoundland we are bound to pay 
               <br />
               $150,000 a year, for all time to come, to 
               <br />
               purchase the mineral lands of that colony; 
               <br />
               while, as regards the other provinces, all the 
               <br />
               public lands are given up to the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments. But that is not all, for, in order to 
               <br />
               man these “valuable lands” in Newfound- 
               <br />
               land, we shall have to establish a Crown 
               <br />
               Lands department under the General Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment; and if honorable gentlemen desire 
               <br />
               to learn something of the probable expense of 
               <br />
               such an establishment, they need only refer 
               <br />
               to a return brought down last night, by which 
               <br />
               they will see that there are no less than sixty
