               Provinces during their sojourn here had the 
               <br />
               effect of changing his opinion on this question. 
               <br />
               He looked to see from what side the proposi- 
               <br />
               tion came, and seeing that it came from the 
               <br />
               side on which his friends sat, he was at once 
               <br />
               convinced that it contained nothing that could 
               <br />
               endanger the institutions of Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               It is evident that he votes for it with certain- 
               <br />
               ty. In 1858 he reproached those members 
               <br />
               who, like the honorable member for Mont- 
               <br />
               calm (Mr. Jos. DUFBESNE), look quietly to see 
               <br />
               from which side measures come before pro- 
               <br />
               nouncing upon them, with only thinking 
               <br />
               and acting according to word of command 
               <br />
               given by the resent Ministers. Has not 
               <br />
               he also been 0 liged to write a pamphlet 
               <br />
               of 150 pages in 1865 to refute the one 
               <br />
               of forty pages which he then wrote ? Then 
               <br />
               he held to be absurd all that was connected, 
               <br />
               either nearly or remotely, with Confederation ; 
               <br />
               now he holds everything to be right and per- 
               <br />
               fect; he is quite satisﬁed, and gets the promise 
               <br />
               of all his members to vote for the scheme be- 
               <br />
               fore us without amendment. He throws his 
               <br />
               hat in the air and exclaims—“ Let us vote for 
               <br />
               Confederation and for our friends.” (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear, and laughter.) That honorable member 
               <br />
               may be able to discover contradictions in my 
               <br />
               conduct. He sees a mote in his neighbor’s 
               <br />
               eyes and seeth not the beam in his own. But 
               <br />
               let us continue our examination of that pamph— 
               <br />

               <br />
               hope for, under Confederation, was that we 
               <br />
               might have two elective chambers, with anum- 
               <br />
               ber of members proportioned to the popula- 
               <br />
               tion in each province, which would have given 
               <br />
               us one vote in three. It was the elective

               system, with representation based on popu-

               federation of all the provinces, that plan was 
               <br />

               <br />

               It was in obedience to the general sentiment, 
               <br />
               and not by conviction, that he who now writes 
               <br />
               gave up, in 1856, an opinion which he had always 
               <br />
               held, and himself drafted the present constitution 
               <br />
               of the Legislative Council, and it is with genuine 
               <br />
               satisfaction, and a conviction strengthened by 
               <br />
               experience, that we greet the revival of the 
               <br />
               principle of Crown nomination to the Le ' lative 
               <br />

               <br />

               It would seem, then, that in 1856 the honor- 
               <br />
               able member altered the Constitution, not as 
               <br />
               the result of conviction, and because he con- 
               <br />
               sidered it was defective, but in obedience to 
               <br />
               the general sentiment; that is to say, that 
               <br />
               being a Minister, he did not wish to lease 
               <br />
               his friends, who demanded that this ange 
               <br />
               should be made, and that, rather than sacriﬁce 
               <br />
               his portfolio as a M inister, he preferred to 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce his rinciples and convictions. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear, and aughter.) Now, the honorable 
               <br />
               member has no other sacriﬁce to make than 
               <br />
               that of his personal dignity; this is but a 
               <br />
               triﬂing one ; and he returns to his old opinions, 
               <br />
               so as not to displease his present friends. 
               <br />
               He clung to power in 1856; to—day he pays 
               <br />
               homage to it; that is the whole difference. 
               <br />
               When the wind blew in the direction of re- 
               <br />
               form, the honorable member was a Reformer, 
               <br />
               not .from conviction but from interest; and 
               <br />
               when it blows in the direction of absolutism, 
               <br />
               the honorable member becomes by instinct a 
               <br />
               Conservative and a Tory. So he who, in 
               <br />
               1856, obtained the passing of an act to render 
               <br />
               the Council elective ; who, in 1858, again pso- 
               <br />
               nounced himself in favor of the elective prin- 
               <br />
               ciple as applied to the Council, tells us in 1865 
               <br />
               that he greets with genuine satisfaction the 
               <br />
               revival of the principle of Crown nomination 
               <br />
               of the Legislative Councillors. (Hear, hear.)
