               state of thin in the United States, which 
               <br />
               has resulted om carrying the elective prin— 
               <br />
               ciplc too far ; and the fact that that principle, 
               <br />
               carried too far has worked much mischief, 
               <br />
               ought to place us on our guard. Some years 
               <br />
               ago, in Canada, there was quite a rage for the 
               <br />
               elective principle, and an agitation was get up 
               <br />
               with the view of rendering the judiciary 
               <br />
               elective. Well, a statesman of the United 
               <br />
               States, with whom I am well acquainted, and 
               <br />
               who now occupies a high position in that 
               <br />
               country, once remarked to me: “ You have 
               <br />
               quite enough of the democratic element in 
               <br />
               your Constitution already, and, above all, do 
               <br />
               not make your judiciary elective, for that 
               <br />
               would be one of the greatest curses you could 
               <br />
               inﬂict on your country.” (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               elective principle, kept within proper bounds, 
               <br />
               is very good indœd, and hitherto, no doubt, 
               <br />
               has worked well in this House. But I doubt 
               <br />
               whether, in the course of time, this House 
               <br />
               would not lose its present high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">status</span> if the 
               <br />
               elective principle was continued in it for ever. 
               <br />
               As regards this, however, I merely state 
               <br />
               my own opinion, and other honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men may hold contrary opinions, as they are 
               <br />
               perfectly entitled to do. (Hear, hear.) Hav-

               ing thus, honorable gentlemen, explained the 
               <br />
               reasons which induced the Government, in 
               <br />
               1856, to propose that the elective principle 
               <br />
               should be extended to this House, with the 
               <br />
               concomitant circumstances which assisted in 
               <br />

               plained the reasons which have induced the

               ederation with the Maritime Provinces, I 
               <br />
               think I am clear from any imputation of 
               <br />
               inconsistency or levity of purpose. Before

               sitting down I have a personal explanation to 
               <br />
               make. When I speak, honorable gentlemen, 
               <br />
               I speak with sincerity, but, like any other 
               <br />

               <br />
               however, that I ﬁnd I have committed a mis-

               <br />
               man should do. (Hear, hear.) I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               I took a wrong view of the proportions of ap- 
               <br />
               poinœd members that were to be allotted to 
               <br />
               each province, in case the amendment of my

               honorable friend from the Wellington Divis-

               <br />
               that I was wrong, and that it was really car-

               that my honorable friend was right in cor-

               HON. MB. SKEAD said—Honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, I claim the indulgence of the House 
               <br />
               for a few moments while I state from my point 
               <br />
               of view, as one of the representatives from 
               <br />
               Central Canada, the way in which I regard 
               <br />
               the measure now under consideration. I am 
               <br />
               an advocate of the union of the British North 
               <br />
               American Provinces. (Hear, hear.) When I 
               <br />
               came here a few weeks ago, my mind was 
               <br />
               scarcely made up as to the course I should 
               <br />
               pursue. At the same time I was desirous of 
               <br />
               taking that course which should be approved 
               <br />
               by the majority of my constituents. In No- 
               <br />
               vember last I received the document which 
               <br />
               was sent to members of both Houses through- 
               <br />
               out the province; but as it was marked “ Pri- 
               <br />
               vate,” I felt bound by every consideration of 
               <br />
               propriety not to make it public. Having at 
               <br />
               that time been reëlected by my constituents, 
               <br />
               I had no occasion to use it in connection with 
               <br />
               securing my return to this House. But, 
               <br />
               speaking of my reelection a few months ago, 
               <br />
               I may remark that a number of my constitu— 
               <br />
               ents felt disposed at that time to pledge me to 
               <br />
               oppose this union of the British North Amer- 
               <br />
               ican colonies. For my own part I felt it 
               <br />
               would be wrong for me to do so, not knowing 
               <br />
               what was the programme that was about to 
               <br />
               be laid; I refused, therefore, to give a pledge. 
               <br />
               Probably I felt more independent on account 
               <br />
               of there being no opposition. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tSlaughter.)</span> 
               <br />
               But be that as it may, I have e same de- 
               <br />
               sire to act in accordance with the deliberate 
               <br />
               views of my constituents as if I had canvassed 
               <br />
               every vote in the division. I pledged myself 
               <br />
               on the hustings on the day of my election, 
               <br />
               that as soon as the scheme was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">published.</span> I 
               <br />
               would give it my earnest attention, and form 
               <br />
               a judgment upon it to the best of my ability. 
               <br />
               After the document was formall laid on the 
               <br />
               table of the House, I waited '1 it was put 
               <br />
               in type, and having ordered two thousand 
               <br />
               copies of it, I sent them, some ﬁfteen days 
               <br />
               ago, to my constituents, with a circular call- 
               <br />
               ing upon them to state any objections they 
               <br />
               might have to the scheme if they con-

               sidered it objectionable, and to indicate what
