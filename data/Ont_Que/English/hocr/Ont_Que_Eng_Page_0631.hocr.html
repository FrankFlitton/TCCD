               Mr. PAPINEAU? Their object, in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place, was to injure the Opposition, who re- 
               <br />
               present him; and next, to elevate themselves, 
               <br />
               by dragging down to their own level one of 
               <br />
               the great men of our history, beside whom 
               <br />
               they are but pigmies. For there are two 
               <br />
               ways of being great: the ﬁrst is by rendering 
               <br />
               to one’s country eminent services, and by ex- 
               <br />
               hibiting undeniable superiority; but inasmuch

               <br />
               able member for Montmorency possess neither 
               <br />
               the material nor the superiority that go to 
               <br />
               make great men, they adopt the second mode 
               <br />
               of attaining greatness. It consists in depre- 
               <br />
               ciating and crushing all those who are supe- 
               <br />
               rior to one’s self. Thus they hope to rise 
               <br />
               over the ruined reputation of those they en- 
               <br />
               viously calumniate and unceasingly attack. 
               <br />
               They recklessly carry on their work of demoli- 
               <br />
               tion ; they are not arrested in their course

               epoch in our history, and when one of the

               legious hands are eagerly raised to mutilate it; 
               <br />
               then, standing alone upon its scattered frag- 
               <br />
               ments, they contemplate with ride the pros-

               <br />
               At the opening of Parliament in 1816, a mes-

               was communicated to the House stating 
               <br />

               <br />

               bitter words in which the message was couched 
               <br />

               <br />
               dissolution was resorted to in order to pre-

               vent a manifestation of the feelings of the

               by the Imperial Government with reference 
               <br />

               ever they endeavored to carry any measure of

               It was in 1856 that we succeeded, after:

               of the past, recorded unfortunately in letters of
