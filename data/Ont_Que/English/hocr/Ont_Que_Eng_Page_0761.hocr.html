               Hon. Mr. LAFRAMBOISE—Well, I can 
               <br />
               say that the Ministerial clock shewed the hour 
               <br />

               <br />

               clusion, Mr. SPEAKER, I have no hesitation 
               <br />
               in saying that our parliamentary history chews 
               <br />
               no precedent for so unworthy a proceeding as 
               <br />
               the present. I say that it is the intention of the

               Government to send their measure to England 
               <br />
               to receive the Imperial sanction before the 
               <br />
               people of this country have had time to judge 
               <br />
               of it, and before their representatives have 
               <br />
               had an opportunity of amending it in any 
               <br />
               way whatever. This measure, or this new 
               <br />
               Constitution, after it shall have so received 
               <br />
               the sanction of the Im <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'21]</span> Government, will 
               <br />
