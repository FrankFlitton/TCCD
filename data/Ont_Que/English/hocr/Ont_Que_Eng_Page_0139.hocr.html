               <br />

               day ignorant of its character, and it could not 
               <br />
               be said that it was ever constitutionally sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to the country. Then we were told that, 
               <br />
               as elective members and as patriots, it was our 
               <br />
               duty to accept the measure as it was, even 
               <br />

               <br />
               rather than lose it altogether. It had been 
               <br />
               generally represented by the local newspapers 
               <br />
               in Upper Canada—fed to do so—that it was 
               <br />
               commonly a proved; but while the simple idea 
               <br />
               of union might ﬁnd favor, as he believed it 
               <br />
               did, it was not less true that the country was 
               <br />
               waiting for the details, of which they would 
               <br />
               judge when they had been discussed in Par- 
               <br />
               liament. When this had been done, and the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bearing—f</span> the manifold particulars was thor- 
               <br />
               oughly understood it was expected, at least 
               <br />
               among the English of Lower Canada, that it 
               <br />
               would not be passed until after having been 
               <br />
               submitted to the people. If it were passed 
               <br />
               through without such an appeal, he had no 
               <br />
               hesitation in saying that the Government would 
               <br />
               assume a very serious responsibility, and if, in 
               <br />
               after times, the union should prove disastrous, 
               <br />
               it would bring upon them impreeations instead 
               <br />
               of blessings. And he was under the impres- 
               <br />
               sion that the Government, whenever they had 
               <br />
               given their views on the subject, had never 
               <br />
               said it would not be so presented, but no doubt 
               <br />
               their utterances were very much like those of 
               <br />
               the Delphic oracle, susceptible of being un- 
               <br />
               derstood in two opposite ways. But what 
               <br />
               could such an indisposition to speak clearly 
               <br />
               indicate, if not a purpose to press the matter 
               <br />
               on to a result, even though the people might 
               <br />
               not want it. Under this measure the elective 
               <br />
               members would have a right to vote them- 
               <br />
               selves, two out of three at least, as members 
               <br />
               for life. N ow it had been found necessary to 
               <br />
               enact a law to ensure the independence of 
               <br />
               Parliament, and for the purpose of removing 
               <br />
               all temptation to swerve from the right, the 
               <br />

               HON. Mn. SANBORN said he was ready 
               <br />
               to accept the explanation, as it would not affect 
               <br />
               his ent. And supposing all the mem- 
               <br />
               bers nominated by the Crown were appointed, 
               <br />
               he would say it was but just ; nay, it would 
               <br />
               be unjust to deprive them of seats which had 
               <br />
               been given them for life. The Honorable Com- 
               <br />
               missioner of Crown Lands would thus see that 
               <br />
               he (Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SANBOBNZI</span> had attributed only 
               <br />
               such opinions to him as e himself conscien- 
               <br />
               tiously held to be right. Assuming then that 
               <br />
               the Crown members would retain their seats, 
               <br />
               there was a direct temptation presented to at 
               <br />
               least two out of three of the elective mem- 
               <br />
               bers. This, he thought, exhibited the project 
               <br />
               in a very damaging light. Such a measure 
               <br />
               was calculated to bias the judgment, and ought 
               <br />
               not to be presented to any legislative body. 
               <br />
               He held that elective members had received a. 
               <br />
               sacred trust to exercise ; that they were sent 
               <br />
               here by their constituencies to represent them, 
               <br />
               and to do that only. Under these circum- 
               <br />
               stances he would ask, whether they could eon- 
               <br />
               ceive they had the power to vote away the 
               <br />
               rights of their electors ? That was not in their 
               <br />
               mndat, and if they did, they would be 
               <br />
               doing what the had no authority to do ; 
               <br />
               the would be oing what they could not do 
               <br />
               wit out going beyond the authority conﬁded 
               <br />
               to them. Coming to the principle of elective 
               <br />
               legislative councils itself, he might say it.
