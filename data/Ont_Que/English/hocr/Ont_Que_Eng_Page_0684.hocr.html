               that this explanation of the Honorable Attor- 
               <br />
               ney General is more explicit and much more 
               <br />
               elaborate than the explanation we had from 
               <br />
               him in the ﬁrst instance. In commenting 
               <br />
               upon that ﬁrst explanation, I hope I did not 
               <br />
               make use of unparliamentary language. But 
               <br />
               I am entitled surely to draw deductions from 
               <br />
               the announcements made to us from the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches, and I am not bound to 
               <br />
               mince matters if I feel alarmed at the conse- 
               <br />
               quences which may result from the giving of 
               <br />
               this dreadful blow to the Constitution we 
               <br />
               have so long lived under. It is surely not 
               <br />
               unseemly that I should feel keenly on this 
               <br />
               subject, and that, before the Constitution to 
               <br />
               which I am sincerely attached is swept away, 
               <br />
               Ishculd express that indignation which I may 
               <br />
               have expressed somewhat warmly this after- 
               <br />
               noon. (Hear, hear.) Much stronger lan- 
               <br />
               guage has been expressed on the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House, when the motives of the honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen ou the Treasury benches have been 
               <br />
               questioned by honorable gentlemen whose 
               <br />
               intellect perhaps as far transcends mine as day 
               <br />
               outshines night. (Laughton) . But I think 
               <br />
               the country and the House will yet thank me 
               <br />
               for stating, even in the earnest manner I did, 
               <br />
               my alarm in connection with this matter. 
               <br />
               At all events, I have a sincere belief in the

               truth of what I stated. (Hear, hear.)
