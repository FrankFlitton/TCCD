               manifest and untold injustice to that section

               sists of concessions. I would ask what con-

               <br />
               concession has been made to the views of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand</span> why it is that everything 'was

               <br />
               vinces, when they know that the little colony 
               <br />
               of Prince Edward Island, with its eighty 
               <br />
               thousand pe0ple, has as much to say in the 
               <br />
               Conference as Upper Canada with its million 
               <br />
               and a half, and as Lower Canada with its 
               <br />
               million and a quarter of people. (Il ear, 
               <br />
               hear.) When we conceded to them that 
               <br />
               point, the series of concessions on the art 
               <br />
               of Canada began. Then we conceded to t em 
               <br />
               the right of depriving us of an elective 
               <br />
               Legislative Council. (Hear, hear.) Who 
               <br />
               challenges this statement? I def y any hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen to say that it was not at the die- 
               <br />
               tation of the eastern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces,</span> that the 
               <br />
               character of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Legislative Council was 
               <br />
               changed. In order to settle this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point,</span> it is 
               <br />
               only necessary to refer hon. gentlemen to 
               <br />
               what the Hon. Minister of Finance stated in 
               <br />
               his celebrated Sherbrooke speech with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to it. That was concession number 
               <br />
               two. Then look at the proposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution.</span> 
               <br />
               The Lower Provinces had only a population 
               <br />
               of 700,000 people. One would think 
               <br />
               they would be satisﬁed with the same repre- 
               <br />
               sentation in the Legislative Council that 
               <br />
               Upper Canada with double the number of 
               <br />
               people should have, and that Lower Canada 
               <br />
               with nearly double the pepulation should 
               <br />
               be given. But instead of being satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with 24, they must have 28 members. There 
               <br />
               are three distinct and most important con- 
               <br />
               cessions on the part of Canada to the people 
               <br />
               of the eastern provinces. And then we 0 
               <br />
               into the Federation with a debt of on y 
               <br />
               862,500,000, instead of with 882,500,000 
               <br />
               as we were entitled to. Then we are to 
               <br />
               saddle ourselves with a burden of 815,000,- 
               <br />
               000, and give them a bonus for comic in, 
               <br />
