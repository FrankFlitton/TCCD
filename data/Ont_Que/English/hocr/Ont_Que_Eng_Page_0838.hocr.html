               gentlemen before me. It may be that there 
               <br />
               are some even here who are secretly dazzled 
               <br />
               by the magniﬁcent vision, so dear to Ameri—

               can statesmen. of an empire which shall 
               <br />
               spread from sea to sea, and unite every

               scattered state and province from the Gulf 
               <br />
               of Mexico to Hudson’s Bay under one law 
               <br />
               and one rule. Sir, I can understand the 
               <br />
               fascination which such an idea can exercise; 
               <br />
               I can even sympathise with it to some 
               <br />
               extent; and it is just because I do under- 
               <br />
               stand it that I am prepared to oppose 
               <br />
               it to the utmost, believing that in the 
               <br />
               long run the establishment of a power 
               <br />
               so gigantic could not fail 'to be fraught 
               <br />
               with the greatest misfortunes to those 
               <br />
               who might live under it, if not to the whole 
               <br />
               human race. And now, air, to return to 
               <br />
               my subject, I would like to take a rapid 
               <br />
               glance at the perils from which we have but 
               <br />
               lately escaped; and in so doing, I shall 
               <br />
               speak only of those of which I have myself 
               <br />
               been cognizant in my own parliamentary 
               <br />
               career, brief thOugh it is; ‘and I appeal

               <br />
               able gentleman, whether there is anything 
               <br />
               in the events of the past two sessions of 
               <br />
               which we have much reason to feel proud, 
               <br />
               save, perhaps, their closing scene? What 
               <br />
               was our position, Mr. SPEAKER ; what was 
               <br />
               that position which some honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men have the hardihood to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> to regret? 
               <br />
               Two diesolutions granted (though in the

               latter case the Royal prerogative was not 
               <br />
               exercised); three changes of Ministry within 
               <br />
               the space of a single twelvemonth; the fate 
               <br />
               of cabinets dependant on the vote of a single 
               <br />
               capricious or unprincipled individual, in a 
               <br />
               House of 130 members; adeﬁcient revenue 
               <br />
               and a sinking credit; all useful legislation at 
               <br />
               a stand-still-these,'sir, were circumstances 
               <br />
               which might well have ﬁlled us with appre-

               hension, had they occurred in a time of 
               <br />
               profound peace; but which, sir, coming, 
               <br />
               as they did, at a period when we are 
               <br />
               menaced with the gravest danger which 
               <br />
               can befall a free people, would have argued 
               <br />
               us deaf and blind to every lesson which the 
               <br />
               misfortunes of our neighbors ought to teach 
               <br />
               us, had we not embraced the very earliest 
               <br />
               opportunity to extricate ourselves from such 
               <br />
               a position; and the wonder to me is not that 
               <br />
               our statesmen should have shown themselves 
               <br />
               willing to bury their private grudges and 
               <br />
               paltry personal animosities, but rather that 
               <br />
               we could have been infatuated enough to 
               <br />
               permit such a state of things to continue

               that the position of parties in this province,

               the bitterness and virulence of party

               grading and demoralizing us all to a degree

               which it is not pleasant to look back upon 
               <br />
               even now. And so far from regarding the

               union of parties which has taken place as a

               that it was of the greatest importance to our

               since this project has been fairly before us

               a very marked improvement has taken place

               in the whole tone and temper of public

               level of the subject, and to have abandoned

               people of Canada have learned a lesson 
               <br />

               <br />

               both sides may have great political principles
