               climate. The extent of the Canadian terri- 
               <br />
               tory was, perhaps, not deﬁned, but it was suf- 
               <br />
               ﬁciently well known to enable him to state 
               <br />
               that it was as large as many empires in Eu- 
               <br />
               rope, larger than France or Austria. He 
               <br />
               knew that the portion cultivated was, in re- 
               <br />
               spect to its superﬁcial area, only as to the sea- 
               <br />
               coast to the sea itself. We had vast forests 
               <br />
               not yet opened or occupied, and yet we had a 
               <br />
               population numbering over two and a half 
               <br />
               millions of souls. With such an extent of 
               <br />
               territory and so fertile a soil, he had no doubt 
               <br />
               whatever that in less than half a century Ca- 
               <br />
               nada would embrace a population equal to 
               <br />
               that of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the‘</span> large empires of the old world. 
               <br />
               Then with regard to our internal communica 
               <br />
               tions, natural and artiﬁcial, there was the 
               <br />
               noble St. Lawrence, which, with great pro- 
               <br />
               priety, might be called the father of rivers, 
               <br />
               for this stream, in point of navigable extent, 
               <br />
               was longer than any other river in the world. 
               <br />
               Some of its tributaries which would help to 
               <br />
               people the interior, were la r than the ﬁrst-

               <br />
               none such are to be found elsewhere, especially 
               <br />
               in view of the facilities they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span> to trade. 
               <br />
               Then the minerals of Canada, which were 
               <br />
               only now beginningtoattract attention, were of 
               <br />
               the most valuable character, and as practical 
               <br />
               men asserted, much more valuable than the 
               <br />
               richest aurifcrous regions could be. The hon-

               orable member then referred to the artiﬁcial 
               <br />

               <br />

               vantages, natural and acquired, he was bound 
               <br />
               to say we could not become a great nation. 
               <br />
               We labored under a drawback or disadvantage 
               <br />
               which would effectually prevent that, and he 
               <br />
               would defy any one to take a map of the world 
               <br />
