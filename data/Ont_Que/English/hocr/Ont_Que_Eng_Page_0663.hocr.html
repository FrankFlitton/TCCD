               such an analysis would be to abolish all gov-

               ernment and abandon all association. My 
               <br />
               honorable friend went too far; he strengthened 
               <br />
               the position of those it was his avowed ob- 
               <br />
               ject to assail. It was obvious to my own 
               <br />
               mind that every day experience, under approx- 
               <br />
               imately similar circumstances, swept away the 
               <br />
               array of dangers and disasters he conjured up, 
               <br />
               and happily gave us hope that men might 
               <br />
               arise equal to the occasion that in the future 
               <br />
               might arise. Our own political difﬁculties 
               <br />
               may be pointed to as the opposite to this 
               <br />
               experience. The essential difference lies in 
               <br />
               this. Felt injustice creates our present diﬂi- 
               <br />
               culties, whereas, with all the supposed defects 
               <br />
               of the scheme before us, palpable injustice to 
               <br />
               any section cannot be charged against it; and 
               <br />
               in our dilemma have we not had the men 
               <br />
               equal to the occasion ? If we have men at the 
               <br />
               head of our aﬂ'airs, desirous of acting justly 
               <br />
               and uprightly, there is nothing that I have

               my honorable friend, who is now one of the

               <br />
               remain in statu quo. He has before said that 
               <br />
               the union, as at present constituted between 
               <br />
