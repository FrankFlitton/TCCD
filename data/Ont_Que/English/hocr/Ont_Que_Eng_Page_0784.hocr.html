               made to the scheme now before the House.

               At least such is my impression from what

               fell from my honorable friend. I feel ex-

               <br />

               of me and I can assure him in return that I

               say a word or two in reference to what he has 
               <br />
               stated in order that no misconception may 
               <br />
               posm'bly exist on the subject. I placed before 
               <br />
               my constituents, fairly and fully, my views on 
               <br />
               this important question. I indicated to them 
               <br />
               that there were some arts of the scheme 
               <br />
               which, if I had been a elegate to the Con- 
               <br />
               vention, I should have opposed and en- 
               <br />
               deavored to modify. At the same time, I 
               <br />
               stated that we had to accept it as it was, it 
               <br />
               being in the nature of a treaty, or reject it.

               HON. J. S. MACDONALD—I am sure 
               <br />
               my honorable friend will not accuse me of a 
               <br />
               desire wilfully to misrepresent his sition 
               <br />
               in reference to this matter. What meant 
               <br />
               to say, if I did not say it, was this, 
               <br />
               that the scheme, as a whole, is not such as 
               <br />
               the Hon. Postmaster General desires—that 
               <br />
               he himself told his constituents that he enter- 
               <br />
               tained objections to it; and on that I argued 
               <br />
               that if the scheme was so bad as to be unsatis-

               tasteful, the opportunity of placing on record
