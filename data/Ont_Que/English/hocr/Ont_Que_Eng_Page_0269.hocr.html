               Lower Canada in the position of having to 
               <br />
               trust for the protection of their rights to 
               <br />
               the people of Upper Canada, who would 
               <br />
               thereby have the majority in the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Bean)</span> There is at this moment a 
               <br />
               movement on the part of the British Pro- 
               <br />
               testants in Lower Canada to have some 
               <br />
               protection and guarantee for their educa- 
               <br />
               tional establishments in this province put 
               <br />
               into the scheme of Confederation, should it 
               <br />
               be adopted; and far from ﬁnding fault with 
               <br />
               them, I respect them the more for their 
               <br />
               energy in seeking protection for their 
               <br />
               separate interests. I know that majorities 
               <br />
               are naturally aggressive and how the posses- 
               <br />
               sion of power engenders dispotism, and I 
               <br />
               can understand how a majority, animated 
               <br />
               this moment by the best fhelings, might in 
               <br />
               six or nine months be willing to abuse its 
               <br />
               power and trample on the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority, while acting in good faith, and 
               <br />
               on what it considered to be its right. 
               <br />
               We know also the ill feelings that might 
               <br />
               be engendered by such a course. I think 
               <br />
               it but just that the Protestant minority 
               <br />
               should be protected in its rights in 
               <br />
               everything that was dear to it as a dis- 
               <br />
               tinct nationality, and should not lie at the 
               <br />
               discretion of the majority in this respect, 
               <br />
               and for this reason I am ready to extend to 
               <br />
               my Protestant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fellow‘citiaens</span> in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada of British origin, the fullest justice 
               <br />
               in all things, and I wish to see their interests 
               <br />
               as a minority guaranteed and protected in 
               <br />
               every scheme which may be adopted. With 
               <br />
               those views on the question of representa- 
               <br />
               tion, I pronounced in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of a Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion of the two Provinces of Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, as the best means of pro-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moting</span> the varied interests of the two sec— 
               <br />
               tions. But the Confederation I advocated 
               <br />
               was a real confederation, giving the largest 
               <br />
               powers to the local governments, and merely 
               <br />
               a delegated authority tothe General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span>

               <br />
               the one new proposed which gives all the 
               <br />
               powers to the Central Government, and 
               <br />
               reserves for the local governments the 
               <br />
               smallest possible amount of freedom of 
               <br />
               action. There is nothin besides in what I 
               <br />
               have ever written or sai that can be inter- 
               <br />
               preted as favoring a Contederation of all 
               <br />
               the provinces. This I always opposed.

               Hear.) Now, sir, I think I have shown 
               <br />
               t at I neither favored representation by 
               <br />
               population pure and simple, nor a Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation of the provinces; and when honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen state that the necessity of settling 
               <br />
               the question of representation is the ori 'n 
               <br />
               of this Federation scheme, they labor u or 
               <br />
               a grave misapprehension. There is nothing 
               <br />
               further from the fact. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               representation question wasalmost altogether 
               <br />
               abandoned—was played out ; there was no 
               <br />
               agitation about it, and certainly less than- 
               <br />
               there had been for the last ten years. The 
               <br />
               honorable member for South Oxford, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁer</span> 
               <br />
               adopting the views of the Toronto <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cowon-'</span> 
               <br />
               tion, still persisted in advocating representa- 
               <br />
               tion by population, but so changed was the 
               <br />
               feeling that he could hardly get adebate on 
               <br />
               the motion he made last session for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a»</span> com-

               <br />
               ties. There was then another cause for this 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme of which representa- 
               <br />
               tion by population was made the pretext.

               It is not so well known, but-far more power-
