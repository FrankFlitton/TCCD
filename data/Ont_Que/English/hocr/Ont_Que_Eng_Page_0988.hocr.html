               ferent rule from that which has been adopted 
               <br />
               in the other provinces? The Legislature of 
               <br />
               New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick</span> was dissolved in order that 
               <br />
               the people might be appealed to on this 
               <br />
               uestion. The Hon. Attorney General of 
               <br />
               ewfoundland has declared that it is the in- 
               <br />
               tention of the Government of that colon to 
               <br />
               appeal to the peo le upon it, and that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing</span>

               wi ] be done unti their o inion is obtained. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) In Nova tia, too, the Gov 
               <br />
               ernment do not, as I understand, make it a 
               <br />
               government question. It is not to be put 
               <br />
               in that position, and if a diﬁiculty arises in 
               <br />
               having it adopted by the Legislature, the 
               <br />
               Government of Nova Scotia are prepared to 
               <br />
               dissolve their Legislature too. I do not say 
               <br />
               anything about Prince Edward Island—its 
               <br />
               acceptance or rejection of the scheme would 
               <br />
               be ol very small account. But their Legis- 
               <br />
               lature will, no doubt, also be dissolved, in 
               <br />
               order that the people may have an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of expressing their opinions upon it, 
               <br />
               if their House of Assembly is found hostile, 
               <br />
               —a step which, no doubt, our Government 
               <br />
               would have taken if this House had shown 
               <br />
               itself hostile to the measure. Because this 
               <br />
               House is not’hostile, and because Ministers 
               <br />
               found themselves strong enough to carry it 
               <br />
               by a large majority, they declared the 
               <br />
               would take the course they have adopte , 
               <br />
               although in the other provinces the case has 
               <br />
               been put on an entirely diﬁ'erent footing. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, let us consider why 
               <br />
               we should he placed in the same position in 
               <br />
               which the legislatures and pee le of the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces are placed. e hear it 
               <br />
               stated on all sides of this House that the 
               <br />
               whole country is in favor of this measure.

               If so, why should there be any hesitation 
               <br />
               about asking the country to conﬁrm by an 
               <br />
               election that which is so clearly advantageoua 
               <br />
               and which is so sure to be carried? But, 
               <br />
               sir, I hear it said, inside of this House and 
               <br />
               outside of this House, that the pe0ple of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada are opposed to this measure. 
               <br />
               If that be so then—if they are so strong- 
               <br />
               ly opposed to it as has been represented 
               <br />
               —is It a wise step for us to force it upon 
               <br />
               them against their will? (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We are arranging to adopt an entirely 
               <br />
               new state of governmental existence, and 
               <br />
               are proposing to embrace a large area 
               <br />
               of country under this new form of 
               <br />
               government. We are claiming for it, and 
               <br />
               desire that it shall have its best and safest 
               <br />
               foundation in the hearts of the people. And, 
               <br />
               sir, will you not ﬁnd it stronger in the 
               <br />
               hearts <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> more deeply rooted in the esti- 
               <br />
               mation of the people, if you appeal to them 
               <br />
               and obtain their sanction to it and their 
               <br />
               support in carrying it out? (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               In proposing that it shall have the sanction 
               <br />
               of the people, I do not contemplate the 
               <br />
               absurdity, unknown to our form of govern- 
               <br />
               ment, of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂring</span> them for a direct yea or nay 
               <br />
               upon it. No such thing as that has ever 
               <br />
               been entertained in my mind. ' I propose to 
               <br />
               have it done in a constitutional manner. 
               <br />
               My whole political history would have shown 
               <br />
               any man acquainted with it, that there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co.!</span> 
               <br />
               have been no such democratic idea harbored 
               <br />
               by me as to go without the walls of the 
               <br />
               Constitution in order to do an act which 
               <br />
               could be better done within it. Therefore, 
               <br />
               any one who had for a moment the belief, 
               <br />
               that while I was endeavoring to build up, I 
               <br />
               was at the same time putting forth what 
               <br />
               may be called a sacrilegious hand to pull 
               <br />
               down, was very much mistaken as to the 
               <br />
               course I was to pursue—the only proper 
               <br />
               and safe course that could be pursued. If 
               <br />
               you wish to erect this monument of a new 
               <br />
               nationality on the true feelings and hearts 
               <br />
               of the pe0ple, you must erect it upon an 
               <br />
               appeal to them. You should not be afraid of 
               <br />
               it. You may say that diﬁculties will arise 
               <br />
               -—-that other questions will be raised—that 
               <br />
               the elections will not always turn on the 
               <br />
               direct issue—for Confederation or against 
               <br />
               Confederation. But I tell you that it will, 
               <br />
               if the people are so much in favor of this 
               <br />
               project as you say. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               merits or demerits of the candidates will 
               <br />
               be passed to one side, and the vote will 
               <br />
               be taken on the true merits of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion—otherwise the people are not worthy of
