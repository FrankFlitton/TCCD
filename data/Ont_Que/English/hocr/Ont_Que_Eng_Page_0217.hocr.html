               <br />
               meant. (Hear, hear.) I was invited to at- 
               <br />
               tend a very large meeting, com rising nearly 
               <br />
               all the leading merchants in ontreal, just 
               <br />
               after the delegates left for home. We spent 
               <br />
               a whole night over it; I believe it was early 
               <br />
               in the morning before we parted. A third 
               <br />
               part of those present, I think, came apparent- 
               <br />
               y determined to oppose the scheme. Fortu- 
               <br />
               nately we had a gentleman there who had 
               <br />
               made himself thoroughly acquainted with it, 
               <br />
               and who was able to go mto explanations and 
               <br />
               deal with all the whys and wherefores that 
               <br />
               were urged by the various objectors. The 
               <br />
               result was, that when we closed the meeting 
               <br />
               there was only one man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tllho</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drlared</span> himself 
               <br />
               'tivel oposed to e seeme— hear,

               <br />
               cause, in his opinion, it won d give the 
               <br />
               French Canadians power to crush us British 
               <br />
               out of the Lower Provinces. I maintain, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, that the public opinion 
               <br />
               of Canada is not opposed to the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation. (Hear, hear.) If it had been 
               <br />
               so, we should have petitions against it poured 
               <br />
               in upon us from every quarter. I do not 
               <br />
               think the scheme is perfect, but we should try 
               <br />
               with an honest purpose to work it out, and 
               <br />
               if it is found defective, it is not, of course, 
               <br />
               like the laws of the Medea and Persians—it 
               <br />
               can be altered. We have had the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of 1841 altered more than once—twice 
               <br />
               at least—since the union. If we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               some parts of the machinery do not work—if, 
               <br />
               after the establishment of the Confederation, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd some little error has been made—we 
               <br />
               will then, no doubt, have power and authority 
               <br />
               also to alter it. I trust this scheme of Feder- 
               <br />
               ation will be carried by a large majority in 
               <br />
               this House, as well as in the Legislative As- 
               <br />
               sembly, and that the legislatures of the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces will also adopt it. If so, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, we shall enter on a new 
               <br />
               era in the history of British North America. 
               <br />
               Hear, hear.) I believe that a Divine Provi- 
               <br />
               ence guides the destinies of nations, and 
               <br />
               I believe a Divine Providence has directed 
               <br />
               the statesmen who were present at that 
               <br />
               Conference in their deliberations, and has 
               <br />
               brought conﬂicting interests into harmony 
               <br />
               in a most wonderful way. (Hear, hear.)

               What was our political condition on the 
               <br />
               fourteenth of June last— only about eight 
               <br />
               months ago? What was our political con- 
               <br />
               dition then, and what brought the leaders 
               <br />
               of the political parties who were then ﬁerce-

               <br />
               was an over—ruling Providence. A party gov-

               ernment could never have arrived at such a 
               <br />
               scheme of union as this. If we reject this 
               <br />
               proposed Confederation, we refuse to lay the 
               <br />
               foundations of a great nation, as a depen- 
               <br />
               dency of the British Empire. When I came 
               <br />
               of age I considered what country I should 
               <br />
               adopt. I adopted Canada. I have new lived 
               <br />
               in it for forty-four years. I have been iden- 
               <br />
               tiﬁed with the progress of its institutions— 
               <br />
               of those at any rate of Lower Can and 
               <br />
               particularly of Montreal. I have he the 
               <br />
               pleasure of taking part with others in organ- 
               <br />
               izing some of them. I have seen some of 
               <br />
               them prosper, and ‘others that will probably 
               <br />
               fail, as we may expect will be the ease 
               <br />
               in a new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> I have, during these 
               <br />
               years also, traveled over a large part of 
               <br />
               Europe. I have travelled too over parts of 
               <br />
               Asia and Africa. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> have seen peo le under 
               <br />
               monarehical governments—some of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> toler- 
               <br />
               ably prosperous, others of them less so. I 
               <br />
               have seen people under despotic governments 
               <br />
               —-some of them pretty comfortable, and others 
               <br />
               crushed down to the lowest depths of slavery. 
               <br />
               I have seen republican governments in Eu- 
               <br />
               rope, and of course I have seen the great 
               <br />
               Republic here on this continent. I have seen 
               <br />
               people, too, living under the government of 
               <br />
               the Church. But I have seen no people like 
               <br />
               those living under the government of Great 
               <br />
               Britain, or enjoying such rfect freedom, and 
               <br />
               such complete protection or life and roperty, 
               <br />
               as those living under the ﬂag of Old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England.</span> 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) And had I my choiceto make 
               <br />
               to—day, after an esperience of forty—four years, I 
               <br />
               should still choose Canada as my home. I feel 
               <br />
               that at my age I have not long to live ; but, 
               <br />
               during the time that I shall be spared on 
               <br />
               earth, I would be willing to devote all my 
               <br />
               energies to the carrying out of this scheme—- 
               <br />
               and I do pray it may succeed—because it is 
               <br />
               laying anew the foundations of one of the 
               <br />
               most important dependencies of the British 
               <br />
               Empire. I trust I shall not live to see it in 
               <br />
               any other condition than as a dependency of 
               <br />
               the British Empire. Honorable gentlemen,
