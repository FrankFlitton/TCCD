               that in a commercial point of view, that

               SPEAKER, our political and commercial posi- 
               <br />

               Threatened with the abrogation of the Reci- 
               <br />
               procity treaty, a very serious loss will be 
               <br />
               entailed on Canada—if the threat be carried 
               <br />
               into execution—without any advantage ac- 
               <br />
               cruing to the United States. Indeed, 
               <br />
               from the nature of our commercial rela- 
               <br />
               tions with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States—the natural

               result of a trade fostered and carried on

               between the United States and‘ Canada for

               with great distress and serious loss to the 
               <br />

               creasing their carrying trade, and fosters an 
               <br />
               immense trade in the purchase of goods of

               frequently do indulge in strange antics, and

               <br />

               Intercolonial Railroad in voting for the 
               <br />
               scheme in which it is a prominent measure, 
               <br />
               I am more and more convinced of the par-

               amount necessity of immediately settirg about 
               <br />
               the enlargement of our canals. We hear of 
               <br />
               schemes to connect the Georgian Bay with 
               <br />
               Ottawa by way of the French Biver route 
               <br />
               and the Trent route, and sir, perhaps the

               only practicable and shortest route <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">via</span> 
               <br />
               Toronto and Lake Simcoe; but all these only 
               <br />
               divert attention from what really can. and 
               <br />
               ought to be done, at a very triﬂing cost in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comparison</span> with any other scheme—I mean 
               <br />
               the enlargement of the canals we now have. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We have now nine feet of 
               <br />
               water in the St. Lawrence canals, and ten 
               <br />
               feet in the Welland, and the cost of increasing 
               <br />
               the depth of those canals to twelve feet,I am 
               <br />
               told Ly men competent to judge, would be 
               <br />
               triﬂing indeed—probably not over two or 
               <br />
               three millions ot‘ dollars. But if it cost as 
               <br />
               many pounds, I contend that it would not 
               <br />
               really cost the country one cent. If the toll 
               <br />
               of one cent per bushel on grain outward and 
               <br />
               a proportionate rate on inward merchandise 
               <br />
               were enacted, the canals would not only he 
               <br />
               self-sustaining, but would become a source of 
               <br />
               revenue to the provinces. Take for instance, 
               <br />
               what I believe a small estimate, one hundred 
               <br />
               millions of bushels outward, and an equal 
               <br />
               amount inward for other merchandise, and 
               <br />
               you would have a revenue of two millions of 
               <br />
               dollars—a sum more than suﬂicient to y 
               <br />
               interest and working expenses. Then, r. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, see the impetus it would give to 
               <br />
               our inland shipping trade, if we could—and 
               <br />
               we could then do so—attract to the St. Law- 
               <br />
               rence route the immense grain crops of the
