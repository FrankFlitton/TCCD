               Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I have stated what, in 
               <br />
               diplomatic phrase, are the views of Her Ma-

               those of the leading journal ; and now I desire 
               <br />
               to quote a few expressions from the last num- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of the Liberal—Whig party in Great Britain. 
               <br />
               Ms. DUNKIN—Ccrtainly, it is a most 
               <br />
               important and inﬂuential publication; and 
               <br />
               there are a few words that I desire to quote 
               <br />
               from an article it contains on this subject. 
               <br />
               The article is in the last or January number 
               <br />
               of the Review, and purports to be in commen-

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               exclusively reserved for the local parliaments, 
               <br />
               this probably not undistinguished writer 
               <br />
               remarks—“Obviously very loosely expressed ; 
               <br />
               for what are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters</span> of a general character, 
               <br />
               and who is to decide whether a matter is of a 
               <br />
               general character or not? * * We should 
               <br />
               prefer to the foregoing enumeration of the 
               <br />
               powers of the Federal Parliament, a simple

               <br />
               ﬂict are very well laid out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> us. In the 
               <br />
               framing of the United States Constitution 
               <br />
               they did not forget to provide for a district 
               <br />
               of Columbia, for a territory within which the 
               <br />
               power of-Congress and the General Govern- 
               <br />
               ment was to be perfectly and unmistakably 
               <br />
               supreme for all purposes. And they did not 
               <br />
               forget to declare that the powers, legislative 
               <br />
               and otherwise, of the Federal authority, were 
               <br />
               to be complete over all the vast territories 
               <br />
               belonging to the nation, and over all its 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smaller</span> ropcrties, such as forts, arsenals, 
               <br />
               dockyar s and the like. We have nothing 
               <br />
               of the kind here; and, at least as regards 
               <br />
               the seat of Government, this is not a mere 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forget.</span> We ﬁnd it stated that “ The seat 
               <br />
               of Government of the Federated Provin- 
               <br />
               ces shall be Ottawa, subject to the royal 
               <br />
               prerogative.” It is distinctly laid down as a 
               <br />
               part of our system that the royal prerogative, 
               <br />
               the right to change the seat of the Federal 
               <br />
               Government at will, is to be maintained. But 
               <br />
               I venture to say that the maintaining of that 
               <br />
               right is simply inconsistent with the practical 
               <br />
               working out of a Federal system. And this 
               <br />
               is a matter involving a good deal of anomaly, 
               <br />

               of the Constitution of the United States knew 
               <br />
