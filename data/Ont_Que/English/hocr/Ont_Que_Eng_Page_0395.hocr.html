               Speaking of the expense which the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment were incurring for the defence of the 
               <br />
               frontier, he said that 30,000 militiamen would 
               <br />
               cost thirty millions of dollars! The honorable 
               <br />
               member has a singular way of calculating. 
               <br />
               The fact is, if we were under the necessity of 
               <br />
               raising an army of 30,000 men, we should not 
               <br />
               pay them at the rate of a dollar, nor even 
               <br />
               three-quarters of a dollar, a head. The hon- 
               <br />
               orable member for Hochelaga knows as well 
               <br />
               as I do that the militia force now on foot and 
               <br />
               doing duty at the frontier, or in garrison in 
               <br />
               the interior, was called out in circumstances 
               <br />
               altogether exceptional, and that the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment were quite unable to control, to the 
               <br />
               extent they would perhaps have desired, the 
               <br />
               rate of pay which was to be allowed. The 
               <br />
               honorable member must likewise be aware 
               <br />
               that those brave militiamen gave the greatest 
               <br />
               proof of their love of country, and in many 
               <br />
               cases made very great sacriﬁces to the detri- 
               <br />
               ment of their own interest and that of their 
               <br />
               families. Many of them were employee in 
               <br />
               commercial houses, some in counting-houses, 
               <br />
               others in workshops, which gave them much 
               <br />
               h' or remuneration than they are now re- 
               <br />
               ceiving from the Government, and I consider 
               <br />
               it very bad taste indeed that any should 
               <br />
               grudge them their paltry pay, under the pre- 
               <br />
               tence that it will be a heavy item on the 
               <br />
               budget. (Hear, hear.) They did not hesi- 
               <br />
               tate, when the country claimed their services, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> risk their health and to give up the comforts 
               <br />
               and delights of home, and I am well assured 
               <br />
               that the people will not grudge them the mis- 
               <br />
               erable half crown which they receive in ex- 
               <br />
               change, and will a prove of what the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment has done uu er the circumstances. The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Hochelaga reproaehes 
               <br />
               the Government with another misdeed. 
               <br />
               The truth is that he ﬁnds something wrong, 
               <br />
               some shortcoming, in every action of the

               <br />
               expresses himself in this manner: “Thus, if

               <br />

               <br />
               were opposed to it, would not that section use

               all their inﬂuence in the General Government

               Well, I ask the House, what is wrong in 
               <br />
               those two clauses? At present, what is our 
               <br />
               position when a bill has the two Houses 
               <br />
               of our Legislature? It is this: the bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'—</span> 
               <br />
               submitted for the sanction of the Governor 
               <br />
               General, and in nearly all cases is sanctioned 
               <br />
               without being referred to the Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov.</span> 
               <br />
               ernment. But if, for instance, the bill relates 
               <br />
               to a divorce, or to any question which con- 
               <br />
               cerns the Imperial Government, or if again 
               <br />
               it is a measure aﬁecting our relations <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> 
               <br />
               our ne' hbors or any other nation, it is then 
               <br />
               reserve for Her Majesty’s sanction. When 
               <br />
               a measure is thus reserved, does the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga suppose that the mem— 
               <br />
               bers of the English Government meet to take 
               <br />
               it into consideration? Not at all; there is 
               <br />
               in the Colonial Oﬂiee a second or a third class 
               <br />
               clerk whose particular business it is, and who 
               <br />
               makes his report to the minister. This report 
               <br />
               decides either the sanction or the disallowance 
               <br />
               of the measure in question. If the measure 
               <br />
               is highly interesting to the country and il 
               <br />
               disallowed, we cannot blame any one and must 
               <br />
               submit, as the Eu lish ministry are not res- 
               <br />
               ponsible to us. Inder the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> 
               <br />
               this danger and inconvenience will no longer 
               <br />
               exist. In a case whereinthe Local Government

               serve for the sanction of the Central Govern-

               ment, if the latter refused their sanction, al-

               tions to turn out the ministry who should set
