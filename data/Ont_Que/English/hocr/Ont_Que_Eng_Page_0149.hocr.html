               I have statistics upon the subject—the

               <br />
               the United States, I wish to show that this 
               <br />
               wonderful development of war power in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               had, that we cannot go on as we have gone. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) In January, 1861, the ships 
               <br />
               of war belonging to the United States were 
               <br />
               83 ; in :December, 1864, they numbered 
               <br />
               671, of which 54 were monitors and iron- 
               <br />
               clads, carrying 4,610 guns, with a tonnage 
               <br />
               of 510,000 tons, and manned by a force of 
               <br />
               51,000 men. These are frightful ﬁgures for 
               <br />
               the capacity of destruction they represent, 
               <br />
               for the heaps of carnage that they represent, 
               <br />
               for the quantity of human blood spilt that 
               <br />
               they represent, for the lust of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conquest</span> that 
               <br />
               they represent, for the evil passlons that 
               <br />
               they represent, and for the arrest of the 
               <br />
               onward progress of civilization that they 
               <br />
               represent. But it is not the ﬁgures which 
               <br />
               give the worst view of the fact—for England 
               <br />
               still carries more guns aﬂoat even than our 
               <br />
               war-making neighbors. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> It is the 
               <br />
               change which has taken place in the spirit

               of the peeple of the Northern States them-

               strong grounds against the prosecution of

               the Mexican war, and published the Bigelow

               <br />
               have grown out of this war. There is

               another and equally serious interest—the

               even attractive to them. When the ﬁrst

               ran through the length and breadth of the 
               <br />
               country; but by and by as the carnage in- 
               <br />
               creased, no newspaper was considered worth 
               <br />
               laying on the breakfast table unless it con- 
               <br />
               tained the story of the butchery of thousands 
               <br />
               of men. “ Only a couple of thousand killed!
