               some things—not so very successful in some 
               <br />
               others. The hon. gentleman' has been a

               not quite certain that I believe in the abso— 
               <br />
               lute omniscience of anybody. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But now, if this Executive Council is to 
               <br />
               have in it, as I am sure it must have, in 
               <br />
               order to work at all, a representation of the 
               <br />
               different provinces, all or nearly all of them, 
               <br />
               let us look for a moment at what will have 
               <br />
               to be its number. There are two ways of 
               <br />
               calculating this—two sets of data on which 
               <br />
               to go. Either we must go upon what I may 
               <br />
               call the wants of the component parts, or we 
               <br />
               may start from the wants of the country as 
               <br />
               a whole. Suppose, then, we start from the 
               <br />
               wants 0: the different provinces. I take it 
               <br />
               that no section of the Confederation can 
               <br />
               well have less than one representative in the 
               <br />
               Cabinet. Prince Edward Island will want 
               <br />
               one; Newfoundland, one. A diﬂieulty pre- 
               <br />
               sents itself with regard to Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               On just the same principle upon which 
               <br />
               Lower Canada wants, for Federal ends, to 
               <br />
               have a proper representation in the Execu- 
               <br />
               tive Council, on that same principle the 
               <br />
               minority populations in Lower Canada will 
               <br />
               each want, and reasonably want, the same 
               <br />
               thing. We have three populations in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada—the French-Canadians, the Irish 
               <br />
               Catholics, and the British Protestants. In 
               <br />
               other words, there are the Catholics, and the 
               <br />
               non-Catholics, and the English-speaking and 
               <br />
               the non-English-speaking,and these two cross- 
               <br />
               llnes of division cut our people into the three 
               <br />
               divisions I have just indicated. Well, if in

               and has done so with no very loud complaint. 
               <br />
               There has never been a time, I think, when 
               <br />
               there was not an Irish Catholic in the Cabi- 
               <br />
               net. There have been times when the number 
               <br />
               of French-Canadians has been less than four, 
               <br />
               and there was then much complaint. Six 
               <br />
               members—four, one and one—are just about 
               <br />
               what you must give to please each section 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada. Well, sir, if there are to 
               <br />
               be six for Lower Canada, there must be six 
               <br />
               or seven for Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadafand</span> you cannot 
               <br />
               very well leave less than three each for Nova 
               <br />
               Seotia and New Brunswick, and, as I have 
               <br />
               said, one each for Newfoundland and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island ; and thus you have an Exe- 
               <br />
               cutive Council of twenty or twenty-one mem- 
               <br />
               bers, besides all we mi ht have to add for other 
               <br />
               provinces ; and this, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%</span> rather think, is a little 
               <br />
               too many. The thing could not ‘be done; 
               <br />
               for so large a Cabinet could never work. 
               <br />
               Suppose then, on the other hand, that we start 
               <br />
               with the idea of limiting the number of our 
               <br />
               Executive Council to meet what I may call the 
               <br />
               exigencies of the country as a whole. Eleven, 
               <br />
               twelve or thirteen—the latter, asan hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber observes,is an unlucky number—will be as 
               <br />
               many as we can possibly allow. Of this 
               <br />
               number one, as before, will he wanted for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and one for Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island. If one is wanted for each of the 
               <br />
               little provinces, New Brunswick and 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia will be sorely discontented 
               <br />
               unless they get, at least, two apiece; and 
               <br />
               neither Lower Canada nor Upper Canada 
               <br />
               will be contented with the three left for each 
               <br />
               of then. And for Lower Canada, in parti- 
               <br />
               cular, how will anyone divide this intractable 
               <br />
               ﬁgure between her French, Irish and 
               <br />
               British? Shall we give them one apiece, 
               <br />
               and ask the French-Canadian element to be 
               <br />
               content with one voice in a cabinet of a 
               <br />
               dozen ?—or, give that element two, without 
               <br />
               satisfying it—so leaving out either the Irish 
               <br />
               or the British, to its intense disgust ?—-or, give 
               <br />
               the preponderating element the whole, to 
               <br />
               the intense disgust of both the others? It 
               <br />
               will be none too easy a task, sir, I think, to 
               <br />
               form an Executive Council with its three 
               <br />
               members for Lower Canada, and satisfy the 
               <br />
