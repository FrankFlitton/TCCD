               Lords on the memorable occasion I have al-

               <br />
               That House might have been constitutionally 
               <br />
               omnipotent, but its physical was not equal to 
               <br />

               <br />
               is proposed to be given to us here? A body 
               <br />
               not at all weighty in the inﬂuence of its mem- 
               <br />
               bers, and which, it is said, will have teshrink 
               <br />
               from the exercise of its prerogatives. I do 
               <br />
               not know whether it will or not. But I had 
               <br />
               rather not give to a body of men limited in 
               <br />
               number—though even so little weighty in the

               <br />

               <br />
               think a much better system could be 
               <br />
               devised—nay, I am sure of it. At all 
               <br />
               events, here is this proposed body, which, 
               <br />
               we are told, is to be Federal, but which is not

               tional check, but it is not to be that either. 
               <br />
               It is rather, I take it, a cleverly devised piece 
               <br />
               of dead-lock machinery, and the best excuse 
               <br />
               made for it is, that it will not be strong enough 
               <br />
               to do near all the harm it æems meant to 
               <br />
               do. Her Majesty’s Government condemns it.

               It may not be necessary that we should say

               with very marked emphasis how we join in
