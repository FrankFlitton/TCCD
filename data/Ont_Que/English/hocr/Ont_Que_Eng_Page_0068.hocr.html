               In the next place, he objected to the manner iü 
               <br />
               which the scheme had been brought down. 
               <br />
               Why, if the Government desired the House to 
               <br />
               vote favorably, did they not act and speak 
               <br />
               understandingly ? Why did they not at once 
               <br />
               bring in the schemes for the local ernments 
               <br />
               and the estimated cost of the ntercolonial 
               <br />
               Railway ? He (Hon. Mr. CURBIB) did not ob- 
               <br />
               jeet to the principle of Confederation. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) No, and he believed there would be 
               <br />
               the most perfect unanimity on the subject, as 
               <br />
               there was among the delegates as to the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of Confederation, but he asked to have, 
               <br />
               as art of the scheme, the cost of the railwa , 
               <br />
               which seemed to be part and parcel of it. e 
               <br />
               knew little of this project, where it was to 
               <br />
               commence and where to end, or how man ends 
               <br />
               it was to have. We heard there was to one 
               <br />
               branch from Truro to Pietou; and then it was 
               <br />
               said again that the road must pass through the 
               <br />
               valley of the St. John, and end in that city. 
               <br />
               Were we to accept the project without inform- 
               <br />
               ation? Were we to have a road to Halifax? 
               <br />
               to purchase the Grand Trunk to Rivière du 
               <br />
               Loup and the link from Truro to Halifax, all 
               <br />
               of them to enter and form part of the national 
               <br />
               railway ? Notwithstanding the admitted talent 
               <br />
               of the delegates, he contended that a manifest 
               <br />
               injustice had been done to Canada, and espe— 
               <br />
               cially to Upper Canada, in the distribution of 
               <br />
