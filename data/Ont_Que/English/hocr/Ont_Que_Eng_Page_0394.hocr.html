               <br />
               will not heap reproaches upon us for having 
               <br />
               given them a Constitution, the object of which 
               <br />
               is to protect their local and general rights in a

               honorable member for Hochelaga did not

               neglect also to make a slight insinuation against 
               <br />
               the delegates to the Conference. In fact, he 
               <br />
               says :—

               The honorable member must have a very mean 
               <br />
               opinion of human nature, to suppose that pub-

               <br />
               in the eyes of the world, would agree to betray

               lieutenant-governor or of chief justice. I am 
               <br />
               willing to believe that that insinuation was a 
               <br />
               slip of the tongue, and that he is already sorry 
               <br />
               thatit ever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">escaped</span> from his lips. Another 
               <br />
               point on which the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Hochelaga enlarged, is the militia question and 
               <br />
               the defence of the country. On this head, 
               <br />
               the honorable member declares that he cannot 
               <br />
               understand how the union of the provinces is 
               <br />
               to increase our strength. The experience of 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Hochelaga and the 
               <br />
               teachings of history ought, however, to have 
               <br />
               taught him that a disunited people, scattered 
               <br />
               over a vast extent of territory, must be an 
               <br />
               easier conquest than one which is united under 
               <br />
               a single strong and respected government. 
               <br />
               This brings me to speak of another observation 
               <br />
               made by the honorable member, who declared 
               <br />
               that our best policy, in order to avoid all diﬂi- 
               <br />
               culty with our neighbors, and escape the evils 
               <br />
               of a war, would be to remain quiet and sit 
               <br />
               with our arms across. The House will permit

               It would be a piece of folly for us to raise a

               <br />

               and to give no pretext to our neighbors for 
               <br />

               I think, as the honorable member does, that 
               <br />
               we ought not to give any just cause of dissatis- 
               <br />
               faction to our neighbors, and still less attack 
               <br />
               their frontier; and the present Government 
               <br />
               have given proof, on all occasions, that they 
               <br />
               are disposed to respect the rights and opinions 
               <br />
               of the American people. But, on the other 
               <br />
               hand, the honorable member is the ﬁrst to 
               <br />
               inform us that the best means of defending 
               <br />
               ourselves is, not to be ready and accustomed 
               <br />
               to the use of arms, but to remain unarmed, 
               <br />
               with our arms across like men of peace—in 
               <br />
               plain terms, to give ourselves up, bound hand 
               <br />
               and foot. Now, I will ask him a plain ques- 
               <br />
               tion. If he were apprehensive of an attack 
               <br />
               from a neighbor of his, would he go to him 
               <br />
               and say, “ tlere 1 am, do what you please with 
               <br />
               me,” or would he not rather be prepared to 
               <br />
               meet an attack ? I rather think that the 
               <br />
               honorable member would not belong in makin 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               up his mind as to which course he woul

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               take. Now, that which is wise and politic in 
               <br />
               an individual is equally wise and politic in 
               <br />
               the case of a nation. We are not desirous of 
               <br />
               assuming a threatening attitude towards our 
               <br />
               neighbors. On the contrary, our wish is to 
               <br />
               live with them in peace and quietness. We 
               <br />
               are anxious not to do the least act which can 
               <br />
               be construed into a threat; but we should be 
               <br />
               lamentably blind if, with the enormous mili- 
               <br />
               tary armament of our neighbors before our 
               <br />
               eyes, we looked at this formidable military 
               <br />
               display with our arms across, and a careless 
               <br />
               disregard of its greatness in our hearts. Such 
               <br />
               an attitude would neither be patriotic nor 
               <br />
               worthy of a nation of free men. The most 
               <br />
               certain way to avoid an attack and subjugation 
               <br />
               by our neighbors, to have our independence 
               <br />
               and our privileges respected, is to shew them 
               <br />
               that we are prepared to defend them at any 
               <br />
               cost. The honorable member for Hochelaga 
               <br />
               has declared that he is prepared to make some 
               <br />
               sacriﬁces to defend the country, but he has 
               <br />
               not told us how much he is ready to do in 
               <br />
               that behalf. Perhaps he will let us know at 
               <br />
               a future time, if we are called upon to spend 
               <br />
               money for the purpose. However that may 
               <br />
               be, I must animadvert on the remarks which 
               <br />
               he has made with regard tothe volunteers.
