               the debts were to be divided and that the in-

               <br />

               <br />
               imposed entirely on Lower Canada. If there 
               <br />
               are any verbal explanations beyond what is 
               <br />
               cmtained in the resolutions, I am quite wil- 
               <br />
               ling to receive them from the Government, 
               <br />
               but that is just the reason why we should not 
               <br />
               be in a hurry to adopt these resolutions until 
               <br />
               we have those explanations, for it might be 
               <br />
               dangerous not to have all these questions 
               <br />
               settled before voting for Confederation ; who 
               <br />
               can sa whether we can settle them as well after 
               <br />
               as ore ? These promises of explanations 
               <br />
               shew that, since all the facts are not submitted, 
               <br />
               we ma easily mistake the meaning of the 
               <br />
               resolutaons which we are called upon to adopt. 
               <br />
               In any case, I certainly see nothing in these 
               <br />
               resolutions which gives the seigniors the 
               <br />
               guarantee of the Confederation as security for 
               <br />
               their claim, and I can only judge of the reso—

               ago, when speaking of the school question, I 
               <br />
               would not vote for a Constitution which would 
               <br />
               not confer on the Catholics of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               the same advantages as are possessed by the 
               <br />
               Protestants of Lower Canada, and I consider 
               <br />
               that this is a matter that should be settled 
               <br />
               before taking a vote on the resolutions, for 
               <br />
               when Confederation is once voted it may 
               <br />
               easily happen that we shall not be able to 
               <br />
               obtain what is promised us now. We there- 
               <br />
               fore are in a position which may make us 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce the minority of Upper Canada by 
               <br />
               voting Confederation now, or make us vote 
               <br />
               against a principle which we might perhaps 
               <br />
               accept, if we were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acîuainted</span> with all its 
               <br />
               details. For my part, acknowledge that I 
               <br />
               would not cause the plan of Confederation 
               <br />
               which is proposed to us to miscarry, if it is 
               <br />
               possible to make it just, acceptable and useful 
               <br />
               to all parties. But for this I will not sacri- 
               <br />
               ﬁce the interests of a portion of the popula- 
               <br />
               tion. Another point upon which we re uire 
               <br />
               explanations, and respecting which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law</span> 
               <br />
               none, is that relating to the constitution of the 
               <br />
               local governments. Now, for instance, some 
               <br />
               journals which usually express the views and 
               <br />
               opinions of the present Government, have 
               <br />
               stated that in all the local governments the 
               <br />
               system of responsibility of the ministers to 
               <br />
               the people or their representatives would not 
               <br />
               exist, but that an irresponsible system would 
               <br />
               be substituted for it. I ask which of you 
               <br />
               would accept such a system, and what part 
               <br />
               of the peop e would approve of such an altera- 
               <br />
               tion in our political institutions? You are 
               <br />
               told “ vote for the plan submitted to you, and 
               <br />
               the details will be explained to you at a later 
               <br />
               period.” But at a later period neither Upper 
               <br />
               nor Lower Canada will be master of the posi— 
               <br />
               tion, and able to obtain the system of govern- 
               <br />
               ment which may suit them, should that 
               <br />
               imposed upon them not meet their views. 
               <br />
               But, yet once more, why hurry you so much ? 
               <br />
               Why, for instance, should this House be 
               <br />
               called upon to sit twice a-day on this uestion 
               <br />
               before even its details are known ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amy</span> dc- 
               <br />
               part from our custom of examining matters in 
               <br />
               a calm and deliberate manner. Certainly, up 
               <br />
               to the present time, not one valid reason has 
               <br />
               been given to justify the hurry in which it is 
               <br />
               proposed to carry this measure. Mention has 
               <br />
               indeed been made of defence, but this is no 
               <br />
               valid reason, for it is perfectly well known 
               <br />
               that all the resources of Canada are now at 
               <br />
               the disposal of England in case of need; this

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               reéipitate action is then neither justiﬁed nor
