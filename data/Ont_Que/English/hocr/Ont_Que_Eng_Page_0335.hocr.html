               <br />
               deavor to answer an objection made by the 
               <br />
               Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lands 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL) to the motion of the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Niagara (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               CUBRIE). He would make it appear that 
               <br />
               the motion is inconsistent with the position 
               <br />
               taken by the honorable member who seconded 
               <br />
               the motion, because he declared himself as 
               <br />
               favorable to Confederation. For my part, I 
               <br />
               can see no inconsistency in the proceeding 
               <br />
               of the honorable member, who merely asks 
               <br />
               that time be allowed that the people may 
               <br />
               give their opinions on the question. He 
               <br />
               does not care in what manner it is allowed. 
               <br />
               If the Government do allow time for the 
               <br />
               purpose, it will rest with themtosay whether 
               <br />
               the question shall be submitted to the peeple 
               <br />
               by means of a general election, or some 
               <br />
               other way. The amendment of the honor- 
               <br />
               able member for Niagara does not suggest 
               <br />
               any particular way of submitting the ques- 
               <br />
               tion to the country. He only asks that 
               <br />
               it be so submitted, leaving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to choose the most convenient method 
               <br />
               of doing it. And this is exactly the position 
               <br />
               which I have myself taken. I have told 
               <br />
               honorable members who seemed to believe 
               <br />
               me altogether opposed to Confederation, that 
               <br />
               it is not the case, that I only want time to 
               <br />
               ascertain whether the eople are in favor of 
               <br />
               the scheme or not. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anly</span> if the project is 
               <br />
               submitted to the people, it is desirable that 
               <br />
               it be presented to them in all its details, 
               <br />
               and not in the skeleton shape in which it 
               <br />
               is now laid before us. I have no intention 
               <br />
               to weary the attention of the House, but I 
               <br />
               thought it right to express my views and 
               <br />
               say why I intend to vote in favor of the 
               <br />

               HON. MR. AIKINS said — Hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men, when I last had the honor of address- 
               <br />
               ing the House, it will be remembered by 
               <br />
               those hon. gentlemen who were present that I 
               <br />
               spoke very strongly in relation to the changes 
               <br />
               contemplated by these resolutions in refer- 
               <br />
               ence to this Chamber. Since then, although 
               <br />
               I have listened very attentively to the 
               <br />
               speeches of honorable gentlemen, I have 
               <br />
               heard no good reason to convince me that the 
               <br />
               elective principle as re ds this honorable 
               <br />
               House should be abolished. It has‘ been 
               <br />
               asserted by those who are strong advocates 
               <br />
               of Confederation, that if any amendment 
               <br />
               is passed aﬁ'ectiog the general principles of 
               <br />
               the resolutions, itwill be considered a defeat ; 
               <br />
               that the scheme will have to be considered 
               <br />
               again, and that n tiations with the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces wil have to be resumed 
               <br />
               in order to meet the altered view of the case. 
               <br />
               Had the amendment of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Wellington (Hon. Mr. SANBOBN) been car- 
               <br />
               ried, this might have been the case ; but as 
               <br />
               the motion which I amabout to move applies 
               <br />
               only to the Canadas, that would not be so. 
               <br />
               It will be remembered that that amendment 
               <br />
               aﬁrmed not only the elective principle for all 
               <br />
               the provinces, but that the life members who 
               <br />
               are now sitting in this House should continue 
               <br />
               to hold their seats. It went further and 
               <br />
               declared that a number to correspond with 
               <br />
               the life members should be admitted to the 
               <br />
               Chamber from the Maritime Provinces. In 
               <br />
               referring to the vote which was taken on this 
               <br />
               amendment, I ﬁnd that in the 4l votes cast 
               <br />
               against it, 11 of the life members of the 
               <br />
               House voted against, while only three voted 
               <br />
               for it ; thus they, by a large majority vote, 
               <br />
               negatived the principles therein <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afﬁrmed.</span> I 
               <br />
               refer to this particularly, for this reason, that 
               <br />
               the ground may be taken by the lilc mem- 
               <br />
               bers in this Chamber that my amendment is 
               <br />
               specially directed against, and if carried, 
               <br />
               would be applicable to these hon. gentle-
