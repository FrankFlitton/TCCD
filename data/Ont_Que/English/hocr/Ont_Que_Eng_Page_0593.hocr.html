               not asked for it ourselves. At any rate it is

               Nor does the proposed Constitution speak

               of doing away with this tribunal,

               peal which the Federal Government has 
               <br />
               the power of creating. H ere the Conven-

               <br />
               question to the Government :—If this Court 
               <br />
               of Appeal be established, will it be a .purely 
               <br />
               civil tribunal, or a constitutional one? Or 
               <br />
               will it be at the same time civil and con- 
               <br />
               stitutional? If it be a civil tribunal, will 
               <br />
               it have jurisdiction over Lower Canada?

               HON. A'r'rY. GEN. CARTIER —The 
               <br />
               question put by my hon. friend the member 
               <br />
               for Montmorency is one which it is not easy 
               <br />
               for the Government to answer, inasmuch as 
               <br />
               the power conferred by that article is only 
               <br />
               that of creating a Court of Appeal at some 
               <br />
               future day, and the jurisdiction of that court 
               <br />
               will depend on the causes which lead to its 
               <br />
               creation. The hon. member has very justly 
               <br />
               remarked that it may become necessary at 
               <br />
               a future period to constitute such a tribunal. 
               <br />
               At present the several provinces which are 
               <br />
               to form part of the Conlederation have the 
               <br />
               same court of ﬁnal appeal. As long <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> we 
               <br />
               keep up our connection with the Mother 
               <br />
               Country, we shall always have our court of 
               <br />
               ﬁnal appeal in Her Majesty’s Privy Council. 
               <br />
               But when the British Provinces on this con- 
               <br />
               tinent are united by the bond of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, we shall have one uniform system, 
               <br />
               common to all, in regard to imports, bills of 
               <br />
               exchange and promissory notes, as well as 
               <br />
               universal jurisprudence. Accordingly, when 
               <br />
               we have lived some years under the Federal 
               <br />

               <br />
               Appeal with jurisdiction in such matters will 
               <br />
               be felt, and, if it is created, it will be ﬁtthat 
               <br />
               its jurisdiction should extend to civil causes 
               <br />

               Provinces, because it will necessarily be

               composed of the most eminent judges in the

               ment on a judgment rendered by a Lower 
               <br />

               <br />
               on the bench men perfectly versed in the 
               <br />
               knowledge of the laws of that section of the 
               <br />
               Confederation, who will be able to give the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of their lights to the other judges 
               <br />
               sitting with them. I must observe to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the member for Montmorency, 
               <br />
               that he disparages the civil law of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada in the estimate he makes of it; but 
               <br />
               he need be under no uneasiness on that 
               <br />
               head. He should not forget that if, at this 
               <br />
               day, the laws of Lower Canada are so re- 
               <br />
               markably well understood in Her Majesty’s , 
               <br />
               Privy Council, it is because the code of 
               <br />
               equity, which is a subject of deep study and 
               <br />
               familiar knowledge among the members of 
               <br />
               the council, is based on Roman law, as our 
               <br />
               own code is. All the eminent judges, 
               <br />
               whether in England, in the Maritime Pro— 
               <br />
               vinces or in Upper Canada, are profoundly 
               <br />
               versed in those principles of equity, which 
               <br />
               are identical with those of our civil code. 
               <br />
               Now, as to my own personal opinion, respect- 
               <br />
               ing the creation of that tribunal, I think 
               <br />
               that it is important not to establish it until 
               <br />
               a certain number of years shall have elapsed 
               <br />
               from the establishment of Confederation, 
               <br />
               and to make it consist of judges from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               several provinces; for this court would have 
               <br />
               to give ﬁnal judgment in causes pronounced 
               <br />
               upon in the courts of all the sections. N ei- 
               <br />
               ther can I tell what functions and powers 
               <br />
               might be assigned to it by the act establishing 
               <br />
               it. Time alone can tell us that; but I do 
               <br />
               hold, and the spirit of the conference at 
               <br />
               Quebec indicated, that the appeal to the 
               <br />
               judicial committtee of Her Majesty’s Privy 
               <br />
               Council must always exist, even if the court 
               <br />
               in question is established.
