               <br />

               equally true that these unions were brought

               about by the Parliaments of those countries 
               <br />

               fore us, on which I said a few words when I 
               <br />
               last addressed the House on this subject. 
               <br />
               We have heard much about the preposed 
               <br />
               new constitution of the Legislative Council. 
               <br />
               We have been told it was political necessity 
               <br />
               that ﬁrst forced the elective system on minds 
               <br />
               that were by no means enamoured of it, and 
               <br />
               this, I think, has been fully established. 
               <br />
               Now, it would ill become me, as an elected 
               <br />
               member, to dwell on any merits or excel- 
               <br />
               lencies the elective system may have possessed 
               <br />
               as applied to this branch of the Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture—it is a subject we can none of us touch 
               <br />
               upon with the same freedom which we might 
               <br />
               if we were not ourselves elected-but I may 
               <br />
               call the attention of the House to this, that 
               <br />
               none of the evils that were dreaded, as likely

               all reasonable, much less necessary, that they 
               <br />
               should be anticipated in time to come. My 
               <br />
               own views were in perfect accord with those 
               <br />
               of hon. gentlemen who protested against the 
               <br />
               system when it was ﬁrst introduced. I did 
               <br />
               not then consider it an improvement, and 
               <br />
               my views have not changed since; I have, 
               <br />
               consequently, no personal predilections for 
               <br />
               an Elective Council, but far prefer a Chamber 
               <br />
               nominated by the Crown. But I am not here 
               <br />
               to carry out only my personal views or pre— 
               <br />
               dilections, but to guard the rights and privi- 
               <br />
               leges of my constituents; and I would remind 
               <br />
               hon. members that it is one thing to concede a 
               <br />
               privilege, but a very diﬂ'erent thing to take it 
               <br />
               away. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Bean)</span> A privilege may be con- 
               <br />
               ceded unasked, but it is a dangerous thing 
               <br />
               to take it away unasked or unassented to. 
               <br />
               (Hear. hear ) I cannot ﬁnd either that the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government made any endeavor to 
               <br />
               maintain the elective principle ; I cannot see 
               <br />
               that the nomination system was forced on 
               <br />
               them by the wishes of the Lower Provinces. 
               <br />
               It may have been the desire of some of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces to maintain their nomi- 
               <br />
               nation system, but the change in ours was 
               <br />
               one which obviously met the wishes of the 
               <br />
               members of this Government, and no effort 
               <br />
               appears to have been made by them to pre- 
               <br />
               serve to the people of this country the privi- 
               <br />
               lege they now enjoy of electing members of 
               <br />
               this House. (Hear.) I think, also, that 
               <br />
               there are objectionable features in certain 
               <br />
               provisions of the scheme for which the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government are responsible. I 
               <br />
               speak notas an opponent, but as one of their 
               <br />

               <br />
               to keep them from doing a wrong. It is not
