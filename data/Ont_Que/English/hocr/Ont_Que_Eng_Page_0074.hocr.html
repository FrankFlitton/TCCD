               <br />

               may be, in case of awar with the United

               <br />
               ﬁciently united. We had our duties, with 
               <br />
               regard to England, to perform. In order to 
               <br />
               secure the exercise of her power in our defence 
               <br />
               we must help her ourselves. We could not do 
               <br />
               this satisfactorily or efﬁciently unless we had 
               <br />
               a Confederation. When all united, the enemy 
               <br />
               would know that, if he attacked an part of
