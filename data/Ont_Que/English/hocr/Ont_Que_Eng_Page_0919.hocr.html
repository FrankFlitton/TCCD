               <br />
               likely to work well for the future of the 
               <br />
               country? Is it likely to prove a satisfactory 
               <br />
               solution of the very ave political diﬁicul- 
               <br />
               ties that beset us ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I:</span> would be in vain to 
               <br />
               attempt to conceal from ourselves that 
               <br />
               Canada is at this moment approaching the 
               <br />
               most critical period of her hitherto existence. 
               <br />

               <br />
               Great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> momentous events are tranSpiring 
               <br />
               just beyond our frontier—events which have 
               <br />
               already seriously and inj uriously affected us 
               <br />
               commercially, and which must inevitably, in 
               <br />
               some way or other, affect us politically. A 
               <br />
               people until recently devoted only to indus- 
               <br />
               trial pursuits and the development of their 
               <br />
               country, have suddenly expanded into a 
               <br />
               great military power. To use their own 
               <br />
               expression, the Americans are “ making 
               <br />
               history very fast,” and it is impossible that 
               <br />
               that eventful history can be manufactured in 
               <br />
               a territory separated from our own by little 
               <br />
               more than an imaginary line, without our 
               <br />
               having eventually some part in its pages, 
               <br />
               for' good or for evil. In fact we cannot 
               <br />
               conceal from ourselves that some great change 
               <br />
               is impending over the destinies of our 
               <br />
               country—a change that will present itself to 
               <br />
               us in some form or other, and that before 
               <br />
               long, without its being in our power to avert, 
               <br />
               though it may be in our power to shape it.

               see it in the tone of the press, in the par- 
               <br />
               liamentary debates and elsewhere. We are 
               <br />
               told that we are giving more trouble to the 
               <br />
               Mother Country than we are worth. A simi- 
               <br />
               lar feeling of want of conﬁdence, amounting 
               <br />
               almost to contempt, has always prevailed 
               <br />
               towards us in the United States. The 
               <br />
               ignorance of everything relating to Canada 
               <br />
               —-of our political and social condition— 
               <br />
               of our resources and our commerce—our 
               <br />
               growth and our progress—that exists among 
               <br />
               our kindred across the border, cannot fail to 
               <br />
               have surprised those who have mingled 
               <br />
               much among them, and if not altogether 
               <br />
               creditable to them is certainly very humi- 
               <br />
               liating to us; but, great as the ignorance is 
               <br />
               there, it is fully equalled by that which 
               <br />
               exists with respect to Canada, and all per- 
               <br />
               taining to Canada, among our nearer and 
               <br />
               dearer kindred in the old world. What can 
               <br />
               we do to remedy this unfortunate and humi- 
               <br />
               liating state of things? What can we do 
               <br />
               to inspire conﬁdence in us abroad; to 
               <br />
               command respect; todefy contempt? These 
               <br />
               appear to me to be the practical questions 
               <br />
               We are plainly 
               <br />
               told by England that we must rely more 
               <br />
               upon our own resources in the future than 
               <br />
               we have done in the past, and it isright and 
               <br />
               just we should do so. It appears to me that 
               <br />
               there are just three states of political 
               <br />
               existence possible for us here, when we 
               <br />
               emerge from the chrysalis-form in which we 
               <br />
               have hitherto existed. First, there is the 
               <br />
               attempt to stand alone as a separate nation- 
               <br />
               ality on this continent—that is one alterna- 
               <br />
               tive. Secondly, there is the prospect held 
               <br />
               out sin the resolutions—namely, a union 
               <br />
               of al e British North American Colonies, 
               <br />
               under the ﬂag of England, becoming more 
               <br />
               and more every year a homogeneous British 
               <br />
               people, and building up a consolidated British 
               <br />
               power on this continent. The last and 
               <br />
               inevitable alternative, if we reject the other 
               <br />
               two, is exactly that stated by my honorable 
               <br />
               friend from South Lanark (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mounts)—</span> 
               <br />
               absorption into the United States. It is in 
               <br />
               vain to shut our eyes to that fact, or that 
               <br />
               the time is at hand when we will have to 
               <br />
               make our selection. I know that the latter 
               <br />
               alternative—and I can speak from as 
               <br />
               thorough an acquaintance with the 
               <br />
               wants, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelings</span> and wishes of the people 
               <br />
               of Canada as any honorable gentleman in 
               <br />
               this House possesses—would be most dis- 
               <br />
               tasteful to the great mass of the people of 
               <br />
               this country. (Loud cheers.) To myself 
               <br />
               personally, it would be so distasteful that it
