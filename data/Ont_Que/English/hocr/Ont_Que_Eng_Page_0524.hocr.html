               <br />
               ter.) Mr. SPEAKER, let me once again 
               <br />
               make reference to Canadian history. Just 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the union of the Canadas, and after 
               <br />
               it, the late Lord SYDENEIAM, who was cer- 
               <br />
               .tainly not a fool, thought he would try a 
               <br />
               political experiment. I believe he made no 
               <br />
               secret of its being, to his own mind, an ex- 
               <br />
               periment, npr yet of the fact that he did not 
               <br />
               suppose it would so far succeed as to last 
               <br />
               long. He was very anxious to introduce 
               <br />
               into Canada a municipal system. Well, he 
               <br />
               tried ﬁrst to get such a s stem embodied in 
               <br />
               the Union Act ; but he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[failed</span> in that. He 
               <br />
               aﬁerwards got his enactment passed as he 
               <br />
               wished, for Lower Canada, by the Special 
               <br />
               Council, and for Upper Canada by the Ca- 
               <br />
               nadian Parliament at its ﬁrst session. That 
               <br />
               system had in it certain features of this 
               <br />
               scheme now prOposed for our Confederation. 
               <br />
               Each municipal district was to have its 
               <br />
               warden appointed by the Governor General, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> to have its elected district council, or 
               <br />
               little legislature of one chamber. The powers 
               <br />
               of that little legislature, or large municipal 
               <br />
               body, were well stated. There was no mis- 
               <br />
               take as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂat</span> how far it could go. The 
               <br />
               power of disallowing by-laws passed by it, 
               <br />
               and also that of nominating the warden, 
               <br />
               were carefully reserved to Government. And, 
               <br />
               mind you, my Lord SYDENHAM did not 
               <br />
               make the blunder of letting his wardens 
               <br />
               hold otherwise than during pleasure. He 
               <br />
               kept in his own hands all needed control 
               <br />
               over them; and, by the way, he kept, too, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> was most material, the power of dis- 
               <br />
               solving any refractory council, in the hands 
               <br />
               Of Government. The whole thing was nicely 
               <br />
               arranged, and was meant to work, and Lord 
               <br />
               SYD. NHAM probably thought it would work 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> some few years, and that then the dis- 
               <br />
               tricts would outgrow the system, and elect 
               <br />
               their own wardens and pass their by-laws 
               <br />
               freely. But, Mr. SPEAKER, the plan never 
               <br />

               "1 Upper Canada; and the ﬁrst thing 
               <br />
               done by the next Parliament was to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sweep</span> it all away—nominated wardens and

               <br />
               in this case. Your Lieutenant-Governor will 
               <br />
               be felt to have a real power, not a sham 
               <br />
               one. What your petty districts would not 
               <br />
               put up with ﬁve and twenty years ago, your 
               <br />
               provinces will not put up with now. Is a larger 
               <br />
               illustration wanted ? One comes readily to 
               <br />
               hand. The Imperial Government used once to 
               <br />
               try the experiment of sending out governors 
               <br />
               to colonies having representative institutions, 
               <br />
               without instructing them to pay due deference 
               <br />
               to those institutions, and it led to a most la- 
               <br />
               mentable failure. (Hear, hear.) Are we 
               <br />
               going to try to work, in all these provinces, a 
               <br />
               worse system than that which, when worked 
               <br />
               from the Colonial Oﬁce at home, resulted in 
               <br />
               what Lord DURHAM well called “constituted 
               <br />
               anarchy ?” If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> are, how long may we 
               <br />
               count on putting off the conﬂict of authority 
               <br />
               that shall and in a complete crash of the en- 
               <br />
               tire fabric ? (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               I have not come to the crowning difﬁculties of 
               <br />
               this case, even yet. Not at all. Between 
               <br />
               the states of the United States, as I have al- 
               <br />
               ready stated, while there is an essential iden- 
               <br />
               tity of constitution, therc is at the same time 
               <br />
               acarefully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distinct</span> separation of powers and 
               <br />
               functions. I do not say that the dividing 
               <br />
               line is drawn exactly where it should be, but 
               <br />
               that there is a distinct dividing line, no one 
               <br />
               can gainsay. But how do we stand here, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, as to the attributes of our own 
               <br />
               provincial legislatures and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments,</span> on 
               <br />
               the one hand, and those of the Federal power 
               <br />
               on the other? Do we follow American ex- 
               <br />
               ample, and give so much to the union and the 
               <br />
               rest to the provinces; or so much to them, 
               <br />
               and the rest to it? Either rule would be 
               <br />
               plain; but this plan follows neither. It sim- 
               <br />
               ply gives us a sort of special list for each; 
               <br />
               making much common to both, and as to 
               <br />
               much more, not shewing .what belongs to 
               <br />
               either. I cannot go now—itis impossible for 
               <br />
               me at this hour of the night to go—into de- 
               <br />
               tail on this head. I can give no more than 
               <br />
               some few specimens; and I take ﬁrst the three 
               <br />
               subjects of the ﬁsheries, agriculture, and im- 
               <br />
               migration. These three subjects are equally 
               <br />
               assrgned to the General Legislature on the one 
               <br />
               hand, and the Provincial Legislature on the 
               <br />
               other. It is provided by the 45th resolution, 
               <br />
               that in all such cases, wherever any statutes 
               <br />
               of the general and local parliaments clash, 
               <br />
               those of the General Parliament shall over- 
               <br />
               ride those of the local. So that in these 
               <br />
               matters of the ﬁsheries, agriculture and 
               <br />
               immigration, either the local legislatures 
               <br />
               must not legislate at all, or if they do 
               <br />
