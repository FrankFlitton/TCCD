               <br />
               asked. The House understands, of course, 
               <br />
               that the Crown lands of the provinces are 
               <br />
               retained under the Confederation scheme by 
               <br />
               each individual province. It was found ne—

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">œœary</span> that they should be retained in order

               funds to carry on the local government. In

               <br />
               honorable gentleman will see that if we do 
               <br />
               not allow the Local Government in New 
               <br />
               Brunswick to collect these dues in this way, 
               <br />
               the revenue which is derived in Canada from 
               <br />

               not the case. (Hear, hear.) Then, with re-

               New Brunswick for a period of ten cars, it 
               <br />
               was found necessary because during t at time

               <br />
               we had to submit with what grace we could.

               All I can say is that I wish very heartil that

               ble for her to fulﬁl her engagements. It 
               <br />
               would of course have been idle to have gone 
               <br />

               federation would be responsible for the claims 
               <br />
               of her creditors. The engagements into which 
               <br />
               she had entered involved a subvention of the 
               <br />
               railways of the province. In New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick they thought it better, rather than take

               <br />
               Thus liabilities were incurred which of course 
               <br />
               it was necessary to redeem. Well, New Bruns-
