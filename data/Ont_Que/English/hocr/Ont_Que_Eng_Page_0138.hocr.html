               that the assimilation of tariffs would be an

               the machinery of the government. He also 
               <br />
               admitted the advantage of having ocean <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sea</span> 
               <br />
               ports of our own, though he was not prepared 
               <br />
               to attach so much importance to that as some 
               <br />
               other honorable members. We were told that 
               <br />
               no inland country could ever be great, and 
               <br />
               that so long as we had no Opening to the sea 
               <br />
               we could not expect rmanent prosperity. 
               <br />
               He was quite proper to say that access to 
               <br />
               the ocean through the ports of St. John, N .B., 
               <br />
               and Halifax, was very desirable, but he was 
               <br />
               not at all certain that the grand effects pro- 
               <br />
               claimed would be realized. It was no doubt 
               <br />
               very desirable to secure all these advantages, 
               <br />
               but the measure contained some provisions 
               <br />
               which, if carried out, would, as he believed, 
               <br />
               be highly injurious to both the general and 
               <br />
               local governments. Then he must say he had a 
               <br />
               strong distrust of it on account of the manner 
               <br />
               in which it was originated. It was not in 
               <br />
               accordance with the analogy of things or with 
               <br />
               the lessons taught us by the history of the 
               <br />
               world, that a few gentlemen, however wise and 
               <br />
               well-intentioned, but self-elected, should meet 
               <br />
               together to form acoustitution and erect a new 
               <br />
               nationality. Ifwe looked to the United States 
               <br />
               (the history of whose Constitution he would 
               <br />
               presently allude to, and whose Constitution 
               <br />
               had been more closely followed in that now 
               <br />
               under consideration than the British Constitu-

               <br />
               prooæded to construct it. [Here the honor-

               They were poor and comparatively helpless. 
               <br />
               They had just come out of an exhaustive war

               with Great Britain, and the duty fell upon

               <br />
               that led to the ﬁrst attempt at federation, and

               HON. MR. SANBORN—If the leading men 
               <br />
               had felt as the ou ht tohave felt, there would 
               <br />
               have been no cad- ock, for it existed more in 
               <br />
               name than in reality. There was no cause for 
               <br />
               saying __ that no government could be formed 
               <br />
               which could command a good majority. And 
               <br />
               what had the diﬁculties arisen from ? From a 
               <br />
               persistent agitation for representation accord- 
               <br />
               ing to popu ation, in co uence of which the 
               <br />
               people had at last come to lieve that it was 
               <br />
               a fundamental axiom in government. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But did it follow that because there 
               <br />
               were diﬁculties that they could not be arranged 
               <br />
               without recourse to such a measure as this, and 
               <br />
               was it certain even that Confederation would 
               <br />
               remove them ? Instead of meeting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dim-</span> 
               <br />
               culties, the Government had travelled awa 
               <br />
               from them and formed an agreement wit 
               <br />
               provinces in which they had no existence, 
               <br />
               without devising means to relieve themselves. 
               <br />
               Federation was forthwith produced, like Mi- 
               <br />

               <br />

               to make all things right. We were told we

               must take it as presented, without any possible
