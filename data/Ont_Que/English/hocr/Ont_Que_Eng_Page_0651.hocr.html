               were not going to sever the connection, was 
               <br />
               in his mind tantamount to saying that a

               separation was inevitable. (Laughter)

               were to carry out these extraordinary views

               in the common intercourse of life? It struck 
               <br />
               me, while he was speaking, that in his state 
               <br />
               of mind, there might be danger in the inter- 
               <br />
               change of the casual civilities of social 
               <br />
               intercourse. He is unfortunately laboring

               of that friendly regard that I cordially feel

               for my hon. friend, I were to express a hope 
               <br />
               that his malady was decreasing. If he were 
               <br />
               to interpret my “ h ” in the same strange

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(limitation</span> as I imagined, and that he had

               under the mental delusion that has charac-

               terized his remarks on this subject, he would 
               <br />

               precarious tenure of his life. (Hear, hear, 
               <br />
               and laughter.) And to illustrate farther 
               <br />
               how incapable his mind had become of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal—</span>

               ing impartially and correctly with the im- 
               <br />
               portant subject before us, I would call 
               <br />
               the attention of the House to the fact 
               <br />
               that when Lord DERBY expressed “ a 
               <br />
               hope,” he was not speaking at all of the 
               <br />
               feeling in England, but he was speaking of 
               <br />
               the feeling in this country. He said he 
               <br />
               hcped we should continue the connection. 
               <br />
               But when he spoke of the feeling in the old 
               <br />
               country, he did not even use the word 
               <br />
               “ hope,” but spoke positively and with assu— 
               <br />
               rance, saying: “ I am sure ” that the aid of 
               <br />
               Great Britain will never fail them when they 
               <br />
               require it. (Hear, hear.) We have had 
               <br />
               his remarks quoted to ns before, but I make 
               <br />
               no apology at allfor extending the discussion 
               <br />
               upon it, for I feel strongly how important it 
               <br />
               is that this country should understand what 
               <br />
               the feeling in England is with regard to us. 
               <br />
               We have also had quoted to us the words 
               <br />
