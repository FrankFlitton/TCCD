               MR. POWELL—Then he may take the 
               <br />
               other alternative. I think the House and 
               <br />
               the country have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extended</span> an enormous 
               <br />
               degree of consideration to this Government, 
               <br />
               but I tell the hon. gentlemen that if they 
               <br />
               continue the course they are now ursuing, 
               <br />
               a reaction will take place in the I case and 
               <br />
               the country. (Hear, hear.) I hOpe that 
               <br />
               this House is not to drOp down into being 
               <br />
               the mere echo of the Executive—so that we 
               <br />
               shall not have Opinions of our own at all, or 
               <br />
               be allowed to offer any advice whatever tO 
               <br />
               the Executive. If the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               accepts these remarks in a hostile spirit, he 
               <br />
               may do so. All I can say is that I do not 
               <br />
               mean them to be so received. But I con- 
               <br />
               sider the course taken by the Government 
               <br />
               this afternoon is a most extraordinary one. 
               <br />
               The reason assigned is, that hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               Opposite have been Offering a factions oppo- 
               <br />
               sition,and that they intend to continue it 
               <br />
               by moving motion after motion. But even 
               <br />
               it they do, I ask, can that involve above a 
               <br />
               couple of weeks more of discussion? And 
               <br />
               I say that it is not for the credit or the 
               <br />
               character of the Government, that to shorten 
               <br />
               the discussion they should take such a 
               <br />
               course as this. I believe they have under- 
               <br />
               taken the great work they have in hand in 
               <br />
               a most patriotic spirit. I believe that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend—though he rejects my advice- 
               <br />
               is animated in the course he is taking by a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purely</span> patriotic spirit. But,while I believe 
               <br />
               that, I think he ought to accord to me the 
               <br />
               right of expressing my opinion as to the 
               <br />
               mode in which this debate should be con- 
               <br />
               ducted. I do not know whether the friends 
               <br />
               of the Administration are to be gagged as 
               <br />
               well as its Opponents—(laughter)-—whether 
               <br />
               it is intended that we shall all be prevented 
               <br />
               from expressing our views. But I do trust the 
               <br />
               leader of the Government will withdraw this 
               <br />
               motion— hear, hear)— which is unworthy 
               <br />

               <br />
               magniﬁcent project. He has all the advan- 
               <br />
               tages he can wish on his side, and I would 
               <br />
               advise him to avail himself of those advan- 
               <br />
               tages, and not to give—by pursuing a course

               out this scheme without having to call to his
