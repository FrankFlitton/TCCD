               <br />
               months. It ma be that the revenue has been 
               <br />
               brought up wit in the last few weeks from 
               <br />
               accidental causes. A rumor got abroad that 
               <br />
               the Hon. Finance Minister intended to make 
               <br />
               a change in the duties, and in two or three 
               <br />
               of our large cities a rush was made to the 
               <br />
               bonding warehouses, in order to save the 
               <br />
               additional amount that would be exacted by 
               <br />
               the change in duties. This, no doubt, in- 
               <br />
               creased the receipts for the time being, and 
               <br />
               itis just possible that from that cause the 
               <br />
               revenue may have regained something of 
               <br />
               what it had lost during the earlier weeks of 
               <br />
               the present year. Then, too, the state of 
               <br />
               our securities in En land—which was so 
               <br />
               much improved, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">according</span> to the statement 
               <br />
               of the Hon. President of the Council, by the 
               <br />
               action of the Quebec Conference,—is now 
               <br />
               anythin indeed but satisfactory. I believe 
               <br />
               that wit the exception of the point they 
               <br />
               touched at one time in October, or early in 
               <br />
               November, and which they touched then for 
               <br />
               a very brief space—they are lower now and 
               <br />
               have been lower for a longer time than they 
               <br />
               have been at any period before since the 
               <br />
               union. I think, therefore, we are not in a 
               <br />
               position to impose heavy and unmeasured 
               <br />

               the hon. gentleman has stated. And I ap- 
               <br />
               prehend his assertion with regard to the 
               <br />
               condition of the province is as greatly exag- 
               <br />
               gerated as his other statement. It is very 
               <br />
               true that many portions Of our country un- 
               <br />
               fortunately labor at this moment under 
               <br />
               considerable depression ; but no intelligent 
               <br />
               person, who considers the circumstances, will 
               <br />
               think that this is at all extraordinary. We 
               <br />
               are alongside a country engaged in a fearful 
               <br />
               war. Our commercial relations with that 
               <br />
               country, with which we usually have im- 
               <br />
               mense transactions, are very greatly dis- 
               <br />
               turbed. Then we have had short crops for 
               <br />
               several years, and our banks are all very 
               <br />
               properly under close-reefed topsails. These 
               <br />
               and other causes have contributed to produce 
               <br />
               the stagnation that now exists, and a general 
               <br />
               disposition to curtail business Operations. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But with all this—notwith- 
               <br />
               standing the scarcity of money, and a good 
               <br />
               deal of embarrassment and suffering from its 
               <br />
               scarcity—I venture to afﬁrm that the great 
               <br />
               branches of our national industry were never 
               <br />
               on a sounder basis; that business men have 
               <br />
               not for years owed less debt than at- this 
               <br />
               moment ° and when a better state of things 
               <br />
               sets in, the evils of which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               speaks will not be found to have been very 
               <br />
               deep-seated. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman is exceedingly anxious that I should 
               <br />
               fulﬁl the premises I made to the country at 
               <br />
               the time I entered this Administration. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman, I think, would show a 
               <br />
               little more discretion if he allowed me to 
               <br />
               judge for myself of the best way in which I 
               <br />
               should fulﬁl those promises. When, in the 
               <br />
               short space of six months, the Government 
               <br />
               have come down with a matured scheme, in- 
               <br />
               volving such important changes, and placed it 
               <br />
               before Parliament in the candid way in which 
               <br />
               they have submitted it, I think the country has 
               <br />
               no good cause to complain, either of time 
               <br />
               having been lost in the fulﬁlment of my 
               <br />
               promises, or in the manner of fulﬁlling them 
               <br />

               (Hear. hear.) And I think it ill-becomes

               the hon. gentleman—when he has heard it 
               <br />
               declared that, notwithstanding what has 
               <br />
               occurred in New Brunswick, we still adhere 
               <br />
               to the basis on which the Government was 
               <br />
               formed—-that all we ask is time to ascertain 
               <br />
               how our scheme can best be carried into 
               <br />
               effect—and that in the brief period of a very

               few weeks we will be prepared to meet Par-
