               <br />
               Yes, sir, so the text runs. But suppose our- 
               <br />
               selves in the time of our ﬁrst, or second, or 
               <br />
               third Federal Cabinet, consisting of its six or 
               <br />
               more sections, of course ; and, for the sake of 
               <br />
               my argument, I will suppose a great deal, 
               <br />
               that every one of these sections controls com- 
               <br />
               fortably the delegations from its own province 
               <br />
               in the two Houses of Parliament, that the 
               <br />
               machine is working beautifully, that there is 
               <br />
               no lieutenant-governor crusty, no provin- 
               <br />
               cial administration kicking over the traces, 
               <br />
               and no provincial legislature giving any 
               <br />
               other trouble than by its anxiety to be well 
               <br />
               paid. I will suppose even that this halcyon 
               <br />
               state of things has gone on for some time. 
               <br />
               But one or two or more of the provinces begin 
               <br />
               to feel that they cannot do without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span> 
               <br />
               more money. And the pressure will be such 
               <br />
               upon the Provincial Legislature and upon the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant-Governor, and upon the delegations 
               <br />
               to the General Legislature, and upon the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motion</span> of the Federal Executive representing 
               <br />
               each such province, that it never can be long 
               <br />
               resisted ; there will be trouble if it is, and 
               <br />
               things must be kept pleasant. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               One mode—the most obvious, though the 
               <br />
               least scientiﬁc—will be just to increase the sub- 
               <br />
               vention from eighty to eighty-ﬁve, or even to 
               <br />
               eighty-two or eighty—one cents a head. 
               <br />
               An additional cent a head from the Federal 
               <br />
               Exchequer would be an object—a few cents 
               <br />
               a head would be a boon. Or suppose the 
               <br />
               demand took this form: suppose the people 
               <br />
               —say of Upper or Lower Canada—should 
               <br />
               say, “ Those Newfoundlanders are getting 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150,000</span> a year for their lands, mines, and 
               <br />
               minerals; and the Federal Government is 
               <br />
               positively administering those lands, mines, 
               <br />
               and minerals, not for Federal proﬁt, but more 
               <br />
               for the advantage of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thit</span> province than we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd we can administer our own; the General 
               <br />
               Government, therefore, must take our lands, 
               <br />
               mines, and minerals, and give us also an 
               <br />
               equivalent.” That is one way of doing the 
               <br />
               thing; and, when the time comes for making 
               <br />
               that sort of demand, depend upon it that it 
               <br />
               will sound singularly reasonable in the ears of 
               <br />
               the provinces whose representatives shall make 
               <br />
               it ; and if two or three provinces shall join in 
               <br />
               the demand, my word for it, the thing will 
               <br />
               soon be done. The same sort of thing may be 
               <br />
               looked for in reference to the New Brunswick 
               <br />
               timber export duty and the Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               mineral export duty. Here is one form of 
               <br />
               the cry that may be raised—“ You give these 
               <br />

               <br />
               lots of such cries may be nicely got up. But 
               <br />
               for everything so given, much or little, to what 
               <br />
               ever province, you will have to do the like 
               <br />
               for all the rest, and the will be alarming

               geniously, but always irresistibly—made, but 
               <br />
               you will have demands made in a more indi- 
               <br />
               rect form which it will be yet easier to carry, 
               <br />
               from their consequences not being so clearly 
               <br />
               seen, and which will therefore be still worse 
               <br />
               in their eﬁects. I speak of that tremendous 
               <br />
               catalogue of outlays which may be gone into 
               <br />
               without the appearance of a grant to any par— 
               <br />
               ticular province—the costly favors which may 
               <br />
               be done in respect of inter-provincial ferries, 
               <br />
               steamship lines between or from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces,</span> 
               <br />
               railways between or through the provinces, 
               <br />
               telegraph lines, agriculture, immigration, 
               <br />
               quarantine, ﬁsheries, and so forth. There 
               <br />
               will be claims of every description under all 
               <br />
               these heads ; and besides them there will be 
               <br />
               the long roll of internal improvements of all 
               <br />
               kinds, whether for the beneﬁt of one or of 
               <br />
               more than one of the provinces. For any 
               <br />
               local work in which it can be at all pretended 
               <br />
               that it is of general interest, pressure may be 
               <br />
               bro ht to bear upon the General Government 
               <br />
               and egislature, and whenever one province 
               <br />
               succeeds in getting any such grant, every 
               <br />
               other province must be dealt with in the same 
               <br />
               way. Compensation must be made all round, 
               <br />
               and no human intellect can estimate the 
               <br />
               degree of extravagance that before long must 
               <br />
               become simply inevitable. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Sir, with our Upper and Lower Canada we 
               <br />
               have had pretty good proof of this. We 
               <br />
               know that whenever anything has had w be 
               <br />
               done for one section of this province, it has 
               <br />
               constantly been found necessary to do some 
               <br />
               thing of the same or of some other kind for 
               <br />
               the other. If either needed anything very 
               <br />
               badly, then the ingenuity of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance had to be exercised to discover some- 
               <br />
               thing else of like value to give the other. In 
               <br />
               one word, unless I am more mistaken than I 
               <br />
               think I can be, these local governments will 
               <br />
               be pretty good daughters of the horse-leech, 
               <br />
               and their cry will be found to be pretty often 
               <br />
               and pretty successfully—“ Give, give, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give!</span> " 
               <br />
               But, sir, there is very little need for our eahug 
               <br />
               with considerations of this kind as to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future</span>
