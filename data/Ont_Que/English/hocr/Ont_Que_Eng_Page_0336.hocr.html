               will be la ely increased under the proposed 
               <br />
               system. It asbeen statedbysomehon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers that a dead-lock might occur. That was 
               <br />
               the impression which prevailed when the elect- 
               <br />
               ive principle was introduced ; but few have 
               <br />
               thought proper to use such an argument 
               <br />
               during the present debate, because it has 
               <br />
               not been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proved</span> b the result. But if it 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible</span> for a cad-lock to occur under 
               <br />
               the elective system, it is far more probable 
               <br />
               under the system proposed in the resolutions. 
               <br />
               If a feeling had been manifested by this 
               <br />
               Chamber since the elective principle was 
               <br />
               introduced—if we had attempted in any one 
               <br />
               respect to usurp the exclusive privileges of 
               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly—it might then with 
               <br />
               truth be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁrmed</span> that the introduction of 
               <br />
               the elective principle in this Chamber was a 
               <br />
               dangerous one. But such has not been the 
               <br />
               ease. I think that the elective principle 
               <br />
               ham worked well, and that so far as the danger 
               <br />
               of a conﬂict is concerned, it is as far removed 
               <br />
               under the present system as under the 
               <br />
               nominative system. Holding these views, I 
               <br />
               have thought it reper to place my amend- 
               <br />

               applied the elective principle to the Maritime

               Provinces, and was favorable to the retention

               of the life members, and it also extended 
               <br />
               the life principle to the Maritime Provinces, 
               <br />
