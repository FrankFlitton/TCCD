               in asserting that the electors of Canada had,

               Sir, I venture to assert that no scheme of 
               <br />
               equal magnitude, ever placed before the world, 
               <br />
               was received with higher eulogiums, with 
               <br />
               more universal approbation, than the mea-

               ting for the acceptance of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Parliament. And no higher eulogy could, I 
               <br />
               think, be pronounced than that I heard a few 
               <br />
               weeks ago from the lips of one of the fore- 
               <br />
               most of British statesmen, that the system of 
               <br />
               government we p seemed to him a 
               <br />
               happy compound of the best features of the 
               <br />
               British and American Constitutions. And 
               <br />
               well, Mr. SPEAKER, might our present atti-

               othercountries. Here is a people composed

               of two distinct races, speaking different lan- 
               <br />
               guages, with reli 'ous and social and municip-

               <br />
               with sectional hostilities of such a c aracter as 
               <br />
               to' render government for many years well-nigh 
               <br />
               impossible; with a Constitution so unjust in

               the view of one section as to justify any resort 
               <br />
               to enforce a remedy. And yet, sir, here we 
               <br />
               sit, patiently and temperately discussing how 
               <br />

               years of strife, were unable to accomplish. We

               has few parallels in history. One hundred

               <br />
               desire not for a moment to excite a painful 
               <br />
               thought—what was then the fortune of war 
               <br />
               of the brave French nation, might have been 
               <br />
               ours on that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wellofought</span> ﬁeld. I recall those 
               <br />
               olden times merely to mark the fact that here 
               <br />
               sit to-day the descendants of the victors and

               <br />
               and social habit, nearly as distinctly marked 
               <br />
               as they were a century ago. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Here we sit to-day seeking amicably to ﬁnd a

               <br />
               the ritish Crown—all earnestly deliberating 
               <br />
               how we shall best extend the blessings of 
               <br />
               British institutions—how a great people may 
               <br />
               be established on this continent in close and 
               <br />
