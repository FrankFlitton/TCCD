               the printed copy sent to the members during 
               <br />
               the recess. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) It has been as- 
               <br />
               serted that this was a treaty entered into by 
               <br />
               the delegates of the several provinces ; but it 
               <br />
               seems to be a treaty in which alterations have 
               <br />
               been made. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) I called the at- 
               <br />
               tention of the honorable gentlemen oppositeto 
               <br />
               this discrepancy, and asked which was the 
               <br />
               true and correct copy of the resolutions, and 
               <br />
               I was told that it was the copy which had 
               <br />
               been submitted to the House. There has 
               <br />
               been an alteration somewhere; and in a matter 
               <br />
               of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">serious</span> importance, the Government 
               <br />
               ought to tell us how and where it occurred-— 
               <br />
               they ought to inform us if it is not the case 
               <br />
               that the treaty was changed after the Confer- 
               <br />
               ence had ceased to meet, and at whose request 
               <br />
               and by whom the change was made. It is 
               <br />
               evident that we are called to vote for ascheme, 
               <br />
               here, different from that submitted to the 
               <br />
               Legislature of N ova Scotia, and one more un- 
               <br />
               favorable to us than that which the delegates 
               <br />
               from N ova Scotia have reported to their Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. While on this subject, I will also 
               <br />
               remark that there is also a discrepancy between 
               <br />
               the French and the English versions of the 
               <br />
               resolutions submitted to the House, the 
               <br />
               French version being the same as the one com- 
               <br />
               municated to the members by the Hon. Provin- 
               <br />
               cial Secretary, and also to those submitted to 
               <br />
               the Nova Seotia Legislature. This would 
               <br />
               indicate that the change has been made in 
               <br />
               these resolutions submitted to this House, and 
               <br />
               it is well that we should have some informa- 
               <br />
               tion, and know what has taken place about 
               <br />
               this pretended treaty since the separation of 
               <br />
               the delegates. (Hear, hear.) There is an- 
               <br />
               other important matter which demands the at- 
               <br />
               tention of the House. It has been stated here 
               <br />
               that the whole of the delegates had agreed to 
               <br />
               the resolutions of the Conference. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span>

               that the scheme is susceptible of modiﬁcation and

               think are very important, and the honorable
