               mercial class, in consequence of the liberty 
               <br />
               which we took of imposing high duties on 
               <br />
               English merchandize imported into this 
               <br />
               country; but the English Government did 
               <br />
               not share that discontent, I am happy to 
               <br />
               say, and did not choose to interfere. This 
               <br />
               fact, however, was of a nature to cast a chill 
               <br />
               upon the interest with which we were re— 
               <br />
               garded in England; but when the news of 
               <br />
               Confederation reached England, that interest 
               <br />
               was revived, and has ever since continued 
               <br />
               to increase. If we desire to interest 
               <br />
               England in our fate, we must draw 
               <br />
               closer the bonds that unite us to her, 
               <br />
               and we must do it by means of the 
               <br />
               Confederation now proposed to us, because 
               <br />
               that measure ouce carried out, she will 
               <br />
               undoubtedly put forth her whole strength 
               <br />
               for our defence if we should be attacked. 
               <br />
               Moreover, in view of the events which have 
               <br />
               recently occurred in the southern portion of 
               <br />
               this continent, if we reﬂect that it seems to 
               <br />
               be the policy of France and of England 
               <br />
               to establish a balance of power similar to 
               <br />
               what exists in Europe, if we consider that it 
               <br />
               is for this end that France has established 
               <br />
               an empire in Mexico, it is clear that England 
               <br />
               cannot but view with a favorable eye the 
               <br />
               movement now in progress here for the Con- 
               <br />
               federation of all the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces. It is not at such a time as this, 
               <br />
               therefore, that England would be disposed 
               <br />
               to abandon her colonies, as it has been pre- 
               <br />
               tended by some. I stated, a moment ago, 
               <br />
               that we should not resist the just demands 
               <br />
               of the British population of this country, 
               <br />
               provided they do not ask anything involving 
               <br />
               injustice towards French-Canadians. If we 
               <br />
               were guilty of injustice towards them, they 
               <br />
               would complain, and propose a plan of con- 
               <br />
               stitution humiliating to the French-Cana- 
               <br />
               dians, and they would no longer entertain 
               <br />
               sentiments of esteem and consideration for 
               <br />
               us. I do not refer to this matter for the 
               <br />
               purpose of discouraging my own fellow- 
               <br />
               countrymen, but because I believe it is 
               <br />
               necessary that they should take this view of 
               <br />
               the matter into account in the position in 
               <br />
               which we now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ﬁnd</span> ourselves placed. To-day 
               <br />

               all are convinced of its necessity. But, on the

               other hand, what are the inﬂuences opposed 
               <br />
               to Confederation in Lower Canada ? They 
               <br />
               are conﬁned to a party which has existed for 
               <br />
               the past ﬁfteen years in Lower Canada, and 
               <br />
               which has always been remarkable for its 
               <br />
               opposition to all measures demanded and 
               <br />
               supported by the party representing in this 
               <br />
               House the vast majority of the people of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. This persistent opposition 
               <br />
               to the measures of the Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               party savoured of revolution—for your revo- 
               <br />
               lutionist is by nature incapable of sub- 
               <br />
               mitting to the majority; it is the same party 
               <br />
               which in other countries forms secret so- 
               <br />
               cieties, by means of which society is thrown 
               <br />
               into disorder—and it is admitted that every- 
               <br />
               where, in Europe as well as in America, 
               <br />
               these secret societies are composed of men 
               <br />
               who are invariably opposed to everything 
               <br />
               calculated to secure the peace and happiness 
               <br />
               of the people. Is it not true that in 1856 
               <br />
               or 1857 a place in the Administration was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> to one of the leaders of that party 
               <br />
               by the present Attorney General, and that 
               <br />
               an opening was repeatedly made for them, 
               <br />
               because it was thought that they were acting 
               <br />
               in good faith? N ow, did they not invariably 
               <br />
               refuse the alliance offered them? And did 
               <br />
               they not even refuse to give a cordial sup-
