               MB. BURWELL, in resuming the debate 
               <br />
               upon Confederation, said-—Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               before allowing a measure of this importance 
               <br />
               to go through the House, I feel it my duty 
               <br />
               to oﬂer a few words upon it. The question 
               <br />
               of Federation is not a new one to my consti- 
               <br />
               tuents. Ever since the Reform Convention 
               <br />
               in Toronto, in 1859, they have been quite 
               <br />
               familiar with it. At the general election in 
               <br />
               1861, in an address to my constituents, I 
               <br />
               stated that in case we should not be able to 
               <br />
               get representation by population, I would 
               <br />
               be in favor of Federation of the two provin- 
               <br />
               ces of Canada, with a Local Government in 
               <br />
               each province and a Central Government to 
               <br />
               administer matters common to both, provi- 
               <br />
               sion to be made to admit the Eastern Provin- 
               <br />
               ces and the N orth-West territory, should they 
               <br />
               see ﬁt to-enter the union, of course with the 
               <br />
               sanction of Great Britain. And at the last 
               <br />
               general election in 1863, I addressed them 
               <br />
               in precisely the same language. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The agitation for constitutional 
               <br />
               changes had been so general and persistent 
               <br />
               for a length of time in Upper Canada, that 
               <br />
               it was im ossible to all appearance to stave 
               <br />
               oﬁ' much onger some action in reference to 
               <br />
               the diﬁiculty. Eﬁ'orts were made at different 
               <br />
               times to secure represention by popu- 
               <br />
               lation as a remedy, but without success. 
               <br />
               The nearest approach to a remedy for the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty under which Upper Canada labors, 
               <br />
               is, in my opinion, the resolutions of the 
               <br />
               Quebec Conference now before the House, 
               <br />
               and the question for consideration is whether 
               <br />
               they are acceptable to _us and our people, or

               I think that, if we look to the history of th

               my opinion attributable to the federatil

               form of government adopted there. I at 
               <br />
               tribute it to different causes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogethet</span>
