               that amount is reduced by one-half, and it 
               <br />
               is thereby admitted that the possession of

               to swallow the pill without even being allowed

               time to enquire whether it is suited to our

               case or not. It must be acknowledged that 
               <br />
               this is a very poor ent. As to the fear

               will be just as acceptable to them eight or ten 
               <br />
               months hence as it is at present. If the plan 
               <br />
               is a useful one, in an English point of view, 
               <br />
               it will be carried out, let what Government

               time to consider of it. The honorable mem-

               ber has stated that there have been twelve 
               <br />
               elections to the Legislative Council since the 
               <br />
               question of Confederation has been mooted; 
               <br />
               but those elections did not take place at a

               period subsequent to the preparation of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the sople were not and could not be

               the twelve elections in question was neither 
               <br />
               favorable nor the reverse to the plan of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, for that plan was not then known. 
               <br />
               It is said because the plan was distributed 
               <br />
               throughout the country, that therefore it 
               <br />

               <br />
               especially in its details, when we every day 
               <br />
               seethe Government greatly embarrassed at 
               <br />
               giving explanations, or refusing to give them, 
               <br />
               on certain points Y—when, for instance, we 
               <br />
               see a minister in one House state that the 
               <br />
               seigniorial indemnity will be paid by Lower 
               <br />
               Canada alone, whilst it is declared in another 
               <br />
               House that that debt will be divided between 
               <br />
               the two provinces Y—when we see ministers 
               <br />
               asking for time to reply to each of the ques- 
               <br />
               tions put to them respecting this scheme? 
               <br />
               How can the people be a uainted with the 
               <br />
               local constitutions and the egislatures, when 
               <br />
               the ministers themselves would appear to 
               <br />
               know nothin about them? How can the

               people know in what matter this ﬁve million

               <br />
               ada, will be divided, since those who pre- 
               <br />
               pared the scheme themselves do not know? 
               <br />
               And there is a mass of other important 
               <br />
               details which ought to be known in order to 
               <br />
               be able to pronounce upon the merits of the 
               <br />
               measure, such as the proposed law in relation 
               <br />
               to education, measures of defence, the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway, &amp;c. We are told, indeed, 
               <br />
               for instance, that the Protestants of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada and the Catholics of U per Canada 
               <br />
               will be protected, in so far as re ates to their 
               <br />
               school system, but we have no guarantee of 
               <br />
               it; and if the scheme of Confederation is 
               <br />
               adopted before these questions are settled, 
               <br />
               who can tell us that the Government will 
               <br />
               have as complaisant a majority tosettle those 
               <br />
               questions as to vote Confederation? There 
               <br />
               is another part of the scheme which is of the 
               <br />
               highest importance, and respecting which we 
               <br />
               are entitled to explanatious before voting for 
               <br />

               <br />
               the defence of the country. It is important 
               <br />
               that we should know what is to be the nature 
               <br />
               of the defence which it is preposed to organ- 
               <br />
               ize and what debt we are to incur for the 
               <br />
               purpose. Why not let us have the why and 
               <br />
               the wherefore of the whole business in order 
               <br />
               that we may come to a sound decision as to 
               <br />
