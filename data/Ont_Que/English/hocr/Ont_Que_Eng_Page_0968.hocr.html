               sink into disuse and oblivion. For our 
               <br />
               religion I have no fears. The experience of 
               <br />
               the past is a guarantee for the future. We 
               <br />
               live no longer in those times when Paradise 
               <br />
               was the promised reward of all whoill-treated 
               <br />
               those of a religion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from their own. 
               <br />
               These are not the days in which wars and 
               <br />
               troubles between nations were begotten of 
               <br />
               religious hatred. The world is too civilized 
               <br />
               to renew the scenes which were then con- 
               <br />
               stantly exhibited. Every man is free to 
               <br />
               practise his religion as he pleases, and this 
               <br />
               tolerant spirit is especially to be noted as 
               <br />
               characterising the English nation. True, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd some fanatics both among the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish and the French population: unfortu- 
               <br />
               nately we had two instances of the working 
               <br />
               of this spirit in one evening in this House—- 
               <br />
               the one from a Catholic, the other from a 
               <br />
               Protestant. The former cried out loudly 
               <br />
               that Confederation would be a mortal blow 
               <br />
               to the Catholic religion, while the other 
               <br />
               cried as loudly that it would be the ruin of 
               <br />
               the Protestants. I must confess, Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> that I am not one of those who 
               <br />
               live in fear and distrust of British domina- 
               <br />
               tion. As long as we live under the sway of 
               <br />
               free England, I have not the least doubt 
               <br />
               that our language will be fully protected, 
               <br />
               and that in ﬁfty years from this present time, 
               <br />
               good Catholics will be allowed the exercise 
               <br />
               of their religion as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freeLy,</span> as salely and as 
               <br />
               piously as this day, and that the wicked will 
               <br />
               not be compelled to be more religious than 
               <br />
               they now are. (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Bagot told us that there are a 
               <br />
               great number of Catholics in England, and 
               <br />
               that they are perfectly at liberty to exercise 
               <br />
               their religion at their pleasure, but that they 
               <br />
               are not represented in the English Parliament. 
               <br />
               This, far from being a proof of intolerance, 
               <br />
               I take to be a proof of their tolerant 
               <br />
               character, since, although able to oppress 
               <br />
               the Catholics, they leave‘them at full liberty 
               <br />
               to fulﬁl the pious exercises of their religion. 
               <br />
               I repeat it, Mr. SPEAKEa, there are fanatics 
               <br />
               in all religions ; happily for humanity, they 
               <br />
               are but a small minority, and men of good 
               <br />
               sense hold them in contempt. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.)

               <br />
               our existence in our childhood, and which is 
               <br />

               <br />
               Christian, moral and religious—which is so 
               <br />
               carefully, wisely and anxiously instilled into

               ness. That education it is, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               which renders nations prosperous, rich and 
               <br />
               great, which elevates them to the rank of 
               <br />
               which they are worthy, and maintains them 
               <br />
               in it. It never fades from the mind on 
               <br />
               which it has been impressed—it remains 
               <br />
               ﬁxed on the memory, like the characters 
               <br />
               which we engrave on the bark of a 
               <br />
               young tree, and which are found long 
               <br />
               years after, when it falls under the wood- 
               <br />
               man’s axe. As the representative of 
               <br />
               the city of Three Rivers, I may be allowed 
               <br />
               to say a few words relative to the advantages 
               <br />
               which Confederation will bring to that dis- 
               <br />
               trict. Every one knows that it possesses 
               <br />
               immense tracts of land not yet Opened out 
               <br />
               to the settler, magniﬁcent forests of timber of 
               <br />
               all kinds, and mines of inestimable value. 
               <br />
               It is beyond question that Three Rivers 
               <br />
               yields the best iron in the country. This 
               <br />
               Was proved at the Great Exhibition at 
               <br />
               London, where the ﬁrst medals were awarded 
               <br />
               to the Radnor Ironworks Company for the 
               <br />
               best iron-wheels, in respect of durability, 
               <br />
               elegance and quality. The St. Maurice has 
               <br />
               been grossly neglected by the various Ad— 
               <br />
               ministrations which, during the last ten 
               <br />
               years, have held ofﬁce, although the district 
               <br />
               yielded a revenue of $30,000 or 840,000 to 
               <br />
               the public chest, which might have entitled 
               <br />
               it to some compensation. Nevertheless, the
