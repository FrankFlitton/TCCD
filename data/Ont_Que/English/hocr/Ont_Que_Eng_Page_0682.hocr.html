               <br />
               repelled the charge of my honorable friend

               from Cornwall, as calculated to reassure the 
               <br />
               House. And I merely rose for the purpose of

               asking honorable gentlemen whether we are

               the further consideration of this House is to 
               <br />
               be invited to all these measures—to the new

               Hos. ATTY. GEN. MACDONALD—If I 
               <br />
               supposed for a moment that the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Chateauguay really required an 
               <br />
               answer, he should get it. I have no doubt 
               <br />
               the Hon. President of the Council would 
               <br />
               gladly give an answer, if he really thought he 
               <br />
               had any information to give to the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman. But no one understands better 
               <br />
               than the honorable member for Chateauguay 
               <br />
               the way in which the case was put. The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Cornwall (Hon. J. S. 
               <br />
               MACDONALD) rose, and in rather an un- 
               <br />
               parliamentary way—after a statement had 
               <br />
               been formally made to inform the House and 
               <br />
               the country what was the policy of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment—upon his honor declared his belief 
               <br />
               that the Government were not sincere in the 
               <br />
               explanations they had made, and that their 
               <br />
               design was to get a bill passed by the Impe- 
               <br />
               rial Parliament, contrary to the feelings of 
               <br />
               this country and of the Lower Provinces, and 
               <br />
               to force that upon the poo le. That was the 
               <br />
               declaration of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honorable</span> gentleman. I do 
               <br />
               not know if he was sincere in making it. He 
               <br />
               seemed to be sincere, and pledged his honor 
               <br />
               and his conscience to it. (Laughter.) But 
               <br />
               his doing so only convinces me, that, if he 
               <br />
               had been in ofﬁce himself, that is the course 
               <br />
               he would have adopted; no such suggestion 
               <br />
               would have risen to any man’s mind, unless 
               <br />
               he had thought it a feasible one. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) For our part we do not consider such 
               <br />
               acourse to be in accordance with our position 
               <br />
               in this House, or in accordance with our 
               <br />
               principles as men of honor ; and the Hon. 
               <br />
               President of the Council rose to repel the dis- 
               <br />
               honoring insinuation with that just <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indigna—</span> 
               <br />
               tion which was felt by every man who heard 
               <br />
               it, and to declare that the belief of the hon- 
               <br />
               orable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman.</span> was utterly untrue, un- 
               <br />
               founded, and unwarranted. But I shall re- 
               <br />
               peat the anouncement in a way that it may be 
               <br />
               understood by the hon. member for Cornwall 
               <br />

               capacity— (laughter) — so that no man can 
               <br />
               mistake it. Our intention is to get the 
               <br />
               sanction of this House to the Address I 
               <br />
               have moved, and this having been done, 
               <br />
               the two branches of the Legislature will have 
               <br />
               given their votes in favor of the Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion scheme, and there is the end to that, so 
               <br />
               far as Canada is concerned. We will then 
               <br />
               go over to England with that in our hands, 
               <br />
               and will say to the Imperial Government :— 
               <br />
               “ Canada has agreed to this, New Brunswick 
               <br />
               has not agreed to it, and we wish to take 
               <br />
               counsel with the Imperial Government as to 
               <br />
               our position. This is the unmistakable voice 
               <br />
               of the people of Canada through their re re- 
               <br />
               sentatives, and we, as representing the ov- 
               <br />
               ernment of Canada, which has three-fourths 
               <br />
               of the whole population of the provinces, come 
               <br />
               to consult with the authorities of the Mother 
               <br />
               Country what is best for the interests of these 
               <br />
               provinces.” (Hear, hear.) We shall also 
               <br />
               discuss the question of defence, and, I have 
               <br />
               no doubt, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> shall be met in a most large- 
               <br />
               hearted and liberal spirit by the English Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and that England will now, in jus- 
               <br />
               tice to Canada, pledge herself to her utmost 
               <br />
               resources in men and money for our defence. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Then there is a third ques- 
               <br />
               tion—that of the Reciprocity treaty ; and we 
               <br />
               will also take counsel with the British Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment as to the best means of treating that 
               <br />
               subject. And the honorable gentleman knows 
               <br />
               —at least he ought to know, for I cannot an- 
               <br />
               swer for the limits of his understanding—that 
               <br />
               we can only discuss that through Imperial 
               <br />
               avenues, that we can have no direct commu- 
               <br />
               nication in such matters with the American 
               <br />
               Government. Having taken counsel with the 
               <br />
               Im rial Government on those three points, 
               <br />
               we shall call the House together at the ear— 
               <br />
               liest period, I hope long before the current 
               <br />
               half-year terminates, that is, before the 30th 
               <br />
               June. We will submit the result of our mis- 
               <br />
               sion, and it will then be before the House for 
               <br />
               discussion. Though another session, it will 
               <br />
               be in eﬁ'ect a continuation of this session, and 
               <br />
               when we have debated and disposed of the 
               <br />
               most pressing subjects, we will then take up 
               <br />
               what remains of the Confederation scheme— 
               <br />
               such as the constitution of the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments and the school question, with regard to 
               <br />
               which, as the Hon. Minister of Finance has 
               <br />
               stated, we shall propose to carry out to the 
               <br />
               letter the pledges we gave at the Conference, 
               <br />
               and which we ask the House to endorse, and 
               <br />
               hope it will. (Hear, hear.) We will also 
               <br />
               submit the result of our negotiations on the 
               <br />
               question of defence, and on all those matters 
               <br />
