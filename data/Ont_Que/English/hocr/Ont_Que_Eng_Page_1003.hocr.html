               the subject of a union of the Maritime 
               <br />
               ' Provinces, the words used, as I recollect 
               <br />
               them, were a “Legislative union,” and you 
               <br />
               do not ﬁnd that the people of those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces desired <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">achderal</span> rather than a Legis- 
               <br />
               lative union. In the correspondence laid 
               <br />
               before the House on the subject, I think 
               <br />
               that the words used are those of a Legislative 
               <br />
               union. You do not ﬁnd the words “Fed- 
               <br />
               eral union” in it; and I think that is the 
               <br />
               kind of union which those gentlemen who 
               <br />
               desired the best interests of this country 
               <br />
               ought to have striven to have bad. But 
               <br />
               because some ﬁfteen or sixteen gentlemen, 
               <br />
               who patched up this Constitution with so 
               <br />
               many discordant elements in it, did not 
               <br />
               choose to give it to us, is no reason why we 
               <br />
               should not have it. All that we desired was 
               <br />
               that we should have a strong government, 
               <br />
               and they should have been satisﬁed to have 
               <br />
               gone on with the government of the coun- 
               <br />

               <br />
               hon. gentlemen who were brought together 
               <br />
               in this Coalition had said so many hard 
               <br />
               things of each other, that it was found neces- 
               <br />
               sary to make people forget these by putting 
               <br />
               before them some great scheme, and I hope 
               <br />
               it will be a lesson to the Hon. President of 
               <br />

               <br />
               desire to explain to Lower Canadian members 
               <br />
               that the object of that motion is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to’</span> ask that

               Legislature ought not to pass a measure of 
               <br />
               such importance—which is nothing short 
               <br />
               of a revolution in our Constitution—those

               who consider the measure of suﬂicient import-

               the peeple, must vote in favor of this motion.

               <br />
               on the other that it was a bad one; but in

               reality there has been no serious discussion, 
               <br />
