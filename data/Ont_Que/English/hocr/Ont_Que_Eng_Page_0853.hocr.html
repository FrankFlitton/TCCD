               The mineral wealth of Canada is almost 
               <br />
               fabulous, and awaits only the introduction 
               <br />
               of English and American capital to astonish 
               <br />
               the world. (Hear, hear.) The Acton copper 
               <br />
               mine, in Lower Canada, is perhaps the 
               <br />
               richest existing. The copper mines of Lake 
               <br />
               Superior are already famous for their extent 
               <br />
               and the richness of the ore; and the iron 
               <br />
               mines of St. Maurice and Lake Superior are 
               <br />
               supposed to be inexhaustible. According 
               <br />
               to Sir WILLIAM LOGAN, our learned geolo- 
               <br />

               <br />
               county of Vaudreuil. The diggings in the 
               <br />
               auriferous river of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chaudière</span> and the

               Gilbert, in the Eastern Townships, have 
               <br />
               been very productive during the last two 
               <br />
               years. A new company has just been 
               <br />
               formed at New York, with a capital of ﬁve 
               <br />

               third part of this beautilui country is still 
               <br />

               cleared and settled in every direction ? From

               a neck of land which they can really call 
               <br />
               their own ; others to escape from the horrors 
               <br />
               of civil war and the ruinous taxes which bow 
               <br />
               them down to the earth. Here we have peace

               and tranquillity—good air—room enough- 
               <br />
