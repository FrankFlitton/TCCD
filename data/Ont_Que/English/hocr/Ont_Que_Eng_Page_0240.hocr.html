               Where such provisions are not contained in 
               <br />

               greatly diminish the beneﬁts of representative

               government. So when an act to establish free 
               <br />

               <br />

               in case a majorit of the votes were given in its

               such submission, nor had the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> the power to

               bind each other by acting upon it. They volun- 
               <br />
               tarily surrendered that power when they adopted 
               <br />
               the Constitution. The government of this state 
               <br />
               is democratic, but it is a representative demo-

               <br />
               into a constitutional provision which vests the

               legislative authority in a Senate and House of

               <br />
               in the Consh'tution. And under these provisions 
               <br />
               it has been held that so much of an act as relates 
               <br />

               fairly with this scheme, and as no other has 
               <br />
               been presented—as those who oppose it have 
               <br />
               not presented for our consideration any other

               this scheme, as regards its great leading out- 
               <br />
               lines, will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂ‘ect</span> that purpose—then, I say, it 
               <br />
               is our duty as honest and patriotic men, to 
               <br />
               approve of it and to sanction it by votin for 
               <br />

               <br />
               hear.) I have resolved, like my honorable 
               <br />
               friend from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Western</span> Division, and my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from the Brock Division (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. BLAIR) to vote against all amendments 
               <br />
               which may be offered to it. We have been 
               <br />
               told distinctly by the members of the Go- 
               <br />
               vernment that we must either accept or 
               <br />
               reject it as it is—that amendment is impos- 
               <br />
               sible. I can very well understand the reason 
               <br />
               of that. It was adopted as a compact be- 
               <br />
               tween the representatives of the different 
               <br />
               provinces who had assembled in Conference 
               <br />
               for the express purpose of' framing this Con- 
               <br />
               stitution. Were we to make any inroads 
               <br />
               upon those resolutions, then the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces might claim and might exercise the 
               <br />
               same right. This instrument is not perfect. 
               <br />
               We all admit that there are points in it to 
               <br />
               which we object ; and there are points in it, 
               <br />
               I dare say, to which our friends in the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces object. It is a compromise, 
               <br />
               and I think it is a very able, and in the main 
               <br />
               a very fair compromise. It is such a com- 
               <br />
               promise as ought to commend itself to every 
               <br />
               reasonable and candid mind. I think, there- 
               <br />
               fore, that all amendments should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vetoed.</span> 
               <br />
               And I am not afraid that, in taking that 
               <br />
               course, we shall not be justiﬁed by the people 
               <br />
               at large. (Hear, hear.) The peOple under- 
               <br />
               stand the menning and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of these amend- 
               <br />
               ments perfectly well. Perhaps I should not 
               <br />
               call them “ buncombe,” but they savour very 
               <br />
               much of that kind of thing. I think the 
               <br />
               members of this House need have no fears 
               <br />
               of public opinion in this matter. As regards 
               <br />
               the people of Upper Canada—for whom I am 
               <br />
               1n a better position to speak than for the 
               <br />
               people of Lower Canada—I a'n satisﬁed they 
               <br />
               will endorse our approbation of the resolu-
