               <br />
               so much by the extent of a country that its 
               <br />
               power and real greatness are to be estimated, 
               <br />

               Of different interests, for it is in the diversity

               that in order to lace the question of union

               called upon to glance, however brieﬂy, at the

               position in which the trade and tonnage of 
               <br />
               each of the British North American Provinces 
               <br />
               at the present moment stands. The returns 
               <br />
               of the trade of Canada in 1863, taking exports 
               <br />
               and imports conjointly, shew an te of 
               <br />
               887,795,000. Taking the census of 1861, 
               <br />
               this trade represents thirty-ﬁve dollars per 
               <br />
               head of the population. The value of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               amounting to sixty-six dollars per head of its 
               <br />
               population. 'The aggregate trade of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia for the same period, amounted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">818-</span> 
               <br />
               622,359, or ﬁfty-six dollars per head of its

               ple. And in the case of Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island, the import and export trade amounted 
               <br />
               to 83,055,568, representing thirty-seven dol- 
               <br />
               lars per head of the population of that colony. 
               <br />
               The value of the total trade of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               was 811,245,032, or eighty-six dollars per 
               <br />

               large population and the very large amount 
               <br />
