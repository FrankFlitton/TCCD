               prepared to accept this union for ourselves?

               (Hear, hear.) I think that the Government 
               <br />
               should have conﬁned themselves simply to 
               <br />

               <br />
               think the House should look at the question 
               <br />
               in this way—is an Imperial Act to be 
               <br />
               passed, establishing a Confederation of the

               <br />
               tions? I am not prepared to accept that as 
               <br />
               the constitutional remedy. I do not want 
               <br />
               it in that form. (Hear, hear.)

               put this question before the House as it has

               Now, my information, which perhaps is as

               <br />
               been or will be adopted in three of the other

               informed, a fair chance of the resolutions 
               <br />
               being adapted in Newfoundland. In Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia the resolutions were brought down by 
               <br />
               the Provincial Secretary, and it was then 
               <br />
               stated that the adeption of the resolutions 
               <br />
               would be moved, on a future day. So Dr.

               ﬁght was between parties pro-Yankee and 
               <br />
               pro-British. It was a fair stand-up ﬁght of 
               <br />
               Yankee interests on the one side and British 
               <br />
               interests on the other; and those who are

               <br />
               rejoicing in the triumph of Yankee interests. 
               <br />
               I state this from the knowledge I have 
               <br />
               obtained from ten different visits to that 
               <br />
               country, and I am quite sure, if my hon. 
               <br />
               friend had been there all the times that I 
               <br />
               have been, and had the same opportunities 
               <br />
               for observation, that he would understand that 
               <br />
               there are inﬂuences there quite apart from the 
               <br />
               real merits of Confederation. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Among other cries, Hon. Mr. TILLEY was 
               <br />
               assailed because it was said that Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               MACDONALD had stated the Intercolonial

               railway could not be made—a part of the

               Constitution. That is a sample of the cries 
               <br />
               against Hon. Mr. TILLEY. ln fact, it was a

               Yankee inﬂuence and the broad principles 
               <br />
               01 British North American policy. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Those who rejoice over that

               state of things may congratulate themselves 
               <br />
               if they choose, but it is for us to stand by the

               true public opinion of the country ; it is for

               are determined to adhere to our original
