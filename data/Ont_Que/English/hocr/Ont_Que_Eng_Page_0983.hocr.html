               Nova Scotia itself has a larger tonnage than 
               <br />
               the great empire of Austria. If this is to

               <br />
               help seeing that we must strengthen our-' 
               <br />
               selves by coming together in a political and 
               <br />
               commercial union. We have now ﬁve inde-

               have one strong independent government, and 
               <br />
               one system of customs taxation. Although 
               <br />
               we shall not have the same concentrated 
               <br />
               power that we would have in a legislative 
               <br />
               union, still we shall have a power that will 
               <br />
               hold over this country that great force that 
               <br />
               must be possessed to enable it to bring the 
               <br />
               whole military force of the country to bear 
               <br />
               in case its defence becomes necessary, and 
               <br />
               ,which will place us in a much better position 
               <br />
               than ever before. Look at the whole of the 
               <br />
               colonies of England, and let us inquire 
               <br />
               whether, in point of the magnitude of the 
               <br />
               trade they bring to England and the amount 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English</span> goods they consume, compared 
               <br />
               with the ex diture that England is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">called,</span> 
               <br />
               upon to mak , here is really any valid found- 
               <br />
               ation for the position taken by those political 
               <br />
               economists of England, of the Manchester 
               <br />
               and Birmingham school. Take the whole 
               <br />
               of the exports of England to the colonies, 
               <br />
               and her imports from those colonies, and 
               <br />
               what do we ﬁnd ? The exports of En land 
               <br />
               last year amounted to nearly £100,00 ,000 
               <br />
               sterling, while the exports from the colonies 
               <br />
               to Great Britain amounted to £40,000,000 
               <br />
               sterling. Place the colonists, man for man, 
               <br />
               with foreign countries, and you will ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               trade of the colonies is of much more advan- 
               <br />
               tage to England than that of foreign nations, 
               <br />
               independently of all those other great interests 
               <br />
               which are involved in the retention by Eng- 
               <br />
               land of her colonial possessions. Take the 
               <br />
               fact that the whole of England’s expendi- 
               <br />
               ture is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">510,000,000</span> sterling, exclusive of the 
               <br />
               interest of the national debt, while her ex- 
               <br />
               pense for colonial purposes annually, exclusive 
               <br />
               of India and of the casual expenses arisingfrom 
               <br />
               sending troops to colonies where hostilities 
               <br />
               are taking place, was only some £2,000,000 
               <br />
               sterling, of which amount Canada only 
               <br />
               had but little more than £500,000 sterling. 
               <br />
               When these thin are taken into consider- 
               <br />
               ation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1"say</span> it wil be found that the colonies 
               <br />
               are of much more value to the Mother

               Country than is generally supposed, and 
               <br />

               we get from our connection with Great

               in England, who are “free from touch of 
               <br />
               spoil,” to say that unless we provide for 
               <br />
               our own defence, we shall be cast <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> ? We

               the same stand, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">declared</span> that we would 
               <br />
               choose our own connection if we provided 
               <br />
               the whole expense of our defence. (Hear,

               hear. Sir, I think we should be able to tell the

               stated that the debt of Canada is only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">820</span> per

               <br />
               most unhesitatingly be willing, for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose of completing our connection with the

               under, of having our connection with Great

               <br />
