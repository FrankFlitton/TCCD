               by their constituents? My hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Wellington admits that under the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion we have the power to alter the consti- 
               <br />
               tution of this House in so far as it relates to 
               <br />
               Canada, but he says we are not authorized 
               <br />
               to extend our action to the other provinces, 
               <br />
               in a scheme of Federal union. That is 
               <br />
               begging the question. I answer his objec- 
               <br />
               tion that any change affecting the elective 
               <br />
               principle is a breach of trust. Besides, 
               <br />
               we do not propose to enact a system 
               <br />
               of Government embracing all British North 
               <br />
               America. We have not the power to do so. 
               <br />
               We merely propose to address Her Majesty 
               <br />
               on the subject. The Imperial Parliament 
               <br />
               alone has that power; but if we have power 
               <br />
               without a breach of trust to alter the consti- 
               <br />
               tution of the Legislative Council of Canada 
               <br />
               (and my hon. friend admits this), then, 
               <br />
               certainly, we cannot be guilty of a breach of 
               <br />
               trust in suggesting a change embraced in a 
               <br />
               Constitution for the various provinces. I 
               <br />
               will not yield to my hon. iriends from Wel- 
               <br />
               lington and Niagara, in attachment to the 
               <br />
               elective principle, as applied to this House. 
               <br />
               I have alwa ‘8 been an advocate for it, and I 
               <br />
               am so still, ut we cannot get it inserted in 
               <br />
               this instrument; and much as I deplore its 
               <br />
               absence from our proposed Constitution, I am 
               <br />
               not on that account prepared to reject the 
               <br />
               resolutions. This scheme, like all other 
               <br />
               constitutional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">simpacts,</span> is a compromise 
               <br />
               between the conﬂicting opinions of its 
               <br />
               framers; and on the whole, it is a fair 
               <br />
               compromise. This feature is not peculiar to 
               <br />
               our plan of Confederation. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federalist,</span> and from the 
               <br />
               correspondence of the able men who framed 
               <br />
               the “ Articles of Confederation,” that com- 
               <br />
               promise and concessions of Opinion were 
               <br />
               submitted to. But out of them all grew 
               <br />
               the wonderful fabric of the American Con- 
               <br />
               stitution. In the resolution which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend proposes, there is, according to his 
               <br />
               own admission, compromise. He admits 
               <br />
               that he cannot in its integrity procure the 
               <br />
               application of the elective principle to the 
               <br />
               Le 'slative Council. He even proposes to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">add1</span> to the Opposite principle; why, then, 
               <br />
               does my hon. friend object to similar conces- 
               <br />
               sious on our part, when we believe that the 
               <br />
               probable advantages of the whole scheme far 
               <br />
               outweigh its defects? (Hear, hear.) As 
               <br />
               regards limitation in the general powers of 
               <br />
               Parliament contended for by my hon. friend,
