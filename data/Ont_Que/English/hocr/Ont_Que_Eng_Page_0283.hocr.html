               accomplished. (Hear, hear.) We have the 
               <br />
               history of the Greek race, having at one time 
               <br />
               apopulation of six millions, dwindling down 
               <br />
               to seven hundred thousand, and we ﬁnd them 
               <br />
               even then, after several centuries of oppres- 
               <br />
               sion, rising up and asserting their rights. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We have the same circum- 
               <br />
               stance in the histo of Belgium, which was 
               <br />
               united to Holland with a view to secure the 
               <br />
               assimilation of the two countries, but ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               years of trial had hardly elapsed when the 
               <br />
               whole of the Belgium peOple and Government 
               <br />
               rose en masse to protest against that union, 
               <br />
               and to assert their separate nationality. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Sir, it is not only from the history of 
               <br />
               the past we may derive the lesson, but we 
               <br />
               have the circumstances of the present gener- 
               <br />
               ation to guide us. I am astonished to see the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Montreal West helping 
               <br />
               ascheme designed to end in a legislative union, 
               <br />
               the object of which can only be to assimilate 
               <br />
               the whole people to the dominant population. 
               <br />
               In that honorable gentleman’s own country 
               <br />
               the system has produced nothing but a dis- 
               <br />
               satisﬁed and rebellious people. Is it desirable 
               <br />
               that in this country then we should pass a 
               <br />
               measure calculated to give diœatisfaction to a 
               <br />
               million of people ? You may ascertain what the 
               <br />
               cost of keeping down a million of dissatisﬁed 
               <br />
               people is by the scenes that have been and are 
               <br />
               now transpiring on the other side of the line, 
               <br />
               where a ﬁfth of the people of the United 
               <br />
               States has risen and has caused more misery 
               <br />
               and misfortune to be heaped upon that 
               <br />
               country than could have been wrought in cen- 
               <br />
               turies of peaceful compromising legislation. 
               <br />
               Sir, if a legislative union of the British 
               <br />
               American Provinces is attempted, there will 
               <br />
               be such an agitation in this portion of the 
               <br />
               province as was never witnessed before—you 
               <br />
               will see the whole people of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               clinging together to resist by all legal and con- 
               <br />
               stitutional means, such an attempt at wresting 
               <br />
               from them those institutions that they now 
               <br />
               enjoy. They would go as a body to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legslature,</span> voting as one man, and caring 
               <br />
               for nothing else but for the protection of their 
               <br />
               beloved institutions and law, and making gov- 
               <br />
               ernment all but impossible. The ninety Irish 
               <br />
               members in the British House of Commons, 
               <br />
               composed as it is of nearly seven hundred 
               <br />
               members, by voting together have caused their 
               <br />
               inﬂuence to be felt, as in the grants to the 
               <br />
               Maynooth College and some other questions. 
               <br />
               It would be the same way with the people of 
               <br />
               Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> and a more deplorable state of 
               <br />
               things would be the inevitable result. The 
               <br />
               majority would be forced by the minority to 
               <br />

               <br />
               among the British population in Lower Canada 
               <br />
               that, with even the small power that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Local</span>

               Government will possess, their rights will not 
               <br />
               be respected. How, then, can it be expected 
               <br />
               that the French population can anticipate any

               more favorable result from the General Gov-

               powers over the destinies of their section of

               HON. Mn. DORION—Well it is the doc-

               When my honorable friend makes a contract

               Roman Catholics of Upper Canada were 
               <br />
               anxious to have their rights protected against 
               <br />
               the hand of the Protestant majority, and,

               where the Protestants are in a minority, they
