               instruction have made immense progress.

               Before the union we had no Catholic uni-

               versity in the country. Young men intend— 
               <br />
               ing to enter the liberal professions were 
               <br />
               compelled, instead of following a regular 
               <br />
               course, to content themselves with what they 
               <br />
               could acquire in the oﬂice of their patrons, 
               <br />
               who were not in all cases competent for the 
               <br />
               task they undertook, or else to go abroad at 
               <br />
               great expense for many years, in order tô 
               <br />
               obtain in England or France a certiﬁcate of 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcation. To-day we have in Lower and 
               <br />
               in Upper Canada universities rivalling Eu- 
               <br />
               ropean universities of the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">class,</span> and we 
               <br />
               have also a body ot young students, who, 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen or twenty years hence, will give proof 
               <br />
               of the excellence of our university system, 
               <br />
               and of the high curriculum of studies these 
               <br />
               institutions have now rendered universal. 
               <br />
               Now, in face of the degree of progress I have 
               <br />
               just referred to, in the social order, can it be 
               <br />
               truly said that the union has run its day, 
               <br />
               when all these marvels are its creation ? 
               <br />
               When we are stronger and better educated 
               <br />
               than we were twenty years ago; when we 
               <br />
               have new political rights: when we have a 
               <br />
               free right to the soil, and when we have 
               <br />
               created a system of public instruction such 
               <br />
               as we now enjoy, can it be said that the union 
               <br />
               has done its work, and that it must be broken 
               <br />
               up ? For my part, Mr. SPEAKER, I am not pre- 
               <br />
               pared to support thatassertion. The union has 
               <br />
               been for us a great means of progress, since 
               <br />
               it has enabled us to secure all these results 
               <br />
               in the social order. The Hon. Attorney Gen- 
               <br />
               eral East has told us that Confederation will 
               <br />
               procure us material advantages still greater, 
               <br />
               and that that is all we want. 1 deny, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, that material interests form the 
               <br />
               sole ambition of the French-Canadian popu- 
               <br />
               lation. We attach a far higher importance 
               <br />
               to the preservation of our own institutions. 
               <br />
               But even as regards material interests, apart 
               <br />
               from the advantages, in the social order, 
               <br />
               derived from the union, we have still a vast 
               <br />
               ﬁeld before us as regards the progress we 
               <br />
               have made since 1840. In order to see 
               <br />
               what the union has done in this respect, it 
               <br />
               is sufﬁcient to look at our system of railroads, 
               <br />
               and above all, at the great Grand Trunk line 
               <br />
               from Sarnia to Rivière du Loup, which has 
               <br />
               increased our commerce tenfold, opened our 
               <br />
               dense forests to colonization, and multiplied 
               <br />
               our resources to an incalculable extent ; it is 
               <br />
               suﬁcient to look at our ports of Montreal 
               <br />
               and Quebec during the season of navigation, 
               <br />
               ﬁlled with vast forests of shipping, to see 
               <br />

               <br />
               the articles of import we require. And if 
               <br />

               <br />
               do we see ? We ﬁnd canals, which in their

               <br />
               tain, Mr. SPEAKER, that there is nothing to 
               <br />

               for instance, the canals are only miserable 
               <br />
               gutters, and the little boys, in rowing their

               the most remote parts of it with the 
               <br />
               markets of Europe. And, in fact, a ship 
               <br />
               of four hundred tons burden can now 
               <br />
               sail from Chicago, cross the ocean, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               pool. The union which has given us such 
               <br />
               canals, such railways, has not run its 
               <br />
               day, has not done its work, as the Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General East pretends. On 
               <br />
               the contrary, with such means as these, 
               <br />
               we are justiﬁed in anticipating from the 
               <br />
               union still greater results in the future. If 
               <br />
               we look at our colonization, we behold the 
               <br />
               forest receding before the axe of the settler, 
               <br />
               the products of our land increased tenfold, 
               <br />
               and our settlers locating in advance of the 
               <br />
               surveyor on our wild lands. What the 
               <br />
               union has already done for us is certainly 
               <br />
               great, but the advantages it has in store for 
               <br />
               us are still greater, if we know how to avail 
               <br />
               ourselves of the means it places at our com- 
               <br />
               mand. Therefore it is that I do not think 
               <br />
               the union has done its work, but that, on 
               <br />
               the contrary, it will yet secure our pros- 
               <br />
               perity. And hence it is that I wish to 
               <br />
               preserve the union and remain under 
               <br />
               allegiance to Her Most Gracious Majesty 
               <br />
               the Queen of England, and refuse to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accept</span>

               constitutional changes which must of neces—

               <br />
               hear.) It has often been said that war 
               <br />
               Canada was a drag on Upper Canada, retard- 
               <br />
               ing her advancement in the march of pro- 
               <br />
               gress, and that a new Constitution was 
               <br />
               necessary. I deny the justice of the accusa— 
               <br />
               tion, and I maintain that such a charge 
               <br />
               could only emanate from Upper Canadian 
               <br />
               fanaticism. True, the F much—Canadian race 
               <br />
               has been characterized at Toronto by I 
               <br />
               Governor General as an “inferior race," <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> 
               <br />
               the insult thus oﬁ‘ered to Lower Canada has

               not a single fact to bear it out. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Moreover,</span>
