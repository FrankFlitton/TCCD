               Well, I do not think there is anything dis-

               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aspire</span> to independence. (Hear, hear.) Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, the circumstances which have 
               <br />
               brought about the contemplated measure— 
               <br />
               and I trust it will be a successful one—are 
               <br />
               such as have iorced themselves on the con- 
               <br />
               sideration oi the Government. I have already 
               <br />
               alluded to one of these circumstances, and 
               <br />
               that is the met that we are passing from the 
               <br />
               stage of childhood to a higher and more 
               <br />
               responsible position—that the Government 
               <br />
               of this country has for some time been in a 
               <br />
               state of transition, and that this is the only 
               <br />
               relief which the circumstances present to us, 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> way in which an amelioration can 
               <br />
               be found. During a number of years, and 
               <br />
               especially since 1 have taken an active part 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politics—in</span> the course of my various elec- 
               <br />
               tion contests—I have invariably stated, that 
               <br />
               while I looked upon representation by 
               <br />
               population as a remedy for the political 
               <br />
               inequalities which existed as between the 
               <br />
               two sections of the province, a Federal union 
               <br />
               of the British North American Provinces 
               <br />
               seemed to me to be the only proper and 
               <br />
               legitimate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusion</span> to be ultimately arrived 
               <br />
               at. Therefore, in advocating this scheme and 
               <br />
               in giving my vote for it, as I shall do when the 
               <br />
               matter is brought to that stage which will 
               <br />
               enable a_ vote to be taken, I am only doing 
               <br />
               that which I have for a number of years 
               <br />
               looked forward to, and which I believe the exi- 
               <br />
               gencies of the country necessitate. (Hear.) 
               <br />
               There are other circumstances besides that 
               <br />
               to which I have alluded, which render me 
               <br />
               favorable to the adoption of the resolutions 
               <br />
               now before the House. The war in the 
               <br />
               United States, and the, at one time, ap- 
               <br />
               parently <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imminent</span> disintegration of that 
               <br />
               republic, strongly directed our attention to 
               <br />
               the necessity and desirability of uniting 
               <br />

               with our neighbors for defensive purposes. 
               <br />
               I do not say that the desire for a union of 
               <br />
               the provinces grew out of the war in the 
               <br />
               United States, nor am I going to give any 
               <br />
               opinion in reference to that war. We all 
               <br />
               regret its existence, and will all be grateful 
               <br />
               when it is brought to a close, and the bless- 
               <br />
               ings of peace <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> again visit our continent. 
               <br />
               I hope that the commercial relations as 
               <br />
               between us and the United States will be 
               <br />
               continued; that we shall have the freest 
               <br />
               intercourse with that peeple, and that the 
               <br />
               passport system being removed, the time is 
               <br />
               not far distant when our relations with them 
               <br />
               shall be as friendly and as cordial as the 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               have heretofore been. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               threatened repeal of the Reciprocity treaty 
               <br />
               is another thing that has led to the strong 
               <br />
               feeling that has been aroused in favor of 
               <br />
               this scheme. We hope by this union to 
               <br />
               obtain a large number of customers for our 
               <br />
               products, intercourse with whom will not be 
               <br />
               subject to those interruptions that charac- 
               <br />
               terise trade with foreign nations. We shall 
               <br />
               have a large territory under our own 
               <br />
               government, trade with which and through 
               <br />
               which will secure to us mutual advantages. 
               <br />
               Having made these remarks, I would pass 
               <br />
               on to observe that the expressed desire on 
               <br />
               the part of the leading men, both of the 
               <br />
               Government _and of the Opposition, in all 
               <br />
               the provinces, for a close connection, is 
               <br />
               another strong reason why we should at 
               <br />
               once take the necessary steps for enabling 
               <br />
               the union to be carried out. _ It is a most 
               <br />
               remarkable and most favorable circumstance 
               <br />
               that the best men, the ablest men, the wisest 
               <br />
               men and the most patriotic men in all the 
               <br />
               provinces-men whose integrity and abilities 
               <br />
               have raised them to the highest places in 
               <br />
               the regards of the people, and whose wisdom 
               <br />
               in the management of public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘airs</span> has 
               <br />
               sustained them for a long period in those 
               <br />
               high and honorable positions—met together 
               <br />
               and agreed upon a scheme of union without 
               <br />
               any dissension. This agreement in forming 
               <br />
               a basis of a Constitution, and a foundation 
               <br />
               to what may become a great nation, I look 
               <br />
               upon as a most favorable omen indeed. I 
               <br />
               look upon this union of sentiment as another 
               <br />
               strong reason for our taking the necessary 
               <br />
               steps to carry out the union so happily inaugur- 
               <br />
               ated, as also a strong evidence ot the pro- 
               <br />
               priety and wisdom which characterised the 
               <br />
               course of the hon. gentlemen who composed 
               <br />
