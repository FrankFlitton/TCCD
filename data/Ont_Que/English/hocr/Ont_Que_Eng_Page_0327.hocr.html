               time had arrived when an appeal might, with 
               <br />

               tlemen on both sides of the House to throw 
               <br />
               aside” -—what? Their party measures? their 
               <br />
               political interests? N 0—“ their personal dif-

               <br />
               advance the great interests of the country.” 
               <br />
               A little further on he again mentions “the 
               <br />
               absence of public grounds <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'for</span> antagonism 
               <br />
               between them,” and intimates plainly that 
               <br />
               “ such a state of things was very prejudicial 
               <br />
               to the best interests of the province.” As 
               <br />
               I have already stated, the people were 
               <br />
               rapidly coming to the same conclusion, and 
               <br />
               this evil would soon have been removed by 
               <br />
               their action at the elections, without resort— 
               <br />
               ing to any change in the Constitution.— 
               <br />
               Such were His Excellency’s views, commu— 
               <br />
               nicated to his Council in a memorandum, 
               <br />
               and I rejoiced to hear them enunciated by 
               <br />
               him. They are views which, it held also 
               <br />
               by the people, would have led to a thorough 
               <br />
               cure for the evils under which we labored, 
               <br />
               even without resorting to Confederation, for 
               <br />
               the people themselves were beginning to 
               <br />
               see that their political leaders were too much 
               <br />
               under the inﬂuence of bitter personal feel- 
               <br />
               ings; prominence was no longer given to the 
               <br />
               constitutional diﬁculty of unequal represent- 
               <br />
               ation; it was dropped both by its friends 
               <br />
               and its opponents. Yet representation by 
               <br />
               population was a question of such political 
               <br />
               importance, that its satisfactory solution 
               <br />
               would justify the bringing about such a 
               <br />
               change as this. That was a suﬂicient motive 
               <br />
               to induce statesmen to join together and seek 
               <br />
               some way of escape from it. I think the 
               <br />
               scheme now submitted is perhaps the best 
               <br />
               that could have been found attainable, and I 
               <br />
               give its framers all credit for it. I am satis- 
               <br />
               ﬂed with nine-tenths or perhaps more than 
               <br />
               nine-tenths of the whole, and I am willing 
               <br />
               to take the other tenth, if really <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary,</span> 
               <br />
               for the sake of the rest. I think the very 
               <br />
               name, and the prestige of our larger union 
               <br />
               will have a desirable inﬂuence upon our future 
               <br />
               prosperity. It will infuse into us that feeling 
               <br />
               of national pride—those patriotic sentiments 
               <br />
               connected with our country, which it is worth 
               <br />
               much to possess. (Hear.) I think,also, that 
               <br />
               our credit in money matters will be improved 
               <br />
               by the union, and it is worth some sacriﬁce to 
               <br />
               accomplish such results. I believe, further, 
               <br />
               that when this scheme is completed it will

               we either fail to attract emigrants or do 
               <br />
               not manage to retain them ; but if we were 
               <br />
               known as one great country, we should ﬁnd

               develope our trade and resources. It is well 
               <br />
               to weigh all these considerations; they may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«</span> 
               <br />

               dict, but they are well entitled to fair and 
               <br />
               honest consideration. (Hear.) As to Con—

               federation cheapening our government, that 
               <br />
               idea, I think, is a fallacy; and here is one of 
               <br />
               the causes which may lead to future dissatis— 
               <br />
               faction, if the eyes of the people are not 
               <br />
               opened t) it until too late. The proper and 
               <br />
               the true way to act is to let the fact be 
               <br />
               known, that so far from Confederation being 
               <br />
               likely to lessen the expenses of government, 
               <br />
               it will be directly the reverse, and that to 
               <br />
               these must be added the cost of those 
               <br />
               defences which are to be constructed—of 
               <br />
               this Intercolouial road which is to be a 
               <br />
               necessary part of the scheme—of these 
               <br />
               other works on the canals, &amp;c., we hear so 
               <br />
               much about. Confederation will, doubtless, 
               <br />
               be expensive; then why not say so—why not 
               <br />
               say to the peeple, “ Here are ”great advan- 
               <br />
               tages, but they will inevitably cost a large 
               <br />
               sum.” I for one am willing to take these 
               <br />
               advantages at that cost. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">haveZnot</span> analyzed 
               <br />
               the numerous ﬁgures set before us by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Niagara, for profusion and 
               <br />
               confusion in matters of ﬁgures in a speech 
               <br />
               are ver much the same to me. I will not 
               <br />
               preten to follow him. But I have such 
               <br />
               conﬁdence in the ﬁnancial ability of those 
               <br />
               who watched over our‘interests, that I am 
               <br />
               unwilling to receive, except with great cau- 
               <br />
               tion, those objections brought in ﬁgures 
               <br />
               against the measure. One honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               man remarked that the hand of an over- 
               <br />
               ruling Providence might be observed as 
               <br />
               bringing about this scheme and reconciling 
               <br />
               so many conﬂicting inﬂuences. That is 
               <br />
               very true. I delight to recognize an over- 
               <br />
               ruling Providence inﬂuencing the lives of 
               <br />
               individuals and nations. I rejoice that 
               <br />
               the blessing of an over-ruling Providence 
               <br />
               on the deliberations of this House is daily 
               <br />
               asked, and I have faith to believe it will 
               <br />
               be granted to us. But I should have
