               Canada would have to maintain two local

               <br />

               as now enjoyed by the people, and felt that it 
               <br />
               would be improper to vote away that privilege

               of his constituents without their authority or

               <br />
               in legislating under the Constitution we now 
               <br />
               have, and not to change it. It was admitted by
