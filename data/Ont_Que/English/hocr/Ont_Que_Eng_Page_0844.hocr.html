               Country, except by passing over American soil,

               and our passage over that soil is merel toler-

               ated; we may at any moment be deprived of 
               <br />
               this privilege, and in that case we should ﬁnd 
               <br />
               ourselves all at once, durin the long winter 
               <br />

               <br />
               munication with Europe. These reasons are 
               <br />
               more than suﬁcient to cause us to seek to im- 
               <br />
               prove our sition, and the only possible 
               <br />
               means by w 'ch to effect that object, is a 
               <br />
               commercial, social and political union with 
               <br />
               our sister colonies, the Maritime Provinces. 
               <br />
               I hear honorable members say—“ Why not 
               <br />
               rather have the repeal of the union ?” 
               <br />
               “Why not leave Upper and Lower Canada 
               <br />
               separate as they were previous to 1840 ?” 
               <br />
               Such a measure would probably put an end 
               <br />
               to the reiterated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">demands</span> of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               for representation based upon population, and 
               <br />
               the fears entertained by Lower Canada, the 
               <br />
               fear of seeing her institutions endangered, 
               <br />
               should that system of representation be con- 
               <br />
               ceded; but that measure would be rather a 
               <br />
               retrograde one, which would throw the 
               <br />
               country back, and would place it in the posi- 
               <br />
               tion which it occupied revious to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union;</span> 
               <br />
               That measure would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ahrogate</span> an agreement 
               <br />
               which has long existed—a union which has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proved</span> to the country a well-spring of pro- 
               <br />
               gress, riches and prosperity. Such a dissolu— 
               <br />
               tion would only tend to weaken us still more, 
               <br />
               and we should be but two weak and insigniﬁ- 
               <br />
               cant vinces, whereas our union has con- 
               <br />
               verte us into one province comparatively 
               <br />
               strong. We can realize the gigantic works 
               <br />
               which have been carried out when we look 
               <br />
               upon our canals and our railways. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Is</span> there

               ——uny one man who has not completely taken 
               <br />
               leave of his senses, who will venture to say that 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada would have been 
               <br />
               as for advanced, each of them, as they now 
               <br />
               are, if they had remained separate, with 
               <br />
               tariﬂ's inimical the one to the other? “ Soon-

               <br />
               opponent, root and branch, of the scheme pro- 
               <br />
               posed, “ letus concede to Upper Canada repre-

               <br />
               unfathomable gulf of the Confederation of

               the neighboring States, formerly the United

               States. (Hear, hear.) How absurd are they

               <br />
               The United States did not, in 1776, number 
               <br />
               more than four millions of inhabitants; there 
               <br />
               were then only thirteen states ; now there are- 
               <br />
               thirtyone states and seven territories—st

               least that was the number before the war-— 
               <br />
               and a population of more than thirty millions. 
               <br />
               We know that the prodigious growth of the 
               <br />

               three thousand millions of dollars, and an an-

               and civil wars. Exposed to persecution by

               the conqueror, and loaded with the heavy

               <br />
