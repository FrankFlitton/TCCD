               English Government. Both were interested 
               <br />
               in a commercial connection which left us 
               <br />
               nothing to envy in the lot of our neighbors. 
               <br />
               In the Canadian Parliament the question of 
               <br />
               commercial reciprocity with the United 
               <br />
               States was taken up. The Imperial Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment approved of the steps taken by the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government, which tended to place 
               <br />
               their agriculturists on a footing of equality 
               <br />
               with the Americans on their markets. On 
               <br />
               the 16th March, 1855, the Reciprocity 
               <br />
               treaty entered into by the United States 
               <br />
               and England, came into force, after having 
               <br />
               been ratiﬁed by the Canadian Parliament. 
               <br />
               Lengthy debates took place in the American 
               <br />
               Congress upon the question, but southern 
               <br />
               inﬂuence carried the measure through. The 
               <br />
               Reciprocity treaty was to continue for ten 
               <br />
               years, from the 16th March, 1855, without 
               <br />
               its being possible to repeal it; but if one or 
               <br />
               the other of the contracting parties should 
               <br />
               think ﬁt, after the expiration of the ten 
               <br />
               years, they might demand the abrogation of 
               <br />
               the treaty, by giving the other party one 
               <br />
               year’s notice. The question of the repeal of 
               <br />
               that treaty has, therefore, for two or three 
               <br />
               years, been agitated in the American Con- 
               <br />
               gress withsome warmth, by those who found 
               <br />
               their interests tosuﬁ'er by it. The opponents 
               <br />
               of the Reciprocity treaty succeeded in 
               <br />
               Congress for two reasons: ﬁrst, on ac- 
               <br />
               count of a feeling of indignation raised 
               <br />
               up against Canada, by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part</span> of our press, 
               <br />
               which displayed hostility to the Northern 
               <br />
               ‘States; and second, because the rebellious 
               <br />
               Southern States were not represented in 
               <br />
               the American Government. On the 16th 
               <br />
               March next, the President is to give that 
               <br />
               notice, and on the 16th March, 1866, the 
               <br />
               markets of the United 'States will be closed 
               <br />
               to us. (Hear, hear.) We have seen that 
               <br />
               atthe time the American Government. which 
               <br />
               was then in the hands of politicians from 
               <br />
               the Southern States, was not favorable to the 
               <br />
               annexation of Canada to the L'nited States, 
               <br />
               because those statesmen dreaded the inﬂu— 
               <br />
               ence which two new free states in the union 
               <br />
               would bring to bear in relation to slavery. 
               <br />
               The ten years of the treaty consequently 
               <br />
               terminate on the 16th March in the present 
               <br />

               but the 16th March, 1866, will be a day of 
               <br />
               much deeper mourning, for it will mark the 
               <br />
               commencement of a commercial crisis such 
               <br />

               the disastrous results of which to the future 
               <br />
               01 the country are beyond calculation. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) In order to understand the whole 
               <br />
               importance of this treaty to the prosperity 
               <br />
               of the country, it is necessary to know what 
               <br />
               passes in the country parts, as I myself am 
               <br />
               in a position to know through my constant 
               <br />
               relations with those parts. All the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cats</span> pro- 
               <br />
               duced in the country from Trois Pistoles to the 
               <br />
               upper extremity of the province are exported 
               <br />
               to the United States, where they ﬁnd a ready 
               <br />
               market, because they are wanted there. This 
               <br />
               year persons went as far as Three Rivers 
               <br />
               for them by way of the Arthabaska Railway. 
               <br />
               This branch of trade is now very consider— 
               <br />
               able ; but the very moment we have to pay 
               <br />
               an export duty of 25 per cent. upon our 
               <br />
               produce on entering the United States, we 
               <br />
               shall have a commercial crisis which will 
               <br />
               derange all business operations throughout 
               <br />
               the land. When the Reciprocity treaty is 
               <br />
               declared at an end, our oats will be worth no 
               <br />
               more than ls. or ls. 3d., as in former times, 
               <br />
               instead of 13. 8d. or 2a., as at present; and 
               <br />
               it is clear to all that the farmer can derive 
               <br />
               no proﬁt from growing them at that price. 
               <br />
               Formerly, before the treaty was made, the 
               <br />
               farmer could make something by selling his 
               <br />
               oats at that price, because food was cheaper 
               <br />
               and taxes less than they now are. The 
               <br />
               latter were no more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2}</span> per cent. and 
               <br />
               5 per cent., whereas they are now 20 per 
               <br />
               cent., and will be increased rather than 
               <br />
               diminished, under Confederation, as certain 
               <br />
               members of this House have alleged. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> 
               <br />
               hear.) I am thoroughly acquainted with all 
               <br />
               that passes in the country parts; and when
