               does not dispose of public moneys without the 
               <br />

               nnscrupulously violating the very essence of 
               <br />
               the Constitution, evidently under the impulse 
               <br />
               of rabid national feelings. It is a principle

               of the Constitution of England that the

               the supplies to be voted without the consent of

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Legislative Council, appointed for life

               <br />
               beset, both previous to and since that period, 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnd those noble champions of our rights and 
               <br />
               liberties coming forward, year after year, with 
               <br />
               the same demands; never disheartened by de- 
               <br />
               feat, and struggling on until at last their 
               <br />
               legitimate claims were acceded‘to. In J anu- 
               <br />
               ary, 1819, the Houses were opened, and the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst question which brought on an animated 
               <br />
               debate was, once more, the question of the 
               <br />
               ﬁnances. A discussion arose as to whether 
               <br />
               the Lower House, after having obtained the 
               <br />
               annual vote of sup ly, could moreover obtain 
               <br />
               a detailed civil hst and vote on each item 
               <br />
               separately. The majority desired this in 
               <br />
               order to assure themselves of the integrity of 
               <br />
               the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁcials,</span> and to hold in check the 
               <br />
               members of the Executive Council, over whom 
               <br />
               they had no control. Others oppoæd it 
               <br />
               strongly, as a new principle and violating the 
               <br />
               rights of the Crown. A committee, appointed 
               <br />
               to examine into the question, reported in 
               <br />
               favor of a reduction of the expenditure—— 
               <br />
               which they declared to be far too great in pro- 
               <br />
               portion to the revenue—and the abolition of 
               <br />
               pensions, which tended to grave abuses. 
               <br />
               Adopting a middle course between the two 
               <br />
               extremes, some wished to vote the supplies 
               <br />
               under certain heads, giving a gross sum for 
               <br />
               each department. But the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suprporters</span> of a 
               <br />
               detailed vote carried the day. he bill was

               passed, sent up to the Council, and, as was 
               <br />
               anticipated, rejected by that body in the fol-
