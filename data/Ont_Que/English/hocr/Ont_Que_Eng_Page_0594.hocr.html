               HON. MB. CAUCHON—I have listened 
               <br />
               to the explanations of my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Attorney General for Lower Canals, and I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd them perfectly satisfactory, as they 
               <br />
               regard criminal law; for that is the same 
               <br />
               or nearly the same in all the provinces. For 
               <br />
               my own part, I inﬁnitely prefer the criminal 
               <br />
               law of England to that of any other country. 
               <br />
               It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affords</span> more protection to the party ac- 
               <br />
               cased, than, for instance the criminal code of 
               <br />
               France does. The civil laws of the latter, by 
               <br />
               the way, have my warm admiration, ashave 
               <br />
               also their administrative talent and their apt- 
               <br />
               sees for civilizing inﬂuences. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               If the English criminal law gives the criminal 
               <br />
               toogreat a chance of escaping, it at least 
               <br />
               saves society the stigma of condemning the 
               <br />
               innocent. The accused is tried for the single 
               <br />
               act for which he is indicted, and is not 
               <br />
               questioned concerning his whole past life 
               <br />
               and conversation The laws of commerce 
               <br />
               are nearly the same in all countries, and 
               <br />
               those which rule the trade of two continents 
               <br />
               may be said to be founded on an ordinance 
               <br />
               of a king of France. Accordingly, there will 
               <br />
               be no inconvenience in bringing commercial 
               <br />
               causes, as well as others, for adjudication 
               <br />

               existence, it will be composed of the most 
               <br />
               eminent men in the several provinces, who 
               <br />

               decisions of eminent judges, like Lords 
               <br />
               MANSFIELD, COKE, and others; and as 
               <br />
               the scheme of a Constitution makes an 
               <br />
               exception in favor of our civil laws, it would 
               <br />
               be most prudent, in my opinion, to leave 
               <br />
               the decision of our causes to those judges 
               <br />
               who have studied and practised them. 
               <br />
               Nothing is as yet written in the Constitu— 
               <br />
               tion concerning them, and nothing stands 
               <br />
               in the way of the desired exception. (Hear.) 
               <br />
               I am aware that it may be attended with 
               <br />
               some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inconveniences</span> and that in this behalf 
               <br />
               concessions may have been, perforce, sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to in order to obtain others; but 
               <br />
               I think that on reﬂection it will be found 
               <br />
               best for all concerned to have the laws en- 
               <br />
               forced rather by those who understand them 
               <br />
               than by those who do not. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               now come, Mr. SPEAKER, to the question of 
               <br />
               marriage and divorce. The word divorce 
               <br />
               has sounded strangely upon Catholic care 
               <br />
               through the length and breadth of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada; for the Catholic, whether he live 
               <br />
               in Rome, in London, Paris, New York, 
               <br />
               Halifax or Quebec, does not recognize any 
               <br />
               authority on earth with power to sanction or 
               <br />
               legalize divorce. Such is what the Catho- 
               <br />
               lic believes, whether he be the Sovereign 
               <br />
               Pontiﬁ', ruling spiritually over 200,000,000 
               <br />
               souls, or the humblest or poorest of the 
               <br />
               faithful, with nothing to shelter him from 
               <br />
               the fury of the elements but the thatched 
               <br />
               roof of his cabin. (Hear, hear.) That is 
               <br />
               what I believe, in common with all the 
               <br />
               Catholics of the world; but here, in this 
               <br />
               House, composed of Catholics and Protes- 
               <br />
               tants, I feel that I need, in order to be 
               <br />
               understood, to speak in another language, 
               <br />
               which will be understood by all, because 
               <br />
               it is based upon principles anterior to Chris- 
               <br />
               tianity and universally admitted. What is 
               <br />
               marriage, considered as a natural contract? 
               <br />
               It is the social formula; it is, as I had occa- 
               <br />
               sion to write elsewhere, the natural mode of 
               <br />
               transmitting pr0perty, which is the funda- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mental</span> base of society, and, to go farther, 
               <br />
               society itself in its constitution. (Hear,
