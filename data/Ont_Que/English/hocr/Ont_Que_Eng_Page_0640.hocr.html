               men ? Situated at a distance of a thousand 
               <br />
               leagues from us, Great Britain, with all her 
               <br />
               material of war and our militia, could not 
               <br />
               defend Canada against so powerful an enemy, 
               <br />
               except at the cost of the greatest sacriﬁces. 
               <br />
               It is not, therefore, at a time when we are 
               <br />
               placed in such great straits, that we should 
               <br />
               exclaim loudly that we do not fear the‘ struggle, 
               <br />
               and that we are ready to measure our strength 
               <br />
               against that of the States of the American 
               <br />
               Union. It is equally absurd to give umbrage 
               <br />
               to their institutions by creating beside them 
               <br />
               a political organisation to which they are 
               <br />
               fundamentally opposed. Is it believed that 
               <br />
               our monarchical pretensions and our threats 
               <br />
               are of a nature to intimidate the American 
               <br />
               statesmen? In their eyes we are but pig- 
               <br />
               mies hurling threats at giants. Let the 
               <br />
               war come with the Constitution as it is, and 
               <br />
               we shall ﬁnd a hundred thousand volunteers 
               <br />
               ready to delend our frontier. But if the 
               <br />
               Government impose on the French-Cana- 
               <br />

               <br />
               which they have so much fear, and which 
               <br />
               may prove to be productive of the most 
               <br />
               disastrous consequences to their institutions, 
               <br />
               their language and their laws, then, I am 
               <br />
               bound to say, there will be hesitation in our 
               <br />
               ranks at the time when every man will be 
               <br />
               marching towards almost certain death for 
               <br />
               the defence of a ﬂag which will no longer 
               <br />
               confer upon our race the guarantees of protec- 
               <br />
               tion which it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> secures to us. I say, then, 
               <br />
               that the time is ill-chosen to make such 
               <br />
               serious changes, and to lay the foundation 
               <br />
               of an Empire the existence of which, threat- 
               <br />
               ened both from the interior and from the 
               <br />
               exterior, will be of but a few days’ duration. 
               <br />
               For with dissatisfaction among the French- 
               <br />
               Cauadians, deprived of their rights and 
               <br />
               privileges, it is impossible for England 
               <br />
               to maintain her power here against three

               <br />
               pursue, at this critical moment, is therefore 
               <br />

               <br />
               century, replaced by local governments, 
               <br />
               which will be nothing more than municipal 
               <br />

               our schools and our lands; but we shall 
               <br />
               then obtain local governments based on the 
               <br />
               sovereignty of states, as is the case under the 
               <br />
               Constitution of the United States. The

               <br />

               posite local interests, and it cost them 
               <br />
               several years of deep study to reconcile 
               <br />
               these various interests, and ﬁnally to build
