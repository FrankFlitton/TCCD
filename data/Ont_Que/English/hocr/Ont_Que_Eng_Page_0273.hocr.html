               <br />

               Thus we shall have eighteen conservatives

               aanum—the average proportion of change— 
               <br />
               it would take nearly thirty years to bring 
               <br />
               about a change in the character of a majorit

               <br />
               But, sir, that will hardly be the case. In

               some of the Lower Provmces there will be

               will. The Government say they had to in-

               selves, but to please the provinces below,

               provinces that this case will carry out the

               If the two Canadas were alone interested, the 
               <br />
               majority would have its own way—would look 
               <br />

               as this about the Legislative Conn ' would 
               <br />
               have no chance of being carried, for it is not 
               <br />
               very long since the House, by an overwhelm- 
               <br />
               ing majority, voted for the substitution of an 
               <br />
               elected for a nominated Upper Chamber. In 
               <br />
               fact, the nominated Chamber had fallen so 
               <br />
               low in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public</span> estimation—I do not say it was 
               <br />
               from t e fault of the men who were there, 
               <br />
               but the fact is, nevertheless, as I state it— 
               <br />
               that it commanded no inﬂuence. There was 
               <br />
               even a diﬂ‘iculty in getting a quorum of it 
               <br />
               together. So a change became absolutely 
               <br />
               necessary, and up to the present moment the 
               <br />
               new system has worked well; the elected 
               <br />
               members are equal in every res t to the 
               <br />
               nominated ones, and it is just w en we see 
               <br />
               an interest beginnin to be felt in the proceed- 
               <br />
               ings of the Up er ouse that its Constitution 
               <br />
               is tobechange ,to return backagainte the one 
               <br />
               so recently condemned. Back again, did I 
               <br />
               say ? No, sir, a Constitution is to bc substi- 
               <br />
               tuted, much worse than the old one, and such 
               <br />
               as is nowhere else to be found. Why, even 
               <br />
               the British House of Lords, conservative as 
               <br />
               it is, is altogether beyond the inﬂuence of the 
               <br />
               popular sentiment of the country. Their 
               <br />
               number may be increased on the recommen— 
               <br />
               dation of the responsible advisers of the 
               <br />
               Crown, if required to secure united action or 
               <br />
               to prevent a conﬂict between the two Houses. 
               <br />
               From the position its members occupy, it is a 
               <br />
               sort of com romise between the popular ele- 
               <br />
               ment and t e inﬂuence or control of the 
               <br />
               Crown. But the new House for the Confed- 
               <br />
               eration is to be a perfectly independent body 
               <br />
               -—-these gentlemen are to be named for life—- 
               <br />
               and there is to be no power to increase their 
               <br />
               number. How long will the system work 
               <br />
               without producing a collision between the 
               <br />
