               speech delivered in 1861; and I say that 
               <br />
               the Constitution which this House, by a 
               <br />
               majority of three to one, has carried out as 
               <br />
               far as it is concerned, is, in spirit and letter, 
               <br />
               that which I then pointed out; and that was 
               <br />
               not the result of my experience, my thought 
               <br />
               and my opinion alone, but of the experience, 
               <br />
               thought and opinion of every man who had 
               <br />
               studied and taken into consideration the 
               <br />
               character of the Constitution of the United 
               <br />
               States. I know that in making that quota- 
               <br />
               tion -I am committing the error which I 
               <br />
               have charged upon other hon. members of 
               <br />
               the House of going back in the debate ; but 
               <br />
               I thought that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> due to myself to read 
               <br />
               it to the House, because the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Chateauguay—not in that blunt, plain- 
               <br />
               spoken style which characterises some hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen, but with that soothing, soft lan- 
               <br />
               guage that is so grateful to oue’s feelings-— 
               <br />
               (laughter)—stated that in proposing a Fede- 
               <br />
               ral union of these provinces I belied the 
               <br />
               whole of my political life, and that it was for 
               <br />
               this reason I made so feeble and ineffectual 
               <br />
               a speech when I oﬂ‘ered these resolutions to 
               <br />
               the House. As to the feebleness and in- 
               <br />
               effectiveness of my speech, that, sir, I admit; 
               <br />
               but as to my sentiments on Confederation, 
               <br />
               they were the sentiments of my life, my 
               <br />
               sentiments in Parliament years ago, my sen- 
               <br />
               timentsin the Conference, and my sentiments 
               <br />
               now. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SPEAKER,Isubmit, 
               <br />
               with all due deference to your decision, that 
               <br />
               the motion proposed by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peel is in order ; and it is a point, I am 
               <br />
               free to admit, of such doubt that I ought 
               <br />
               not to set up my opinion against that impar- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tially</span> given by yourself, for one is very apt 
               <br />
               to ecide in his own favor in a doubtful 
               <br />
               case. It would have been very convenient 
               <br />
               for the Government to have it declared out 
               <br />
               order, and our feelings may therefore have 
               <br />
               caused us to take a less impartial view than that 
               <br />
               taken by yourself; and it became our duty 
               <br />
               to submit to your ruling, unless we believed 
               <br />
               in our conscience that beyond all doubt you 
               <br />
               were wrong. Having been declared to be 
               <br />
               properly before the House, I must say that 
               <br />
               the motion of the hon. member is altogether 
               <br />
               inconsistent with his votes upon the uestion 
               <br />
               of Confederation. (Hear, hear.) cannot 
               <br />
               understand how an hon. member who gave 
               <br />
               the two votes he did last week upon that 
               <br />
               question, could make the motion in amend- 
               <br />
               ment now under consideration. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Indeed I understood him to say that

               I regret that my hon. friend has taken this

               course, I must at the same time congratulate 
               <br />
               him upon the sound doctrine he has laid 
               <br />
               down in his speech ; for if I wanted, if the 
               <br />
               House wanted, an argument in favor of the 
               <br />
               measure which the Government has laid

               before the House, we could not have had it 
               <br />
               in more eloquent and convincing language 
               <br />
               than that contained in the speech of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend. My hon. friend is always eloquent 
               <br />
               and always convincing, but he could not have

               HON. Arrr. GEN. MACDONALD—It

               may be a compliment, but it is not ﬂattery. 
               <br />
               A compliment is the statement of an agree- 
               <br />
               able truth; ﬂattery is the statement of an 
               <br />
               agreeable untruth. Now, were I to state 
               <br />
               that the hon. member for Cornwall delivered 
               <br />
               an eloquent and convincing speech, that 
               <br />
               would be Battery—(great laughter )—-but when 
               <br />
               I state, in all sincerity, that the speech of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Peel was an eloquent 
               <br />
               and convincing one, I may compliment, but 
               <br />
               I do not ﬂatter. (Hear, hear.) But what 
               <br />
               struck me as strange was that while my hon. 
               <br />
               friend stated to the House that he was not a 
               <br />
               man to make an unconstitutional motion, or 
               <br />
               to make a motion committing in any way a 
               <br />
               breech of constitutional usage, or to propose 
               <br />
               anything less than a constitutional appeal 
               <br />
               to the people, he should oppose the motion 
               <br />
               before the House; for I know that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend is not the man to commit a 
               <br />
               fundamental error inst constitutional and 
               <br />
               free institutions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%:</span> knew well, and it is 
               <br />
               much to the credit of my hon. friend as a 
               <br />
               sound constitutional lawyer, that although 
               <br />
               he drew his notice of motion hurriedly, it 
               <br />
               was necessary, when he presented it to the 
               <br />
               House, to guard against mistake; and he 
               <br />
               took care that the appeal he pr0posed to 
               <br />
               make to the pe0ple on this question should 
               <br />
               be a constitutional appeal by the members 
               <br />
               of this House going to the polls. (Hear,
