               believe the scheme will be found in fact and

               in practice—by its combination of the better

               great practical advantages. I shall read an 
               <br />
               extract from an article in the London 
               <br />
               Times, written in 1858, hearing on this 
               <br />
               subject, and which brings very clearly into 
               <br />
               view the distinction between the system 
               <br />
               which has been preposed for our adoption, 
               <br />
               and that which has been adopted in the 
               <br />
               States. The great weakness of the American 
               <br />
               system has lain in the fact that the several 
               <br />
               states, on entering the union, claimed inde- 
               <br />
               pendent jurisdiction ; that they demitted to 
               <br />
               the Central Government certain powers, and 
               <br />
               that they claimed equal and sovereign 
               <br />
               powers with regard to everything not so 
               <br />
               delegated and demitted. The weaknesses 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculties</span> of that system have been 
               <br />
               avoidei in the project now before us, and 
               <br />
               we have the central power with deﬁned and 
               <br />
               sovereign powers, and the local parliaments

               <br />
               subordinated to the central power. The 
               <br />
               article says :— <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               It is uite clear that the Federal Constitution 
               <br />
               of the nited States of America formsaprecedent 
               <br />
               which cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possibly</span> be followed in its principles 
               <br />
               or details by t e united colonies, so lon as they 
               <br />
               remain part of the dominions of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%mperial</span> 
               <br />
               Crown. The principle of the American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Peder-</span> 
               <br />
               ation is, that each is a sovereign state, which 
               <br />
               consents to delegate to a central authority a 
               <br />
               portion of its sovereign ower, leaving the re— 
               <br />
               mainder which is not so elegated absolute and 
               <br />
               intact in its own hands. This is not the position 
               <br />
               of the colonies, each of which, instead of being 
               <br />
               an isolated sovereign state, is an inte ral part of 
               <br />
               the British Empire. They cannot de egate their 
               <br />
               sovereign authority to a central government, 
               <br />
               because they do not possess the sovereign author- 
               <br />
               ity to delegate. The only alternative as it seems 
               <br />
               to us would be to adopt a course exactly the 
               <br />
               contrary of that which the United States adopted, 
               <br />
               and instead of taking for their motto E Pluribus 
               <br />
               Unum, to invert it by saying In Una Plura.
