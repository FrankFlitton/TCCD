               I have now to make a few remarks on the 
               <br />
               character of Her Majesty’s loyal Opposition. 
               <br />
               The composition of that Opposition strikes 
               <br />
               me as somewhat remarkable. It is certainly 
               <br />
               heterogeneous. The great diﬂ'erence be- 
               <br />
               tween the Opposition and the Government 
               <br />
               seems to me to be this, that while the 
               <br />
               Government are anxious to build up, to 
               <br />
               consolidate, to strengthen, the only object of 
               <br />
               the Opposition, the only object which keeps 
               <br />
               them together, appears to be to pull down, 
               <br />
               to weaken, to divide. (Hear, hear.) Many 
               <br />
               of the remarks which which have fallen 
               <br />
               from the various members of the Opposition, 
               <br />
               they might have made with equal force 
               <br />
               against each other as against the Govern ment. 
               <br />
               To use a military phrase, they seem to have 
               <br />
               been ﬁring at one another, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tut</span> as it is only 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁre away, although logically hora de combat. 
               <br />
               One says it is necessary we should have a 
               <br />
               change. Another says he desires no change, 
               <br />
               but wishes ustcremainas we are. Athird is

               <br />
               time past has been proved to be weak and 
               <br />
               powerless. Another member of the Oppo- 
               <br />
               sition bases his hopes of the world’s future 
               <br />
               on the principles of Federalism. Another 
               <br />
               says he will have nothing but a legislative 
               <br />

               <br />
               few of those with whom he acts who would

               threaten ﬁre and sword if a legislative

               have surely here an extraordinary display

               of anything but unanimity. As I said

               before, they present the spectacle of a most

               <br />
               the latitude of parliamentary opposition.— 
               <br />
               The circumstances of this country are 
               <br />
               too grave for us to triﬂe with such a 
               <br />
               question. If we present to the House 
               <br />
               and to the country something to meet the 
               <br />
               diﬁculties of our position, then I say that 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen who oppose that scheme 
               <br />
               are wanting in their duty to their country, 
               <br />
               and are wanting in the appreciation they 
               <br />
               ought to have of those difﬁculties, if they do 
               <br />
               not on their part present something to us, 
               <br />
               and ask us to accept from them what they 
               <br />
               suppose better than is offered to them by us. 
               <br />
               I cannot but express my regret at the course 
               <br />
               they have pursued. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Bean)</span> I will now 
               <br />
               allude, sir, to an opposition to thi~ scheme, 
               <br />
               which has been very decidedly expressed 
               <br />
               by a certain section of the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority of Lower Canada. I am aware, 
               <br />
               from personal intercourse with many gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen belonging to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motion</span> of the 
               <br />
               community, that they do feel a very 
               <br />
               strong aversion to this scheme, because, as 
               <br />
               they say, it will place them at the mercy of 
               <br />
               the French-Canadians. On this point I 
               <br />
               desire to assure my honorable friends from 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, that whilst I consider that 
               <br />
               our present circumstances require us all to 
               <br />
               speak Openly and honestly one to the other, 
               <br />
               it is and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:hall</span> be my earnest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desire</span> tu speak 
               <br />
               with all kindliness of feeling towards them. 
               <br />
               I feel compelled to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> that there is no part 
               <br />
               of this scheme that I feel more doubt about. 
               <br />
               than the effect it will have upon the educa- 
               <br />
               tion and political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> of the Protestants 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada. It has been said that 
               <br />
               there is and always has been a spirit of 
               <br />
               toleration and generosity on the part of the 
               <br />
               French-Canadians towards their Protestant 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen. I have heard it said that 
               <br />
               they have on every occasion furthered to 
               <br />
               the utmost of their ability, and in the fairest 
               <br />
               and most just manner, the educational 
               <br />
               interests of the Protestant minority. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span>
