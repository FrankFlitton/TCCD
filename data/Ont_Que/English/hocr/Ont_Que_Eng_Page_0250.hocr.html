               Upper Canada, I think it necessary for me 
               <br />
               to give my reasons for the position I have 
               <br />
               felt it my duty to take in reference thereto. 
               <br />
               It has been stated that the elections which 
               <br />
               have lately taken place have gone in favor 
               <br />
               of the Government ; but, even if such were 
               <br />
               the case, how could it possibly be otherwise, 
               <br />
               œeing that men of all shades of politics have 
               <br />
               united in forming a happy family. We have 
               <br />
               seen those who have been for almost a life- 
               <br />
               time antagonistic to each other opening their 
               <br />
               arms, as was so well and eloquently depicted 
               <br />
               the other evening by the honorable member 
               <br />
               from Montreal (Hon. Mr. FERRIER), and 
               <br />
               embracing each other; and we have been 
               <br />
               led to imagine that the millennium, so long 
               <br />
               predicted and anxiously looked for, has, 
               <br />
               so far as Canada is concerned at all events, 
               <br />
               at length arrived. (Laughter.) We areto 
               <br />
               have no more discord and no more strife, but 
               <br />
               are henceforth to live in harmony the one 
               <br />
               with the other. It has been asserted that 
               <br />
               in regard to myself I owe my return without 
               <br />
               opposition to the fact that I avowed myself 
               <br />
               in favor of the Confederation of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces on the basis submitted. This is not 
               <br />
               correct. I held no meetings—I made no 
               <br />
               speeches—and in no instance was I asked 
               <br />
               what were my views in regard to the scheme; 
               <br />
               and, if honorable gentlemen will permit me, 
               <br />

               existing between Upper and Lower Canada but

               must have felt that some remedy should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span> 
               <br />
               for those evils. Whether the very able gentle-

               men who have so strangely united to solve and 
               <br />
               remove these difﬁculties will be able to accomplish 
               <br />
               their praiseworthy task, time alone can tell. We 
               <br />
               need the details before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> able to pronounce 
               <br />
               an opinion; but heartily (an I hope in common 
               <br />
               with every well-wisher of their country) I most 
               <br />
               earnestly pray that they may succeed. 
               <br />
               It will be seen that here I simply state 
               <br />
               that the ntlemen who had so strangely 
               <br />
               come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">togetIihr</span> would be entitled to the thanks 
               <br />
               of the country if they were able to agree 
               <br />
               upon a scheme which would solve the ad- 
               <br />
               mitted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculties</span> between Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. But as I have read from my 
               <br />
               address, so I still maintain that, before we 
               <br />
               can be expecwd to express an intelligent 
               <br />
               opinion, we ought not simply to have half a 
               <br />
               scheme, but the details of the scheme in its 
               <br />
               entirety. If we refer to the election in 
               <br />
               North Ontario, where the Honorable Pro- 
               <br />
               vincial Secretary had been the representative, 
               <br />
               and who returned for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reelection</span> after accept- 
               <br />
               ing oﬁice in the present Government, we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that he was defeated by a gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. M. C. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CAMERON).</span> who is known to be 
               <br />
               an opponent to the project. And if we take 
               <br />
               the more recent election which occurred in 
               <br />
               South Ontario, we ﬁnd the contest between 
               <br />
               two gentlemen, both personal friends of my 
               <br />
               own, and both of whom were favorable to 
               <br />
               the principle, but who pledged themselves 
               <br />
               that before it became an accomplished fact, 
               <br />
               it should, so far as their vote would extend, 
               <br />
               be submitted for the approval of the people. 
               <br />
               And I would be greatly deceived if the gen- 
               <br />
               tleman who has now the honor to represent 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing the scheme unless that course be ﬁrst

               taken. We need the details before it is
