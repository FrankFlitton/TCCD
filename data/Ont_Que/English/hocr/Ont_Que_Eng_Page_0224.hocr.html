               Now, honorable gentlemen, I have shown

               that this scheme has no precedent, even on 
               <br />
               the other side of the line. Among all the 
               <br />
               wild republican theories of our neighbors, 
               <br />
               they have never proposed to change the 
               <br />
               Constitution in this manner—never changed 
               <br />
               it, at all events, without the consent of the 
               <br />
               people, obtained in some form or other. 
               <br />
               Referencehas been made, I think, by my 
               <br />
               honorable friend in front (Hon. Mr. Rose 
               <br />

               <br />
               every honorable member knows the means 
               <br />
               employed to bring about that union. MAY, 
               <br />
               in his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitutional</span> History, states that 
               <br />
               £1,500,000 sterling were spent in 'ng 
               <br />
               it. But how was the representation ealt 
               <br />
               with in that case? Did England, being the 
               <br />
               richer country, possessing the largest share 
               <br />
               of wealth and capital, give a preponderance 
               <br />
               of the representation to Ireland, as we pro-

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of 450 members. And although it was con- 
               <br />
               sidered by England an absolute necessity 
               <br />

               <br />
