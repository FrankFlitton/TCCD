               having done this when he was young, and yet 
               <br />
               you say that you would do the same if you 
               <br />
               were powerful enough to undertake it. That 
               <br />
               is no argument, and that is not what we ought 
               <br />
               to do. We ought to say to England that it 
               <br />
               is our wish to remain under the shadow of her 
               <br />
               noble flag; that we stand in fear of our neigh- 
               <br />
               bors, and are desirous of knowing what she 
               <br />
               can do to help us. It is in this way that our 
               <br />
               Ministers should approach the Imperial Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and if the negotiations do not ter— 
               <br />
               minate in a satisfactory manner, then it will 
               <br />
               be time to separate and to seek another state 
               <br />
               of existence. The debate has taken too 
               <br />
               personal a turn, and we have listened to ac- 
               <br />
               cusations and insinuations against this per- 
               <br />
               son and that person ; but as the Opposition 
               <br />
               has nothing better to suggest to us than what 
               <br />
               is proposed to us by the present Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, they cannot hope that members on 
               <br />
               this side of the House will support them 
               <br />
               with the sole object of defeating the Admin- 
               <br />
               istration. Gentlemen on the Opposition 
               <br />
               benches call for the details, but their lead- 
               <br />
               ers may be called upon to say what they 
               <br />
               suggest to bring the country forth from the 
               <br />
               ‘diﬂiculties in which it is plunged. What 
               <br />
               they desire is the status quo. But let them 
               <br />
               prOpose something practical to us ; let them 
               <br />
               say what they want and what they can do. 
               <br />
               Instead of this we hear from them nothing 
               <br />
               but reeriminations and perpetual fault-ﬁnd- 
               <br />
               ing. They ask why the Government does not 
               <br />
               now state how the local governments are to 
               <br />
               be organised ; but the reply to this question 
               <br />
               made by the Hon. Attorney General for 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, was very just, when he told 
               <br />
               them that the Government wished ﬁrst to 
               <br />
               know whether we were favorable to Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, and that then they would bring forward 
               <br />
               the details. This is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perfectly</span> fair, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> 
               <br />
               must not mix up the cards. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               l do not wish to speak at greater length 
               <br />
               at present; but I must allude, however, to 
               <br />
               the continual assertion of the. honorable 
               <br />

               <br />
               tional debt which Confederation will entail. 
               <br />
               Why does he not take account of the reasons 
               <br />
               which induce the Lower Provinces to refuse 
               <br />
               Confederation ? Is it because those reasons 
               <br />
               are fatal to his arguments ? in fact the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces declare that our Ministers 
               <br />
               wished to obtain too much for Canada, that 
               <br />
               the burthens to bc laid upon them are too 
               <br />
               heavy, and that an alliance with us would

               <br />
               grant too much to the Lower Provinces.

               <br />
               not be advantageous to them, because they 
               <br />
               will be compelled to pay for the canals, the 
               <br />
               railways and other improvements in Canada,

               <br />
               the provinces. That is why they labored,

               and labored successfully, to prevent the
