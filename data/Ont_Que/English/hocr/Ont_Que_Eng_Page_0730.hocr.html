               duced aught but lamentable dissenslon. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) What is the present c of 
               <br />
               the Opposition as regards the scheme of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gon-</span> 
               <br />
               federation ? It is this: you refuse an appeal 
               <br />
               to the people; you most un'ustly hurry on 
               <br />
               the debate ; you deny us all opportunity of 
               <br />
               moving amendments to the plan, or recording 
               <br />
               them on the journals of the House ; and you 
               <br />
               are bent on imposing on us, without our consent, 
               <br />
               a Constitution no detail of which is made knOWn 
               <br />
               to us, and of the general tenor of which our 
               <br />
               knowledge is also very im erfect. Now, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I beg to ask inisters whether it 
               <br />
               would not be inﬁnitely better for them to quiet 
               <br />
               all these apprehensions, and silence all com- 
               <br />
               plaints? Why should they hurry on the 
               <br />
               debate, I do not say unconstitutionally, but I 
               <br />
               do say with dangerous precipitancy ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thy</span> 
               <br />
               should they bar the moving of any amen - 
               <br />
               ment to the scheme, particularly as there 
               <br />
               is nothing pressing in the occasion, and as the 
               <br />
               aspect of the question is in many respects al- 
               <br />
               tered from what it was previous to these late 
               <br />
               events? I shall probably be told that I am 
               <br />
               wrong in saying there is nothing pressing in 
               <br />
               the occasion; that, on the contrary, events 
               <br />
               render the immediate passing of the measure 
               <br />
               absolutely necessary ; that the defence of our 
               <br />
               frontier is a question which must be settled at 
               <br />
               once—that there is not a moment to be lost. 
               <br />
               Well, Mr. SPEAKER, I acknowledge, for my 
               <br />
               part, that if I vote in favor of the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation, it is not out of a feeling of the 
               <br />
               necessity of setting about our defence; for 
               <br />
               hitherto I have never had a thought that the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the provinces afforded any 
               <br />
               better means of defending the frontier than 
               <br />
               that which we have at presen t—(hear, hear)— 
               <br />
               inasmuch as we have already all opportunity 
               <br />
               of combined action to the fullest extent under 
               <br />
               the protecting arm of England ; but this seems 
               <br />
               not to have entered the minds of the authors 
               <br />
               of the scheme. But I go further than this, 
               <br />
               and assert that the discussion which is daily 
               <br />
               going on on the subject of the proposed consti- 
               <br />
               tutional changes is agitating the public mind 
               <br />
               very strongly. As at a former epoch of our 
               <br />
               history, such changes necessarily tend to dis- 
               <br />
               turb the minds of the many; and this very 
               <br />
               natural agitation is attended with its dangers, 
               <br />
               and aﬂ'ords another proofthat constitutions are 
               <br />
               not the work of a day—that time, and even a 
               <br />
               great deal of time, is necessary to settle the 
               <br />
               foundation of the social and constitutional 
               <br />
               ediﬁce of the best disposed of the nations. 
               <br />
               The present Constitution of Great Britain is a 
               <br />
               proof of this. That is certainly well established, 
               <br />

               <br />
               the more care and deliberation now that, as the 
               <br />
               Ministers themselves acknowledge, we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ia</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               ourselves in agood attitude of d3fence to meet 
               <br />
               the imminent danger, we are perhaps weaken- 
               <br />
               ing our position, by acting too strongly or 
               <br />
               prematurely on public Opinion. I say then 
               <br />
               again, that those who would force our repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives to accept the measure without 
               <br />
               amendments, for the bare reason that we must 
               <br />
               prepare to defend ourselves in arms without 
               <br />
               loss of time, are acting without justiﬁable or 
               <br />
               suﬂicient reason. I regret deeply that the 
               <br />
               previous question has been moved, so as to 
               <br />
               reduce the friends of the Government to the 
               <br />
               necessity of voting on the measure before us 
               <br />
               without being able to move any amendment, 
               <br />
               and that in the face of a total change of cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances. I pray for the forgiveness of 
               <br />
               the House for having spoken on the subject, 
               <br />
               but I considered it a duty to protest at once 
               <br />
               against the proceeding of the Government 
               <br />
               which I had not foreseen. I shall vote there-

               Hos. Arrr. GEN. CARTIER—I am glad

               that the hon. member for the county of 
               <br />

               <br />
               communicated to us his apprehensions. I 
               <br />
               have listened to him with great attention, 
               <br />
               and I am certain that there is no difference

               between his views and ours. We are per-

               member for the county of Quebec and to 
               <br />
               the House, that the few words I have just

               uttered would excite the laughter of the 
               <br />
