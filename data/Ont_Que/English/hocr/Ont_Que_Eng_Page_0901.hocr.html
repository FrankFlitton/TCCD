               MB. JACKSON—I think it right to say

               a few words on this question before the vote 
               <br />

               detain the House very long. The subject 
               <br />
               has been discussed from various points of 
               <br />
               view. In the early part of the debate, one 
               <br />
               gentleman, the hon. member for Hoohelaga 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. DOBION), objected to the scheme 
               <br />
               mainly on the ground that it approximated 
               <br />
               too closely to a legislative union, and that it

               would interfere with the privileges which 
               <br />
               the parties to the union exercise in their 
               <br />
               respective localities; and if I remember 
               <br />
               rightly, he said that the plan of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment would have the effect of interfering 
               <br />
               with the language and religion of Lower 
               <br />
               Canadians. It occurred to me at the time 
               <br />
               he was making his speech, that he was taking 
               <br />
               untenable ground, and I felt grateful then, 
               <br />
               and I do so now, that that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               is not in a position to exercise more power, 
               <br />
               at this crisis, than an ordinary member of 
               <br />
               the Legislature. I admire the ability of 
               <br />
               that honorable gentleman, and I consider it 
               <br />
               unfortunate that at this important juncture 
               <br />
               he did not rise above narrow and limited 
               <br />
               sectional views, and take more statesmanlilre 
               <br />
               ground. (Hear, hear.) Then the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Ontario (Mr. M. C. 
               <br />
               CAMERON) objected to Confederation from 
               <br />
               a different point of view, but he arrived at 
               <br />
               his conclusions from arguments of an entirely 
               <br />
               different character. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Strange</span> to say, he did 
               <br />
               not regard this with satisfaction, while a 
               <br />
               legislative union would meet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">withrhis</span> appro- 
               <br />
               val. He professed to believe that the Mari- 
               <br />
               time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provincea‘would</span> combine with Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, and form a union detrimental to the 
               <br />
               interests of Upper Canada, placing the 
               <br />
               peOple the:e in a worse position than that 
               <br />
               which they at present occupy with an 
               <br />
               equality of representation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As,</span> he made 
               <br />
               that remark, I asked him what diﬁ'erence it 
               <br />
               could make then, whether we had a Federal 
               <br />
               or 3 Legislative union, which he professes to 
               <br />
               admire, as it would have charge of all the 
               <br />
               important general interests. His answer 
               <br />
               convinced me that there was nothing to 
               <br />
               support his argument. It seemed to me 
               <br />
               that he took too much for granted in assum- 
               <br />
               ing that there would be a union between 
               <br />
               Lower Canada and the Maritime Provinces as 
               <br />
               against Upper Canada. Itis hardlytobeeou- 
               <br />
               ceived that gentlemen called together for the 
               <br />
               performance of certain high purposes would 
               <br />
               attempt to do an injury to one part of the 
               <br />
               country over another. (Hear, hear.) If 
               <br />
               such a sectional alliance was possible, it 
               <br />
               would be much more likely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the union 
               <br />
               would be formed with Upper Canada, inu- 
               <br />
               much as that part of the proposed Con- 
               <br />
               federacy has a much larger aggregate busi- 
               <br />
               ness than any or either of the other separate 
               <br />
               sections. But I will not dwell upon this, asit 
               <br />
               appears to me to carry with it its Own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retuta-</span> 
               <br />
               tion. This principal reason for opposing this 
               <br />
               scheme is, I think, founded on the fact that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen now united together in
