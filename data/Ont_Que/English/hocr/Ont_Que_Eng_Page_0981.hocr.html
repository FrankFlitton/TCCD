               <br />
               inﬂuence in stimulating the energies of the

               satisfactory footing than that on which they 
               <br />
               now stand. I am satisﬁed, with that hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, that it would have had this 
               <br />
               effect to a very great extent. But we know 
               <br />
               very well the antagonisms which existed be- 
               <br />
               tween the two sections, and that that mea- 
               <br />
               sure, while pressed by Upper Canada, was 
               <br />
               resisted by Lower Canada. We have felt— 
               <br />
               and no doubt many in Lower Canada have 
               <br />
               felt—that this Confederation of the British 
               <br />
               North American Colonies would probably 
               <br />
               not have reached the point it has reached, 
               <br />
               had the demands—the just demands-0t 
               <br />
               Upper Canada been conceded by Lower 
               <br />
               Canada ; had we been placed in that 
               <br />
               position on the ﬂoor of this House, 
               <br />
               which we thought the interests of the 
               <br />
               western portion of Canada required at the 
               <br />
               hands of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But we have not found that that was done. 
               <br />
               Lower Canada felt that if representation by 
               <br />
               population were conceded, there would have 
               <br />
               been dangers 'ncurred to her own institu- 
               <br />
               tions, which s e was not willing to place in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'hands</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incrmed</span> number of repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives from Upper Canada. I think the 
               <br />
               people of Lower Canada were mistaken in 
               <br />
               that feeling. I do not believe that her 
               <br />
               institutions would have been dealt with in a 
               <br />
               way unsatisfactory to her people. The peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Upper Canada, I think, have always 
               <br />
               been prepared to do what was fair and just 
               <br />
               towards the peeple of Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I have no doubt, however, 
               <br />
               that the people of Lower Canada would 
               <br />
               be much more ready to take up such a 
               <br />
               scheme as this. which would give them 
               <br />
               a Local Legislature to manage their own 
               <br />
               local aﬂ'airs, rather than adopt a measure 
               <br />
               which would place them in what they 
               <br />
               might conceive to be an inferior posi- 
               <br />
               tion in point of their numbers on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House, and an inferior position in 
               <br />
               respect of power—supposing representation 
               <br />
               by population in the united Legislature of 
               <br />
               Canada were carried. There can be no 
               <br />
               doubt that the idea that there is a necessity 
               <br />
               for change has not only grown up from the 
               <br />
               feeling to which I have referred, but from 
               <br />
               the circumstances connected with our rela- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the last three or four years. The Recipro- 
               <br />
               city treaty was passed ten years ago, ,at a 
               <br />

               when the statesmen of the United States

               believed the eﬁ'ect of that measure would be

               many of those who consented to the Be-

               <br />
               ing which was springing up of an entirely 
               <br />
               opposite character. But now there is no 
               <br />
               doubt that the disposition to abrogate the 
               <br />
               Reciprocity treaty has not arisen alone from 
               <br />
               angry feelings against England by the 
               <br />
               people of the United States, and in con- 
               <br />
               sequence of the fancied raids from this 
               <br />
               country—but also from the fact that there 
               <br />
               has been a great pressure of taxation upon 
               <br />
               themselves, and the necessity of raising the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff,</span> and from the belief that if a tax were 
               <br />
               placed upon the produce coming in to them 
               <br />
               from Canada, an increased revenue would re- 
               <br />
               sult. All these circumstances have iven rise 
               <br />
               to the desire on the part of the peop e and the 
               <br />
               Government of the United States to place 
               <br />
               this uestion on a different footing from that 
               <br />
               on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> it has stood for ten years, and to 
               <br />
               repeal that treaty which they represent to

               <br />
               point of fact it is very largely in favor of 
               <br />
               the United States. (Hear, hear.) Another 
               <br />
               reason why a change is necessary, is—as we 
               <br />
               cannot conceal from ourselves—that our 
               <br />
               position as a colony has been greatly altered 
               <br />
               by the events which have taken place in the 
               <br />
               United States. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,We</span> cannot now expect that 
               <br />
               we can sit with our arms folded, praying 
               <br />
               that Providence may be good to us, though 
               <br />
               we do not prepare to defend ourselves. We 
               <br />
               cannot expect that England will be prepared 
               <br />
               to take on her shoulders almost the whole of 
               <br />
               the burden, and that we are to be neither the 
               <br />
               hewers of wood nor the drawers of water. We 
               <br />
               must be both. And if we obtain, as I hope, 
               <br />
               through the resolutions which have been 
               <br />
               passed, when the proper time comes, we will 
               <br />
               obtain—if we get the name and status of a 
               <br />
               nation, we should not be afraid also to take 
               <br />
               the responsibilities of a nation ; and the 
               <br />
               course most likely to save us from attack is 
               <br />
               that we should learn in the time of peace to 
               <br />
               be prepared for the exigency of war, and to 
               <br />
               put ourselves—a peeple of four millions, as 
               <br />
               we will be when united together—in a posi-
