               sented the people in the Legislative Assembly. 
               <br />
               Such a state of things could not continue with- 
               <br />
               out leading to a collision; and the events of 
               <br />
               1837 justiﬁed the apprehension of those who 
               <br />
               had all along warned the Government that it 
               <br />
               was impossible for the peeple any longer to 
               <br />
               endure so ﬂagrant a violation of their rights, 
               <br />
               and that there was imminent danger of ex- 
               <br />
               haunting their patience. Events followed 
               <br />
               each other rapidly, and the clergy then, as 
               <br />
               at this time, were opposed to any energetic 
               <br />
               demonstrations. Monseigneur LARTIGUE, 
               <br />
               Bishop of Montreal, published a pastoral let- 
               <br />
               ter, in which he said : “ Who will dare assert 
               <br />
               that the whole people of this country desire 
               <br />
               the destruction of the Government?” Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> no one desired it; but the minor- 
               <br />
               ity at that period, like the minority at pres- 
               <br />
               ent, complained of the injustice they suffered, 
               <br />
               and the clergy were opposed to them. The 
               <br />
               minority of that day struggled for the politi- 
               <br />
               cal rights of the people se they are struggling 
               <br />
               now, and they found arrayed against them 
               <br />
               every owcrful inﬂuence and all established 
               <br />
               authorities. This contrast points to a fact 
               <br />
               deserving of notice. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Today</span> the Government 
               <br />
               constantly insult us by crying out: “ You 
               <br />
               represent nothing in this House; public 
               <br />

               <br />
               En, I ask the on. Attorney General for 
               <br />
               Lower Canada whether he himself and his 
               <br />
               honorable colleague the Prime Minister, had 
               <br />
               the majority of the Lower Canada people 
               <br />
               and clergy with them when, in 1837, they 
               <br />
               protested energetically against the injustice 
               <br />
               done to their fellow-countrymen? No, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, at that time they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed</span> part of 
               <br />
               the little phalanx who went so far as to raise 
               <br />
               the standard of rebellion on the plains of 
               <br />
               St. Denis and St. Charles! How times are 
               <br />
               changedl At the present moment the same 
               <br />
               men, the revolutionists of former days, strain 
               <br />
               every nerve to deprive the people of the right 
               <br />
               of pronouncing for or against the constitu- 
               <br />
               tional changes sought to be forced upon them. 
               <br />
               So complete a forgetfulness of their own past is 
               <br />
               extremely deplorable. Mr. SPEAKER, for 
               <br />
               weighty reasons, I do not desire to dwell 
               <br />
               on the events of 1837. In 1838 there 
               <br />
               remained to be brought on the trials of 
               <br />
               those who had been implicated in the 
               <br />
               troubles. Lord DURHAM found himself 
               <br />
               placed in an embarrassing position, for it is 
               <br />

               <br />
               SPEAKER, among those sanguinary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mm</span> I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd the Honorable Attorney General for 
               <br />
               Lower Canada (Hon. Mr. CARTIER). (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Far be from me the thought of re- 
               <br />
               proaching him with his conduct at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> period. 
               <br />
               I have always looked upon it as that of a 
               <br />
               patriot and of a true friend of his country. 
               <br />
               Besides, that honorable member has declared 
               <br />
               to us on many occasions that he did not regret 
               <br />
               the struggles which he had formerly main- 
               <br />
               tained in order to claim the political liberties 
               <br />
               of his country, and I can perfectly understand 
               <br />
               that he does not waver m those sentiments, 
               <br />
               for it is now an historical fact that all those 
               <br />
               who took part in those struggles nobly staked 
               <br />
               their lives for their convictions, and the min- 
               <br />
               ority then, like the present minority, could 
               <br />
               expect nothing but misinterpretation of their 
               <br />
               opposition to power. It is not for me to 
               <br />
               decide how far this insurrectionary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">movemmt</span> 
               <br />
               was excited by the deplorable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstance</span> 
               <br />
               of the time, but I am perfectly satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               those who were at the head of it were impelled 
               <br />
               by sentiments of patriotism, by the generous 
               <br />
               desire of obtaining for their fellow-country- 
               <br />
               men the political liberties which were refused 
               <br />
               them. They have therefore laid their coun- 
               <br />
               try under a great debt of gratitude for the 
               <br />
               sacriﬁces which they made. Now see, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER; the men who, twenty years ago, 
               <br />
               constituted a revolutionary minority, braved 
               <br />
               the clergy and raised the standard of revolt 
               <br />
               against Great Britain, are to—day in a ma- 
               <br />
               jority and supported b the powerful inﬂuence 
               <br />
               of England and of s clergy, whose entire 
               <br />
               conﬁdence they possess. They have their
