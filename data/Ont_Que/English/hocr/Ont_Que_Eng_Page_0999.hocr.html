               Well, perhaps the people will see that this 
               <br />
               great scheme of Confederation, which has

               Upper Canada—a place created, perhaps,

               chieﬁy by the Hon. President of the Council 
               <br />
               himself; and if it is true, as that honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman urged in his paper, it is still more 
               <br />
               true and essential now that the people 
               <br />
               should have an opportunity of pronouncing 
               <br />
               upon it. And, sir, I adopt the view of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Peel—although starting 
               <br />
               from it, he arrives at somewhat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘erent</span> con- 
               <br />
               clusions from myself— if you force this 
               <br />
               scheme upon the people without asking for 
               <br />
               their consent, and if they wake from the 
               <br />
               apathy which they feel now, to ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               they are saddled with burdens which they 
               <br />
               never contemplated, you make them Oppo- 
               <br />
               nents of the union, and worse opponents 
               <br />
               than if you asked them now whether they 
               <br />
               approved of it or not; and so you will have 
               <br />
               a dissatisﬁed people laboring under burdens 
               <br />
               which I fear will eventually create serious 
               <br />
               discontent throughout the length and breadth 
               <br />
               of the land. (Hear, hear.) And there is 
               <br />
               this additional reason for referring the ques- 
               <br />
               tion to the people, now that the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces have rejected the scheme, and I pre- 
               <br />
               sume their governments will not dare to 
               <br />
               press it forward in opposition to the wishes 
               <br />
               of the people. Now, hon. gentlemen opposite, 
               <br />
               when they introduced this scheme, and said 
               <br />
               they could suffer no amendments to be made 
               <br />
               in it, put it on the plea that it was absolute- 
               <br />
               ly necessary, to keep faith with the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, that the should carry it in its 
               <br />
               entirety. I am glad to ﬁnd that the Hon. 
               <br />
               President of the Council is not so willing 
               <br />
               and anxious to break faith with those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces as he was two years ago in reference 
               <br />
               to one of the essential ingredients of this 
               <br />
               scheme—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IntercolonialBailway.</span> (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I admire, sir, the principle of keep- 
               <br />
               ing faith in any engagement; but I do not 
               <br />
               think it was necessary, in order to keep faith 
               <br />
               in this matter, that it should be treated as 
               <br />
               the Government proposes that this House 
               <br />
               shall deal with it. All the Government had 
               <br />
               to do to carry out what it undertook with 
               <br />
               the governments of the Lower Provinces, 
               <br />
               was to bring the scheme before Parliament, 
               <br />
               as those governments have done, and allow 
               <br />
               Parliament to deal with it as it saw ﬁt. 
               <br />

               There was no necessity for saying to the 
               <br />
               House that it must reject it or adopt it in

               <br />
               nor even appointed by Parliament for that 
               <br />

               <br />
               the tacit understanding on the part of the 
               <br />
               representatives of the people in this House, 
               <br />
               to see whether any arrangement of union 
               <br />
               might be made that would work beneﬁcially 
               <br />
               for the interests of the whole provinces-— 
               <br />
               all it had to do was to settle upon some plan 
               <br />
               which it would report to this House for 
               <br />
               action; but it had no power whatever to 
               <br />
               bind this Legislature absolutely and irrevoc- 
               <br />
               ably to the scheme adopted by the Confer- 
               <br />
               ence, so that it could not dissent from or 
               <br />
               alter it. (Hear, hear.) Well, we ﬁnd hon- 
               <br />
               orable gentlemen who advocate this scheme 
               <br />
               say that it is not a perfect measure, that it 
               <br />
               is not what any one of the provinces would 
               <br />
               desire or accept of itself, but that it is ne- 
               <br />
               cessary to have this patch-work of 3 Con- 
               <br />
               stitution, because there are difﬁculties which 
               <br />
               it is necessary to get over and remove; and 
               <br />
               yet, while it is admitted to be imperfect, to 
               <br />
               tell us that we should not have an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of saying whether its provisions are 
               <br />
               right or wrong, is, to my mind, to insult the 
               <br />
               intelligence of this House, and to commit a 
               <br />
               wrong which I think honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               will have cause to regret hereafter. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Many honorable gentlemen have 
               <br />
               advocated this measure with great warmth,

               that idea somewhat in advance of his fellow-
