               Such were the opinions and such the basis of 
               <br />
               that great scheme of union which Lord DUB- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HAM</span> contemplated, and which he aimed to 
               <br />
               secure to Upper and Lower Canada. It con- 
               <br />
               sisted of two parts: representation based on 
               <br />
               population in the Legislature; and guarantees 
               <br />
               that the peculiar institutions of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               should be protected, and her rights respected. 
               <br />
               But His Lordship had larger views before him 
               <br />
               than the union of Upper and Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               He was anxious that all the British colonies 
               <br />
               in North America should be consolidated 
               <br />
               under one government. When His Lordshi 
               <br />
               received his commission from the Britis 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper</span> and Lower Canada; but a more pro- 
               <br />
               found study of the question when in this 
               <br />
               country, and from consultation with the lead- 
               <br />
               ing men in the several American Colonies, he 
               <br />
               arrived at the conclusion that a Legislative 
               <br />
               would be preferable to a Federal union of 
               <br />
               these colonies. The change in his opinion is 
               <br />
               thus stated in the extracts from his report, 
               <br />
               with which I shall now trouble the House. 
               <br />
               By a legislative union he means “ a complete 
               <br />
               incorporation of the provinces included in it 
               <br />
               under one Legislature exercising universal 
               <br />
               and sole legislative authority over all of them, 
               <br />
               exactly in the same manner as the Parliament 
               <br />
               legislates alone for the whole of the British 
               <br />
               Isles.” After a careful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">review</span> of the whole 
               <br />
               subject, Lord DURHAM says :—

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I had still more strongly impressed upon me 
               <br />
               the rest advantages of a united government; 
               <br />
               and was gratiﬁed by ﬁnding the leading minds 
               <br />
               of the various colonies strongly and generally 
               <br />
               inclined to a scheme that would elevate their 
               <br />
               countries into something like a national exist- 
               <br />
               ence. I thought that it would be the tendency 
               <br />
               of a Federation, sanctioned and consolidated by 
               <br />
               amonarchical government, gradually to become 
               <br />
               a complete Legislative union; and that thus,while

               <br />
               provide for the protection of British interests by 
               <br />
               the General Government, and the gradual tran- 
               <br />
               sition of the provinces into an united and homo-

               <br />
               the period of gradual transition is past in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, [and therefore he says,] that the only 
               <br />
               efﬁcacious government would be that formed by 
               <br />
               a Legislative union.

               Having thus dealt with the question in its 
               <br />
               application to Upper and Lower Canada, he 
               <br />
               extends the ran e of his observations to the 
               <br />

               But while I convince myself that such desirable 
               <br />
               ends would be secured by a legislative union of 
               <br />
               the two provinces, I am inclined to go further 
               <br />
               and enquire whether all these objects would not 
               <br />
               be more surely obtained by extending this legis- 
               <br />
               lative union over all the British possessions in 
               <br />
               North America; and whether the advantages 
               <br />
               which I anticipate for two of them might not, 
               <br />
               and should not in 'ustice be extended over all. 
               <br />
               Such an union woul at once decisively settle the 
               <br />
               question of races; it would enable the provinces

               <br />
               above all, it would form a. great and powerf

               <br />
               and responsible government for itself, and which, 
               <br />
               under the protection of the British Empire, might 
               <br />
               in some measure counterbalance the preponderant 
               <br />
               and increasing inﬂuence of the United States on 
               <br />

               His Lordship had no fears that such an union 
               <br />
               would lead to separation from the Mother 
               <br />
               Country. He rather looked upon it as a 
               <br />
               means of strengthening the bonds which 
               <br />
               united them, and of its proving an advantage 
               <br />
               to both. On this point he says :—

               I do not antici ate that a colonial legislature 
               <br />
               thus strong and t as self-governing would desire 
               <br />
               to abandon the connection with Great Britain. 
               <br />
               On the contrary, I believe that the practical

               relief from undue interference which would be 
               <br />
               the result of such a change would strengthen the
