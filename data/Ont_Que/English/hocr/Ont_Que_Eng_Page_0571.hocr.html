               remarks, Mr. SPEAKER, I shall conclude 
               <br />
               b stating thatI am in favor of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> 
               <br />
               an of Confederation, not because trust 
               <br />
               solely to the evidence of my own judgment, 
               <br />
               but because I see at the head of the movement 
               <br />
               the most enlightened men in the country, and 
               <br />
               because all the men of inﬂuence, all the men 
               <br />
               of property in the country, are in favor of the 
               <br />
               project. (Hear, hear.) And I am convinced, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding all that may have been said, 
               <br />
               that the country is sufﬁciently familiar with the 
               <br />
               project, and that the people now know all they 
               <br />
               will ever know about it. In every parish 
               <br />
               there are men who are the leaders of public 
               <br />
               opinion, and we know that these men are in 
               <br />
               favor of this plan. We have all these inﬂu- 
               <br />
               ences with us, and for my part I attach but 
               <br />
               little importance to the opinion expressed at 
               <br />
               certain public meetings held to oppose Con- 
               <br />
               federation, or to the petitions presented 
               <br />
               against the project, for it is always easy to 
               <br />
               obtain signatures to petitions. And, more- 
               <br />
               over, let any one compare the sirrnatures to 
               <br />
               these petitions with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">poll-books</span> kept at 
               <br />
               elections, and it will be found that they are 
               <br />
               the names of those who have always been op- 
               <br />
               posed to everything proposed by the great 
               <br />
               national party, which has ever represented the 
               <br />
               interests of Lower Canada. (Applause)

               MB. DUFRESNE (of Montcalm)—Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I do not rise to speak on the ques- 
               <br />
               tion now before the House, but simply to 
               <br />
               express my sur rise that after six weeks of 
               <br />
               discussion the pposition pretend that we re- 
               <br />
               fuse them time to discuss the measure, and 
               <br />
               that nevertheless they refuse to discuss it 
               <br />
               during the afternoon sittings, and will only 
               <br />
               take it up in the evening. For my part, I am 
               <br />
               prepared to vote at once upon this matter, 
               <br />
               and I believe that the question is perfectly 
               <br />
               mastered and well understood by every mem- 
               <br />
               ber of this House. Why are the Opposition 
               <br />
               unwilling to speak during the afternoon sit- 
               <br />
               tings? Their object in speaking is to kill 
               <br />
               time, rather than to discuss the merits of 
               <br />
               the question. And why is this? Is it 
               <br />
               because they are waiting for a few more peti- 
               <br />
               tions, a few more names, in order to protest 
               <br />
               against Confederation ? But we know the 
               <br />
               value of these petitions-we know what the 
               <br />
               Rouges are, and that they will sign any and 
               <br />
               every petition, provided it be against the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment and its policy. The Opposition is 
               <br />
               like a sulky child; if you refuse him a play- 
               <br />
               thing he cries for it, and then if you offer it 
               <br />
               to him he refuses to take it. The Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation is in reality the plan of those gentlemen 
               <br />
               themselves, and yet to-day they will not hear 
               <br />

               Opposition responsible for the loss of time we

               <br />
               come to a vote. Their conduct will receive

               <br />
               ER, when so many eloquent voices have spoken 
               <br />
               on the great question which occupies us so 
               <br />
               seriously, which stands preëminent over all 
               <br />
               others in the present situation, which pre—oc- 
               <br />
               cupies all minds, which agitates to its farthest 
               <br />
               limits all British North America, which in- 
               <br />
               cludes within its immense scope two oceans 
               <br />
               and nearly half a continent, and which is 
               <br />
               pregnant with the destinies of a great people 
               <br />
               and a great country—when the whole of the 
               <br />
               motives which can be advanced for and against 
               <br />
               the project have been so luminously discussed, 
               <br />
               when I myself have, elsewhere, at such con- 
               <br />
               siderable length and so completely developed, 
               <br />
               with the feeble abilities which Providence has 
               <br />
               conferred upon me, the considerations which 
               <br />
               militate for or against the entirety and the 
               <br />
               details of the work of the Quebec Conference, 
               <br />
               I might—perhaps I should—have remained a 
               <br />
               simple spectator of these solemn debates, while 
               <br />
               awaiting the hour at which I should be per— 
               <br />
               mitted to record m vote in accordance with 
               <br />
               my convictions. considered, however, that 
               <br />
               as one of the oldest representatives of the 
               <br />
               people, after having spoken elsewhere, I 
               <br />
               should speak again within the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliamentary</span> 
               <br />
               precinct, in order to accomplish to the letter 
               <br />
               my trust, and in order to obey that voice 
               <br />
               which has a right to command me. I have 
               <br />
               therefore come this evening in order to bring 
               <br />
               my feeble tribute of ideas to the decisive 
               <br />
               ordeal which is being accomplished. For my 
               <br />
               part I should have wished for the bringing 
               <br />
               forward of fewer personal questions, fewer 
               <br />
               criminations and reeriminations, fewer allu- 
               <br />
               sions to the past; in a word, I should have 
               <br />
               wished to see the debate rising at its very 
               <br />
               outset to the dignity of the question itself, 
               <br />
               so as to place as in a position to judge of 
               <br />
               it on its own merits, without considering 
               <br />
               the names or the antecedents of those who 
               <br />
               may defend or may oppose it; I should 
               <br />
               have wished to see the conscience of our pub-

               stances, men had forgotten that they were 
               <br />
               party men, in order to remember only their
