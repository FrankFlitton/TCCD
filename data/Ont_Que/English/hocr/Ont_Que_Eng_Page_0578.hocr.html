               not exist, and of what was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absurd.</span> He was 
               <br />
               like the French savant who, in 1836, proved 
               <br />
               by arguments not to be refuted, that it was

               ﬂoundering through his powerful and learned 
               <br />

               <br />
               cally across the Atlantic as if to mock the

               wisdom of science. Facts are stubborn and

               <br />
               durable was formed piece by piece, and that 
               <br />
               even what is actually strong must also perish, as 
               <br />
               the Roman Empire had ended by succumbing 
               <br />
