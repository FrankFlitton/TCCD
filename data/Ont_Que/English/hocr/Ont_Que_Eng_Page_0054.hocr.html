               Upper House is im racticablc in this young 
               <br />
               country. Here we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> none of the elements 
               <br />
               for the formation of a landlord aristocracy- 
               <br />
               no men of large territorial positions—no 
               <br />
               class separated from the mass of the pce lc. 
               <br />
               An hereditary body is altogether unsuite to 
               <br />
               our state of society, and would soon dwindle 
               <br />
               into nothing. The only mode of adapting 
               <br />
               the English system to the Upper House, is 
               <br />
               by conferring the ower of appointment on 
               <br />
               the Crown (as the nglish peers are ap oint- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eg),</span> but that the appointments should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> for 
               <br />
               l' e. The arguments for an elective Council 
               <br />
               are numerous and strong; and I ought to say 
               <br />
               so, as one of the Administration responsible 
               <br />
               for introducing the elective principle into 
               <br />
               Canada. (Hear, hear.) I hold that this prin- 
               <br />
               ciple has not been a failure in Canada; but 
               <br />
               there were causes—which we did not take 
               <br />
               into consideration at the time—why it did 
               <br />
               not so fully succeed in Canada as we had 
               <br />
               expected. One great cause was the enormous 
               <br />
               extent of the constituencies and the immense 
               <br />
               labor which consequently devolved on those 
               <br />
               who sought the suffrages of the people for 
               <br />
               election to the Council. For the same reason 
               <br />
               the expense—(laughter)—the legitimate 
               <br />
               expense was so enormous that men of stand— 
               <br />
               ing in the country, eminently ﬁtted for such 
               <br />
               a position, were prevented from coming 
               <br />
               forward. At ﬁrst, I admit, men of the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst standing did come forward, but we 
               <br />
