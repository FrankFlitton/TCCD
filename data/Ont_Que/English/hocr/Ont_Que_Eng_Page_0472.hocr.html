               the Lower Provinces who seeks this union

               taken the advocacy of Upper Canadian

               interests so culiarly under his own control,

               acting for the interests of Upper Canada

               kind ? (Hear, hear.) The President of the 
               <br />
               Council has used this language with reference 
               <br />
               to the matter. He says :_“ It is not a 
               <br />
               question of interest, or mere commercial 
               <br />
               advantage; no, it is an eñ'ort to establish 
               <br />
               a new empire in British North America.” 
               <br />
               That is the honorable gentleman’s state- 
               <br />
               ment. But, for my own part, I think it 
               <br />
               would be better to get out of the debt which 
               <br />

               Upper Canada should unite with him in 
               <br />
               supporting this scheme—“ We complained, 
               <br />

               <br />
               public chest and applied to local pur oses, in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, from which wc 0 Upper 
               <br />
               Canada derived no advantage.” Now I ask, 
               <br />
               have we ever seen an attempt made by 
               <br />
               Lower Canada to obtain so great a subsidy as 
               <br />
               $175,000 a year in perpetuity? "And yet, 
               <br />
               that is what the hon. gentleman, by this 
               <br />
               scheme, actually concedes to them, apart 
               <br />
               from the greater expenditure we will have to 
               <br />
               pay in connection with the administration of 
               <br />
               the general affairs of the whole Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation. Let us see what the seventeen addi-

               tional representatives we of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               are to obtain, will cost us. I make it that 
               <br />
               for each representative we will have to pay 
               <br />
               only 816,397 per annum. I make that out 
               <br />
               in this way. The contribution by the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces to the General Government is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,929,272.</span> The contribution of Lower

               Canada is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">82,208,035.</span> The contribution of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada is $4,416,072. I am speak-

               ing now of the contributions that go to meet 
               <br />
               the expenditure of the Federal Government. 
               <br />
               The contribution of Upper Canada is thus in

               excess of the Lower Provinces, $2,486,800; 
               <br />

               <br />
               and in excess of both, $278,765, which, 
               <br />
               divided by 17, will give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$16,397</span> as the cost 
               <br />
               of each additional member we are getting. 
               <br />
               HON. J. S. MACDONALD—Hear, hear. 
               <br />
               Ma. CAMERON—Well, this matter is 
               <br />
               not left to us either, as the representatives 
               <br />
               of the people, to pronounce an opinion upon 
               <br />
               it. We are to take the scheme as a whole. 
               <br />
               We are not to be allowed to amend it in any 
               <br />
               particular. But the Government come down 
               <br />
               and tell us, that in consequence of the union 
               <br />
               of political parties which has taken place, 
               <br />
               they feel themselves so strong that they can 
               <br />
               say to the representatives of the people : 
               <br />
               “ Just take this, or you shall have nothing, 
               <br />
               and revert back to inevitable ruin.” That is 
               <br />
               the position in which they put us. Yet, if the 
               <br />
               statement made by the Hon. Finance Minister 
               <br />
               is correct, our revenue has increased,se that 
               <br />
               we have a surplus of $872,000, after making 
               <br />
               up the deﬁciency of the previous year. He 
               <br />
               tells us the revenue of Canada has increased 
               <br />
               by a million and a half of dollars ; and that 
               <br />
               the revenues of New Brunswick and Nova 
               <br />
