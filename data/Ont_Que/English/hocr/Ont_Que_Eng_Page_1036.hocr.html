               <br />
               dissolved, and the Imperial Parliament could 
               <br />
               not legislate on it fora year or more—(hear, 
               <br />

               <br />
               country would still remain, for a year or two 
               <br />
               longer, exposed to the dangers and diﬂi- 
               <br />
               culties so eloquently described by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Peel. (Hear.) If that hon. 
               <br />
               member had voted against the previous 
               <br />
               question, and thereby asserted the right to 
               <br />
               amend or refer the Address before adoption, 
               <br />
               he could now very properly ask and claim 
               <br />
               our support to this resolution. But he not 
               <br />
               only voted for the previous question, but 
               <br />
               for the Address, and deliberately chose the 
               <br />
               present time to make this motion. Under 
               <br />
               these circumstances, he at least has no claim 
               <br />
               upon the support of the House. (Bean) 
               <br />
               Having made a solemn contract with this 
               <br />
               House on the main question, he now turns 
               <br />
               round and seeks to upset the arrangement 
               <br />
               of his own making. His course is best 
               <br />
               explained by asimple illustration. Suppose 
               <br />
               four or ﬁve gentlemen had entered into an 
               <br />
               unanimous agreement, when one turns round 
               <br />
               and says, “ I was and am in favor of all that 
               <br />
               has been done ; but unless you now attach 
               <br />
               this condition, I draw back and retire from 
               <br />
               the arrangement.” (Hear.) That was con- 
               <br />
               duct ‘which could not be approved either in 
               <br />
               public or private <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁirs.</span> The position of 
               <br />
               the seconder of the resolution—the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Ontario—is entirely 
               <br />
               different, because he, like myself, asserted 
               <br />
               by his vote on the previous question, the 
               <br />
               desire to have the resolutions amended. 
               <br />
               The honorable member for Peel told us, 
               <br />
               even to-day, that this he considered 
               <br />
               the proper time to place his motion before 
               <br />
               the House. The resolution itself is highly 
               <br />
               proper, and one for which I would have 
               <br />
               voted, had it been made before the adoption 
               <br />
               of the Address. (ﬂeur.) Now it is en- 
               <br />
               tirely out of place. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Ontario remarked just now, in the 
               <br />
               course of his speech, that this Constitution, 
               <br />
               if adopted, will soon have to be amended, 
               <br />
               and therefore, he said, we ought not to 
               <br />
               accept it. I entirely dissent from that 
               <br />
               opinion. Why, sir, the British Constitution 
               <br />
               is but a series of amendments made from 
               <br />
               time to time—a growth by successive amend- 
               <br />
               ments. The objection of my hon. friend is 
               <br />
               one of the main reasons why I am willing to 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 1865 614 3334 5086">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               accept this scheme. I believe it will 
               <br />
               admit of amendment as time goes on, so 
               <br />
               that it may be made to meet the changing 
               <br />
               wants and requirements of the people. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend from North Ontario referred to 
               <br />
               the seductive inﬂuence of the breath of the 
               <br />
               Hon. President of the Council, when breath- 
               <br />
               ed into the ears of members, and its magical 
               <br />
               eﬂ'ects in relaxing the knees, and then, sir, he 
               <br />
               locked, by way, I presume, of application, at 
               <br />
               the hon. memberforWest Elgin. (Loud laugh- 
               <br />
               ter.) N ow I have always regarded the hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Elgin as one of the most 
               <br />
               reliable members of this House. (Laughter.) 
               <br />
               Well, if my honorable friend looked more 
               <br />
               particularly in this direction, I have nothing 
               <br />
               to add to the reasons already given in expla- 
               <br />
               nation of my vote. The question before me 
               <br />
               was—“ Should we adopt or reject the 
               <br />
               resolutions ?”—and agreeing with the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Peel that something should be 
               <br />
               done immediately, I voted for them. I 
               <br />
               think it would be most outrageous if, after 
               <br />
               they have been sanctioned by a vote of this 
               <br />
               House, we were to nullify them by any 
               <br />
               subsequent proceedings. If the resolutions 
               <br />
               were to be referred to the people at all, it 
               <br />
               should have been before they received the 
               <br />
               sanction of this House. Are we to turn 
               <br />
               round to—day and reverse what we did on 
               <br />
               Saturday last ? I repeat, sir, that I think 
               <br />
               the resolutions should have gone to the 
               <br />
               country—and if my opinion had prevailed, 
               <br />
               they would have been referred—but not now, 
               <br />
               after their deliberate sanction by this House ; 
               <br />
               to do so would stultify the Legislature. Our 
               <br />
               duty is now, in my opinion, to car them 
               <br />
               into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> in good faith, and n°0 stand 
               <br />
               shilly-shallying — blowing hot and cold 
               <br />
               with the same breath. I, sir, stand 
               <br />
               by what I have done, and- by what this 
               <br />
               House has done, and shall vote against 
               <br />
               the amendment of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Peel—(hear)—who, I think, occupies amost 
               <br />
               inconsistent position. (Hear, hear.) There 
               <br />
               is another point, sir, to which I desire to 
               <br />
               allude. The hon. member for Peel stated 
               <br />
               that he voted for the Address as a private 
               <br />
               individual—as he would have voted on the 
               <br />
               question if out of this House. New, sir, 
               <br />
               no member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> shield himself under such a 
               <br />
               subterfuge. No member can separate his 
               <br />
               private from his legislative character in this 
               <br />
               House. If the explanation of the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Peel be the general doctrine 
               <br />
               and practice of Parliament, I should like to 
               <br />
