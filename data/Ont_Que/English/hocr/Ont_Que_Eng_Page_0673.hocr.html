               mediate attention that the matter cannot be 
               <br />

               <br />
               Government have had in their hands a report 
               <br />
               from Uol. JERVOIS upon the defences, since 
               <br />
               the 12th of October last, and yet since that 
               <br />
               time not a. single thing has been done towards 
               <br />
               defenc .:. We are now told with startling 
               <br />
               emphasis that the country is about to be in- 
               <br />
               vaded, or is in most imminent danger; and 
               <br />
               all at c <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rice,</span> now that the great scheme of 
               <br />
               Conlederation is defeated, we learn that not 
               <br />
               an hour's delay can be allowed, and that we 
               <br />
               cannot even wait to vote the supplies, so 
               <br />
               urgent is the necessity of sending a mission to 
               <br />
               E land about this matter. Between Friday 
               <br />

               covered that this imminent danger threatens 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us,</span> and so anxious is it about it that we 
               <br />
               cannot even stop to vote the ordinary sup— 
               <br />
               plies, but must pass at once a vote of credit. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) And, sir, while I am on the

               subject of the defences, I must say it is most 
               <br />
               astonishing that although we have repeatedly 
               <br />
               asked for information on the subject, in con- 
               <br />
               nection with this great scheme, we can not 
               <br />
               get it. (Hear, hear.) At the earliest mo— 
               <br />
               ment after the commencement of the session, 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Drummond and 
               <br />
               Arthabaska (Mr. J. B. E. DORION) made a

               motion for any despatches, reports, or com- 
               <br />
               munications, or for extracts thereof, which 
               <br />
               might be in the possession of the Government 
               <br />
               on the question of the defences of the country, 
               <br />
               and the Hon. Attorney General West rose 
               <br />
               and replied that to give this information would 
               <br />
               endanger the safety of the province. The 
               <br />

               asking for such information on the subject of

               unable to obtain an answer to it up to the

               a vote of credit to hon. gentlemen. ( ear,

               time for holding our meetings of Par- 
               <br />

               dinary thing that we should be asked by the 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen on the other side to 've

               thrown into a condition of derangement in 
               <br />
               order to allow the honorable gentlemen to get 
               <br />
               themselves out of a diﬁculty—not to get the 
               <br />
               country, but themselves, out of the diﬁeulty 
               <br />
               which they have acknowledged to have over- 
               <br />
               taken them? (Hear, hear.) Are all the 
               <br />
               affairs of the province to be thrown over, for 
               <br />
               such a reason, until next session, which may 
               <br />
               not be held for six months or nine months, or 
               <br />
               until the honorable gentlemen choose to call us 
               <br />
               again together ? Because “ an early summer

               <br />
               later period than that. Do they expect a

               vote ofcredit of six millions of dollars to enable 
               <br />
