               Where is then the danger of delay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Y—and</span> 
               <br />
               delay is all we ask for. What struck me 
               <br />
               very much in the eloquent and able address 
               <br />
               of the Honorable Commissioner of Crown 
               <br />
               Lands was, that he never touched upon the 
               <br />
               real question Of the amendment. It is true 
               <br />
               he said delays were dangerous, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dilay</span> would 
               <br />
               lose the measure, but not a shadow of argu- 
               <br />
               ment did he advance in proof of this view. 
               <br />
               I think delay is safety, in that it will enable 
               <br />
               the country and the Legislature to look into 
               <br />
               the scheme, to weigh all its advantages and 
               <br />
               disadvantages, if it has any, and so more 
               <br />
               certainly secure the passing of it if good, and 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rejection</span> of it if the reverse. Of course, 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen, divers views may exist as 
               <br />
               to the way in which the opinion of the people 
               <br />
               on this question is to be obtained. I am 
               <br />
               not to be deterred from expressing my views 
               <br />
               by the taunt of republicanism ; a sneer 
               <br />
               never disturbs me when I have good ground 
               <br />
               for what I do or say. I have had to bear 
               <br />
               with many a sneer on account of my adhesion 
               <br />
               to the temperance cause, but they never 
               <br />
               moved me from my course. My belief is 
               <br />
               that the views of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'peOple</span> may be ascer- 
               <br />
               tained without any such delay as will endan- 
               <br />
               er the scheme. lt is to be presumed that 
               <br />
               e debate will not extend beyond a week or 
               <br />
               two, in both Houses. A very short time 
               <br />
               after it is concluded, and the pamphlets 
               <br />
               containing the speeches printed, a direct 
               <br />
               vote of the people might be taken with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro.</span> 
               <br />
               priety and safety. The proposition to sub- 
               <br />
               mit the plan to the vote of the peOple seems 
               <br />
               at the ﬁrst glance not to be British—our 
               <br />
               prejudices rise against it. We are, however, 
               <br />
               not to be guided by prejudices, but by 
               <br />
               reason and reﬂection; and if we can ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the best means of clearly and satislactorily 
               <br />
               ascertaining what the people wish, that 
               <br />
               means ought to be adopted, call it by what 
               <br />
               name you may. I think that to put the 
               <br />
               matter to a direct vote in this way is the 
               <br />
               best plan. The people should be told : 
               <br />
               “ Here is the measure; will you take it or 
               <br />
               will you not ?” We should not ask them 
               <br />
               to discuss amendments; we could not bring 
               <br />
               the peOple of all the provinces together for 
               <br />
               such a purpose, and if we allowed amend- 
               <br />
               ments to be discussed, we should have 
               <br />
               inextricable confusion. The plain question 
               <br />
               should be proposed: DO you wish for this 
               <br />
               Coniederation or not—yes or no ?

               HON. Ma. VIDAL—No. That is the 
               <br />
               way the uestion is proposed to this House, 
               <br />
               and if it e wrong to submit it thus to the 
               <br />
               people, it is also wrong to submit it. in such

               a manner to the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               An additional motive tor suggesting this 
               <br />
               mode of proceeding is, that I should be 
               <br />
               extremely unwilling to subject myself w 
               <br />
               the censorious remarks of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               in the other Chamber who might reasonably 
               <br />
               say, if we propose to have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissolution</span> and 
               <br />
               a new election on the subject, ‘It is all 
               <br />
               very well, but you keep your seats, while 
               <br />
               you send us home.” I do not indeed see 
               <br />
               why we might not with great propriety wait 
               <br />
               until the next general election, when, after 
               <br />
               two years of reﬂection and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussioa,</span> the 
               <br />
               peeple would be still better able to give an 
               <br />
               intelligent vote. I can see no objection to 
               <br />
               the wish of the people being thus ascertained 
               <br />
               in this par excellence constitutional way; 
               <br />
               but as ministers tell us we cannot wait, then 
               <br />
               I say, let us rather have a direct vote of the 
               <br />
               people on the scheme than precipitate 
               <br />
               a general election. I should prefer a 
               <br />
               direct vote to a general election, because 
               <br />
               during an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">election</span> other inﬂuences are 
               <br />
               at work besides purely political ones. In 
               <br />
               many places the personal popularity of a 
               <br />
               candidate outweighs the political leaning of 
               <br />
               the electors; in others, a well-ﬁlled purse 
               <br />
               carries the day, or some local question pre- 
               <br />
               judices a constituency and inﬂuences the 
               <br />
               minds of the voters. But upon a scheme 
               <br />
               such as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this,</span> if submitted directly to the 
               <br />
               country, none of these considerations would 
               <br />
               have any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> and the electors would be 
               <br />
               guided by patriotism alone. So that while 
               <br />
               constitutionally the House represents the 
               <br />
               will of the people, and no fault could be 
               <br />
               tound if the House, after a new election, 
               <br />
               were to pass upon the matter, still the object 
               <br />
               desired, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vis.,</span> to know the desire of the 
               <br />
               people, would be more expeditiome and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lea</span> 
               <br />
               expensively attained by a direct vote. It is

               of no use to call this method “ Yankee " 
               <br />
               or “ Republican.” It is Well known that 
               <br />
               it prevailed as far back as the days of ancient
