               Well, sir, we ﬁnd that some of these articles 
               <br />
               have been taxed to an amount equal to one— 
               <br />
               half their value. The person who buys and 
               <br />

               when they consented that Canada should pay ﬁve-

               <br />
               not receive one-twelfth of the beneﬁt. Who can 
               <br />
               fail to see the hand of the Grand Trunk in 
               <br />

               Scotia that this Halifax and Que c Railwa will 
               <br />
               draw to their harbor the trade of the West, ut it 
               <br />
               is a dream and nothing more. No passenger, no 
               <br />
               shipper of freight, Will ever think of going or 
               <br />
               sending to Halifax when he can ﬁnd shipping at 
               <br />
               Quebec or Pertland. He will not add the cost of 
               <br />
               seven hundred miles of railroad to the expenses of 
               <br />
               transit to beneﬁt the people of Halifax. As to 
               <br />
               freight, the thing is not to be a oken of. Neither 
               <br />
               freight nor passengers woul such a line draw 
               <br />
               from any point higher than Riviere du Loup. 
               <br />
               There is a refreshing coolness in the demand that 
               <br />
               Canada shall pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fox—the</span> construction of a road

               brought to my notice. I took the statement 
               <br />
               as it appeared in the published <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">telegraph"</span> 
               <br />
               reports. He has no right to charge me with 
               <br />
               repeating an incorrect statement. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.)
