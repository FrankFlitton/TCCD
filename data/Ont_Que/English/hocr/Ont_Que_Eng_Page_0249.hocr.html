               but, if this view of the case be correct, why 
               <br />
               do not our merchants and millers forward

               any of the other different railway lines which 
               <br />
               have long been open to these points? The 
               <br />
               reason is obvious. The freight b railway is 
               <br />
               so expensive that they ﬁnd it to for their 
               <br />
               advantage to pay interest, storage and in- 
               <br />
               surance on their wheat and ﬂour until the 
               <br />
               opening of the navigation. And if they do 
               <br />
               not now avail themselves of the shipping ports 
               <br />

               send their produce double that distance over 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial road to Halifax? Most as- 
               <br />
               suredly not. (Hear, hear.) If the Recipro-

               And how the honorable gentleman from

               Toronto (Hon. Mr. Ross) could say as he

               able gentlemen that nothing could be more 
               <br />

               <br />
               aﬁ‘airs for a long time past. The Legislature 
               <br />
               has been called together year after year, and the 
               <br />
               usual sessional expenditure incurred—which 
               <br />
               is always very large—but the sectional major-

               ities arrayed against each other in the other 
               <br />
               Chamber, rendered useful legislation almost, if 
               <br />
               not altogether, impossible. Whatever govern-

               for existence, the very natural desire to ob-

               <br />

               <br />
               other local objects, on which vast sums have 
               <br />
               been squandered. It will secure to the people

               <br />
               which controls the purse-strings. It will also 
               <br />
               give to them all the unsold Crown lands in the 
               <br />
               western section of the province. And I trust 
               <br />
               the promises made with reference to the 
               <br />
               widening and deepening of our canals, and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               be carried out in good faith. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Indeed no Government can afford to treat with 
               <br />
               entire neglect works of so much importance to
