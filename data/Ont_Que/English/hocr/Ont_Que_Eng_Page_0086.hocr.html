               <br />
               the General Legislature will be to consider the 
               <br />
               modes by which the burden of taxation can be 
               <br />
               most easily borne by the industry of the whole 
               <br />
               country, and to aælmilate the several sources

               of revenue which are now in existence in such

               <br />
               able exercise of the industry of the peeple. It 
               <br />
               would be entirely out of place for me, sir, to 
               <br />
               attempt on this occasion to indicate what the 
               <br />
               policy of the General Government may be, but 
               <br />
               one thing must be evident to all, and that is, 
               <br />
               that where the taxation is about equal per 
               <br />
               head, the adjustment of it cannot be attended 
               <br />
               with any injustice to the people of any of the 
               <br />
               several provinces. Reductions may bemade in 
               <br />
               our customs, on the one hand; and, perhaps, 
               <br />
               on the other, some portions of our commerce 
               <br />
               may berelieved from the exactions to which 
               <br />
               they are now subjected. Apart from the advan-

               trade which will hereaﬁer exist between us, 
               <br />
               it must be clear to every member ofthe House 
               <br />
               that the credit of each and all the provinces 
               <br />
               will be greatly advanced b a union of their

               and this brings me to the consideration of the 
               <br />
               question of the means that will be at the dis-

               posal of the general and local governments. 
               <br />
               It must be admitted that having the power of 
               <br />
               taxation in their own hands, it will be the 
               <br />
               fault of the General Legislature if any em— 
               <br />
               barrassment is felt in meeting the expendi-

               ture of the General Government. Before, 
               <br />
               however, passing to the consideration of the 
               <br />
               means at the disposal of the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments. I would take this opportunity of reply- 
               <br />
               ing to the honorable member for Hochelaga, in 
               <br />
               reference to the export duty on timber in New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, and the royalty in Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               on the produce of the mines. This has arisen 
               <br />
               from the circumstance that in the former pro- 
               <br />
               vince it was found both expensive and incon- 
               <br />
               venient to attem t to levy their timber dues 
               <br />
               in the forest, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and)</span> they therefore ado ted the 
               <br />
               plan of causing them to be paid in t e form 
               <br />
               of an export duty upon the clearances of 
               <br />
               vessels at the custom house. If, therefore, 
               <br />
               provision had not been made for securin to 
               <br />
               New Brunswick the payment of these nes, 
               <br />
               that province would have been deprived of the 
               <br />
               large amount which its territorial timber con- 
               <br />
               tributes te the revenue, and the General 
               <br />
               Legislature would have been required to in— 
               <br />
               crease the proposed grant to that province by 
               <br />
               an amount equal to those dues—somewhere 
               <br />
               about 890,000 per annum. In the case of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia—not possessing any public lands 
               <br />
               or timber to any extent—her territorial reve- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and collected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.in</span> the form of royalty. Her 
               <br />
               representatives at the Conference inted out 
               <br />
