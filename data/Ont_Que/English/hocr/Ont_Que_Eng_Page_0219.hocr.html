               glad to hear my honorable friend on these

               points before a popular assemblage. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear). We have been told by my honorable 
               <br />
               friend the Commissioner of Crown Lands, 
               <br />
               that concessions had to be made, but how 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> concessions made ? Unfortunate- 
               <br />
               ly they were all made one way; they were 
               <br />
               made to the Lower Provinces. No conces- 
               <br />
               sions to Canada, east or west, but all in 
               <br />
               favor of the Lower Provinces. And could 
               <br />
               you expect anything else would be the result 
               <br />
               of the Convention, when the small province 
               <br />
               of Prince Edward Island, and the small pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Newfoundland, sent representatives 
               <br />
               in the same manner and the same number 
               <br />
               as the whole province of Canada? Could it 
               <br />
               have been expected that the delegates from 
               <br />
               Canada would supply all the talent? How- 
               <br />
               ever much I esteem the talents of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Executive Council, I believe 
               <br />
               there are those in the Lower Provinces who 
               <br />
               possess the talent necessary to arrange a 
               <br />
               scheme of this kind. When Canada, with
