               criminals l Poor people ! why do you allow 
               <br />
               yourselves to be deceived? If the Ministers 
               <br />
               are desirous of pushing on the measure, it 
               <br />
               is because of the check which the Ministry 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick have just had, and 
               <br />
               because it is for us to use all diligence to 
               <br />
               show the Mother Country that we do not 
               <br />
               hang ﬁre, but are ready to do our part to

               <br />
               at Quebec. It is time we should do some- 
               <br />
               thing to improve our position; for the 
               <br />
               intended revocation of the treaty of recipro- 
               <br />
               city, the probable abolition of the “transit” 
               <br />
               system, and other tokens of ill-feeling with 
               <br />
               which President LINCOLN’s Message of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> year is ﬁlled, are enough to warn us 
               <br />
               to prepare to meet the storm which is 
               <br />
               blowing up on the political horizon, that we 
               <br />
               ought immediately to look out for better

               If, hereafter, an appeal to the people, relative

               that a majority of the counties of both

               Canadas will understand their true interests, 
               <br />
               will be able to distinguish their real friends

               from those who aim at deceiving them by

               Confederation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> But if I, for 
               <br />
               one, am civilly told that I must stay at home, 
               <br />
               I shall have the satisfaction of saying that 
               <br />
               I have fallen like a man who preferred his

               duty to a ﬂeeting popularity ; and although it

               may be an easy matter for the fair and 
               <br />
               intelligent county of Vaudreuil to send to 
               <br />
               this House, as its representative, a member

               more competent in many respects than I

               prosperity of his country ! (Continued

               <br />
               that the people will comprehend the position 
               <br />
               of the country, will see that a measure of this
