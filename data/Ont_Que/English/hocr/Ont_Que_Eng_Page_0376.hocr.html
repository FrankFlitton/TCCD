               How will such tidings affect our credit? The

               world will not understand the motives of our

               <br />
               able argument to force us to accept it. What

               not admit that there is general contentment 
               <br />
               among the people?” It is on reasons widely 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differing</span> from these that the Speech from the

               <br />
               But are we really bordering on civil strife ?

               Of course it is representation based on popu-

               We, Lower Canadians, who at this distance 
               <br />
               cannot judge of the sentiments of Upper 
               <br />
               Canadians by our own observation, must de-

               specting them on the Upper Canada news-

               <br />
               information which we possess. Well, in 1862, 
               <br />
               we saw the U per Canada leaders, except the 
               <br />
               President of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Council, who was wiaeenough 
               <br />
               to keep aloof, who are at the same time con- 
               <br />
               nected with the principal newspapers there, 
               <br />
               either as proprietors, editors or co-editors, ac-

               cept oﬂice under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Maenonann—Sloor'rn</span> 
               <br />
               Government, the fundamental principle of 
               <br />
               which was equal resentation of the two 
               <br />
               sections, a principle which entitled it to the 
               <br />
               cordial support of Lower Canada. These 
               <br />
               gentlemen we saw <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reelected,</span> notwithstanding 
               <br />
               their abandonment of their principles, and we 
               <br />
               found them voting against representation by 
               <br />
               population. From this I conclude that Up- 
               <br />
               per Canada is much more indifferent, and its 
               <br />
               leaders much less sincere touching this ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the representation, than they would 
               <br />
               have us believe. Were it otherwise, Upper 
               <br />
               Canada would have taken the opportunity, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afforded</span> by the election, of punishing the men

               <br />
               men who now pitch their voices in harmony 
               <br />

               <br />

               of their sections, and became their chieftains 
               <br />
               respectively. When they found out that that
