               farm of Confederation; but what I can never 
               <br />
               consent to is to vote for a Confederation of 
               <br />
               which I know neither the exact nature nor 
               <br />
               the details. The article which I have already 
               <br />
               quoted is one of those to which I desired 
               <br />
               more particularly to draw attention. I will 
               <br />
               now quote the 67th resolution. I ﬁnd by 
               <br />
               this resolution “ that the General Government 
               <br />
               will fulﬁl all engagements entered into, pre- 
               <br />
               vious to the union, with the Imperial Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, for the defence of the country.” 
               <br />
               Now, strange to say, the authors of this docu- 
               <br />
               ment do not even take the trouble to state by 
               <br />
               whom such engagements must be made. N 0, 
               <br />
               they simply assert the obligation in the terms 
               <br />
               of the resolution I have just quoted. Sup- 
               <br />
               pose our Government had entered into an 
               <br />
               engagement to the extent of ﬁfty millions 
               <br />
               of dollars, shall we—can we—aﬁrm that the 
               <br />
               engagement was a necessary one, by voting 
               <br />
               for the measure without knowing the nature 
               <br />
               of the engagement? Coming now to the 
               <br />
               68th resolution, I ﬁnd: “ The General Gov— 
               <br />
               ernment will cause to be completed, without 
               <br />
               delay, the Intercolonial Railway, from 
               <br />
               Rivière du Loup, through New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               to Truro, in Nova Scotia.” Now, hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen, I maintain that this is another 
               <br />
               portion of the plan with which we are not 
               <br />
               acquainted. We do not know what is to be 
               <br />
               the cost of this railway thus described in 
               <br />
               the resolution I have just read. Here, 
               <br />
               again, we are kept in the most complete 
               <br />
               ignorance by the present Government. An 
               <br />
               honorable member of this House has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">declared,</span> 
               <br />
               that though the Intercolonial Railway were 
               <br />
               to cost ﬁfty millions of dollars, we should not 
               <br />
               hesitate to support a measure for carrying it 
               <br />
               out ; for, even at that price—that exorbi- 
               <br />
               tant price—it would be for the interests 
               <br />
               of the country. Well, I ask you, would this 
               <br />
               House be acting in accordance with that 
               <br />
               spirit of wisdom and prudence which ought 
               <br />
               to characterize it, by vcting blindly for such 
               <br />
               an enormous expenditure as that? I do not 
               <br />
               believe it, and for my part, I do not hesitate 
               <br />
               an instant to say that I would refuse. I am 
               <br />
               well aware, it is true, that the construction 
               <br />
               of this gigantic railway cannot cost so large 
               <br />
               a sum ; but it is generally admitted, both in 
               <br />
               this House and out of it, that the work 
               <br />
               cannot be done for less than twenty millions. 
               <br />
               Moreover, does it not often happen that 
               <br />
               public works estimated to cost, say one 
               <br />
               million of dollars, are found to have cost, 
               <br />
               when ﬁnished, double and more than double 
               <br />
               that amount? This may happen with the 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               <br />
               and I repeat it, this House ought to hesitate 
               <br />
               before sanctioning such an enormous expen-

               <br />
               heavily charged, an which will scarcely be 
               <br />
               in a more ﬂourishing position when the 
               <br />
               various British provinces of this continent 
               <br />
               are united under the Confederation. I am 
               <br />
               justiﬁed, then, in demanding that the details 
               <br />
               of the plan should be made known to us 
               <br />
               before we are called upon to sanction it. I 
               <br />
               have already stated that I do not pretend to 
               <br />
               be opposed to Federation of the provinces in 
               <br />
               every possible shape—that I might support 
               <br />
               a Confederation not of too onerous a charac- 
               <br />
               ter for this country—but it is obviously 
               <br />
               quite impossible for me to support a project 
               <br />
               of this kind, with which I am unaequainted, 
               <br />
               in its details and as a whole. It appears to 
               <br />
               me that the Ministry cannot complain if, 
               <br />
               under these circumstances, we vote against a 
               <br />
               project which we desired to know fully in 
               <br />
               order to form our opinions concerning it, 
               <br />
               and to ascertain that of the peeple we repre- 
               <br />
               sent. I do not think it can be pretended 
               <br />
               that this House is not entitled to make so just 
               <br />
               and reasonable 9. request. As I have shown, 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, if we accept the resolutions 
               <br />
               presented to us, we endanger the rights of 
               <br />
               the minorities in both sections of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince; we expose ourselves to the payment 
               <br />
               of enormous sums for the construction of 
               <br />
               a railway which may prove to be utterly 
               <br />
               useless for the defence of the country. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that, before undertaking 
               <br />
               such onerous charges, we ought to re- 
               <br />
               ﬂect deeply and to weigh well all pos- 
               <br />
               sible chances of such serious eventua‘ities. 
               <br />
               I am quite aware that certain hon. members 
               <br />
               of this House will never yield to the reasons 
               <br />
               I have advanced, nor shall I undertake to 
               <br />
               bring them round to my views, for I feel 
               <br />
               that all my _eﬁ‘orts must be useless. The 
               <br />
               fact that we refuse to accept the measure 
               <br />
               proposed to us before we are acquainted with 
               <br />
               it, certainly does not imply, as it is stated 
               <br />
               and supposed, that we are opposed to every 
               <br />
               idea of Confederation. Another provision 
               <br />
               of the project which we cannot a prove is 
               <br />
               that by which the constitution of t e Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Council is based on the nominative 
               <br />
               principle, instead of the elective principle 
               <br />
               which now prevails, as regards that branch 
               <br />
               of the Legislature, under our own Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. I have already had occasion to ex-
