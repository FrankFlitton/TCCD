               Canada said in this House that the clergy 
               <br />
               were in favor of the scheme. Now, I main- 
               <br />
               tain that a great many priests are opposed to 
               <br />
               Confederation. (Hear, hear.) I ﬁnd in the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">banadien</span> of this day a letter written by a 
               <br />
               member of the clergy, who expresses himself 
               <br />
               in the following terms on the subject of Con- 
               <br />
               federation—

               Ma. ROBITAILLE—Is the letter-really 
               <br />
               written by a priest ?
