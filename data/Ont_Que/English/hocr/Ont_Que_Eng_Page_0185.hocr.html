               were inclined beforehand to concur in the

               views of the representatives of the eastern

               views in opposition to the elective principle as 
               <br />
               applied to this House. They acted quite con-

               <br />
               right in making this change. We know that

               in former times, when our Legislative Council 
               <br />
               was nominated by the Crown, difﬁculties did 
               <br />

               such an extent as it should be. But under

               <br />
               at elections or in ways which may not be

               very creditable. (Laughter.) My honorable

               friend (Hon. Mr. CRAWFORD) may laugh, 
               <br />
               but if he reﬂects he will remember that he has 
               <br />
               himself known men in high positions whose 
               <br />
               career was not creditable in all particulars. 
               <br />
               However patriotic and anxious to discharge 
               <br />
               their duties rightly they might be, their views 
               <br />
               were sometimes warped by circumstances. 
               <br />
               Looking across the ocean, my honorable friend 
               <br />
               will remember that during the Administration 
               <br />
               of WILLIAM PITT, who wielded almost the 
               <br />
               sole control of Parliament in England for 
               <br />
               seventeen years, he appointed, durin this 
               <br />
               period, 140 members to the House of ords, 
               <br />
               subservient to his own wishes and intent on 
               <br />
               carrying out his views. I will just read to 
               <br />
               this House a short extract relating to him, 
               <br />
               written by a man capable of judging. In

               When Mr. PITT had been eight years in ower
