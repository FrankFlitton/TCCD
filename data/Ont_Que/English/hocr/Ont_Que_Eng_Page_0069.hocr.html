               guarantee for their enlargement? He found 
               <br />
               that the desirable improvement would cntail 
               <br />
               an expense of 812,000,000. As to the local

               <br />
               spread out to catch ﬂies. As to the argument 
               <br />
               that the rejection of the scheme would injure 
               <br />
               our credit, he would ask whether the bond- 
               <br />
               holders would not much prefer our present 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial condition to one of ﬁfteen millions 
               <br />
               of increased indebtedness, with nothing of 
               <br />
               value to show for it. If the people of Eng- 
               <br />
               land knew that Confederation and the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway meant an increase of ﬁft 
               <br />
               per cent. on our tariﬂ', they would not be so 
               <br />
               anxious for it. As to the representation in 
               <br />
               the Confederated Legislative Council, it was 
               <br />
               proposed to give Upper Canada and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada twenty-four members <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">each,</span> and to the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces twenty-eight. That is, the 
               <br />
               780,000 souls in the Lower Provinces would 
               <br />
               have four members more than Upper Canada 
               <br />
               with its million and a half. This proved that 
               <br />
               though Canada had talented men in the Con- 
               <br />
               ference, they either forget our interests or 
               <br />
               sat there powerless. When the Legislative
