               <br />
               passing events. In New Brunswick, conser-

               vatives join the liberal government to carry 
               <br />
               Confederation, and we see no parties there 
               <br />
               but the partisans and the opponents of the 
               <br />
               union, as in 1788, in the United States, there 
               <br />
               were no parties but the adherents of royalty 
               <br />
               and those of Federal Government. We see 
               <br />
               the same thing in Nova Scotia. This is true

               He may well say so—he who never had a 
               <br />
               party. He came into power, nobody expect- 
               <br />

               <br />
               everybody expects that. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Continued</span> laughter.) 
               <br />
               I am bound to shew him respect because he 
               <br />
               is my senior in this House, my senior by three 
               <br />
               years. It is true he has not always repre- 
               <br />
               sented the same county, his brother having 
               <br />
               fraternally driven him out of Glengarry, and 
               <br />
               obliged him to take refuge in the rotten 
               <br />
               borough of Cornwall. (Laughter.) But al- 
               <br />
               though we have almost always been unlucky 
               <br />
               enough to do duty in different camps, we have 
               <br />
               not on that account ceased to be good friends. 
               <br />
               ( Laughter.) I will not look at this question 
               <br />
               in a party light, because parties expire, and 
               <br />
               we do not know whether in thirty years the 
               <br />
               present parties will exist. We ought to look

               at the question apart from party considera- 
               <br />
               tions, and on its own merits: that is to say, we 
               <br />
               ought to place in the Constitution a counter- 
               <br />
               poise to prevent any party legislation, and to 
               <br />
               moderate the preeipitaney of any government 
               <br />
               which might be disposed to move too fast 
               <br />
               and go too far,—I mean a legislative body 
               <br />
               able to protect the people against itself and 
               <br />

               hear.) In England, the Crown has never

               attempted to degrade the House of Peers by 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               which are found in Europe, and the Federal

               <br />
               members of the House of Commons, will not 
               <br />
               be selected from a privileged class which have 
               <br />
               no existence. Here all men are alike, and 
               <br />
               are all equal; if a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerence</span> is to be found, it

               arises exclusively from the industry, the in-

               <br />
               who have labored the most strenuously, or 
               <br />
               whom Providence has gifted with the highest 
               <br />
               faculties. (Hear, hear.) Long ago the pri- 
               <br />
               vileges of caste disappeared in this country. 
               <br />
               Most of our ancient nobility left the country 
               <br />
               at the conquest, and the greater number of 
               <br />
               those who remained have sunk out of sight 
               <br />
               by inaction. Accordingly, whom do we see 
               <br />
               in the highest ofﬁces of state ? The sons of 
               <br />
               the poor who have felt the necessity of study, 
               <br />
               and who have risen by the aid of their intel- 
               <br />
               lect and hard work. (Hear, hear.) Every- 
               <br />
               thing is democratic with us, because cv one 
               <br />

               <br />
               noble ambition. The egislative councillors 
               <br />
               appointed by the Crown will not be, there- 
               <br />
               fore, socially speaking, persons superior to the 
               <br />
               members of the House of Commons; they 
               <br />
               will owe their elevation only to their own 
               <br />
               merit. They will live as being of the people 
               <br />
               and among the people as we do. How can 
               <br />
               it happen, then, that having no advan- 
               <br />
               tage over us greater than that of not

               being elected, they will not be subject in a

               legitimate degree to the inﬂuence of public 
               <br />
               opinion? There are some men who have

               enough patriotism to approve of everything

               thing done at home—it is a pitiful crotchet 
               <br />
               in the human mind. If there had been as 
               <br />
               much danger for the liberal party in this
