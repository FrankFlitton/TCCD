               favor by the country, and though there were

               <br />
               present proportions until last session. Then, 
               <br />
               men of all parties and all shades of politics 
               <br />
               became alarmed at the aspect of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘airs.</span> 
               <br />
               They found that such was the opposition

               between the two sections of the province, 
               <br />
               such was the danger of impending anarchy, 
               <br />
               in consequence of the irreconcilable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ-</span> 
               <br />
               ences of Opinion, with respect to representa- 
               <br />
               tion by population, between Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, that unless some solution of 
               <br />
               the diﬁculty was arrived at, we would suﬁ'er 
               <br />
               under a succession of weak governments,— 
               <br />
               weak in numerical support, weak in force, 
               <br />
               and weak in power of doing good. All were 
               <br />
               alarmed at this state of affairs. We had 
               <br />
               election after election,—we had ministry 
               <br />
               after ministry,—-with the same result. Par- 
               <br />
               ties were so equally balanced, that the vote 
               <br />
               of one member might decide the fate of the 
               <br />
               Administration, and the course of legislation 
               <br />
               for a year or a series of years. This con- 
               <br />
               dition of things was well calculated to arouse 
               <br />
               the earnest consideration of every lover of 
               <br />
               his country, and I am happy to say it had 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect.</span> None were more impressed by 
               <br />
               this momentous state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘airs,</span> and the 
               <br />
               grave apprehensions that existed of a state 
               <br />
               of anarchy destroying our credit, destroying 
               <br />
               our prosperity, destroying our progress, than 
               <br />
               were the members of this present House; 
               <br />
               and the leading statesmen on both sides 
               <br />
               seemed to have come to the common con- 
               <br />
               clusion, that some step must be taken to re- 
               <br />
               lieve the country from the dead-lock and 
               <br />
               inpending anarchy that hung over us.— 
               <br />
               With that view, my colleague, the Presi- 
               <br />
               dent of the Council, made a motion founded 
               <br />
               on the despatch addressed to the Colonial 
               <br />
               Minister, to which I have referred, and a 
               <br />
               committee was struck, composed of gentlemen 
               <br />
               of both sides of the House, of all shades of 
               <br />
               political Opinion, without any reference to 
               <br />
               whether they were supporters of the Admin- 
               <br />
               istration of the day or belonged to the Opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, for the purpose of taking into calm and 
               <br />
               full deliberation the evils which threatened 
               <br />
               the future of Canada. That motion of my 
               <br />
               honorable friend resulted most happily. 
               <br />
               The committee, by a wise provision,——and in 
               <br />
               order that each member of the committee 
               <br />
               might have an opportunity of expressing his 
               <br />
               opinions without being in any way compro- 
               <br />
               mised before the public, or with his party, in

               <br />

               <br />
               should be freely entered upon without refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the political antecedents of any of 
               <br />
               them, and that they should sit with closed 
               <br />
               doors, so that they might be able to approach 
               <br />
               the subject frankly and in a spirit of compro- 
               <br />
               mise. The committee included most of the 
               <br />
               leading members of the House,—I had the 
               <br />
               honor myself to be one of the number,—and 
               <br />
               the result was that there was found an ardent 
               <br />
               desire—a creditable desire, I must say,—dis- 
               <br />
               played by all the members of the committee 
               <br />
               to approach the subject honestly, and to at- 
               <br />
               tempt to work out some solution which might 
               <br />
               relieve Canada from the evils under which she 
               <br />
               labored. The report of that committee was 
               <br />
               laid before the House, and then came the 
               <br />
               political action of the leading men of the two 
               <br />
               parties in this House, which ended in the 
               <br />
               formation of the present Government. The 
               <br />
               principle upon which that Government was 
               <br />
               formed has been announced, and is known to 
               <br />
               all. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It'was</span> formed for the very purpose of 
               <br />
               carrying out the object which has now re- 
               <br />
               ceived to a certain degree its completion, by 
               <br />
               the resolutions Ihave had the honor to place 
               <br />
               in your hands. As has been stated, it was not 
               <br />
               without a great deal of diﬁculty and reluct- 
               <br />
               ance that that Government was formed. The 
               <br />
               gentlemen who compose this Government had 
               <br />
               for many years been engaged in political hos- 
               <br />
               tilities to such an extent that it affected even 
               <br />
               their social relations. But the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crisis</span> was 
               <br />
               great, the danger was imminent, and the gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen who now form the present Adminis- 
               <br />
               tration found it to be their duty to lay aside all 
               <br />
               personal feelings, to sacriﬁce in some degree 
               <br />
               their position, and even to run the risk of 
               <br />
               having their motives impugned, for the sake. 
               <br />
               of arriving at some conclusion that would be 
               <br />
               satisfactory to the country in general. The 
               <br />
               present resolutions were the result. And, as 
               <br />
               I said before, I am proud to believe that the 
               <br />
               country has sanctioned, as I trust that the re- 
               <br />
               presentatives of the people in this House will 
               <br />
               sanction, the scheme which is now submitted 
               <br />
               for the future government of British North 
               <br />
               America. (Cheers.) Everything seemed to 
               <br />
               favor the project, and everything seemed to 
               <br />
               shew that the present was the time, if ever, 
               <br />
               when this great union between all Her Maj es- 
               <br />
