               distant, when this common fealty will be found 
               <br />
               ofas little use in our case as it wasin theirs;

               <br />
               itself on the Empire and on us between entire

               separation on the one hand, and a legislative 
               <br />
               union on the other. But a legislative union of 
               <br />
               British America with the Uniœd Kingdom 
               <br />
               must be, in the opinion of, one may say, every- 
               <br />
               bod at home and here, a sheer utter impos- 
               <br />
               sib' 't ; and when the question shall come to 
               <br />
               be whether we are so to be merged in the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom or are to separate entirely 
               <br />
               from it, the answer can only be—“At what- 
               <br />
               ever cost, we separate.” Sir, I believe in my 
               <br />
               conscience that this step now proposed is one 
               <br />
               directly and inevitably tending to that other 
               <br />
               step; and for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that‘reason—even</span> if I believed, 
               <br />
               as I do not, that it bid fair to answer ever so 
               <br />
               well in the other respects—because I am an 
               <br />
               Englishman and hold to the connection with 
               <br />
               England, I must be against this scheme. Sup- 
               <br />
               pose now, on the other hand, this scheme 
               <br />
               were not to go into operation, there would be 
               <br />
               no earthly diﬂieulty in working out, with this 
               <br />
               Canada of ours, the other plan I have been 
               <br />
               suggesting for the placing of our relations 
               <br />
               with the Empire on a better footing. Nor 
               <br />
               would there probably be any material diﬁiculty 
               <br />
               either in bringing about a legislative union of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces, or in developing a 
               <br />
               very near approach to free trade, or indeed 
               <br />
               absolute free trade between us and them. I 
               <br />
               know there are those who say that this mock 
               <br />
               Federal union is necessary in order to our 
               <br />
               getting that free trade with those provinces. 
               <br />
               Well, sir, as to that, all I care to say is this, 
               <br />
               that for a number of years past we have had 
               <br />
               a near approach to free trade with the United 
               <br />
               States—a foreign country ; and I imagine we 
               <br />
               can have it with the Lower Provinces as well, 
               <br />
               without any very great difﬁculty. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear. I say again, we had far better hold 
               <br />
               ﬁrmly to the policy of thus maintaining and 
               <br />
               strengthening our union with the parent state, 
               <br />
               than let ourselves, under whatever pretext, be 
               <br />
               drawn into this other course, which must in- 
               <br />
               evitably lead to our separation from the Em- 
               <br />
               pire. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               there is still another point of view in which 
               <br />
               this scheme uires to be considered. The 
               <br />
               people of the United States, whm they framed 
               <br />
               their institutions, were not only starting as a 
               <br />
               nation—they were so starting with no dan- 
               <br />
               gerous neighbor-nation near them. If we are 
               <br />

               to take the step now urged upon us, not only

               It is quite right that the General Govern-

               ment should have such powers; but the very

               this kind, is an unpleasant recognition of

               other, we are as conﬁdently assured of our own

               wonderquy great and wo nderfully rich, that 
               <br />
               we are something like—I don’t know whether 
               <br />
               we are not—the third or fourth power, or 
               <br />
               maritime power, one or other, in the world. 
               <br />
               Really, I would not undertake to say how 
               <br />
               great we are, or are not, according to honor- 
               <br />
               able gentlemen. They startle one. I had 
               <br />
               no idea how great we were! (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But yet, with all this wonderful magniﬁcence 
               <br />
               and greatness, we are told we positively must 
               <br />
               not, for very fear of the United States—for 
               <br />
               fear of their power—for fear of their hos- 
               <br />
               tility, we must not any longer stay disunited, 
               <br />
               but must instantly enter into this so-ealled 
               <br />
               union. Just as if either their power or their 
               <br />
               hostility towards us—taking that to be their 
               <br />
               feeling—would be lessened by our doing so. 
               <br />
               Just as if they would not be only the more 
               <br />
               jealous of us and hostile to us, for our setting ‘ 
               <br />
               ourselves up ostentatiously as their rivals. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) In this connection, it does 
               <br />
               seem to me that we have more than one 
               <br />
               question to answer. Many honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men appear to think they have done all that 
               <br />
               need be done, when they have answered to 
               <br />
               their own satisfaction the one question, 
               <br />
               What is the amount of our resources ? 
               <br />
               Starting with the vastness of our territory, 
               <br />
               they go into all kinds of statements as to 
               <br />
               our trade and so forth, multiplying ten- 
               <br />

               <br />
               im rte—those of the Intercolonial trade 
               <br />
               an all. I only wonder they do not, on the 
               <br />
