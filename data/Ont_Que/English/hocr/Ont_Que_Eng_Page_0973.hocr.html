               hon. gentlemen sitting tamely and silently

               <br />
               against their former allies, and we have no

               indication from them that they are not the

               of speaking more at length on the scheme, 
               <br />

               ln the Eastern Townships, both among the

               French and English, the general Opinion 
               <br />
               is strongly against this scheme. I have had 
               <br />
               such opportunities of learning the views and

               I have had an excellent opportunity of
