               The great diﬂiculty under which we labor, 
               <br />
               and which we seek to overcome, is a political 
               <br />
               and not a social one. It has its root in the 
               <br />
               Constitution imposed upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proving</span> in 
               <br />
               1841 by the Imperial Government and 
               <br />
               Legislature. That Constitution was founded 
               <br />
               on injustice to Lower Canada, and its fruit, 
               <br />
               as was then foreseen, has produced the 
               <br />
               grossest injustice to Upper Canada. Had the

               <br />
               separated Upper from Lower Canada been 
               <br />
               obliterated, except for judicial purposes, 
               <br />
               we should now be working harmoniously 
               <br />
               together, instead of seeking organic changes 
               <br />
               in the Constitution, in order to preserve 
               <br />
               ourselves from revolution and anarchy.

               <br />
               agot (Hon. Mr. LAFRAMBOISE), in his 
               <br />
               speech, quoted largely from the report of 
               <br />
               Lord DURHAM, to show that that distin-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁished</span> nobleman was prejudiced against 
               <br />
               wer Canadians, and was indisposed to do 
               <br />
               them justice. By selecting here and there 
               <br />
               passages from that able document, the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman gave a colorable appearance to 
               <br />
               his accusation, but nothing more. I deem 
               <br />
               it an act of justice to Lord DURHAM to 
               <br />
               supplement the extracts read by the hon. 
               <br />
               member, by further extracts which will shew 
               <br />
               that His Lordship was governed by exact and
