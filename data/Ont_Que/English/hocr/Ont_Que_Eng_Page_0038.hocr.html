               shall be ad'ourned till such further day as the 
               <br />
               House s think fit to appoint; and then it 
               <br />
               shall be referred to a Committee of the whole 
               <br />
               House before any Resolution or Vote of the 
               <br />
               House do puss thereupon,” which seems to be 
               <br />
               based thereon, refer to Resolutions or to an 
               <br />
               Address upon which some future action of this 
               <br />
               House is to be based. I fail to see in this motion 
               <br />
               that the action of this House is to be involved 
               <br />
               any further after passing this Resolution. As 
               <br />
               this matter was discussed before I left the chair, 
               <br />
               at six o’clock, I took occasion to ut in wri ' 
               <br />
               my opinion uponthesubject. Iwil read: “ The 
               <br />
               motion is foran Address to Her Majesty, in which 
               <br />
