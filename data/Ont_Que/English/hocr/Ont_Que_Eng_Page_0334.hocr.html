               by the Crown. e told us that to restore 
               <br />
               the credit of the Legislative Council it had 
               <br />
               been found necessary to make it elective ; 
               <br />
               but this was not the sole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inducement</span> for the 
               <br />
               change; there was another motive quite as 
               <br />
               reasonable for making the Council elective, 
               <br />
               and this motive was that in causing the 
               <br />
               Councillors to be elected, they would be 
               <br />
               taken from among all parties in the count , 
               <br />
               and would, therefore, represent the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public'</span> 
               <br />
               Opinion of the different parties in it. There 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> a time, under the old order of things, 
               <br />
               when the opinions of two or three men 
               <br />
               residing in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thc'cities</span> ot Quebec and Mont- 
               <br />
               real formed the ublic opinion of all Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. This ad a bad cﬁ'ect, for the 
               <br />
               public Opinions of the diﬂ'erent parties in 
               <br />
               the country ought to be represented in this 
               <br />
               House as well as in the other. It was for 
               <br />
               the purpose Of attaining this end that the 
               <br />
               country was broken up into divisions, that 
               <br />
               it was required that the councillors elected 
               <br />
               should be residents in the divisions, or 
               <br />
               should be the owners of real estate within 
               <br />
               their limits of the value of £2,000; but 
               <br />
               under the system of Crown nominations to 
               <br />
               seats in this House, the choice might fall, 
               <br />
               as it formerly did, on persons residingin the 
               <br />
               large cities; it would not be diﬁcult for 
               <br />
               them to acquire £1,000 worth of real estate 
               <br />
               in the divisions, and the country would not 
               <br />
               be equally represented in this House. An- 
               <br />
               other reason why the elective <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘system</span> is 
               <br />
               preferable to that of nominations by the 
               <br />
               Crown, is that on every fresh election the 
               <br />
