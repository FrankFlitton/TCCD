               the Opposition have declared that changes 
               <br />
               are indispens..ble and necessary. The hon.

               <br />
               When I was asupporter of the MACDONALD-

               DORION Administration, I understood that 
               <br />
               the members of that Government were of 
               <br />
               Opinion that changes were necessary, and that 
               <br />
               we could not very long remain in our present 
               <br />
               position. The hon. member for Hochelaga 
               <br />
               has admitted that the opinion of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada must be respected, and that to it 
               <br />
               would have to be granted representation 
               <br />
               based on pepulation; and the inﬂuence of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada made itself felt by the MAC-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DONALD-UORION</span> Administration; it made 
               <br />
               itself felt especially when, just before the 
               <br />
               last general elections, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">became</span> necessary 
               <br />
               to oust the Honorable Mr. SICOTTE from the 
               <br />
               Ministry to satisfy Upper Canada. By 
               <br />
               means of Mr. SICOTTE, elections had been

               ALD Administration, to which I was Opposed,

               between the parties, and because I consid-

               <br />
               stood in need of me, I supported them in

               <br />

               change my party then, but matters and cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances having changed, I consulted my 
               <br />
               friends in the county which I represent, 
               <br />

               <br />
               whom I consider able to protect and preserve

               cur institutions and the interests of the 
               <br />

               the reasons which have decided me to go

               with them; and as I ﬁnd that it is always

               they will be turned against you ;” and this 
               <br />
               year he says that one Lower Canadian can
