               HON. MR. FERRIER—I am giving my 
               <br />
               opinion—nothing more. But my honorable 
               <br />
               friend proceeded to refer to the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               Railway—(hear, hear)—that monster corpor- 
               <br />
               ation which, one would have inferred from 
               <br />
               111 honorable friend’s remarks, had really 
               <br />
               laid desolate every district of Canada through 
               <br />
               which it had passed. For my own part I 
               <br />
               cannot understand what damage the Grand 
               <br />
               Trunk Railway has done to Canada. We 
               <br />
               have had thirteen millions sterling of English 
               <br />
               capital—(hear, hear. -—expcnded in building 
               <br />
               the Grand Trunk ailway and the Victoria 
               <br />
               Bridge, which is the greatest work in the 
               <br />
               world. Canada has paid somewhere about 
               <br />
               three millions to complete the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               --about one-ﬁfth part of the sixteen millions 
               <br />
               that have been spent, and it is the cheapest 
               <br />
               bargain she ever made. (Hear, hear.) We 
               <br />
               have the beneﬁt of the whole of this expen- 
               <br />
               diture. If there has been extravagance in it, 
               <br />
               those English stockholders have been the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁ‘erers.</span> We can only have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffered</span> a ﬁfth 
               <br />
               part of what they have done, and we have 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of the whole of it. That I think 
               <br />
               is the view we ought to take of the Grand 
               <br />
               Trunk Railway in connection with Canada. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Then the Intercolonial Rail— 
               <br />
               way has been referred to. That road has 
               <br />
               become, I think, even at present a necessity. 
               <br />
               It should have been made some years ago, 
               <br />
               and it would have been made but for the 
               <br />
               political incapacity of the Government of that 
               <br />
               day, which prevented it. (Hear, hear.)

               honorable friend that two members of that

               HON. MR. FERRIER—It is fortunate 
               <br />
               that some men see the error of their ways, 
               <br />
               and do better, and I trust it has been so in 
               <br />
               the present case. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) 
               <br />
               If we had had this road to the sea-board at 
               <br />
               the present time, it is very likely the Recipro- 
               <br />
               city Treaty would not have been repealed. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We want the road at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent moment for the business of the country. 
               <br />
               Some honorable gentlemen say that, if the 
               <br />
               road were made to—day, we would have nothing 
               <br />
               to send over it. The fact is, these honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, when they make such a statement, 
               <br />
               shew that they have not taken the trouble to 
               <br />
               enquire what the position of the trade of the 
               <br />
               country is. For the last ten days we have 
               <br />
               had about 100 cars standing loaded at Point St. 
               <br />
               Charles, and no way of getting them oﬁ‘. These

               One portion of it is for the supply of New

               HON. MR. FERRIER—We have also a 
               <br />
               large accumulation of cars standing full of pro- 
               <br />
               duce at Portland, and no ships to take it away. 
               <br />
               Such is the present state of the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               Railway, and it is a very awkward position to 
               <br />
               be laced in. As the gallant Knight (Hon. Sir 
               <br />
               E <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I).</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TACHE)</span> told us the other day, it is just as 
               <br />
               if a neighbor’s farm stood between us and the 
               <br />
               highway. That is the position of the United 
               <br />
               States, they stand between Canada and the 
               <br />
               sea board, and they have now been pleased to 
               <br />
               say, “we will not allow you to pass through 
               <br />
               our farm ”—-because, although the Reciprocity 
               <br />
               Treaty is not yet repealed, 'they have put a 
               <br />
               check on intercourse by this passport system, 
               <br />
               and by the way in which they work the 
               <br />
               present law with reference to the produce we 
               <br />
               are taking along. For instance, if pork is sent 
               <br />
               on, an aﬂidavit must be put in that that pork 
               <br />
               is the produce of Canada. Now, it is a diﬁi- 
               <br />
               cult thing to make such an afﬁdavit. At this 
               <br />
               season of the year loads of pork come from all 
               <br />
               quarters, and after it is all packed into a 
               <br />
               barrel, it is almost impossible for any man to 
               <br />
               make an afﬁdavit where it was raised. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It is the same with ﬂour. A miller 
               <br />
               frequently mixes ﬂour brought in from the 
               <br />
               United States, and how is an aﬂidavit to be 
               <br />
               made whether that ﬂour is mixed or not ‘? 
               <br />
               There may be four-ﬁfths of it the produce of 
               <br />
               Canada, and yet the other ﬁfth prevents it 
               <br />
               from going. Hence, the trade is so hampered 
               <br />
               by all these obstructions put in the way by the 
               <br />
               United States Government, that it is very 
               <br />
               seriously interfered with. And, that being 
               <br />
               the position of our trade, I beg to ask whether
