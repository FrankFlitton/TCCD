               Mn. CAMERON, continuing his remarks, 
               <br />
               said—When the House rose at six o’clock, 
               <br />
               I had remarked upon the singular effect the 
               <br />
               breath of the Hon. President of the Council 
               <br />
               had upon many hon. members of this House; 
               <br />
               and in connection with this matter, I would 
               <br />
               like now to observe that there seems to be a 
               <br />
               practice growing into favor, which, accord- 
               <br />
               ing to my judgment, is deserving of every 
               <br />
               candemnation. It is for hon. members of 
               <br />
               the Government to address themselves priv— 
               <br />
               ately to particular members, and give them 
               <br />
               reasons for their action, which reasons are 
               <br />
               not made known generally to the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House Now, I understand 
               <br />
               that every honorable tnember on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House represents a portion of 
               <br />
               the people of the country, and the por- 
               <br />
               tion of the people which one represents 
               <br />
               is as much entitled to consideration and to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span> in possession of the Government 
               <br />
               as the rest of the peOple or the constituencies 
               <br />
               of every other hon. member of the House. 
               <br />
               If the Government gives to some that infor- 
               <br />
               mation which in certain cases it has not 
               <br />
               communicated to those hostile to certain 
               <br />
               measures, it places those hon. members in a 
               <br />
               false position, makes them act contrary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“to</span> 
               <br />
               what they would, perhaps, if all the facts 
               <br />
               were in their possession, and is a proceeding 
               <br />
               that is opposed to the best interests of the 
               <br />
               country. (Hear, hear.) It reasons were 
               <br />
               privately given by a Minister to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me</span> which 
               <br />
               he withheld from other hon. members of

               ing to deceive me; for, according to his

               secrets of the Cabinet, and if he betrayed 
               <br />
               them to me, I would conclude that he had 
               <br />
               some sinister end in view, and was endeavor-

               ing to make we proceed in a course contrary

               to that which would be dictated by my 
               <br />
               honest convictions. (Hear, hear.) Now, in 
               <br />
               reference to the Hon. the President of the 
               <br />

               a truce and buried the party hatchet, brushed

               peace with his political enemies—(laughter) 
               <br />
               —we would have no more misrepresenta- 
               <br />
               tions going to the country through the me- 
               <br />
               dium of the newspaper organ which he 
               <br />
               wields. I did not expect, therefore, to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that that organ would have devoted a whole 
               <br />
               column to a humble individual like myself, 
               <br />
               who happens to express views contrary to 
               <br />
               those now held by that hon. gentleman. 
               <br />
               That paper, in referring to the recent debate 
               <br />
               in this House on the Confederation resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, makes an attack on me, by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represent</span> 
               <br />
               ing that I have betrayed my constituents by 
               <br />
               acting, as it says, contrary to the pledges 
               <br />
               I gave them previous to my election. Now, 
               <br />
               I presume my constituents know what 
               <br />
               pledges I did make to them, and it is not 
               <br />
               necessary that any communications should 
               <br />
               be made through the channels of the Globe 
               <br />
               to let them know that I have betrayed 
               <br />
               those pledges, for they are as well able to 
               <br />
               judge as that paper whetherl violated my 
               <br />
               promises or not. If any argument I used 
               <br />
               to justify the position I took in regard to 
               <br />
               that question was bad, it might have been 
               <br />
               pointed out ; but it was quite unnecessary 
               <br />
               to tell them that I had broken my pledges, 
               <br />
               when they were as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">competent</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judge</span> upon 
               <br />
               that point as any one else. Yet that is 
               <br />
               what the organ of the hon. gentleman is 
               <br />
               doing, showing that the old party leaven 
               <br />
               leavens the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> still, and that 
               <br />
               all the elements of party discord and strife 
               <br />
               are justas rampant now in this House as 
               <br />
               they were before the present Coalition was 
               <br />
               formed. (Hear.) Now, the Hon. Attorney 
               <br />
               General West, in that amusing and interest- 
               <br />
               ing scene he had with the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Carleton the other day, made a declaration 
               <br />
               which, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">according</span> to my sense of political 
               <br />
               morality, is not exactly one that should 
               <br />
               have been made by a Minister of the Crown 
               <br />
               holding the position of the hon. gentleman. 
               <br />
               He declared that it was the bounden duty 
               <br />
               of the members of his party to follow their 
               <br />
               leader in all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things-not</span> exercising their 
               <br />
               own judgment in reference to any matter 
               <br />
               that may come before the House, but sub-
