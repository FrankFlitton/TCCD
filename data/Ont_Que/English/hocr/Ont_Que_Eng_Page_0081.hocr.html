               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">combined</span> to resist Confederation, because each

               party argued it would produce the most widely

               different results—we might look upon this 
               <br />
               fact, he repeated, as one of the strongest argu- 
               <br />
               ments in favor of Confederation. (Hear.) 
               <br />
               We had, on the other hand, all the moderate 
               <br />
               men, all that was respectable and intelligent, 
               <br />
               including the clergy, favorable to Federation. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear, and oh, oh.) He did not, of 
               <br />
               course, mean to say that there were not re- 
               <br />
               spectable opponents to the project—what he 
               <br />
               did mean, however, was that it met general 
               <br />
               approval from the classes referred to. He 
               <br />
               was opposed, he might as well state most 
               <br />
               distinctly, to the democratic system which 
               <br />
               obtained in the United States. In this coun-

               try of British North America we should have 
               <br />
               a distinct form of overnment, the character- 
               <br />
               istic of which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be to possess the monar- 
               <br />
               chical element. When we had Confederation 
               <br />
               secured, there was not the least doubt but 
               <br />
               that our Government would be more respect- 
               <br />
               able—that it would have more prestige, and 
               <br />
               command more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> from our neighbours. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The great want under the 
               <br />
               American form—the point which they all 
               <br />
               admitted formed the great defect—was the 
               <br />
               absence of some respectable executive element.

               How was the head of the United States Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment chosen ? Candidates came forward, 
               <br />
               and of course each one was abused and villiﬁed 
               <br />
