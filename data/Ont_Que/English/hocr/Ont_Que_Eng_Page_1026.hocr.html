               having appealed against the decision of the

               Chair, because he must have known that the 
               <br />
               authorities were against him. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The honorable gentleman is no doubt pos—

               <br />
               ﬁnally carried in some shape or other, with 
               <br />

               demand to have the seigniors deprived of 
               <br />

               tion also? Did he not oppose the introduc- 
               <br />
               tion of the elective principle into the 
               <br />
