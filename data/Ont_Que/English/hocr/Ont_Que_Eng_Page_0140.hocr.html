               <br />
               conceded and consummated. When the sub- 
               <br />
               ject was under discussion, objections were 
               <br />

               <br />
               would thus arise between the two branches,

               and the Constitution had worked as 
               <br />

               <br />
               element was made gradually with the view of 
               <br />
               anticipating such a result, and the effect was 
               <br />
               attained, for there had been no clashing of 
               <br />
               interests. The elective principle had been

               the Conference had any warrant'from the 
               <br />
               country to justify their action ? They had 
               <br />
               none whatever. If they had not acted under 
               <br />
               the dictation of Prince Edward Island, they 
               <br />
               had acted on their own motion, and without 
               <br />
               authority of any kind. The conclusion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tgas</span> 
               <br />
               legitimate and l 'cal. The position e

               Coming to the proposal to amend the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, he would say there existed no reason 
               <br />
               why the House, if it thought roper, could 
               <br />
               not chan e them in any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular.</span> He wil- 
               <br />
               lingly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afmitted</span> that they were in the nature

               of a treaty, and we must accept them, if ac- 
               <br />
               cepted at all, so that their essential character 
               <br />
               should not be impaired; but when they were 
               <br />
               presented to us, we were bound to decide 
               <br />
               whether they were what we wanted or not. 
               <br />
               If they were so in the main, there was no 
               <br />
               necessity for taking exceptions which would 
               <br />
               affect our relations with the other provinces, 
               <br />
               but they might be modiﬁed and changed in 
               <br />
               so far as Canada was concerned, and the other 
               <br />
               rovinces would have no cause of complaint. 
               <br />
               hat interest had they in the manner of our 
               <br />
               choosing our own representatives ? All they 
               <br />
               had a right to say in the matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wasﬂthat</span> we 
               <br />
               should not have more than two-thirds of the 
               <br />
               whole number. There was a way of putting 
               <br />
               things so as to frighten and convince waver- 
               <br />
               ing minds; but he would ask the House to 
               <br />
               sift this matter to the bottom—to look at the 
               <br />
               reason of things—and to say if his amend- 
               <br />
               ment 'were adopted, which maintained intact 
               <br />
               the principle of representation laid down in
