               amidst which the veil of party is easily seen 
               <br />
               thrOugh. According to their views, no good

               can come out of the system for either party in 
               <br />
               the commonwealth. “ Think twice of what 
               <br />
               you are doing, you English Protestants of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada ! The Local Government will 
               <br />
               swallow you up,” cries the Montreal Witness. 
               <br />
               “Take care of yourselves, you French-Cana- 
               <br />
               dian's of the Catholic Church !” bellows the 
               <br />
               Montreal True Witness ; “ if the plan of Con- 
               <br />
               federation is sanctioned by the Legislature, 
               <br />
               you will disappear like a dream : the hydra 
               <br />
               of the Central Government will poison you 
               <br />
               with its pestiferous breath.” (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               And the other jcurnals of the same party, 
               <br />
               inspired by the same spirit, open full cry on 
               <br />
               the plan of Confederation, as nothing less 
               <br />
               than‘a “ political suicide !” Others there 
               <br />
               are—and some in the interest of the present 
               <br />
               Gevernment—who have some misgivings,
