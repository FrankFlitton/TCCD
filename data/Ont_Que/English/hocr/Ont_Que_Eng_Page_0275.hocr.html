               HON. Mn. DORION—I now come to an- 
               <br />
               other point. It is said that this Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion is necessary for the purpose of providing 
               <br />
               a better mode of defence for this country. 
               <br />
               There may be people who think that by add- 
               <br />
               ing two and two together you make ﬁve. I 
               <br />
               am not of that o inion. I cannot see how by 
               <br />
               adding the 700, 00 or 800,000 people, the 
               <br />
               inhabitants of the Lower Provinces, to 
               <br />
               the 2,500,000 inhabitants of Canada, you 
               <br />
               can multiply them so as to make a much 
               <br />
               larger force to defend the country than you 
               <br />
               have at resent. Of course the connection 
               <br />
               with the ritish Empire is the link of com— 
               <br />
               munioation by which the whole force of the 
               <br />
               Empire can be brought together for defence. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) But the position of this coun- 
               <br />
               try under the proposed scheme is very evident. 
               <br />
               You add to the frontier four or ﬁve hundred 
               <br />
               more miles than you now have, and an extent 
               <br />
               of coun immeasurably greater in pro- 
               <br />
               portion than the additional population you 
               <br />
               have gained; and if there is an advantage at 
               <br />
               all for the defence of the country, it will 
               <br />
               be on the part of the Lower Provinces and 
               <br />
               not for us. And as we ﬁnd that we are 
               <br />
               about to enter into a very large expendi- 
               <br />
               ture for this purpose of defence—this having 
               <br />
               been formally announced in a speech deliv-

               <br />
               ronto—and as Canada is to contribute to 
               <br />
               that expenditure to the extent of ten-twelfths 
               <br />
               of the whole, the other provinces paying only

               I cannot conclude without referring to some 
               <br />
               other things which have received the grave atten-

               which I desire to call attention is the t that 
               <br />
               the delegates have unanimously resolved that the

               HON. MR. ORION—It appears then that 
               <br />
               our course is to put “ the mihtary and naval 
               <br />

               ing to these resolutions, the General Govem— 
               <br />
               ment is to have control of “ the military and

               <br />
               them is not stated. - This I contend, then, 
               <br />
               that if the military and naval defences of all 
               <br />

               crease the militia for this purpose, the Lower

               <br />
               have to pay ﬁve times as much as we are now

               <br />
               750,000 on the other, compact and powerful. 
               <br />
               These 250,000 Canada will have to defend, 
               <br />
               and it will have to pledge its resources for the
