               mand anything at which their Catholic con-

               sciences might take alarm, their consciences 
               <br />
               were soon quieted by the fact that “ it was 
               <br />
               a friend,” and the Orangeman obtained at 
               <br />
               once what he sought; and the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Montmorency declared that all this had 
               <br />
               been done by a power which had soiled and 
               <br />
               corrupted everything in the order of morality 
               <br />
               and political integrity. Now, he heartily 
               <br />
               approves of all that he then held to be abomin- 
               <br />
               able and atrocious, so long as it was pro- 
               <br />
               posed by his friends. Then he was opposed 
               <br />
               to Confederation of any kind, because it was 
               <br />
               a certain means of obliterating the inﬂuence 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada, and he preferred a legis- 
               <br />
               lative union to a Confederation. But now 
               <br />
               his friends propose a Confederation of all 
               <br />
               the provinces, and he heartily approves of 
               <br />
               it. I quote again from what he said on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ask a vote on his informal resolutions. But 
               <br />
               hardly had he obtained power and his views 
               <br />

               the hon. member for Montmorency warmly 
               <br />
               approves. It seems, when the other day I

               asserted that this scheme ot Confederation 
               <br />
               was planned by the Grand Trunk Company, 
               <br />
               that I did but express the opinion of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Montmorency. [t was he 
               <br />
               who ﬁrst made this assertion, and not I. 
               <br />
               “If the Grand Trunk,” said he, “ wants 
               <br />
               Confederation, we are sure to have it.” In 
               <br />
               those days his friends the enemies desired to 
               <br />
               sell the country; now he seeks to save it by 
               <br />
               exactlythe same means that they took to 
               <br />
               ruin it. Now he no longer seeks to ascer- 
               <br />
               tain whether the plan of Confederation is 
               <br />
               good or bad; he only looks to see that it comes 
               <br />
               from his friends,and thatis sufﬁcient to secure 
               <br />
               for it his hearty approval. This scheme be- 
               <br />
               ing preposed by the friends and supporters of 
               <br />
               good principles, it cannot contain anything

               that may endanger the institutions of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) But 
               <br />
               formerly it was quite a different matter, when 
               <br />
               the same scheme was proposed by enemies, the 
               <br />
               present friends of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency. What constitutes the excel- 
               <br />
               lence of this scheme in the eyes of the honor- 
               <br />
               able member, is that it is not submitted by 
               <br />
               rouges or annexationists, but by the represen— 
               <br />
               tatives of good principles, the guardians of 
               <br />
               the interests of Lower Canada. (Hear, hear, 
               <br />
               and laughter.) Besides, the delegates from the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces, whom he had looked upon as 
               <br />
               enemies to Lower Canada, inspired him with 
               <br />
               such conﬁdence during the dinners and balls of 
               <br />
               the Conference, as to have removed any appre-

               hensions under which the honorable member

               himself. For my part I do not believe that
