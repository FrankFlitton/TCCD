               destinies of British America, that even the 
               <br />

               <br />
               population of from eight to ten millions. I 
               <br />
               must confess, Mr. SPEAKER, that I cannot 
               <br />
               understand how any hon. gentleman can 
               <br />
               stand up here, and labor to perpetuate our pre- 
               <br />
               sent insigniﬁcance, by interposing obstacles 
               <br />
               to the carrying out of the only really great 
               <br />
               or statesmanlike idea which has ever been 
               <br />
               brought under the consideration of a Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Parliament. And now, sir, though I have 
               <br />
               already trespassed too long upon the patience 
               <br />
               of hen. members, I must crave their indul- 
               <br />
               gence a moment longer, while touching 
               <br />
               brieﬂy upon the subject of defence. Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, without discussing the question 
               <br />
               of how much or how little we ought to con— 
               <br />
               tribute towards the defence of the Empire, 
               <br />
               in a war with any other nation than the 
               <br />
               United States, I assume that every true 
               <br />
               Canadian, whether of French or British 
               <br />
               origin, will be prepared to resist the invasion 
               <br />
               of his native soil; and if I am right in this, 
               <br />
               I take it, all we have to do is to inform the 
               <br />
               home Government that we are determined 
               <br />
               —not to contribute so much in men, and so 
               <br />
               much in money, to the defence of Canada, 
               <br />
               but that we are resolved—that every man 
               <br />
               and every farthing we can control shall be 
               <br />
               sacriﬁced before we submit to the power of 
               <br />
               our republican neighbors, and that all we 
               <br />
               ask of England is to pursue a course becom- 
               <br />
               ing the glory of her ancient renown. That 
               <br />
               she will do this, sir, we have no reason to 
               <br />
               doubt; but I regret to observe that Colonel 
               <br />
               JERVOIB, in his report upon the subject of 
               <br />
               fortiﬁcations, seems altogether to have ig- 
               <br />
               nored the Western Peninsula, for he makes 
               <br />
               no mention of any point west of Hamilton 
               <br />
               as capable of being fortiﬁed, from which I 
               <br />
               infer he must have come to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that in the event of war with the United 
               <br />
               States, it would be impossible for us to 
               <br />
               hold the country above the head of Lake 
               <br />
               Ontario. Sir, this may be the opinion 
               <br />
               of that gallant ofﬁcer, and it may be cor- 
               <br />
               rect; but, as the representative of the 
               <br />
               most exposed portion of the western 
               <br />
               frontier, I am bound at least to say that 
               <br />
               the peeple of that part of the country 
               <br />
               would be most unwilling to admit that 
               <br />
               they are less able now to hold their own 
               <br />
               than their fathers were in 1812. Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, our chief danger lies in the pos- 
               <br />
               sibility of a reunion with the North and 
               <br />

               an event which could excite no surprise in

               ﬁcations and defence, no force we can bring 
               <br />

               <br />
               build, nor, indeed, any course that could be 
               <br />
               adopted, would so effectually protect us, 
               <br />
               so absolutely guarantee the inviolability of 
               <br />

               tain; and when the proposed deputation 
               <br />
               from this Government reaches England, I 
               <br />
               trust they will feel it to be their duty 
               <br />
               strongly to urge the consideration of this

               fact upon Her Majesty’s Government; for 
               <br />

               coast, a formidable, warlike and bitterly

               South, and some half million well armed and 
               <br />
               resolute Canadians in their front, depend 
               <br />
               upon it, Mr. SPEAKER, we need be under 
               <br />
               no apprehension of war’s alarms. And new, 
               <br />
               sir, it only remains for me to thank honorable 
               <br />
               members for the patient hearing they have 
               <br />
               accorded me, and to express a hepe that 
               <br />
               the deputation to England will not swerve 
               <br />
               from the course they have informed us they 
               <br />
               intended to pursue, in consequence of any- 
               <br />
               thing that has transpired in any of the other 
               <br />
               provinces, but that they will impress upon 
               <br />
               the home Government the fact that four- 
               <br />
               ﬁfths of the people of British America are 
               <br />

               <br />
               in a constitutional manner, to induce the

               people of the Lower Provinces to reconsider 
               <br />
               their recent course, and to acquiesce in the 
               <br />
               project agreed upon by the Quebec Confer- 
               <br />

               <br />
               which a balance of power may be established

               <br />
