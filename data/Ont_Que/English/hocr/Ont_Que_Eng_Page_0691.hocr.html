               olamour for adissolution, merely for the sake 
               <br />
               of ascertaining the mind of the people upon 
               <br />
               the measure, and who do not take to the 
               <br />
               untenable ground of denying the right of 
               <br />
               this Parliament to legislate on the subject, 
               <br />
               that if they did not consult their constituents 
               <br />
               with a View to obtaining an expression of 
               <br />
               ublic opinion, they ought to have done so. 
               <br />
               They had the scheme before them in all its 
               <br />
               details for months, and I think they ought to 
               <br />
               be in a' position, when they came here, to 
               <br />
               know whether their constituents were in 
               <br />
               favor of the scheme or against it. In the 
               <br />
               meetings which were held in my county, I 
               <br />
               met with only two individuals who were 
               <br />
               prepared to go the length of denouncing the 
               <br />
               scheme in toto, although many would prefer 
               <br />
               to see it, in some respects, diﬂ'erent from 
               <br />
               what it is. So well disposed did the peOple 
               <br />
               show themselves to be towards the union 
               <br />
               scheme, that in the town of Woodstock, 
               <br />
               where a very large and inﬂuential meeting 
               <br />
               was held, the editor of a newspaper that 
               <br />
               had been, up to that night, urging the 
               <br />
               necessity for a dissolution of Parliament 
               <br />
               before the adaption of the scheme, was the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to rise to move a resolution approving 
               <br />
               of the scheme in all its features, and neither 
               <br />
               in his speech nor in his resolution did he 
               <br />
               even hint at an appeal to the people; and 
               <br />
               that meeting voted for the scheme without 
               <br />
               a single dissentient voice. (Hear. hear.)

               am quite satisﬁed, Mr. SPEAKER, that the

               scheme. I will now, sir, state brieﬂy what 
               <br />
               I think of the general features or underly-

               <br />

               <br />
               own premises, he succeeded in proving to a

               denounced this scheme because it is so very

               sir, I accept of it because of its British 
               <br />
               and monarchical features,—I accept of it 
               <br />
               because of its monarchical character. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I look upon it as a scheme more 
               <br />
               national than federal in its character—as 
               <br />
               looking more to a national union of the 
               <br />

               chieﬂy because of this feature of it that 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               Lower Canada, as otherwise their institutions

               would be endangered ; and yet oddly enough, 
               <br />
               he elaborated an argument to prove the
