               before effecting so radical a change in our

               such serious importance as that which is 
               <br />
               proposed to us. Let us now consider, Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spans,</span> the disastrous consequences of the 
               <br />
               adoption of the scheme of Confedera— 
               <br />
               tion. The members of the Government 
               <br />
               have told us that Confederation would 
               <br />
               constitute us a military power of the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst class. and would enable us to resist 
               <br />
               the aggressions of the American Union. 
               <br />
               The defence of our frontier is certainly a 
               <br />
               question of the highest importance, for no 
               <br />
               one is unaware that our relations with our 
               <br />
               neighbors are in a position of extreme ten- 
               <br />
               sion. They have established a passport 
               <br />
               system, the sole object of which is to hamper 
               <br />
               our trade. A resolution has been adopted 
               <br />
               by Congress, almost unanimously, for the 
               <br />
               repeal of the treaty of reciprocit which 
               <br />
               exists between the two countries. 11 a few 
               <br />
               months the waters of our lakes will be

               <br />
               Such, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> is the position of the 
               <br />
               United States with respect to us, and to meet 
               <br />
               this danger the Government proposes to form 
               <br />
               a Confederation which will, they tell us, 
               <br />
               constitute a ﬁrst class power, able to 
               <br />
               maintain on this continent the supremacy of 
               <br />
               Great Britain. But will the object proposed 
               <br />

               <br />

               of all those provinces under his immediate 
               <br />
               command? We are told, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               that Confederation will give us a more uni- 
               <br />

               <br />

               under the present Constitution, and I have

               The plan of the present Government is,

               therefore, to establish here a political system
