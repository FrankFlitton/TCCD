               ernment that we are entitled to. Let us all 
               <br />
               recollect that France commenced her Canadian 
               <br />

               <br />
               by rotation to the present Maritime Provinces, 
               <br />
               and also to Louisiana. Those companies were

               in rank to a lieutenant-colonel in the army. 
               <br />
               Those companies were in the habit of being 
               <br />
               trained for navy purposes. I entertain no 
               <br />
               doubt that the frequent intercourse with those 
               <br />

               I understand, has the intention of establishing

               civilian administrators, had deserved such a
