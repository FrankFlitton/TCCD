               MB. SCATCHERD—Well, we have always 
               <br />
               contended that we were willing to collect the 
               <br />
               moneys required for our own local p in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, and that Lower Canada should 
               <br />
               do the same. We are entitled, according to 
               <br />
               . that principle, to $286,000 more than we 
               <br />
               shall receive; and the proposed arrangement, 
               <br />
               therefore, I say is unjust; otherwise we have 
               <br />
               been contending for what was incorrect for 
               <br />
               the last ten years. It should have been made 
               <br />
               part of the scheme, that whatever Upper 
               <br />
               ' Canada required for her local expenditure 
               <br />
               should be obtained by taxes levied on her 
               <br />
               people, and that whatever Lower Canada 
               <br />
               required for the like purposes should be levied 
               <br />
               in the same way. But that is not the scheme, 
               <br />
               so that we gain nothing with regard to our 
               <br />
               paying more than we receive, which has been 
               <br />

               be found, if this scheme goes into Operation, 
               <br />
               that the burdens on the people of Upper

               <br />
               ation, the position of Upper Canada will be 
               <br />
               no better than it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> before. I give this as 
               <br />
               a glaring instance—there are others which 
               <br />
               cannot so readily be detected—of the way in 
               <br />
               which the just claims and interests of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada have been overlooked. I do not see 
               <br />
               hLW honorable gentlemen will be able to an- 
               <br />
               swer the charges brought against them by 
               <br />
               their constituents, that they have deliberatel 
               <br />
               agreed, that for all time to come there sh 
               <br />
               be that advantage of one section over the 
               <br />
               other. If Upper Canada is to get no more 
               <br />
               beneﬁt from the Confederation than I can 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in these resolutions, I am at a loss to see 
               <br />
               how she is beneﬁted by them. The expense 
               <br />
               of an Intercolonial Railway is to be saddled 
               <br />
               on her farmers and her people generally— 
               <br />
               they are to pay the larger portion of that 
               <br />
               expense, and that,so far as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> see, is to 
               <br />
               be the grand effect of this scheme. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Another objection I have to the pro-

               ject relates to the preposition with reference 
               <br />
               to the Constitution of the Legislative Coun- 
               <br />
