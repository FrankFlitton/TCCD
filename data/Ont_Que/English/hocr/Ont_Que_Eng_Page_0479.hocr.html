               different view of the question, when out came 
               <br />
               that remarkable circular from the Provincial 
               <br />

               such a magical effect, that at once the story 
               <br />
               was changed, and the advocacy Was begun of

               disposing of the question without submitting

               it to the peeple, although the people them- 
               <br />
               selves never dreamt that it could be carried 
               <br />
               through this House and become a ﬁxed fact 
               <br />
               until that step was taken. I do not see how

               any man, who does not desire to make him-

               the trust reposed in him, can come here, and

               <br />
               have to pay for all this—who provide the 
               <br />
               revenue for carrying on the affairs of the 
               <br />
               country—are not at liberty to express their

               views on the subject in the legitimate way 
               <br />
               known to the Constitution. It is argued 
               <br />
               that there have been no petitions presented 
               <br />
               against Confederation ; but where, I ask, has 
               <br />
               there been any agitation in reference to the 
               <br />
               question? Where has it been contested at 
               <br />
               the polls? I stand here an elected member, 
               <br />
               who ran against the Provincial Secretary, 
               <br />
               when, as a member of the government 
               <br />
               formed for the purpose of carrying out this 
               <br />
               scheme, he returned to his constituents for 
               <br />
               reelection, and [succeeded in defeating him. 
               <br />
               So far, therefore, as the people of North
