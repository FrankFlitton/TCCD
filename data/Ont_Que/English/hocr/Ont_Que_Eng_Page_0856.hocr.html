               world knows. The whole face of Europe has

               <br />
               and by war, and by negotiation, extending their

               <br />
               they must go onward: for it is the very nature 
               <br />
               of power to grip whatever is within its reach. It 
               <br />
               is not their hostile feelings, therefore, but it is
