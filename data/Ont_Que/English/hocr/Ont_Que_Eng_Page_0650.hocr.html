               ments which are absolutely and altogether 
               <br />
               contradictory. To resume my argument, it 
               <br />
               seems to me that if we evinced a desire to 
               <br />
               remove the existing causes of complaint, 
               <br />
               even the Manchester School, even such men 
               <br />
               as GOLDWIN SMITH, would not be unwilling 
               <br />
               to see the connection between these provinces 
               <br />
               and the Mother Country continue. My 
               <br />
               honorable friend the member for Brome, 
               <br />

               <br />
               burgh Review, but he thought there were 
               <br />
               speeches uttered by certain noblemen and 
               <br />
               gentlemen in their places in the British 
               <br />
               Parliament, from which, looking at them 
               <br />
               through his discolored lens, hc could extract 
               <br />
               sentiments of a similar character. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman would admit nothing whatever in 
               <br />
               favor of this scheme, and seemed determined 
               <br />
               that England, whether she liked it or not, 
               <br />
               should cut the connection. He said the 
               <br />
               Mother Country eulogised the scheme, but— 
               <br />

               the House of Lords, on the 7th of February, 
               <br />
               said, “ He hoped and believed that these 
               <br />
               colonies would still recognize the value of 
               <br />

               without in any way weakening their fealt .

               more clearly express the feelings of the person

               <br />
               connected with him, that “our fealty to

               the British Crown should in no manner

               detected some uncertainty—some “ but.” 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) Lord DERBY was even more
