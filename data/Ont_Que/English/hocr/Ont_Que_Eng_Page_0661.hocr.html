               MR. DENIS—Will the honorable member 
               <br />
               allow me to put to him a question ? Since the 
               <br />
               honorable member has referred to this letter 
               <br />
               from the head of the Church, does he enter- 
               <br />
               tain the opinion that any honorable member 
               <br />
               has a right to come here and criticise in a 
               <br />
               similar way the mode of procedure of Protest- 
               <br />
               ant clergymen? If so, how are we to get 
               <br />
               along at all? The honorable member may 
               <br />
               have his own opinions in regard to this letter, 
               <br />
               but he ought not to state them on the ﬂoor of 
               <br />
               the House, for if he does so any other honor- 
               <br />
               able member has the right to come here and 
               <br />
               critise the conduct of respectable clergymen 
               <br />
               of the Free Church, of the Episcopal Church, 
               <br />
               or of any other Protestant Church, and make 
               <br />
               such comments as he thinks ﬁt. This ought 
               <br />
               not to be. Then, the honorable member said 
               <br />
               the letter ought to be looked upon with sus- 
               <br />
               picion. Well, all I can say is, that if we 0 
               <br />
               into a chapter on suspicions, every man oug t 
               <br />
               to be suspicious. We might bring suspicions 
               <br />
               to bear upon everything, however respectable 
               <br />
               it may be, and in this way it would be im s- 
               <br />
               sible with frankness to deal with anything. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend uses the word “hierarchy.” 
               <br />
               Well, a word even does damage sometimes. 
               <br />
               My honorable friend may have his opinion 
               <br />
               upon these things, and that opinion ought to 
               <br />
               be respected, because I believe it to be an 
               <br />
               honest opinion ; but if he has a right to speak 
               <br />
               of “ Romish” and all that sort of thing in 
               <br />
               connection with our Church, we willhave a 
               <br />
               right to speak in a disrespectful manner of 
               <br />
               ministers of the Free Church, of the High 
               <br />
               Church, of the Low Church, and of all the 
               <br />
               other kinds of churches, and bad feeling will 
               <br />
               be created to no purpose.

               aware of, that there is no analogy whatever—

               orable gentlemen who have spoken against it 
               <br />
               have magniﬁed the dangers of collision, and

               especially has the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Brome done so. I am of Opinion, sir, that if 
               <br />
               the same rigid and hostile analysis were made 
               <br />

               for uniting separate and distinct peoples to- 
               <br />
               gether, it would not be diﬂicult to foresee 
               <br />
               dangers of collision as likely to ﬂow therefrom. 
               <br />
               Were the British Constitution itself subjected 
               <br />
               to the same kind of dissection, ﬂaws and com- 
               <br />
               promises might be detected, and possible dan- 
               <br />
               gers be foretold. In the Constitution pro- 
               <br />
               posed for our adoption, as with all others, the 
               <br />
               successful working of it must mainly depend 
               <br />
               upon the characters and principles of the men 
               <br />
               who have to work it. The honorable member 
               <br />
               for Brome certainly attempted to make the 
               <br />
               worst of these resolutions, and endeavored to 
               <br />
               point out, in almost every feature, defects 
               <br />
               which he thought might endanger the interests 
               <br />
               of the people. He dwelt particularly upon 
               <br />
               the apparent facilities for the development of 
               <br />
               what is called in this country "lo -rolling." 
               <br />
               He said we might ﬁnd the Maritime rovinces 
               <br />
               working with each other, and with Lower 
               <br />
               Canada against Upper Canada, and vice versa. 
               <br />
               Well, it must be obvious, sir, that the honor-

               able gentleman’s objections in this respect 
               <br />
