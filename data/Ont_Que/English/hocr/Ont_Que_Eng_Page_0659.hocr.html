               Protestant minority of Lower Canada have 
               <br />
               always lived in harmony, not only with the

               Catholics, but with the Catholic clergy of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. And I may say also, on 
               <br />
               behalf of the Protestants of Lower Canada— 
               <br />
               the majority of them at all events—that they 
               <br />
               are so convinced that there is true liberality 
               <br />
               in the hierarchy, in the Catholic clergy of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, as well as in the great 
               <br />
               majority of the Roman Catholics of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, that they have no such fears as the

               COL. HAULTAIN—Of course, it must

               be perfectly obvious, that in a matter of this

               <br />
               the Hon. Attorney General ast will have 
               <br />
               very little weight, in comparison with what 
               <br />
               emanates from the head of the Roman 
               <br />

               French-Canadian fellow-subjects of anything 
               <br />
               like intolerance. But what I say is 
               <br />
               this, that there is round for sus ieion 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Roman Catholic hierarchy, when they

               ﬁnd emanating from the head, the very in-

               spiration and fount of that hierarchy, the 
               <br />
               intolerant sentiments I have alluded to. 
               <br />
               Why do I mention this? Is it with the 
               <br />
               view of raising any difﬁculty about the 
               <br />
               scheme now before us? Quite the reverse. 
               <br />
               I speak in time—I speak to assure my co-

               religionists in Lower Canada—to elicit the 
               <br />
               declaration of tolerant and generous senti- 
               <br />
               ments on the part of Roman Catholic mem-

               bers ; I speak in earnest warning now, that 
               <br />
               there may be no necessity for it hereafter. 
               <br />
               I need scarcely declare what are my own 
               <br />
               sentiments—those of every British Protest- 
               <br />

               Catholic fellow-countrymen that which we

               also demand, the freest liberty of conscience, 
               <br />
               the freest exercise of every political right.

               COL. HAULTAIN—I think, sir, this is 
               <br />
               a matter too serious to be made the occasion 
               <br />
               of unmeaning jokes. I speak what I know 
               <br />
               when I say there is a feeling of distrust- on 
               <br />
               the part of a great many of the Protestants 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada. And I speak what I 
               <br />
               know, when I say that what 1 have quoted 
               <br />
               as emanating from the head of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic Church, has tended to increase that 
               <br />
               distrust. It must be evident, that if we are 
               <br />
               in the future to progress amicably and well, 
               <br />
               it is better we should speak honestly before 
               <br />
               we enter into this compact, and that we 
               <br />
               should all strive to guard against any system 
               <br />
               being carried out, or any course pursued, 
               <br />
               that would tend to create diﬂiculties in the 
               <br />
               future. What do my hon. friends from. 
               <br />
               Lower Canada say with regard to what I 
               <br />
