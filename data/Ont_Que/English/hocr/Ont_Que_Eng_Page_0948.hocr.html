               Ma. EBB said—Mr. SPEAKER, in the

               consideration of the scheme presented by the 
               <br />
               Government for the Confederation of the Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of British North America, I must say 
               <br />
               that I ﬁnd a great deal of diﬁiculty in dealing 
               <br />
               with it. It ap era to me that before asking 
               <br />
               for a vote, the vernment should have come 
               <br />
               down to the House with a more full and ex- 
               <br />
               plicit statement of the measure in its entirety, 
               <br />
               so that honorable members might be able to 
               <br />
               arrive at a reasonable and just conclusion as 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> merits of the case. (Hear, hear.) And 
               <br />
               I think, sir, that taking into consideration the 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               <br />
               well as myself have the honor of representing 
               <br />
               in this House, this line of argument is of much 
               <br />
               greater force coming from us than if it had 
               <br />
               been advanced by the people of any other part 
               <br />
               of the proposed Confederation. We all know 
               <br />
               that if this scheme is adopted, the English- 
               <br />

               anada will be in a very small minority in the 
               <br />
               Local Legislature; we all know that those 
               <br />
               who ﬁrst opened up and settled the country 
               <br />
               which I allude to spoke the English language, 
               <br />
               and that the great majority of the people now 
               <br />
               living there are English-speaking Protestants; 
               <br />
               and, therefore, when their representatives are 
               <br />
               called upon to vote for a measure of thiskind, 
               <br />
               which so deeply and intimately affects their 
               <br />
               future position and prosperity, I believe that 
               <br />
               all the details of it, all parts of it, should be 
               <br />
               fully and clearl placed before them, in order 
               <br />
               that they may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{now</span> exactly in what position 
               <br />
               they stand with regard, and how it is to affect 
               <br />
               the interests they represent. Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The honorable gentlemen on t e Treasury 
               <br />
               benches, in introducing this scheme and ask- 
               <br />
               ing our assent to it, have thought proper to 
               <br />
               take a different course; they merely bring 
               <br />
               down the resolutions which consent to Con- 
               <br />
               federation, reserving the all-important details 
               <br />
               for future consideration. It may be the right 
               <br />
               course, but I doubt it very much. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Although the Government has not 
               <br />
               'ven all the information which I would 
               <br />

               ple of the section of which I am one of the 
               <br />
               representatives would be justiﬁed in opposing 
               <br />

               vote for the resolutions in your hands, reserving 
               <br />
               to myself the right of voting for or against the

               <br />
               tion as in my judgment may seem advisable. 
               <br />
               (liear, hear.) I consider that by voting for 
               <br />
               this measure I do net pledge myself to any- 
               <br />
               thing more than the general principle of a 
               <br />
               union of the Provinces of British North Amer- 
               <br />
               ica. I admit, sir, that last summer the polit- 
               <br />
               ical affairs of this country were in a state of 
               <br />
               extreme diﬁiculty, and I admit, too, that it 
               <br />
               was necessary something should be done to 
               <br />
               get rid of that difﬁculty. I would have 
               <br />
               thought, however, that the Conference which 
               <br />
               met here in October last, toconsider a subject 
               <br />
               that has been before the peeple of this coun- 
               <br />
               try since 1858, would have proposed, for the 
               <br />
               consideration of the respective legislatures, a 
               <br />
               legislative union of the British North Amer- 
               <br />
               ican Provinces. It a pears to me that a 
               <br />
               legislative union woul be far more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effective</span> 
               <br />
               in binding the provinces together, and far 
               <br />
               more economical than the Federal union pro- 
               <br />
               posed. (Hear, hear.) I admit, however, that 
               <br />
               there may be very great diﬁiculties in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bring.</span> 
               <br />
               ing about a legislative union, that may not 
               <br />
               be in the way of a Federal union ; and under 
               <br />
               all the circumstances of the case, the scheme 
               <br />
               proposed may have been the best that could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               have been devised. The greatest objection I

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               now have to it is that many of the people do 
               <br />
               not understand—that its details are not yet 
               <br />
               fully comprehended by the country. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that if hon. gentlemen had come down 
               <br />
               with the scheme in its entirety—presenting 
               <br />
               all its details, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the—results</span> expected to ﬂow 
               <br />
               from them—that there would be far less op- 
               <br />
               position to it than there is in the country and 
               <br />
               in this House. (Hear, hear.) But as it is 
               <br />
               now, they call upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives</span> of the 
               <br />
               people to give their consent to a measure that 
               <br />
               neither they nor the people thoroughly under- 
               <br />
               stand. These objections liave been made to 
               <br />
               the scheme, and in my Opinion they have 
               <br />
               great weight, more articularly in the part of 
               <br />

               English-speaking part of the population of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada view it with apprehension, or
