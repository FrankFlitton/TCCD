               of these resolutions by itself. It was then 
               <br />
               quite open to me, according to the usage 
               <br />
               of the House. to make a motion for 
               <br />
               an Address to Her Majesty for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose stated, and it was not as a favor to 
               <br />
               the Government that the arrangement 
               <br />
               was made to discuss it as if the House 
               <br />
               were in Committee of the Whole. On the 
               <br />
               contrary, it was a concession of the Govern- 
               <br />
               , ment to the minority in the House ; for I 
               <br />
               stated, of my own mere motion, that although 
               <br />
               I had a right to proceed in the ordinary 
               <br />
               manner with the Speaker in the chair, and to 
               <br />
               restrict honorable gentlemen to a single 
               <br />
               speech in accordance with the rules that 
               <br />
               govern debate—that although this was my 
               <br />
               undoubted right according to parliamentary 
               <br />
               practice, yet, for the purpose of allowing 
               <br />
               the fullest and freest discussion, I suggested 
               <br />
               that the same rule should obtain as if the 
               <br />
               House were in Committee of the Whole, when 
               <br />
               every member could speak twenty times if 
               <br />
               he felt so disposed, and present his views 
               <br />
               fully on all the points of“ the scheme. That 
               <br />
               was the proposition made by the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment; it was a fair, liberal, even generous 
               <br />
               one. But how were we met by honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite? We were ready to 
               <br />
               proceed with the discussion at once, and to 
               <br />
               present the subject to the House without 
               <br />
               delay. But it was stated that that would 
               <br />
               be unfair—that the members of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment should ﬁrst make a statement, and 
               <br />
               allow it to go to the House and country, 
               <br />
               so that neither should be taken by sur- 
               <br />
               prise in a matter of so much importance, 
               <br />
               and that honorable gentlemen might have 
               <br />
               the fullest information upon which to 
               <br />
               make up their minds. We did make our 
               <br />
               statement, and when asked for a week’s 
               <br />
               delay in order that these speeches might be 
               <br />
               fully considered, we consented to it. Sup- 
               <br />
               posing that after this postponement the 
               <br />
               debate would go on at once, we gave hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposed to the scheme a whole 
               <br />
               week to consider our remarks, to prepare 
               <br />
               themselves for debate, to work out objections 
               <br />
               to our arguments, and pick out all the ﬂaws 
               <br />
               they could ﬁnd in the scheme itself. We 
               <br />
               did this because we thought it fair, and be- 
               <br />
               cause we believed bon. gentlemen were sin- 
               <br />
               cere in their professed desire to have the 
               <br />
               fullest infcrmation upon the subject. Well, 
               <br />
               the debate began, it has gone on now for 
               <br />

               the estimation of this House. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I say it distinctly that this was the plot of 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite, to delay the con. 
               <br />
               sideration of this subject. Their policy was 
               <br />
               to wait, like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Micawsss,</span> for “ somethiugto 
               <br />
               turn up,” to see what would happen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor.</span> 
               <br />
               able to them in New Brunswick, to learn 
               <br />
               what would be done in N ova Scotia, and to 
               <br />
               embrace every pretext of delay that pre— 
               <br />
               sented itself. The hon. gentleman was 
               <br />
               playing, deliberater playing, a trick. He 
               <br />
               talked about a base trick having been played 
               <br />
               upon the Opposition, but was it not a base 
               <br />
               trick in him not to discuss this question, but 
               <br />
               to put it oﬁ' upon every possible excuse, to in- 
               <br />
               teirupt hon. gentlemen when they discussed 
               <br />
               it, making inuendoes, suggesting motives for 
               <br />
               delay, trying to disparage the scheme and 
               <br />
               ourselves in the estimation of the House and 
               <br />
               country, and getting others to say what he 
               <br />
               would not dare to say himself. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               That was the plan of the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman»</span> 
               <br />
               He complains of not being able to more an 
               <br />
               amendment, but the Opposition attemptedto 
               <br />
               move none. It was friends of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment who oﬁ'ered the only amendments yet 
               <br />
               presented. The policy of the Opposition was 
               <br />
               just this—they wished to s nd the whole 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> of March and the best part of April in the

               general discussion upon my motion ; and

               then, when they could do nothing more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">°°</span>
