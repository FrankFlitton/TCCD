               <br />
               revenue cannot be considered as permanent. 
               <br />
               Besides, the amount must be added to the

               It is the same as regards the Municipal Loan

               Of a rson with an income of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£400,</span> who 
               <br />
               should expend £1,000. The total expenses 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada for all purposes, less the 
               <br />
               cost of legislation and the payment of interest 
               <br />
               on the local debt, will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$997,000,</span> calculating 
               <br />
               the expenditure upon the present basis. But 
               <br />
               it is evident that Lower Canada will reduce 
               <br />
               its ex nditure, such for instance as the 
               <br />
               expen 'ture connected with the Crown Lands 
               <br />
               department, and that economy will be prac-
