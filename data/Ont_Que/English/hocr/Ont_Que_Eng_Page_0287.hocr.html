               <br />
               schemes that could be brought under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> 
               <br />
               sideration of the House; and if it should be

               adopted without the sanction of the people, 
               <br />
               the country would never cease to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regret</span> it. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) What is the necessity for all 
               <br />
               this haste ? The longer this Constitution is 
               <br />
               expected to last, the greater the necessity for 
               <br />
               the fullest consideration and dehberation. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd, sir, that when, in 1839, Lord JOHN RUS- 
               <br />
               SELL brought into the House of Commons his 
               <br />
               ﬁrst measure for the union of the provinces, 
               <br />
               he announced his intention to lay his measure 
               <br />
               before the House, have it read a second time, 
               <br />
               and postpone it till next session, to give a 
               <br />
               year to the people of Canada to consider it 
               <br />
               and make such representations as they would 
               <br />
               think proper. (Hear, hear.) And it was only 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in&amp;</span> the subsequent session, and after under- 
               <br />
               gomg considerable modiﬁcations in the mean 
               <br />
               time, that the measure was passed. Nothing 
               <br />
               could be more reasonable than such delay. 
               <br />
               But here it seems the people are to be treat- 
               <br />
               ed with less respect than the were when their 
               <br />
               Constitution was suspend , and this meas- 
               <br />
               ure is to be pushed with indecent haste. 
               <br />
               There are three modes of obtaining the views 
               <br />
               of the people upon the question now under 
               <br />
               discussion. The most direct one would be, 
               <br />
               after debating it in this House, to. submit it 
               <br />
               tothe people for their verdict, yea or nay. 
               <br />
               The second is to dissolve the House and 
               <br />
               appeal to the peOple. The third is to discuss 
               <br />
               and pass the resolutions or address to a 
               <br />
               second reading,and afterwards leave it open 
               <br />
               to the ublic to judge of its merits, by meet- 
               <br />
               ing an discussing it, and sending in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petition,</span>

               <br />
               at the next session. Any one of these 
               <br />
               methods would elicit the views of the people. 
               <br />
               But to say that the opinions of the people 
               <br />
               have been ascertained on the question, I say 
               <br />
               it is no such thing. (Hear, hear.) We 
               <br />
               have heard one side of the question discussed, 
               <br />
               but we have heard none of the views on the 
               <br />
               other side ; and yet the feeling, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> exhibiœd 
               <br />
               in some parts of the country, has been un— 
               <br />
               mistakeably in favor oi an appeal to the 
               <br />
               people. Some ﬁfteen counties in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada have held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meetings‘and</span> declared for 
               <br />
               an appeal before the scheme is allowed to 
               <br />
               pass ; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when”</span> honorable gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               other side have held second meetings, they 
               <br />
               have been condemned more conclusively than 
               <br />
               at ﬁrst. (Hear, hear.) In the county of 
               <br />
               Rouvxlle, the hon. member representing that 
               <br />

               <br />
               of Opinion, held a second meetin , but the 
               <br />
               decision was still more emphatic tlgmn at the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst. (Hear, hear.) Then meetings have 
               <br />
               been held, all tendin to the same conclusion,

               <br />
               HON. Mn. DORION—Yes, a meeting was 
               <br />
               called, and called without the requisite 
               <br />
               notice ; the notice having been given at the 
               <br />
               church doors on a Friday for a meeting on 
               <br />
               the next day; but notwithstanding, when 
               <br />
               the meeting was held, the hon. gentleman did 
               <br />
               not dare press a resolution in favor of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, but simply one of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬁdence”</span> in 
               <br />
               himself. (Hear, hear.) His friends cel- 
               <br />
               lected together, and all they did was to 
               <br />
               express conﬁdence in him. There was no 
               <br />
               resolution in favor of Confederation, nor of 
               <br />
               assing such a measure without submitting 
               <br />
               it to the people. (Hear, hear.) I have now 
               <br />
               to thank the House for the patience with 
               <br />
               which they have listened to my remarks. 
               <br />
               In the terms of the paragraph I have quoted 
               <br />
               from the Globe, I shall feel it my duty to 
               <br />
               resist the assage of the measure at every 
               <br />
               stage, wit a view that the scheme should 
               <br />
               go to the people in some shape or other. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) There is no hurry in regard 
               <br />
               to the scheme. We are now legislating for 
               <br />
