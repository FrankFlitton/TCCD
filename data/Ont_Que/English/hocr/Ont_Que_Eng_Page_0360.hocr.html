               to ? If we are to assume that the population of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland increased 8,000 between 1861 
               <br />
               and 1864 or 1865, why should not a similar 
               <br />
               increase be allowed to Canada? Assuming 
               <br />
               that the population of Canada increased at no 
               <br />
               more rapid rate, we would have an increase of 
               <br />
               160,000, which would entitle us to go into 
               <br />

               why the population of Newfoundland should

               HON. Ms. CAMPBELL—The reason is 
               <br />
               just this, that there happened to be no census 
               <br />
               taken in Newfoundland in 1861. The last 
               <br />
               census there was some years before—I think 
               <br />
               in 1857. The estimated increase, if I recol- 
               <br />
               lect rightly, was based on the increase which 
               <br />
               had taken place during the period between the 
               <br />
               previous census and that of 1857; and, taking 
               <br />
               that ratio of increase, it was found that the 
               <br />
               population, at the time of the union, would be 
               <br />
               close upon 130,000. We therefore put it at 
               <br />
               that ﬁ re.

               <br />
