               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) A subsidy of 80 cents per 
               <br />
               head was provided, based upon the u- 
               <br />
               lation according to the census of 1861. The 
               <br />
               amount, if taken upon the basis of the present 
               <br />
               pulation, would undoubtedly be considerably 
               <br />
               ess ; and it must be observed that the agree- 
               <br />
               ment does not contemplate any future exten- 
               <br />
               sion of this amount. It is hoped that being 
               <br />
               in itself ﬁxed and permanent in its character, 
               <br />
               the local governments will see the importance 
               <br />
               ———I may say the necessity-—of their exercising 
               <br />
               a rigid and proper control over the expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of their several provinces. We thus 
               <br />
               obtain one of the greatest securities that can 
               <br />
               be oﬁ‘ered to us that those inﬂuences which, 
               <br />
               in such a Legislature as we now possess in 
               <br />
               Canada, are brought to hear for the purpose 
               <br />
               of swelling the public expenditure, will not 
               <br />
               exist in the local legislatures, but will meet with 
               <br />
               such a resistance, from the mere fact of the 
               <br />
               inability of the local governments to Obey 
               <br />
               them, as to produce a very considerable 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saving</span> in the general expense of the whole 
               <br />
               country. (Hear, hear-,) I have now, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, only-to advert to the last question 
               <br />
               which Ifhave stated is necessary to be decided 
               <br />
               on‘the resent occasion ; and that is, whether 
               <br />
               under t e proposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Oonfhderation</span> such addi- 
               <br />
               tional expenses will be incurred as to render 
               <br />
               it undesirable. In considering this point, I 
               <br />
               must state that in my opinion the question of 
               <br />
               expense alone is by no means a fair criterion 
               <br />
               by which to judge of the advantages of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mew</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hare</span> such as that now befdre the House. If 
               <br />
               it be looked at in its most restricted sense, the 
               <br />
               only point in which additional expense can be 
               <br />
               incurred, must be that of the simple cost of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governing</span> the country. In no other way that 
               <br />
               ’am able to see, can there be additional ex- 
               <br />
               pense charged upon the people; and looking 
               <br />
               at it in this point of view, we may well doubt 
               <br />
               whether the aggregate charge will be greater 
               <br />
               for the General Government, caring for the 
               <br />
               oral interests of the whole, and for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               attention of the ﬁrst men in the country ; we 
               <br />
               shall not have our time frittered away in 
               <br />
               considerin the merits of petty local bills, 
               <br />
               and there ore we may reasonably hope that 
               <br />
               the expenses of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span> the General Legislature will 
               <br />
               be considerably less than even those of the 
               <br />
               Legislature of Canada at the present moment, 
               <br />
               —while, on the other hand, the local legis- 
               <br />
               latures having to deal rather with municipal 
               <br />
               than great ral questions, will be able to 
               <br />
               dispose of t em in a manner more satisfactory 
               <br />
               to the people, and at inﬁnitely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less</span> expense 
               <br />
               than now. I believe, therefore, the simple 
               <br />
               cost of the Government of the country will 
               <br />
               not be in reality any greater under the new 
               <br />
               than under the old system; but there are 
               <br />
               other items of cXpenditure for great public 
               <br />
               objects, the absence of which from the esti- 
               <br />
               mates of any country is an indication rather 
               <br />
               of weakness and of dependence than a sub- 
               <br />
               ject that ought to form a source of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfac-</span> 
               <br />
               tion. If such items are not—now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found.</span> in the 
               <br />
               public expenditure, either of Canada or the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces,- it is the best proof <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> that 
               <br />
               could be given that our position is one of in- 
               <br />
               feriority, and that we do not possess either 
               <br />
               the power or the means to undertake such 
               <br />
               works as make such items necessary. Let me 
               <br />
               give one or two points as examples of my 
               <br />
               meaning; and ﬁrst I will instance the great 
               <br />
               question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofdefence—{hean</span> hear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\—-the</span> absence 
               <br />
               of items of expenditure for which can only be 
               <br />
               an indication that we are lacking in one of the 
               <br />
               chief elements of national greatness, that we 
               <br />
               do not pro y value the institutions under 
               <br />
               which we live, and that we are not willing to 
               <br />
               make the sacriﬁces that every free people must 
               <br />
               make if they are desirous of preserving them. 
               <br />
               The same argument applies to public works, 
               <br />
               in connection with which it might be said 
               <br />
               that great advantage would arise from large 
               <br />
               expenditure; but with limited resources and 
               <br />
               an undeveloped territory it might be impos- 
               <br />
               sible for any small country to undertake the 
               <br />
               necessa outlay. Many works of this kind 
               <br />
               are not irectly productive of revenue, although 
               <br />
