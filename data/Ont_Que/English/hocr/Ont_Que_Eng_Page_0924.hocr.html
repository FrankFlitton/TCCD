               among us is prepared for either of these 
               <br />
               alternatives ? Am I to suppose that the 
               <br />
               people of this province of French origin 
               <br />
               are less loyal to the British Crown than 
               <br />
               those of Anglo-Saxon descent? Am I to 
               <br />
               believe that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.were</span> the opportunity afforded 
               <br />
               them, they would reunite themselves with 
               <br />
               France ? These questions, I am assured, 
               <br />
               they will answer indignantly in the negative. 
               <br />
               At all events, of this I am satisﬁed, and I be- 
               <br />
               lieve they are satisﬁed, that under no govern- 
               <br />
               ment in the world can they enjoy so large an 
               <br />
               amount of civil, political and religious liberty 
               <br />
               as under British sway. The Scotch have 
               <br />
               their history and their traditions as well 
               <br />
               as the French, but where is the Scotchman 
               <br />
               now that is not proud of his alliance with 
               <br />
               England, or that would wish to dissever the 
               <br />
               connection, though thereby he might regain 
               <br />
               his parliament or his king? I lieve that 
               <br />
               every enlightened French—Canadian is of the 
               <br />
               same opinion, whatever hot-blooded and hair- 
               <br />
               brained demagogues may assert to the con- 
               <br />
               trary. (Hear, hear.) Take the question of 
               <br />
               religious creeds. These are said to present 
               <br />
               an insurmountable obstacle in the way of the 
               <br />
               settlement of our sectional difﬁcult-y. If, 
               <br />
               sir, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had.</span> established in this province a 
               <br />
               non-Catholic or Protestant creed, to which 
               <br />
               all would be required to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subscribe,</span> or if not 
               <br />
               to subscribe, at least to support by compul- 
               <br />
               sory taxation, then, sir, I could conceive 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> of religious opinion might 
               <br />
               operate in the way alleged; but as among us 
               <br />
               the most complete religious liberty is en- 
               <br />
               joyed—yes, a larger amount of religious 
               <br />
               liberty than Catholic Christians are allowed 
               <br />
               in France—I can see no valid ground for the 
               <br />
               supposition that they would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffer</span> in this 
               <br />
               respect, or that they ever had the shadow of 
               <br />
               a reason to fear that in doing an act of jus- 
               <br />
               tice to Upper Canadians they would be 
               <br />
               doing injustice to themselves. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We are, all- of us, too much and too deeply 
               <br />
               interested in the question of religious liberty, 
               <br />
               to trespass on the rights of conscience, or to 
               <br />
               allow of state interference in matters of such 
               <br />
               transcendent importance as our relations to 
               <br />
               the Divine Being, and the service and wor- 
               <br />
               ship we owe to Him. Diﬁ‘ering as we do in 
               <br />
               our creed and modes of worship, religious 
               <br />
               equality is necessary to the peace and good 
               <br />
               order of government, as well as to the life of 
               <br />
               religion itself among the people. We thus 
               <br />
               become the guardians of .the most precious 
               <br />
               of all liberties, the right to worship God 
               <br />
               according to the dictates of our conscience,

               without let or hindrance from each other or 
               <br />
               the state. (Hear, hear.) But it is said that 
               <br />
               the civil institutions of Lower Canada would 
               <br />
               suffer, were Upper Canada allowed a repre-

               sentation in the Legislature and the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment in proportion to its population. I 
               <br />
               marvel, sir, much that such a diﬁcult as 
               <br />
               this should ever have been started. t is 
               <br />
               well known that the policy of Great Britain 
               <br />
               has ever been of the most liberal and com- 
               <br />
               prehensive character in relation to matters 
               <br />
               of this kind. Trace her history in connection 
               <br />
               with her conquest in any part of the world ; 
               <br />
               and when, except with the consent of the 
               <br />
               people, has she imposed upon them the body 
               <br />
               of her statute laws? Her Constitution and 
               <br />
               her common law of right belong to the 
               <br />
               peoples subjected to her sway, and these are 
               <br />
               the guardians of personal and public liberty ; 
               <br />
               but beyond these she allows the largest free- 
               <br />
               dom in respect of customs, the peculiar insti- 
               <br />
               tutions, and the administration of civil 
               <br />
               justice throughout the length and breadth 
               <br />
               of her dominious. However desirable the 
               <br />
               assimilation of the laws between Upper and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Low“</span> Canada may be, uniformity would be 
               <br />
               purchased at too dear a rate, if it led to dis- 
               <br />
               satisfaction among any considerable class of 
               <br />
               the people. Time may accomplish what 
               <br />
               force might destroy. As an Englishman, 
               <br />
               whilst I believe our laws, in the main, as 
               <br />
               well as our whole judicial system, are the 
               <br />
               best in the world, I do not believe either the 
               <br />
               one or the other to be perfect. To improve 
               <br />
               them by importing into them whatever is 
               <br />
               more excellent in other systems, is the 
               <br />
               dictate of common sense, and will always 
               <br />
               have my hearty concurrence. The institu- 
               <br />
               tions of Lower Canada are perfectly safe in 
               <br />
               the keeping of Lower Canadians, for practic- 
               <br />
               ally nothing could be gained by Upper 
               <br />
               Canadians in changing them, supposing they 
               <br />
               had the power to do so, which they neither 
               <br />
               have nor desire to have. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               And then, sir, with respect to language, I 
               <br />
               can hardly suppose Lower Canadians serious 
               <br />
               when they imagine that any desire exists to 
               <br />
               destroy the use among them of their mother- 
               <br />
               tongue. It may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do‘well</span> enough to excite a 
               <br />
               prejudice among ignorant people to say so, 
               <br />
               but surely among those that are intelligent 
               <br />
               it can have no effect. It remains with 
               <br />
               French-Canadians themselves to determine 
               <br />
               whether they will abandon the use of their 
               <br />
               native tongue, and adopt ours, or not. They 
               <br />
               are free to use either, or both, at pleasure. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span>
