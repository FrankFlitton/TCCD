               was entirely the contrary. I said there should

               they were to meet Parliament in July, there 
               <br />

               HON. MR. BROWN—Yes; but the hon- 
               <br />
               orable gentleman most inconsistently told us 
               <br />
               in the same breath that the deputation of 
               <br />
               Ministers must go at once to England. Does 
               <br />
               he fancy a general election would be brought 
               <br />
               on during the absence from the country of 
               <br />
               the leading members of the Administration ? 
               <br />
               If he does, I tell him he is mistaken. But 
               <br />
               does the honorable gentleman pretend there 
               <br />
               is any doubt as to the feeling of the people 
               <br />
               of Canada on this measure ? Not at all. On 
               <br />
               the contrary, he is quite conﬁdent that if sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to the people there would be a vast 
               <br />
               majority in its favor—a complete sweep over 
               <br />
               the country. Nay, strange enough, he gives 
               <br />
               this very fact of the certainty of approval as 
               <br />
               the chief argument in favor of an election. 
               <br />
               He says, “Send it to the people ; there is no 
               <br />
               fear of the result. The very men who now 
               <br />
               sit here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> or others who think as they 
               <br />
               do, will come back and adopt it! ” Could 
               <br />
               anything more absurd than this be imagined? 
               <br />
               Is not the argument clearly in the opposite 
               <br />
               direction ? Should not the honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tleman have said—“ The people approve of 
               <br />
               this measure; their representatives approve 
               <br />
               of it; if you had an election, the same men 
               <br />
               would be sent back, or others like them; a 
               <br />
               vast sum would be uselessly expended ; much 
               <br />
               valuable time would be lost; partisan broils 
               <br />
               might be revived; don’t, then, lose a moment, 
               <br />
               but put it through at once.” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> But 
               <br />
               I confess the honorable gentleman did sug- 
               <br />
               gest one argument in favor of an appeal to 
               <br />
               the people, and a very strange one it certain- 
               <br />
               ly was coming from such a quarter. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Peel says he has not a doubt as to 
               <br />
               the feelings of the people of Upper Canada; 
               <br />
               he is quite certain that an almost unanimous 
               <br />
               verdict woul be rendered by them in favor 
               <br />
               of this measure. But he says he has some 
               <br />
               doubts as to what the people of Lower Cana- 
               <br />
               da might think about it; they might ssi- 
               <br />
               bly like to give the measure a death- low,

               and he is in favor of giving them a chance to 
               <br />

               <br />
               peculiar style of argument from one so en- 
               <br />
               amoured of this measure, and from one, too, 
               <br />
               who has been supposed not to be very closely 
               <br />
               allied with the majority of Lower Canadians 
               <br />
               on matters of public policy, and especially on 
               <br />
               this particular question. (Hear, hear.) Who 
               <br />
               could have expected to ﬁnd the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peel assuming the rôle of an exponent of 
               <br />
               popular feeling in Lower Canada, and con- 
               <br />
               stituting himself the guardian of the rights 
               <br />
               of the French-Canadians? (Hear, hear.) It 
               <br />
               did strike me that the honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               might very properly have left the Lower Ca- 
               <br />
               nadians to speak for themselves. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               In view of the vote recorded on this measure 
               <br />
               at our last sitting—considerin the fact that 
               <br />
               a majority of twelve on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">îower</span> Canada 
               <br />
               vote was then recorded in favor of the meas-

               ure, I do think the hon. member for Peel might 
               <br />
               have been well content to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aciept</span> the votes of 
               <br />
               Lower Canadian representatives as the best 
               <br />
               index to Lower Canadian feeling. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) There were three Lower Canada 
               <br />
               members absent, on Saturday morning, from 
               <br />
               the division; but had they been here, there 
               <br />
               would have been a majority of thirteen on
