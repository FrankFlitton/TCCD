               doing an injustice to the inhabitants of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada? It will be said that the 
               <br />
               national life of Lower Canada is so deeply 
               <br />
               rooted, that it is impossible to destroy it; 
               <br />
               but, if we desire to secure its safety, we must 
               <br />
               accept the present scheme of Confederation, 
               <br />
               under which all the religious interests of 
               <br />
               Laver Canada, her educational institutions, 
               <br />

               stitutes a peOple’s nationality, will ﬁnd protec-

               our public lands in our own hands, we

               can attract the tide of emigration, retain 
               <br />
               our own people in the country, and advance 
               <br />

               vinces. And all this is secured to us under 
               <br />
               the plan of Confederation. Every impartial 
               <br />
               man will admit that great care has been 
               <br />
               taken, in the drawing up of this project <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> 
               <br />
               Confederation, to protect all our interests. 
               <br />
               It may be true that it is not quite free from 
               <br />
               defect, but every one must acknowledge 
               <br />
               that it is the most perfect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> that could 
               <br />
               possibly be obtained, and the system best 
               <br />
               calculated to aﬂ'ord us security. All the 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen who have spoken on the 
               <br />
               Opposition side say that the expenses will 
               <br />
               he extraordinary, and that the revenue will 
               <br />
               not be suﬁcient to support the governments 
               <br />
               ofthe Confederation. But they base their 
               <br />
               calculations upon the revenue as it now 
               <br />
               Stands, and they do not reﬂect that the pre— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sect</span> debt of the province has been contracted 
               <br />
               m carrying out the vast public works we 
               <br />
               now possess, and that these public works 
               <br />
               have not as yet produced a revenue, but will 
               <br />
               hereafter do so. These public works were 
               <br />
               essentially necessary for the development of 
               <br />
               our resources; and if at this moment the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance is able to present a 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crpepditure,</span> we are justiﬁed in hoping that 
               <br />
               Within a few years our revenue will be 
               <br />
               more than suﬂieient to enable us to meet 
               <br />
               all the expenses of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> governments, 
               <br />
               and to extinguish our present debt. For 
               <br />
               my own part, I do not think that our 
               <br />
               eXpenses will be greater under Confederation 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l31ml</span> they are at present. If the Federal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> works well, our expenses will 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">€</span> less than they are at present, for we shall

               <br />
               majority of one or two votes in this House, 
               <br />
               as we have witnessed for some years past; 
               <br />
               for a government so placed is at the mercy 
               <br />
               of every member who has a local interest to

               <br />
               it is thus forced to grant favors which it 
               <br />
               would refuse if it were stronger. This 
               <br />
               was the cause of all the useless expenditure; 
               <br />
               and almost every one of our governments 
               <br />
               has been in that position. (Hear, hear.)

               But under Confederation we may hope that 
               <br />
               the Federal Government will generally have 
               <br />
               the support of a large majority, and Will con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               demands of a small number of members.

               The resources at the disposal of the local

               a degree of econom which will serve as an

               Lower Canada, when left to herself, will be— 
               <br />
               come highly prosperous in a few years—and 
               <br />
               perhaps Upper Canada also—provided her

               expenses be kept within bounds; and I am

               <br />
               British pepulation of Lower Canada. We 
               <br />
               have always gone along hand in hand like 
               <br />
               good friends, acknowledging each other’s 
               <br />
               rights, and each party invariably making it a 
               <br />
               rule to accede to the just claims of the other. 
               <br />
               This will be our safety also under the Federal 
               <br />
               Government. For my part I should be sorry 
               <br />
               to see the present plan of Confederation fail, 
               <br />
               at all events through any action of ours, for 
               <br />
               that would justly dissatisfy the British popu- 
               <br />
               lation of this country, who desire to see it 
               <br />
               carried out, and to whom we should not re- 
               <br />
               fuse it. We know that the British have al-

               <br />
               mote the material prosperity of the country, 
               <br />
               and it is our duty to respect them and to ac-

               cede to their just demands. With these few
