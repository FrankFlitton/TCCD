               apprehend, any considerable merit; as a work 
               <br />
               of defence it has, however, many advocates; 
               <br />
               but, if the union of the provinces is to go on, 
               <br />
               it is an absolute necessity ; and, as the price 
               <br />
               of union, were there no other argument' m its 
               <br />
               favor, I heartil go for it. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The advantage it will confer on the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces can hardly be over-rated. It will 
               <br />
               make Halifax and St. John the Atlantic sea- 
               <br />
               ports of half a continent—it will insure to 
               <br />
               Halifax, ere long, the establishment of a line 
               <br />
               of powerful steamers running in six da s from 
               <br />

               <br />
               stream of passengers and immigrants through 
               <br />
               those Lower Provinces that never otherwise 
               <br />
               would come near them. Mr. SPEAKER, I 
               <br />
               could go on for many hours piling up argu- 
               <br />
               ments m favor of this scheme, but already I 
               <br />
               have detained the House too long—(cries of 
               <br />
               “no, no;" “go on!”)—and must draw to a 
               <br />
               close. But I think I have iven reasons 
               <br />
               enough to satisfy every candid man who 
               <br />
               desires the advancement of his country, why 
               <br />
               this House should go unanimously and enthu- 
               <br />
               siastically for “ the union, the whole union, 
               <br />
               and nothing but the union 1” Before sittin 
               <br />
               down, however, there are one or two genera 
               <br />
               objections urged against the scheme which I 
               <br />
               am desirous of meeting, and I will try to do 
               <br />
               so as brieﬂy as ssible. And ﬁrst, sir, I am 
               <br />
               told that we 8 ould have made the union 
               <br />
               legislative and not federal. Undoubtedly this 
               <br />
               is a point on which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘erent</span> opinions may be 
               <br />
               honestly held by men sincerely seeking the 
               <br />
               same ends—but, speaking my own views, I 
               <br />
               think we came to a most wise conclusion. 
               <br />
               Had we continued the present legislative 
               <br />
               union, we must have continued with it 
               <br />
               the unjust system of taxation for local pur- 
               <br />
               ses that now exists—and the sectional bicker- 
               <br />
               ing would have gone on as before. And can 
               <br />
               any honorable gentleman really believe that 
               <br />
               it would have been possible for a body of men 
               <br />
               sitting at Ottawa to admininister eﬁciently 
               <br />
               and wisely the parish business of Red River 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland, and all the country be- 
               <br />
               tween? Only think of bringing suitors and 
               <br />
               witnesses such distances to promote a bill for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">closing.</span> a side-line or ineo rating a club! 
               <br />
               And ' such a thing were esirable, would it 
               <br />
               be ssible for any body of men to go through 
               <br />
               suc a mass of work? Why, sir, the Im 
               <br />
               rial Parliament with 650 members sits or 
               <br />
               eight months in the year, and even our Par- 
               <br />
               liament sits three or four months,—how then 
               <br />

               <br />
               is another reason why the union was not 
               <br />
               made legislative—it could not be carried. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We had either to take a federal 
               <br />
               union or drop the negotiation. Not only were 
               <br />
               our friends from Lower Canada against it, but 
               <br />
               so were most of the delegates from the Mari- 
               <br />
               time Provinces. There was but one choice 
               <br />
               open to us—federal union or nothing. But 
               <br />
               in truth the scheme now before us has all the 
               <br />
               advantages of alegislative union and a federal 
               <br />
               one as well. We have thrown over on the le- 
               <br />
               calities all the questions which experience has 
               <br />
               shown lead directly to local jealousy and dis- 
               <br />
               cord, and we have retained in the hands of 
               <br />
               the General Government all the powers neces- 
               <br />
               sary to secure a strong and eﬁieient adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of public affairs. (Hear, hear.) By 
               <br />
               placing the appointment of the judges in the 
               <br />
               hands of the General Government, and the 
               <br />
               establishment of a central court of appeal, 
               <br />
               we have secured uniformity of justice over 
               <br />
               the whole land. (Hear, hear.) By vesting

               common to the whole peep e, we have vested

               fully and unrestrictedly in the General Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. The measure, in fact, shuns the 
               <br />
               faults of the federal and legislative systems 
               <br />

               <br />
               well persuaded it wrll work eﬂiciently and 
               <br />
               satisfactorily. (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I am told that the cost of working 
               <br />
               this FederatiOn scheme will be enormous. 
               <br />
               Now, it would be a very rash thing of me, or 
               <br />
               of any other rson, to assert that the ex- 
               <br />
               pense will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ml):</span> great ; for we all know that 
               <br />
               any system of government may be made either 
               <br />
               economical or extrav ant, precisel according 
               <br />
               to the discretion of t ose who minister it. 
               <br />
               But this I am conﬁdent of, that with ordinary 
               <br />
               discretion, far from being more costly than 
               <br />
               the existing system, a very considerable re- 
               <br />
               duction may be readily eﬁ'ected; and one 
               <br />
               thing is quite certain, that no ingenuity
