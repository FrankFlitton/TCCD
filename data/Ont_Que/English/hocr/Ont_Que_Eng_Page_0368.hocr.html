               PASSY assigns two main causes for these

               The strongest bond of union among the

               and religion. We have neither in common. 
               <br />
               The confederations of South America have

               they can ever live in peace under a federal 
               <br />

               <br />
               ation in 1824. In 1837 it was united, and 
               <br />
               the union subsisted till- 1846, except three 
               <br />
               years of dictatorship. In 1846 the Federal 
               <br />
               principle again revailed, but disappeared 
               <br />
               in 1853, since w ich riod the history of

               <br />
               have ever existed, and none can exist. The 
               <br />
               principle of a monarchy is that the war 
               <br />
               resides in one person; the princi le 0 con-

               bers of the confederation. A confederation 
               <br />
               would, therefore, always be a republic, even 
               <br />

               <br />
               vested in one person, but in each of the 
               <br />
               several states, of which no one would 
               <br />
               acknowledge a head ; it would be a republic 
               <br />
