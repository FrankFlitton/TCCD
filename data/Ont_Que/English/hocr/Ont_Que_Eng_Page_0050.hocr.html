               marks of compromise. Of necessity there

               must have been a great deal of mutual con- 
               <br />
               cession. When we think of the representa-

               tives of ﬁve colonies, all supposed to have 
               <br />

               <br />
               ties and sections, it must be admitted that 
               <br />
               had we not met in a spirit of conciliation, and 
               <br />
               with an anxious desire to promote this union; 
               <br />
               if we had not been impressed with the idea 
               <br />
               contained in the words of the resolution— 
               <br />
               “ That the best interests and present and fu- 
               <br />
               ture prosperity of British North America 
               <br />
               would be promoted by a Federal Union under 
               <br />

               <br />
               might have proved to be of no avail. If 
               <br />
               we had not felt that, after coming to this 
               <br />
               conclusion, we were bound to set aside our 
               <br />
               private opinions on matters of detail, if we 
               <br />
               had not felt ourselves bound to look at what 
               <br />
               was practicable, not obstinately rejecting the 
               <br />
               opinions of others nor adhering to our own; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if,we</span> had not met, I say, in a spirit of concili-

               ation, and with an anxious, overruling de- 
               <br />
               sireto form one people under one government, 
               <br />
               we never would have succeeded. With these 
               <br />
               views, we press the question on this House 
               <br />
               and the country. I say to this House, if you 
               <br />
               do not believe that the union of the colonies 
               <br />
               is for the advantage of the country, that the 
               <br />
               joining of these ﬁve peOples into one nation, 
               <br />
               under one sovereign, is for the beneﬁt of all, 
               <br />
               then reject the scheme. Reject it if you do 
               <br />
               not believe it to be for the present advantage 
               <br />
               and future prosperity of yourselves and your 
               <br />
               children. But if, after a calm and full con- 
               <br />
               sideration of this scheme, it is believed, as a 
               <br />
               whole, to be for the advantage of this pro- 
               <br />
               vince—-if the House and country believe this 
               <br />

               country to lay aside all prejudices, and accept 
               <br />

               <br />
               to meet the question in the same spirit in which 
               <br />
               the delegates met it. I ask each member of 
               <br />
               this House to lay aside his own opinions as 
               <br />

               <br />
               As I stated in the preliminary discussion, we 
               <br />
               must consider this scheme in the light of a 
               <br />
               treaty. By a happy coincidence of circum- 
               <br />
               stances, just when an Ad ministration had been 
               <br />
               formed in Canada for the purpose of attempt- 
               <br />
               ing a solution of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁcnlties</span> under which 
               <br />
               we laboured, at the same time the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, actuated by a similar feeling, appoint- 
               <br />
               ted a Conference with a view to a union 
               <br />
               among themselves, without being co isant 
               <br />
               of the position the government was ing in 
               <br />
               Canada. If it had not been for this fortunate 
               <br />
               coincidence of events, never, perhaps, for a 
               <br />
               long series of years would we have been able 
               <br />
               to bring this scheme to a practical conclusion. 
               <br />
               But we did succeed. We made the arrange- 
               <br />
               ment, agreed upon the scheme, and the depu- 
               <br />
               tations from the several governments repre- 
               <br />
               sented at the Conference went back pledged 
               <br />
               to lay it before their governments, and to 
               <br />
               ask the legislatures and people of their 
               <br />
               respective provinces to assent to it. I trust 
               <br />
               the scheme will be assented to as a whole. 
               <br />
               I am sure this House will not seek to alter it 
               <br />
               in its unimportant details ; and, if altered in 
               <br />
               any important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provisions,</span> the result must be 
               <br />
               that the whole will be set aside, and we must 
               <br />
               begin de nova. If any important changes 
               <br />
               are made, every one of the colonies will feel 
               <br />
               itself absolved from the implied obligation to 
               <br />
               deal with it as a Treaty, each province will 
               <br />
               feel itself at liberty to amend it ad libitum eo 
               <br />
               as to suit its own views and interests ; in fact, 
               <br />
               the whole of our labours will have been 
               <br />
               for nought, and we will have to renew our 
               <br />
               negotiations with all the colonies for the
