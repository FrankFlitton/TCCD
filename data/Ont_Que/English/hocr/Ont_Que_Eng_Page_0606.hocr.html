               of the Hon. Finance Minister (Hon. Mr.

               these insults, and to prove that the prosperity

               Well, if it be true that the French-Canadian

               members of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> since 1849,

               have, by their unceasing efforts, obtained the 
               <br />
               realization of these reforms, why is it now 
               <br />
               sought to destroy the Constitution under 
               <br />
               which they were obtained, and to create a 
               <br />
               new state of things which will diminish that 
               <br />
               inﬂuence which we now enjoy? It is be- 
               <br />
               cause, notwithstanding our material pros- 
               <br />
               perity, the old aggression of race against 
               <br />
               race, the former state of antagonism and 
               <br />

               <br />
               posed to be attained by the Government in 
               <br />
               making these changes is a vast and noble 
               <br />
               end, I admit. It is the creation of an im-

               mense Empire, which will redound to our 
               <br />
               glory and to that of England. But it seems 
               <br />
               tome that this will not be the necessary 
               <br />
               result of the means which are being taken 
               <br />
               toattain it. (Hear, hear.) Whenever the 
               <br />
               great measures of reform to which I have 
               <br />
               already referred have been submitted to 
               <br />
               Parliament, we have seen public men devote 
               <br />
               themselves exclusively to these measures, 
               <br />
               and labor for their realization. We have 
               <br />
               seen parties arrayed for or against these 
               <br />
               great questions—the abolition of the Soigni— 
               <br />
               orial Tenure, the election of the members 
               <br />
               of the Legislative Council, the construction 
               <br />
               of our railways and canals, &amp;e. In view of 
               <br />
               these great questions, there was no room for 
               <br />
               the contemptible personal considerations, 
               <br />
               and the miserable wrangling of the church 
               <br />
               door; but as soon as these great reforms 
               <br />
               were obtained, there was no longer any 
               <br />
               ground for opposition to the Government on 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               and of satisfying individual ambition. They

               then addressed themselves to the prejudices

               Canada could no longer tolerate? The

               hon. member for South Oxford (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               BROWN) was imported, and brought out

               here from Scotland, to cast the ﬂaming torch

               <br />
               to inﬂame them one against the other. I

               organized under his command as they are

               this day. To diminish or destroy the in-

               ﬂuence of the French-Canadians in Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, the hon. member for South Oxford 
               <br />
               raised a elamour for representation based 
               <br />
               upon population, which was reéchced from 
               <br />
               one end of Upper Canada to the other. 
               <br />
               These cries, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offspring</span> of fanaticism, were 
               <br />
               rejected by Lower Canada with unanimity

               member for South Oxford, ﬁnding that 
               <br />
               this cry for representation based on popu- 
               <br />
               lation was a magniﬁcent war-horse, made 
               <br />
               use of it to form a party. Since that 
               <br />
               period he has allowed nothing to stand in 
               <br />
               his way. He has ealumniated every public

               <br />
               held in respect by the inhabitants of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada; he has attacked, with the 
               <br />
               greatest fury, all that was dear to us as 
               <br />
               Frenchmen and Catholics; and by this 
               <br />
               means he gained his object; and we have 
               <br />
               seen all the western farmers, all the inhabit- 
               <br />
               ants of Canada West, cry out that here we 
               <br />
               were all under the domination of the clergy, 
               <br />
               and that the English and Protestant p0pula- 
               <br />
               tion ought not to submit to so heavy a yoke. 
               <br />
               He knew that the English element was 
               <br />
               fanatic and aggressive, and by means of this
