               the Intercolonial Railroad is not now wanted? 
               <br />
               I have some memcranda here taken from some 
               <br />
               statements I have had an o portunity of looking 
               <br />
               at, and I ﬁnd that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{ower</span> Provinces re- 
               <br />
               quire 600,000 barrels of ﬂour and grain an- 
               <br />
               nually beyond what they raise themselves. 
               <br />
               Now that they take ﬂour from Boston and 
               <br />
               fm Portland, a considerable quantity of it 
               <br />
               is carried down by the Grand Trunk Railway 
               <br />
               to Portland. It is then taken round to St. 
               <br />
               John, and is taken up the St. John river, 
               <br />
               and distributed all the way along, until within 
               <br />
               sixty miles of our own Canadian frontier at 
               <br />
               Riviera du Loup. Now, I would ask any 
               <br />
               sensible man whether it would not be as easy 
               <br />
               for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Intercolonitd</span> Railway to take this pro- 
               <br />
               duce and distribute it along the line, just as 
               <br />
               the Grand Trunk is now doing in the State 
               <br />
               of Maine? St. John is just 600 miles from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Montreal-Abe</span> same distance that Portland is 
               <br />
               from Sarnia. Well, to move this quantity of 
               <br />
               ﬂeur that I have mentioned, 600,000 barrels, 
               <br />
               would occupy one train every working day 
               <br />
               through the year. I think that is a suﬂieient 
               <br />
               answer to any honorable gentleman who says 
               <br />
               there is nothing to do for this Intercolonial 
               <br />
               Railway. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> In 1862, New 
               <br />
               Brunswick sold goods to the United States to 
               <br />
               the value of $880,000, and purchased 82,916,— 
               <br />
               000—thus paying to the United States 82, 
               <br />
               000,000 in hard cash. Nova Scotia ex rted 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">81,879,000</span> to the United States, an ur- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chaced</span> from the United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,860,000—</span> 
               <br />
               thus paying them another 82,000,000. These 
               <br />
               two provinces, therefore, paid to the United 
               <br />
               States in one year, the sum of four millions 
               <br />
               of dollars. There is a trade now between the 
               <br />
               United States and those provinces of ten 
               <br />
               millions of dollars a year. The proposed 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               tion of the Reciprocity Treaty discards 
               <br />
               that trade, and should we not here in Canada 
               <br />
               lay hold of it ? (Hear, hear.) Is not every 
               <br />
               mercantile man wide awake and ready to lay 
               <br />
               hold of it at once, if there was a possibility of 
               <br />
               doing so? but there is no such possibility, 
               <br />
               excepting by the Intercolonial Railroad. 
               <br />
               Another thing I wish to point out is, that half 
               <br />
               the importations of tea into New Brunswick 
               <br />
               and Nova Scotia axe supplied from the United 
               <br />
               States. New, that is precisely an article 
               <br />
               which we could send along the railway at a 
               <br />
               very low ﬁgure—and every honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               man is well aware that Montreal and Quebec 
               <br />
               compete with New York and Boston in the 
               <br />
               tea trade. Upper Canada merchants know 
               <br />
               that they would never go to Montreal to pur- 
               <br />
               chase the cargoesof tea sold there if 
               <br />
               they could do better in New York. And I 
               <br />

               maintain, therefore, that Quebec and Men- 
               <br />
               treal are in a position, as soon as th have

               the opportunity, to do the busineæ those

               provinces, better, in fact, than the United 
               <br />
               States can do. (Hear, hear.) Under the 
               <br />
               Reciprocity Treaty and the bonding system, 
               <br />
               in about the period of ﬁfteen years, the trade 
               <br />
               between ourselves and the United States has 
               <br />
               increased from 89,000,000 to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">837,000,000—</span> 
               <br />
               being four hundred per cent. In 1862, the 
               <br />
               Canadian imports passing through the United 
               <br />
               States in bond amounted to 86,000,000. And, 
               <br />
               unless we are careful in looking into the pro- 
               <br />
               gress of trade here as well as in the United 
               <br />
               States, we may lose what is absolutely neces— 
               <br />
               sary for the prosperity of our country. It 
               <br />
               requires men to be wide-awake in these days 
               <br />
               of rapid progress to keep pace with the march 
               <br />
               of events. (Hear, hear.) And Iam prepared 
               <br />
               to shew, as I have already to some extent 
               <br />
               endeavored to shew, and my own mind is 
               <br />
               made up on it, that, before the Intereolouial 
               <br />
               Railroad can be made, we will have enough 
               <br />
               business for it to pay expenses—(hear, hear) 
               <br />
               ——so that no loss can accrue to the provinces 
               <br />
               when the road is made—that is, three years 
               <br />
               hence, if it were set about now. But, I sup- 
               <br />
               pose, if this union is brought about, some time 
               <br />
               will be taken, after the Confederation is 
               <br />
               formed, to decide upon the mode of proceeding 
               <br />
               with the construction, and, if it is gone on 
               <br />
               with even in the most rapid manner, it would 
               <br />
               take at least four years before it was in full 
               <br />
               working order. I think it is much to be 
               <br />
               regretted that we have been so long in com- 
               <br />
               mencing it. In view of the present state of 
               <br />
               our relations with the United States, it ought 
               <br />
               to have been in existence now, and I say that 
               <br />
               in another year it would have paid expenses. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Honorable gentlemen object 
               <br />
               to the scheme of union because it was not 
               <br />

               <br />
               provinces acquainted with it. I do not under-
