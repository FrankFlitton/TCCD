               DB. PAQUET ——Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> although 
               <br />
               I am not in the habit of addressing the

               House, and although the question now under 
               <br />
               consideration has already been discussed at 
               <br />
               great length, I cannot allow so im rtant an 
               <br />
               occasion to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pam</span> without making nown the 
               <br />
               reasons which induce me to protest against 
               <br />
               the constitutional changes which are now pro 
               <br />
               posed,-and which tend to nothing less than 
               <br />
               the complete overthrowing of .the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion under which we have been governed 
               <br />
               since the union of Upper and Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               Since the prorogation of Parliament in June 
               <br />
               last, I have endeavored in vain to explain to 
               <br />
               myself the advantages which we, Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cen-</span> 
               <br />
               adians, would derive from Confederation, and 
               <br />
               I had lost myself in the motives and the ob- 
               <br />
               ject of a union of this kind, when I had the 
               <br />
               opportunity of reading in the speech of the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Sherbrooke that “ the 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation had not been a new 
               <br />
               question since the days of Lord DURHAM, 
               <br />
               that only the question of carrying it into ef- 
               <br />
               fect was wanting.” After having read this 
               <br />
               signiﬁcant passage, I set myself to work to 
               <br />
               study and ascertain what were the tendencies 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> spirit which actuated Lord DURHAM, 
               <br />
               and more especially, what object he had in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jiew.</span> I did not take long to convince myself, 
               <br />
               as any Lower Canadian member may do on 
               <br />
               reading his celebrated report, that everything 
               <br />
               he had in view was calculated to secure our 
               <br />
               annihilation as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French-Canadians,</span> and that 
               <br />
               he desired neither more nor less than to sub- 
               <br />
               ject us to a ruling power exclusively English. 
               <br />
               When we see, M r. SPEAKER, the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers from Upper Canada rejoicing over such 
               <br />
               a scheme, and declaring themselves so much 
               <br />
               the more satisﬁed from the fact that they 
               <br />
               would obtain, by this ﬁne stroke of policy, 
               <br />
               more than they had at ﬁrst ho d for, when 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Lain ton (Mr. A. 
               <br />
               MACKENZIE), whilst avowing, as he has al- 
               <br />
               ways done, that his views are but incomplete 
               <br />
               ly expressed in the language which I am 
               <br />
               about to read, there is reason for some little 
               <br />
               alarm. This is what that honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               said in the House the other night :— 
               <br />

               I believe then, sir, in the ﬁrst place, that Con- 
               <br />
               federation is desirable; in the second, that it is 
               <br />

               <br />
               best thing we can get, and this last is perhaps 
               <br />
               the strongest reason of all for accepting it. It is

               pected, at the time when the present Government 
               <br />
               was formed, to bring about a settlement, and I 
               <br />
               do think, sir, it would be the reatest act of mad-

               am not, however, afraid that it will be voted 
               <br />

               justly due to us, that we have obtained our legi-
