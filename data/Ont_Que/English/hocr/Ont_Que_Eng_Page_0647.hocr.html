               to the wishes of Upper Canada. There can- 
               <br />
               not, therefore, be a stronger evidence than 
               <br />
               this of the fact that the question of reform in 
               <br />
               the representation was not laid aside, neither 
               <br />
               had it lost one iota of its importance in the 
               <br />
               minds of the eat majorit of the western 
               <br />
               section. The overnment t at had ventured 
               <br />
               to lay it aside was virtually swept away, and 
               <br />
               another formed who made it an open question. 
               <br />
               This, sir, lies at the very foundation of our 
               <br />
               diﬁculties. It has been the source of our 
               <br />
               diﬁculties, and no doubt would have continued 
               <br />
               to be, had no remedy been provided. I have 
               <br />
               said before on another occasion, and I repeat 
               <br />
               it, that the minds of men in Upper Canada 
               <br />
               were ﬁlled with foreboding as to the future. 
               <br />
               They feared that Lower Canada would resist 
               <br />
               their demands; they feared that Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada would continue to deny to them what 
               <br />
               appeared to them to be palpably just and 
               <br />
               right, and what the end of it all would be 
               <br />
               they did not know. I confess that I shared 
               <br />
               this feeling in common with others; and it 
               <br />
               was a matter of common conversation that 
               <br />
               things could not continue as they were; that 
               <br />
               it was impossible for Upper Canada, with her 
               <br />
               superiority in numbers and in wealth, to 
               <br />
               consent to remain in the united Legislature 
               <br />
               in the inferior position she then occupied. If 
               <br />
               the attempt had been persisted in to deny to 
               <br />
               that section what was so reasonable and just, no 
               <br />
               man could have foretold the serious diﬂiculties 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might.</span> have followed. Hon. gentle-

               men from LowerCauada, who have eXpressed 
               <br />
               an opinion that this question had ceased to 
               <br />
               be considered as of importance in the west, 
               <br />
               manifest a very great ignorance of the char- 
               <br />
               acter, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelings</span> and the intentions of the 
               <br />
               men they had to deal with. My hon friend 
               <br />
               from Brome was one of those who wished to 
               <br />
               make light of our present diﬂiculties. He 
               <br />
               said, towards the close of his speech, that it 
               <br />
               only needed a little patience, that Very little 
               <br />
               was wanted to make everything quite smooth. 
               <br />
               But, sir, even he was obliged to admit that 
               <br />
               a slight measure of parliamentary reform 
               <br />
               was necessary in order to remove the diﬂi- 
               <br />
               culties by which we were surrounded, and 
               <br />
               he evidently intimated his willingness to 
               <br />
               concede it. And there have been hints 
               <br />
               thrown out by certain Liberal members from 
               <br />
               Lower Canada that it would not be such an 
               <br />
               impossible thing, if we would give up this 
               <br />
               scheme of union, for Upper Canada to ob- 
               <br />
               tain her right position, and what she has so 
               <br />
               justly claimed. But if this be their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling,</span> 
               <br />
               I ask them why they did not come boldly

               <br />
               hon. friend from Brome—and I regret ex- 
               <br />
               tremely that he is not in his place—why did 
               <br />
               he not, in 1862, speak of concessions to 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, instead of, by vote and by 
               <br />
               argument, do his best to convince us that 
               <br />
               we could expect no relief from him 
               <br />
               and from those acting with him, from 
               <br />
               the same section. Very different language 
               <br />
               is now used by Lower Canada members of 
               <br />
               all shades of opinion, to that we have been 
               <br />
               accustomed to hear. Those who now admit 
               <br />
               the justice of the demands of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               and yet in time ast have resisted them, 
               <br />
               ought to be the t to Oppose this scheme, 
               <br />
               which settles the diﬁiculty on a basis accepted 
               <br />
               by all. The honorable member for Brome 
               <br />
               and the British members from Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               who resisted the reform asked for, ought to 
               <br />
               be foremost in supporting the scheme before 
               <br />
               us; and I am sorry to ﬁnd that my hon. 
               <br />
               friend appears to me to occupy a very 
               <br />
               inconsistent position. Had he always 
               <br />
               advocated parliamentary reform, he might 
               <br />
               with consistency have opposed the preposed 
               <br />
               union. In some such position, and even in 
               <br />
               a stronger point of view, do the French 
               <br />
               Liberal members appear to be. They were 
               <br />
               the professed allies of the Reform party in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, and were, of course, aware 
               <br />
               that no reform government could stand that 
               <br />
               did not deal with the representation question. 
               <br />
               Now, it appears to me, sir, that the Liberal 
               <br />
               French party have been singularly untrue 
               <br />

               COL. HAULTAIN—I repeat, sir, that the 
               <br />
               Liberal French members have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pursued</span> a 
               <br />
               course that if continued in, could only have 
               <br />
               terminated as it has done. I speak of what 
               <br />
               has come under my own observation since 
               <br />
               1862. A new Parliament had been convened. 
               <br />
               The question of representative reform had 
               <br />
               attained great prominence. The Reform 
               <br />
               party had spoken distinctly on that question. 
               <br />
               Had their Lower Canada allies contemplated 
               <br />
               a continuance of the alliance, we might 
               <br />
               suppose that they would have forborne 
               <br />
               raising unnecessary diﬂiculties. But, sir, 
               <br />
               what was the course pursued? It will be 
               <br />
               remembered that an amendment to the ad- 
               <br />
               dress was moved, asserting that the principle 
               <br />
               of equal representation was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">essential</span> to the 
               <br />
               union. This was a gratuitous though most 
               <br />
               signiﬁcant expression of the divergence that 
               <br />
               This was made more palpa-
