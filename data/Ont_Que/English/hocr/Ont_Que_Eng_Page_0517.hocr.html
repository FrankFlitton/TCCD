               without observing any rule of equality as to 
               <br />
               their numbers. Indeed, until 1848, equality 
               <br />
               in the representation of the two sections of the 
               <br />
               province in the Cabinet was never seriously 
               <br />
               aimed at. In 1848, from considerations of a 
               <br />
               peculiar character—perhaps more personal than 
               <br />
               political—the usage was commenced, and it has 
               <br />
               since been rsevered in, of having a Premier 
               <br />
               and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub-lifremier,</span> and a Cabinet organized 
               <br />
               under them, respectively, in two sections—of 
               <br />
               course equal in numbers, or as nearly so_as 
               <br />
               possible. And on this usage and in connection 
               <br />
               with it have developed themselves all those 
               <br />
               double majority and double ministry notions 
               <br />
               and practices which again of late have so con- 
               <br />
               stantly been leading us into all manner of 
               <br />
               constitutional diﬁiculties. (Hear, hear. It

               able to command a majority of its sectional 
               <br />
               representation in this House. It was, prac- 
               <br />
               tically, a division of the House, as well as of 
               <br />

               admit, to be sure, that there were two minis-

               <br />
               that already, in Canada, the force of circum- 
               <br />
               stances has been one too many for us, and has 
               <br />
               inﬂicted upon us a system more complex—less 
               <br />

               <br />
               us, as at home, the Constitution makes the 
               <br />
               whole Ministry, collectively, responsible for all 
               <br />
               the sets it performs; but it is well known that 
               <br />
               here, for all practical purposes, we have for 
               <br />
               years had our Ministry acting by two sections 
               <br />
               —each section with a chief of its own, to a 
               <br />
               large extent a policy of its own, and the 
               <br />
               responsibility of leading and governing a 
               <br />
               section of this House of its own. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) We have been federalising our Con- 
               <br />
               stitution after a very new and anomalous 
               <br />
               fashion ever since 1848, and by that, more 
               <br />
               than by anything else, have been getting our-

               this respect? As we have seen, it starts with 
               <br />
               a principle, as to the election of the House of 
               <br />
               Commons, which must involve the straying 
               <br />
               on the ﬂoor of that House, not of a set of 
               <br />
               members of Parliament coming there to judge 
               <br />
               and to act each for the whole of British North 
               <br />
               America, but of a certain ﬁxed number of 
               <br />
               Upper Canadians, a certain ﬁxed number of 
               <br />
               Lower Canadians, a certain ﬁxed number of

               <br />
               province. (Hear, hear.) If we ever getall these 
               <br />
               territories laid out into provinces, we are to 
               <br />
               have just so many sections, numerically most 
               <br />
               unequal, upon the ﬂoor of this House, and 
               <br />
               the only abiding distinctions between mem- 
               <br />
               bers will be those represented by the territor- 
               <br />
               ial lines between their provinces. The Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Council, we have seen, will not be the 
               <br />
               check which these sections will require. The 
               <br />
               Executive Council has ot to be that check, 
               <br />
               and in the Executive ‘ouncil these sections 
               <br />
               will have to reproduce themselves. Apart 
               <br />
               from the provinces or vast territory to the 
               <br />
               west of us, we shall thus have our six such 
               <br />
               sections on the ﬂoor of the Commons House, 
               <br />
               with their six corresponding sections in the 
               <br />
               Executive Council, and six parliamentary 
               <br />
               majorities to be worked together, if possible, 
               <br />
               while hitherto we have found our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">two</span> sections 
               <br />
               and two majorities one too many. Our eon- 
               <br />
               stitutional diﬂiculties, I repeat, are referable 
               <br />
               to that very practice, and so it is proposed 
               <br />
               that we should try a system three times—and 
               <br />
               more than three times—more complex still.

               such a system, shall have managed to carry
