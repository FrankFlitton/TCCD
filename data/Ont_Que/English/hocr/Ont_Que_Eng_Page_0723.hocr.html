               HON. MR. HOLTON—I am obliged to 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman for his courteous 
               <br />
               answer. I think it is, on the whole, a satis- 
               <br />
               factory answer, because the answer plainly 
               <br />
               implies this, that without the concurrence 
               <br />
               of the Lower Provinces this measure cannot 
               <br />
               go on. That is the plain implication. We 
               <br />
               know well that we shall not have the con- 
               <br />
               currence of the Lower Provinces, and there- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘fore</span> it is absurd to ask this House to vote a 
               <br />
               measure which the honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               themselves, as they have risen one after 
               <br />
               another in the course of this debate, have 
               <br />
               declared to be an imperfect measure—a 
               <br />
               measure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compromise—not</span> such a measure 
               <br />
               as they, in many respects, desired and advo- 
               <br />
               cated, but a measure which they had con- 
               <br />
               curred in for the purpose of inducing the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces to become parties to it. 
               <br />
               Why, I ask, should this House be called 
               <br />
               upon to vote for the objectionable features 
               <br />
               of a scheme, when there is no longer any 
               <br />
               reason for such a vote—when it is admitted 
               <br />
               that the Lower Provinces, for whose sake 
               <br />
               these objectionable features were introduced, 
               <br />
               will not consent and cannot be coerced into 
               <br />
               it? (Hear, hear.) The Hon. Presidentot the 
               <br />
               Council told the people of Toronto, at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tie</span>

               banquet recently held there, that he was

               entirely opposed to the new constitution of 
               <br />

               posed it in the Conference. We know also 
               <br />
               that that feature of the scheme is very objec- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Hon. President of the Council has destroyed 
               <br />
               that party, and it is not, perhaps, rightto 
               <br />
               speak of it as the Liberal party any longer- 
               <br />

               <br />
               once ranged themselves together, in Upper 
               <br />

               <br />
               The Hon. Presidentof the Council stated,thst

               as representing in the Conference the Liberal 
               <br />
               party of Upper Canada—the Liberal party of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada having no representation in 
               <br />
               the Conference at all—as representing the 
               <br />
               Liberal party of Upper Canada, the party 
               <br />
               from that section which is in a large ma-

               jority in this House, the honorable gentle- 
               <br />

               <br />
               feature of the scheme—a feature which is 
               <br />
               known to be as unpalatable to a large 
               <br />
               majority of this House as it is to the hon.

               gentleman himself. I merely mention this 
               <br />
               to illustrate my argument. Why should 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, who were disposed to accept 
               <br />
               this scheme as a whole, notwithstanding 
               <br />
               these objectionable features—who were dis- 
               <br />
               posed to accept it, on the grounds set forth 
               <br />
               by their leaders, as ameasure of compromise 
               <br />
               —why, I ask, should they now be called
