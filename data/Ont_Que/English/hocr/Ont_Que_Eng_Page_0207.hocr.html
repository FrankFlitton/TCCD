               vides a means of forming a great people, and 
               <br />
               of raising us to a position in which we may 
               <br />
               take a place among the nations of the globe. 
               <br />
               But if into that people, by the Constitution 
               <br />
               itself, the seeds of discord are introduced, 
               <br />
               will any one believe that it would not be 
               <br />
               better to live apart, as at the present time, 
               <br />
               than to live together with disunion in our 
               <br />
               midst? It was also stated that on entering 
               <br />
               into the Confederation we should have to 
               <br />
               reduce our import duties in order that our 
               <br />
               tariﬂ' might agree with that of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces. But, as a sequence of that 
               <br />
               statement, we must enquire upon what the 
               <br />
               effect of that reduction of duties will fall. 
               <br />
               For my part, I am of opinion that the deﬁcit 
               <br />
               which that reduction of our revenue will 
               <br />
               produce will have to be ﬁlled up by the 
               <br />
               agriculture and industry of Canada. By 
               <br />
               setting this Confederation going, in order to 
               <br />
               overcome secondary diﬁculties, we shall be 
               <br />
               working out the interests of the English 
               <br />
               dealers by reducing the import duties one- 
               <br />
               half. And who will provide the balance 
               <br />
               which we shall have to ﬁnd in order to meet 
               <br />
               our expen .iture? The agriculturist and 
               <br />
               the artisan of this country, who will be made 
               <br />
               to meet that balance by direct taxation. 
               <br />
               The Lower Provinces are not agricultural 
               <br />
               countries, and we are told that we shall 
               <br />
               barter our ﬂour for the produce of their 
               <br />
               mines and their forests. But I am of opin- 
               <br />
               ion that it is not by enacting political mea- 
               <br />
               sures that the course of trade will be 
               <br />
               changed. Let England abandon Canada at 
               <br />
               once, and even with Confederation, our pro- 
               <br />
               ducts will always go to England, because it 
               <br />
               is our most advantageous market, and will 
               <br />
               always continue to be so. So also will it be 
               <br />
               with New Brunswick and N ova Scotia; that 
               <br />
               is to say, the products of their mines will 
               <br />
               continue to seek the United States markets, 
               <br />
               because those provinces now have commer- 
               <br />
               cial relations with the United States. These 
               <br />
               Provinces will follow the general laws of 
               <br />
               commercial transactions in going to the 
               <br />
               United States, exactly as we 0 to Europe 
               <br />
               to obtain there the goods whic we require, 
               <br />
               and to dispose of our products in return. 
               <br />
               But to return to the question of the tariff; 
               <br />
               I say that we must needs come to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that the deﬁcit created by the lower- 
               <br />
               ing of the tariﬁ' will fall on _the agriculture 
               <br />
               and industry of the country, and that an 
               <br />
               inferior ositiou is ascribed to them in 
               <br />
               the Con ederation. If the import duties 
               <br />
               are reduced from ten to eleven per cent. 
               <br />

         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 1878 643 3373 5207">

               our manufactures will be denuded of allI 
               <br />
               their proﬁt, and we shall prevent capitalists 
               <br />
               from establishing themselves in Canada. 
               <br />
               This will be an immediate consequence of 
               <br />
               Confederation. I have heard it said that 
               <br />
               the Protestants of Lower Canada ought to 
               <br />
               be satisﬁed with their prospects for the 
               <br />
               future, because we have always acted with 
               <br />
               liberality towards them. But that is no 
               <br />
               guarantee for them, for we would not con- 
               <br />
               tent ourselves with a mere promise to act 
               <br />
               liberally, if we considered that our interest or 
               <br />
               our institutions were threatened by a ma- 
               <br />
               jority differing in race and religion from 
               <br />
               ourselves; and in any case that is not the 
               <br />
               way to ensure the peace of the country. If 
               <br />
               we establish this principle, we should say to 
               <br />
               the Catholics of Upper Canada that they 
               <br />
               ought to be satisﬁed with the lot which we 
               <br />
               provide for them. When we make a. Consti- 
               <br />
               tution, we must in the ﬁrst place settle the 
               <br />
               political and religious questions which divide 
               <br />
               the pepulatious for whom the Constitution is 
               <br />
               devised; because it is a well known fact, that 
               <br />
               it is religious diﬂ'erences which have caused 
               <br />
               the greatest troubles and the greatest diﬁ- 
               <br />
               culties which have agitated the people in 
               <br />
               days gone by. We must learn to prevent 
               <br />
               them for the future. When we observe a man 
               <br />
               like the hon. member (Hon. Sir N. F. BEL— 
               <br />
               LEAD) acknowledge that we do not agree 
               <br />
               with the Irish, despite the identity of our 
               <br />
               religious belief, it may easily be foreseen 
               <br />
               that difﬁculties will arise with populations 
               <br />
               differing from us in origin and belief. We 
               <br />
               are told to vote Confederation ﬁrst, and that 
               <br />
               the details will be arranged at a subsequent 
               <br />
               period ; that a measure will then be brought 
               <br />
               down to regulate the sectional or sectarian 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties. I am quite willing to admit 
               <br />
               that such a measure will be presented ; but, 
               <br />
               should not the majority choose to adOpt it, 
               <br />
               we should then be compelled to remain with 
               <br />
               the seeds of trouble and dissension, which 
               <br />
               the House will not have succeeded in eradi- 
               <br />
               cating, implanted among us. It is also 
               <br />
               asked what kind of Local Government we 
               <br />
               shall have; but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> will make 
               <br />
               no statement respecting it until <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ccnfedera.</span> 
               <br />
               tion is voted. What kind of a Constitution, 
               <br />
               and what Governor we shall have? What 
               <br />
               Governor? Perha s that is where the great 
               <br />
               secret lies, for I be ieve that for some time 
               <br />
               past the idea or the hope of being governor 
               <br />
               has ﬁlled the head of more than one politi- 
               <br />
               cal man. What is to be the amount of the 
               <br />
               Governor’s salary? These are so many
