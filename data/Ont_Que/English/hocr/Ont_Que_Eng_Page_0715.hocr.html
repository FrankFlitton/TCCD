               I am not aware that any diﬂiculty of this 
               <br />
               nature has ever arisen, and so far as relates

               are diﬂ‘erently constituted, and because our

               are wretched arguments, and he has even 
               <br />
               been reduced to s litting hairs since he has

               <br />
               has been ill. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter)</span> The honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga considered my ﬁrst 
               <br />
               pamphlet much better written than my last, 
               <br />
               doubtless for the same reason that he con- 
               <br />
               sidered my speeches of 1858 greatly superior 
               <br />
               to that which I delivered here the other day. 
               <br />
               He thinks now as I thought in 1858; he 
               <br />
               has therefore receded by six years. Allud- 
               <br />
               ing to my speech of the 2nd March, he 
               <br />
               appears to impute it to me as a crime, that I 
               <br />
               yielded to the inﬂuence of my relations with 
               <br />
               the delegates from the Maritime Provinces, 
               <br />
               and that under the action of that inﬂuence, 
               <br />
               I changed my opinions respecting Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation. I admit the fact of that inﬂuence 
               <br />
               legitimately exercised. We lose nothing by 
               <br />
               coming in contact with intelligent men. 
               <br />
               The members ot this House, who last autumn 
               <br />
               visited those provinces, returned amazed at 
               <br />
               what they had seen. They were convinced 
               <br />
               that those provinces were possessed of great 
               <br />
               resources. Contact with the most eminent 
               <br />
               men of those countries could be productive 
               <br />
               of no evil, and the hon. member would have 
               <br />
               gained by it. Perhaps if he had experi- 
               <br />
               enced that contact, he would not to-day have 
               <br />
               recourse to the means which he is employing 
               <br />
               to cast discredit on the scheme of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, and to cause it tobe rejected. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Among those men there are some who 
               <br />
               are endowed with magniﬁcent abilities, and at 
               <br />
               whose side I should be happy and proud to 
               <br />
               sit in a deliberative assembly. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Yes, we were gainers by coming in contact 
               <br />

               then the Government was the worst I 
               <br />
               had ever seen. Perhaps I was right at the

               time, butI could not say the same thing 
               <br />

               <br />
               and dishonest Government, it was certainly 
               <br />
               that of 1863, and accordingly it succumbed

               occurred in 1862, who ventures to hope

               to see the hon. member return to power? 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) He told us that it was not 
               <br />
               expedient to change the Constitution without 
               <br />
               ﬁrst having recourse to an appeal to the 
               <br />
               pe0ple. But the ﬁrst question to be decided 
               <br />
               is the constitutional question, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qua-</span> 
               <br />
               tion of expediency and convenience comes 
               <br />
               after. He talks to us without ceasing of 
               <br />
               consulting the electors. His doing so may 
               <br />
               be easily understood ; on the elections rest 
               <br />
               his only hopes. Always deceived in every 
               <br />
               election, he hopes, but hopes in vain, that 
               <br />
               the next will give him the victory. He 
               <br />
               oughtto know, however, that our Constitution 
               <br />
               is constructed upon the model of the British 
               <br />
               Constitution, and that members do not and 
               <br />
               cannot receive an imperative order from their 
               <br />
               electors. Each representative, although 
               <br />
               elected by one particular county, represents 
               <br />
               the whole country, and his legislative re- 
               <br />
               s onsibility extends to the whole of it. If, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> I am convinced that any legislative 
               <br />
               measure presented by the Government or by 
               <br />
               a member of this House, is of a nature to 
               <br />
               save Lower Canada, I must vote for that 
               <br />
               measure, even though my constituents are 
               <br />
               opposed to it. My electors might punish 
               <br />
               me afterwards, but they could not impose 
               <br />
               upon me duties which I consider to be en- 
               <br />
               tirely beyond their jurisdiction, and to relate 
               <br />
               to the very Constitution of the country. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) If there are any members 
               <br />

               <br />
               rests of Lower Canada, even if the majority 
               <br />
               of our people think otherwise, it is their duty 
               <br />
               to oppose it on precisely the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> principle.
