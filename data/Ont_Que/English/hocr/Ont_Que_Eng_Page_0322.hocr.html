               HON. MB. CAMPBELL—My hon. friend 
               <br />
               eavils at the question of authority. But he 
               <br />
               must know that the Parliament of this country 
               <br />
               had sanctioned the formation of a Govern- 
               <br />
               ment with the avowed intention of bringing 
               <br />
               about Federation; and therefore there was 
               <br />
               authority for what was done from the people 
               <br />
               of this country. But my hon. friend is a mon- 
               <br />
               archist, and recognizes other sources of au- 
               <br />
               thority than those vested in the people. 
               <br />
               There is the authority of the Crown ; and on 
               <br />
               this point I would beg to refer him to the 
               <br />
               d teh which was received on this subject 
               <br />
               from the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 
               <br />
               It says : “ With the sanction of the Crown, 
               <br />
               and upon the invitation of the Governor— 
               <br />
               General, men of every province, chosen by 
               <br />
               the respective Lieutenant-Governors, without 
               <br />
               distinction of party, assembled to consider 
               <br />
               questions of the utmost interest to every sub- 
               <br />
               ject of the Queen, of whatever race or faith, 
               <br />
               resident in those provinces, and have arrived 
               <br />
               at a conclusion destined to exercise a most 
               <br />
               important inﬂuence upon the future welfare 
               <br />
               of the whole community.” So here was the 
               <br />
               sanction of the Crown so far as the action of 
               <br />
               the other provinces was concerned; whilst 
               <br />
               our own Parliament directly sanctioned the 
               <br />
               formation of a Government having this object 
               <br />
               in view.

               admitted—I never in the least disputed—- 
               <br />
               that the Conference was properly, legally,

               believe, after this debate has been concluded 
               <br />
               in both Chambers, and the full report of it 
               <br />
               which is being prepared has gone forth to 
               <br />
               the country, the people will be in a position 
               <br />
               to form a correct judgment on the merits of

               the case. They will then have before them

               perhaps all that could be said on one side or

               the other, and if they cannot then form a 
               <br />
               reliable judgment, it will be their own fault. 
               <br />
               There is no reason why this House ‘Bhonld

               <br />
               the debates as is being done, if the people 
               <br />
               are not to be consulted ; for unless they are 
               <br />
               to be asked for a decision—if the scheme is 
               <br />
               to be carried into effect without consulting 
               <br />
               them—where is the necessity for placing be— 
               <br />
               fore them speeches and arguments which 
               <br />
               which will only have the effect of disturbing 
               <br />
               their minds? In ad lition to saying that 
               <br />
               the plan has not emanated from the people, I 
               <br />
               contend that it has not even emanated from 
               <br />
               the representatives of the people. Had these 
               <br />
               resolutions been framed by our own Govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               measures into our Legislature, and there dis- 
               <br />
               cussed, voted upon, and adopted by the ma- 
               <br />
               jority, I should not think it necessary that 
               <br />
               there should be any reference to the people, 
               <br />
               though perhaps I might still think such refer- 
               <br />
               ence desirable. But the fact is that the repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of the peeple have not been con- 
               <br />
               sulted in the matter ; there has been no way 
               <br />
               left open whereby they can eﬁ'ect the 
               <br />

               sume honorable gentlemen will concur with 
               <br />
               me that if, after all that has been stated, 
               <br />
               the country should not desire the change— 
               <br />
               if the people at large should think they are 
               <br />
               really paying too much and making too con- 
               <br />
               siderable a sacriﬁce to secure the anticipated 
               <br />
               beneﬁts of this measure—it ought not to be 
               <br />
               passed. (ﬂeur.) Where, I would ask, is the 
               <br />
               danger to be apprehended in submitting the 
               <br />
               measure to the country? Danger is to be 
               <br />
               apprehended from forcing upon the people a 
               <br />
               measure of which they may not approve. 
               <br />
               (Hear.) But nothing can be endangered by 
               <br />
               submitted this project to the peeple, if,as has 
               <br />
               been so strongly asserted and as I believe, 
               <br />
               the majority are in favor of it. If I thought 
               <br />
               an immediate reference to the people would 
               <br />
               jeepurdise the scheme, rhaps I might
