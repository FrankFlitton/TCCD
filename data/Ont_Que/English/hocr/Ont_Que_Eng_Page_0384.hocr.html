               a single Ieg'mlature, would render it impracticable. 
               <br />
               Then the honorable member had changed 
               <br />
               his opinion on this subject! I do not say

               <br />
               always acted with the same object in view——

               <br />
               based on population. Eibw, then, does it

               vent our being placed in a position of infe- 
               <br />
               riority ? But the object of the Confederation 
               <br />
               is not merely to do away with existing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dim-</span> 
               <br />
               culties. It has become a necessity, because 
               <br />
               we have become suﬁciently great,—because 
               <br />
               we have become strong, rich, and powerful 
               <br />
               enough ,—because our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">products</span> are numerous 
               <br />
               enough and considerable cnough,—beeause 
               <br />
               our population has become large enough to 
               <br />
               allow of our aspiring to another position, and 
               <br />
               of our seeking to obtain an outlet through 
               <br />
               some seaport for our products. At the pre— 
               <br />
               sent day we stand in a position of vassalage 
               <br />
               to the United States, with respect to the 
               <br />
               exportation of our products to Europe; we 
               <br />
               are at their mercy. If we should have any 
               <br />
               diﬁculty with our neighbors to-morrow, they 
               <br />
               would close the Portland route to us, and we 
               <br />
               should ﬁnd ourselves, during nearly seven 
               <br />
               months in the year, cut off from all commu- 
               <br />
               nication with the seaboard, save by means 
               <br />
               of the usual long and diﬁcult land journey. 
               <br />
               This is not a tenable position, nor one worthy 
               <br />
               of a people such as that which inhabits the 
               <br />
               Provinces of British North America. It is 
               <br />
               a position which must be emerged from, for 
               <br />
               such is the interest of Canada, of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, and of the Western States. The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Hochelaga told us that 
               <br />
               he was in favor of a plan which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> settlc

               existing diﬁculties, and would place Lower 
               <br />
               Canada in a suitable position ; but he never 
               <br />
               told us what that plan was. The only thing 
               <br />
               he ever proposed was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his.</span> plan of 1869 for

               <br />
               that plan would only have settled one diﬂi-

               others, that respecting our communication 
               <br />
               with the seaboard. That plan, for instance, 
               <br />
               would not have allowed us to construct the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway; for it is almost im- 
               <br />
               possible that so great an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enterprise</span> should 
               <br />
               succeed unless it is in the hands of a great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">central</span> power, and if it is necessary toconsult

               ﬁve or six governments before commencing

               it. But the question of the Confederation of 
               <br />
               the two Canadas is not the only one which 
               <br />
               is presented as a means of escaping from our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculties;</span> there are diﬂ'erent plans which I 
               <br />
               shall enumerate. Some propose, for instance, 
               <br />
               that we should remain in the position in 
               <br />
               which we now are; others wish for annexa- 
               <br />
               tion to the United States; some would, per- 
               <br />
               haps, be in favor of complete independence; 
               <br />
               others would favor a Confederation of the two 
               <br />
               Canadas ; and, lastly, the Confederation of all 
               <br />
               the British North American Provinces is 
               <br />
               proposed. Well, let us cursorily examine 
               <br />
               these various propositions. It may be that 
               <br />
               there are some members who are desirous 
               <br />
               that we should remain as we are. The 
               <br />
               honorable members for Hochelaga and 
               <br />
               Lotbiniere (_ Hon. Mr. DORION and Mr. JOLY) 
               <br />
               consider our position an excellent one, 
               <br />
               and so, in their speeches, they have 
               <br />
               told us. They consider that we are ex- 
               <br />
               tremely prosperous, and that We have 
               <br />
               nothing to wish for. For my part, I consider 
               <br />
               that in our present position we are under a 
               <br />
               great disadvantage ; it is that if we remain 
               <br />
               isolated and alone, we cannot communicate 
               <br />
               with the metropolis, except through the 
               <br />
               United States; if we remain alone we can 
               <br />
               aspire to no position, we can give rein to no 
               <br />
               ambition as a people. Again, we have at 
               <br />
               the present time as many systems of judica- 
               <br />
               ture as we have provinces; with Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, on the contrary, this defect will be 
               <br />
               removed, and there will be but two systems: 
               <br />
               one for Lower Canada, because our laws are 
               <br />
               different from those of the other provinces, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bt</span> cause we are a separate people, and because 
               <br />
               we do not choose to have the laws of the 
               <br />
               other pepulations—and the other for the‘ 
               <br />
               remainder of the Confederation. All the 
               <br />
               other provinces having the same laws, or 
               <br />
               their system of law being derived from one 
               <br />
               and the same source, may have one and the 
               <br />
               same system of judicaturc; and, in fact, a 
               <br />
               resolution of the Conference allows them to 
               <br />
               resolve that they will have one code and one 
               <br />
