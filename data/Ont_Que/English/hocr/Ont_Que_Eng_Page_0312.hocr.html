               presœt Government of Canada was formed for

               the very purpose of considering and submitl in

               from Niagara again takes shelter under the 
               <br />
               statement that what the Government proposed 
               <br />

               <br />
               federation of Canada alone, and that the bring-

               ing of all the provinces into the Confederation 
               <br />
               was only a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wound</span> idea. The honorable

               of the case is a mere pretence. Everybody

               knew that the Government would endeavor to

               of these details which he does not hap n ully
