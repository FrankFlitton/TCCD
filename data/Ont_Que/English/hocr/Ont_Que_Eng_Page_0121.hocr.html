               Now, sir, the United States are in the same po- 
               <br />
               sition as we are in respectto this inland trafﬁc, 
               <br />
               and they include it in their returns as is done 
               <br />
               here. And what, sir, do you think is the 
               <br />
               difference between their tonnage and ours ? 
               <br />
               Why ours is over twelve millions and theirs 
               <br />
               is but sixteen millions. There are not four 
               <br />
               millions of tons of difference between the 
               <br />

               lected that the United States have had 
               <br />
               seventy years start of us. As regards 
               <br />
               France, the whole amount of shipping that 
               <br />
               entered and left the rts of that great 
               <br />
               country in one year was ut 8,456,734 tons— 
               <br />
               four millions of tons less than that of the 
               <br />
               British American Provinces. May we not 
               <br />
               then, when this union is accomplished, fairly 
               <br />
               claim to be the third maritime state of the 
               <br />
               world; and may we not even entertain the 
               <br />
               hepe that, at some future day, a still higher 
               <br />

               days of puberty have been passed and the 
               <br />
               strength of manhood has been reached ? I 
               <br />
               ask honorable gentlemen, in looking at these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures, to consider what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> must be

               parison with the commerce of all the great

               maritime states ? Will it not strengthen our 
               <br />
               position abroad ?-will it not give us a degree 
               <br />
               of inﬂuence and importance to have it known 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               (Cheers) But, in the fourth place, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, I go for a union of the provinces, 
               <br />
               because it will give a new start to immigration 
               <br />
               into our count . It will bring us out anew 
               <br />
               prominently before the world—it will turn ear- 
               <br />
               nest attention to our resources, and bring to 
               <br />
               our shores a stream of immigration greater, 
               <br />
               and of a better class, than we ever had before. 
               <br />
               I was in England when the ﬁrst public an- 
               <br />
               nouncement of this scheme was made, and 
               <br />
               witnessed, with pleasure, the marked impres- 
               <br />
               sion it produced. You could not go abroad, 
               <br />
               you could not enter into any company, in an 
               <br />
               class of society, where Canada or the British 
               <br />
               American Provinces were mentioned, but you 
               <br />
               heard this union movement spoken of almost 
               <br />
               with enthusiasm. And I say it is desirable 
               <br />
               that this scheme should not be delayed, but 
               <br />
               be carried through promptly and vigorously. 
               <br />
               I hesitate not to say that it should be accom- 
               <br />
               panied with a vigorous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂ‘ort</span> to give a new 
               <br />
               impetus to our industrial enterprises, to open 
               <br />
               up fresh lands for settlement, and to cheapen 
               <br />
               the transport of our produce to the sea-board. 
               <br />
               With the consummation of this union, I trust 
               <br />
               we will have a new immigration and a new 
               <br />
               land settlement policy—that we will ascertain 
               <br />
               every lot of land we actually own, so that a 
               <br />
               printed list may be placed in the hands of every 
               <br />
               immigrant—that the etty price we have been 
               <br />
               heretofore exacting wrll no longer be exacted, 
               <br />

               <br />
               very few shrewd men in Upper Canada who 
               <br />

               <br />

               of which keeps him in trouble perhaps for 
               <br />
               years, and retards the progress of the country.
