               Mr. SPEAKER, that I cannot understand

               why we should concede to-day what we 
               <br />
               refused in 1860. It is true that I do not 
               <br />

               <br />

               to-day than to be broken to-morrow ; but 
               <br />
               when I study the history of the past, when 
               <br />
               Ilook at things as they are, and look for— 
               <br />
               ward to the future which is now proposed 
               <br />
               for us, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> only see in the scheme of Con-

               <br />
               than the disease, and which, instead of 
               <br />
               removing the diﬁiculties it is proposed to 
               <br />
               eradicate, will only have the eﬂect of pro-

               ducing results the most unfavorable to 
               <br />
               the peace and prosperity of our country. 
               <br />
               I statel then, Mr. SPEAKER, that the 
               <br />
               question of representation by population, 
               <br />
               which has been the principal cause of the Con-

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">golitical</span> programme of the MACDONALD-

               Canada majority, the leaders of which. 
               <br />
               throughout their whole political career, had 
               <br />
               so loudly demanded this concession in favor 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada, had bound itself not to 
               <br />
               raise that exciting question within the halls 
               <br />
               of the Legislature, at least during the exist-

               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I stated that, thanks to the 
               <br />
               patriotic ﬁrmness of that Administration, 
               <br />
               Lower Canada was enabled for two years to 
               <br />

               <br />
               uring two sessions the question of represen-

               <br />
               of Upper Canada. (Hear, hear.) It was 
               <br />
               at that period that the honorable member 
               <br />
               for South Oxford asked for a committee to 
               <br />

               must say that I felt pained at his position

               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, the House witnessed an act 
               <br />
               which I do not desire to characterize now ; 
               <br />
               we saw the Administration which had the 
               <br />
               courage to chain down the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">monster</span> of re- 
               <br />
               presentation by population, overthrown by a 
               <br />
               French-Canadian majority! (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Yes, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MLSPEAKER,</span> that Liberal government, 
               <br />
               which had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘orded</span> so much security to our 
               <br />
               institutions by maintaining intact our present 
               <br />
               Constitution,was defeated by a French-Cana- 
               <br />
               dian majority of this House. I do not intend, 
               <br />
               when I say this, to attack my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fellow-</span> 
               <br />
               countrymen, far from it ; but I wish to 
               <br />
               trace the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliamentary</span> history of our 
               <br />
               country, and I do not hesitate to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assert</span> that 
               <br />
               that vote gave a fatal blow to our in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence as French-Canadians, and that 
               <br />
               posterity will record that vote, which is now 
               <br />
               a matter of history, as a fatal act by which 
               <br />
               our public men sacriﬁced to party spirit 
               <br />
               the dearest of our interests. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I fearlessly assert, Mr. SPEAKER, that for 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen years our affairs had not been admi- 
               <br />
               nistered by men more sincerely devoted to 
               <br />
               our interests and better able- to protect the 
               <br />
               political liberties, the interests and the 
               <br />
               institutions of Lower Canada. What have 
               <br />
               we seen during the past ﬁfteen years in this 
               <br />
               House? We have witnessed party appeals 
               <br />
               to prejudices and the most insulting person- 
               <br />
               alities; and, in fact, the lowering of the 
               <br />
               moral status of our national representatives, 
               <br />
               as the natural result. We have seen the 
               <br />
               men best qualiﬁed to enforce, on the ﬂoor of 
               <br />
               this House, the rights of the people, refusing 
               <br />
               to come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forward</span> at elections, because they 
               <br />
               saw that the position of a member 01 Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment no longer conferred that degree of 
               <br />
               dignit and position which made it an object 
               <br />
               of am ition in better times. We have seen 
               <br />
               men of eminence, who had labored in behalf 
               <br />
               of the interests of their constituents for 
               <br />
               manylong years, abandoning their political
