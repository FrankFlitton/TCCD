               $80,000,000, or about 820 for each inhabi- 
               <br />
               tant. In the neighboring republic, from a

               statement made at the close of last year, we 
               <br />

               take a glance over the whole of the British 
               <br />
               Colonial Empire. England has thirty-eight 
               <br />
               colonies, containing ten millions of people. 
               <br />
               Six millions of these are white and four mil- 
               <br />
               lions are black. Of the six millions of white 
               <br />
               people, four millions are inhabitants of 
               <br />
               these British American Colonies. We have 
               <br />
               for Canada, N ova Scotia and New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               no less than ﬁve millions of tons’ capacity of 
               <br />
               sea-going vessels, and on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lakes</span> seven 
               <br />
               millions, making a total tonnage of'twelve 
               <br />
               millions, which, in point of tonnage, places 
               <br />
               us as the third power in the world. No

               other nations but England and _the United 
               <br />
               States possess a larger tonnage than that.
