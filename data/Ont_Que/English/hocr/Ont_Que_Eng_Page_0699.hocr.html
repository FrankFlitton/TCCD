               HON. Ma. DORION—Mr. SPEAKER, the 
               <br />
               intelligence received from New Brunswick 
               <br />
               since the last sitting has caused the question 
               <br />
               of Confederation, now under discussion, to 
               <br />
               lose much of its interest. Every one is now 
               <br />
               convinced that it is a question which no 
               <br />
               longer has any real existence, and which 
               <br />
               may safely be shelved for some time to come 
               <br />
               at all events. I deem it, however, to be my 
               <br />
               duty to make a few observations in reply to 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Montmorency, and to 
               <br />
               allude in passing to the speech of the Hon. 
               <br />
               Solicitor General East (Honorable Mr. 
               <br />
               LANGEVIN). The honorable member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency began his speech by saying 
               <br />
               that the members of this House ought 
               <br />
               to raise their views above all paltry consid- 
               <br />
               erations of a personal or party character, 
               <br />
               and discuss the question of Confederation 
               <br />
               upon its own merits, that thereby its advan- 
               <br />
               tages or disadvantages might be made ap- 
               <br />
               parent. And yet the honorable member has 
               <br />
               devoted at least one-third of his speech to 
               <br />
               calling to mind and discussing what I may 
               <br />
               or may not have said in past times. I have 
               <br />
               already said, and I repeat it, that I defy any 
               <br />
               member of this House to cite a single passage 
               <br />
               from any one of my speeches, or one single 
               <br />
               line of anything Imay have ever written, to 
               <br />
               prove that I have ever been in favor of a 
               <br />
               Confederation of the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces. In order to produce asemblance 
               <br />
               of proof, and with the view of making me 
               <br />
               contradict myself, it has been necessary to 
               <br />
               torture my words, to falsify my speeches, to 
               <br />
               make false translations of them; and even 
               <br />
               then with all the skill that has been used, the 
               <br />
               attempt has been unsuccessful. The speech

               <br />

               two hours in its delivery, was reported in

               sions which it contains. For instance, on

               the occasion of a discussion which has but 
               <br />
               an incidental relation to representation based 
               <br />
               on population, but which relates to a Con- 
               <br />
               federation of the two provinces, I am made 
               <br />
               to say that I have alwa been opposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               representation by pep tion, but that if 
               <br />
               Upper Canada desired to have it, that I was 
               <br />
               ready to concede it. This is nearly the 
               <br />
               contra of what I said on that occasion, for 
               <br />
               I invanably make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my</span> speeches coincide <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> 
               <br />
               my votes; and as have invariably voted 
               <br />
               against every proposition tending to the 
               <br />
               concession of representation based upon 
               <br />
               pepulation, so I have never declared that I 
               <br />
               was in favor of that measure, but on the 
               <br />
               contrary, I have always declared that Lower 
               <br />
               Canada could never consent to such a 
               <br />
               proposition, because it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> no guarantee 
               <br />
               for her institutions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) But 
               <br />
               now that the question of Confederation is 
               <br />
               under discussion, the Mirror report is set

               <br />
               This re ort made me say, in substance, that 
               <br />
               I looks upon the Federal union of Upper
