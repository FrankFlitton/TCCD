               MR. DUN KIN—It is a pity the same lan-

               guage was not addressed to us. In that case, 
               <br />

               your hands would have been, that you should 
               <br />

               <br />
               tention of the House for a moment to a case 
               <br />
               in which thereuudoubtedly was a treaty. I

               speak of the proceedings which eventuated 
               <br />
               in the union between England and Scotland. 
               <br />
               In the reign of Queen ANNE, at the instance 
               <br />
               of the two legislatures, then respectively in- 
               <br />
               dependent—of England on the one hand, 
               <br />
               and of Scotland on the other—Her Majesty 
               <br />
               appointed commissioners to represent each of 
               <br />
               her two states, and they framed what were 
               <br />
               declared to be articles of a treaty. They 
               <br />
               took months to frame those articles; and 
               <br />
               twice in the course of their proceedings Her 
               <br />
               Majesty came down to assist personally at 
               <br />
               their deliberations. Their meeting was an- 
               <br />
               thorized b acts of Parliament; they were 
               <br />
               named by er Majesty; they deliberated for 
               <br />
               months; and the Queen attended their de- 
               <br />
               liberations twice. And after they had en- 
               <br />
               tered into this treaty—so called on the face 
               <br />
               of it—the Parliament of Scotland departed 
               <br />
               from it and insisted on changes which were 
               <br />
               approved of by the Parliament of England, 
               <br />
               and the treaty as thus changed went into op- 
               <br />
               eration. In both parliaments the bills to 
               <br />
               give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> to it passed through every stage; 
               <br />
               originated in Committee of the Whole, and 
               <br />
               had their ﬁrst, second and third readings. 
               <br />
               All was done with the utmost formality; 
               <br />
               and yet there was there unmistakably a 
               <br />
               treaty solemnly made beforehand. Here we 
               <br />
               have an aﬁ'air got up in seventeen days 
               <br />

               <br />
               the sanction of the Crown, and only got that 
               <br />
               sanction afterwards. The document they 
               <br />
