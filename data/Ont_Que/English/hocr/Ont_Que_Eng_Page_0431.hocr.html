               ing the importance of Confederation. If

               I were disposed to follow such tactics,

               I might possibly proﬁt by his advice. But 
               <br />
               I am inclined to overlook a great many

               have every conﬁdence in the present Govern-

               <br />
               justice at the hands of the Lower Canada 
               <br />
               Local Parliament as from any Government 
               <br />
               of United Canada that we ever had. We 
               <br />
               have never yet had occasion to appeal to the 
               <br />
               Protestant majority of Upper Canada for help, 
               <br />
               and if we ever should deem it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proper</span> to do 
               <br />
               so, I have no reason to believe that we should 
               <br />
               receive more attention than our wants re— 
               <br />

               <br />
               hensions of being shut out from the General

               Canada, and our educational rights being 
               <br />
               interfered with, I feel every assurance that 
               <br />
               the spirit of the answers just given will be 
               <br />
               carried out. I will now say a few words
