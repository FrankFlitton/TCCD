               <br />
               diate decision does not amount to much, and 
               <br />
               it certainly does not impose on us the duty 
               <br />
               of hastily taking the whole scheme as it is. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I have endeavoured, hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen, to show that I am guided by an 
               <br />
               honest, earnest desire to advance the interests 
               <br />
               of the count by the course I now propose 
               <br />
               to take in re erence to this amendment, and 
               <br />
               I have endeavored to disabuse the minds of 
               <br />
               those who think that in supporting it I am 
               <br />
               acting in hostility to a scheme which I 
               <br />
               believe will be advantageous to the country, 
               <br />
               but the advantages of which I think cannot 
               <br />
               be secured without referring it to the people. 
               <br />
               I presume it is altogether likely—perhaps I 
               <br />
               may consider it a certainty—that this is to 
               <br />
               be the last time I shall appear as a represen- 
               <br />
               tative in the Council of my country. I am 
               <br />
               anxious, short as my parliamentary career 
               <br />
               has been and is probably destined to be, that 
               <br />
               it should he unsullied by anything that can 
               <br />
               even have the appearance of selﬁshness. I 
               <br />
               am, therefore, unwilling to record a vote 
               <br />
               which might either have the eﬁ'ect of making 
               <br />
               me a member for life, or of helping to take 
               <br />
               away the privilege which my constituents at 
               <br />
               present enjoy, of having a representative in

               HON. MB. BUREAU—It is not my in-

               do not feel justiﬁed in passing over in silence 
               <br />
               the declaration which has just been made by 
               <br />
               the hen. member for Toronto Hun. Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rosa)</span> That gentleman said, with perfect

               <br />
               respecting the organization of the local 
               <br />
               governments, the course would be a bad one; 
               <br />
               for, said he, diﬂicnlties would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">probably</span> arise 
               <br />
               in relation to the matter, whic might result 
               <br />
               in the resignation of several members of the 
               <br />
               present Cabinet. In those few words the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Toronto has furnished the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best</span> argument in favor of the delay for which 
               <br />
               we ask; but such was not his intention. In 
               <br />
               a similar sense, some other hon. members 
               <br />
               have, in my Opinion, exhibited a degree of 
               <br />
               force and logic which is truly remarkable. 
               <br />
               But can it be possible to make a request 
               <br />
               more essentially legitimate in its character 
               <br />
               than that of the hon. member for Niagara? 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">For</span> my part, I do not think so. And indeed,

               it is wished to have voted with such strange 
               <br />
               and imprudent precipitation ? Let us re- 
               <br />
               member that sometimes no diﬂicnlty what-

               ever is raised to devoting an entire session 
               <br />
               to the consideration of a measure of second- 
               <br />
               ary importance. Last year no attempt was 
               <br />
               made to pass a new Militia Bill at railroad 
               <br />
               speed, as it is now proposed to do with the 
               <br />
               measure for Confederation; on the contrary, 
               <br />
               all the time necessary to complete it and to 
               <br />
               examine it in all its aspects was devoted to 
               <br />
               its consideration. And yet, how immense 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between these two measures, 
               <br />
               in regard to their importance and the solemn 
               <br />
               consequences which might result from them ! 
               <br />
               And further, it cannot be denied, the plan 
               <br />
               which it is sought to makeus adept is asyet 
               <br />
               but imperfectly known to the Canadian Le- 
               <br />
               gislature, and the people hardly know its 
               <br />
               outlines, not having yet had time to examine 
               <br />
               into it, so closely have our ministers invested 
               <br />
               it with mystery and secrecy. I consider that 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Tomato showed rather 
               <br />
               too much seal in the cause of his friends 
               <br />
               when he proceeded to make that declaration, 
               <br />
               which was heard by the House with well- 
               <br />
               marked surprise. I am prepared to acknow- 
               <br />
               ledge that in so doing he has done us a very 
               <br />
               great service. I have no doubt whatever, 
               <br />
               in fact. that as we have been told by the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, the disclosing of the organ- 
               <br />
               ization of the local governments during this 
               <br />
               phase of the discussion would, for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Admi-</span> 
               <br />
               nistration of the day, be an act of imprudencc, 
               <br />
               and one which, it is highly probable, would 
               <br />
               subject it to serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁeulties.</span> I am also 
               <br />
               of opinion that one of the diﬁculties, of by 
               <br />
               no means the least importance, which is feared 
               <br />
               is that respecting the distribution or division 
               <br />
               of the partof the public debt which will have - 
               <br />
               to be borne by the diﬁ'erent provinces. In deed 
               <br />
               it may, with very great reason, he asked 
               <br />
               whether it will be possible to come to an un- 
               <br />
               derstanding on this point. With a degree 
               <br />
               of courage worthy of a better cause, the 
               <br />
               Ministry now comes to us and says : “ First 
               <br />
               vote the Address, and afterwards we will lay 
               <br />
               before you the scheme for the organisation
