               from LoWer Canada, and I found that, not- 
               <br />
               withstanding their opposition to the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation, which they were willing to do 
               <br />
               almost anything to defeat, they were still per- 
               <br />
               sistent in denying to Upper Canada a single 
               <br />
               shadow of a hope that her grievances would 
               <br />
               be redressed, if this scheme were rejected, by 
               <br />
               the granting of representation according to

               population. (Hear, hear.) Before coming here, 
               <br />
               too, I entertained the opinion that those hon. 
               <br />
               orable gentlemen from Upper Canada, who 
               <br />
               had fought so long and so uselessly for repre- 
               <br />
               sentation according to population, would join 
               <br />
               with me in endeavoring to get an amendment 
               <br />
               to the scheme before as adopted, giving us a 
               <br />
               Legislative instead of a Federal union. I 
               <br />
               soon found out, however, that there was little 
               <br />
               hope of getting such an amendment carried, 
               <br />
               because nine-tenths of them were determined 
               <br />
               to accept the scheme as it stood, simply be- 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) My hon. friend the member

               more than another chargeable with bringing

               about this state of affairs, it is that honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman. He once held a high and honor-

               <br />
               bein highly popular with his constituents, 
               <br />
               coul well have aﬂorded to have lent a help-

               <br />
               ing the union as it was work satisfactorily. 
               <br />
               I am satisﬁed that when he held the reins of 
               <br />
               power, if he was so anxious for the good-will, 
               <br />
               as well as for the reputation of the great Pro- 
               <br />
               testant and Reform party of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               and so desirous of maintaining and protecting 
               <br />
               the rights which he now desires to have given 
               <br />
               to his friends, he would have used his power 
               <br />
               in the Government and his eloquence in the 
               <br />
               House to obtain even—handed justice for Up- 
               <br />
               per Canada, and to relieve his friends in that 
               <br />
               portion of the province from the difﬁculties 
               <br />
               under which they labored. But, instead of 
               <br />
               doing that, he joined a Government that de- 
               <br />
               nied its members the privilege of voting for 
               <br />
               representation according to population — a 
               <br />
               Government that made it a close question, 
               <br />
               and which, instead of dealing with it as they 
               <br />
               ought to have done, or even giving us reason 
               <br />
               to hope well of the future, took such a course 
               <br />
               in relation to that great question as left a 
               <br />
               dark and dismal future before those who had 
               <br />
               been struggling for their rights bn that ques-

               MR. FERGUS N—Well, whatever may 
               <br />
               have been their privileges, we all know that 
               <br />
               there was nothing done in the matter, al- 
               <br />
               though they might have seen that it would 
               <br />
               be better to come out honestly and say that 
               <br />
               even—handed justice should be done to both 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada. As this was ‘ny 
               <br />
               impression, Mr. SPEAKER, and seeing that no, 
               <br />
               change could be made in the Constitution 
               <br />
               that would beneﬁt Upper Canada, I felt I 
               <br />
               had a duty to perform—I felt that if they 
               <br />
               would not give us a change in the mode we 
               <br />
               desired, it was not for me to say that I would 
               <br />
               play the part of the dog in the manger. I feel 
               <br />
               it would be better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to'have</span> almost any scheme, 
               <br />
               than to endure the diﬂiculties we had labored 
               <br />
               under for so many years past; and I told the 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen from Lower Canada that 
               <br />
               if that were the course they were to pursue, 
               <br />
               they would change my mind to a consid- 
               <br />
               erable extent. Another thing which had a 
               <br />
               peculiar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂ‘ect</span> on my mind, was the report of 
               <br />
               Col. J EBVOIB on the defences of our country. 
               <br />
               It is impossible for me to deny that the 
               <br />
               speeches which have been made in the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish Parliament, expressive of a want of sym- 
               <br />
               pathy with the Canadian people, and of a desire 
               <br />
               to get rid of Canada, have not been pleasant 
               <br />
               to me ; and although I think I have a loyal 
               <br />
               heart, and am bound by powerful obligations 
               <br />
               to maintain British supremacy, I ﬁnd it hard 
               <br />
               that English statesmen should express a wil- 
               <br />
               lingness to shake us off and leave us in the 
               <br />
               power of a foreign nation. (Hear, hear.) But 
               <br />
               Col. J EBVOIS was sent out to ascertain what 
               <br />
               defences were necessary, and what could be 
               <br />
               done to defend this country if at an unfor- 
               <br />
               tunate moment a difﬁculty might arise. When 
               <br />
               I see that his report declares that we have a 
               <br />
               difﬁcult country to defend—that it would take 
               <br />
               a large number of men to put us into a 
               <br />
               condition to defend ourselves—and when I 
               <br />
               see that the British Government, true to its 
               <br />
               real instincts, is resolved to aid us in our de- 
               <br />
               fence—this, I say, has a great effect upon my 
               <br />
               mind, and makes me think it would not be 
               <br />
               my duty, under the circumstances, to refuse 
               <br />
               assent to the Government measure at a mo- 
               <br />
               ment when I feel that the lives and property 
               <br />
               of my constituents, 30,000 in number, are 
               <br />
               open to an attack at any time from the pow- 
               <br />
               erful armies a foreign people might choose to 
               <br />
               bring up against them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Bean)</span> The scheme 
               <br />
               seems to me to be an expensive and trouble-
