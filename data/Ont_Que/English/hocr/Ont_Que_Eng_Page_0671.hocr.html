               have the minds of the people of Canada been 
               <br />

               prospered for a number of years, but political

               shades of opposition. (Hear, hear.) Is it 
               <br />
               too much to ask honorable gentlemen on the

               the liabilities to be assumed by the respective

               <br />
               ignorance on these subjects ? Are the aﬁ'airs 
               <br />
               of the country to continue in the unsettled 
               <br />
               state in which they now are ? Is all legisla-

               tion to remain at a stand-still until the more 
               <br />
               and more doubtful prospect of Confederation 
               <br />
               is realized ? (Hear, hear.) What amount 
               <br />
               of money is required by the Government to 
               <br />
               meet the danger that is said to have suddenly 
               <br />
               threatened us? Are the people not to know

               what preparations are to be made and what 
               <br />
               sums are to be expended in our defence ? I 
               <br />
               am not opposed to any proper measures being 
               <br />
               taken to defend the country, but at the same 
               <br />
               time prudence dictates that we should know

               anything but satisfactory to be told that we

               in our Constitution ; I believed it was capable

               <br />
               aspect of the Confederation question ; and yet 
               <br />
               it appears to me somewhat absurd to proceed 
               <br />
               with the debate, when even the Government 
               <br />
               itself admits the measure to be a failure.

               <br />

               <br />
               agreed on by the Government in June, 1864, 
               <br />
               was certain] not the one carried out at the 
               <br />
               Opening of t ' session, and still less that which 
               <br />
               has just been announced. The policy, as we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd it in a memorandum then communicated 
               <br />
               to the House, was that a measure for the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the two Canadas, with pro- 
               <br />
               visions for the admission of the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, should be brought before the House 
               <br />
               this session. I will give the terms of the 
               <br />
               memorandum, in order that there may be no
