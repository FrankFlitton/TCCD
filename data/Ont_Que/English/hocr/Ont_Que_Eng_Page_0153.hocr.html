               Confederation at all hazards and at all

               consideration, and all the arguments I have 
               <br />
               heard on both sides for the last month, these 
               <br />
               are my inmost convictions on the necessity 
               <br />
               and merits of a measure which alone, 
               <br />
               under Providence, can secure to us social 
               <br />
               order and peace, and rational liberty, and 
               <br />
               all the blessings we now enjoy under 
               <br />
               the mildest Government and the hallowed 
               <br />
               institutions of the freest and happiest 
               <br />
               country in the world.” (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The next motive for union to which I 
               <br />
               shall refer is, that it will strengthen rather 
               <br />
               than weaken the connection with the empire, 
               <br />
               so essential to these rising provinces. Those 
               <br />
               who may be called, if there are any such, 
               <br />
               the anti-unionists, allege, that this scheme 
               <br />
               here submitted will bring separation in its 
               <br />
               train. How, pray? By making these coun- 
               <br />
               tries more important, will you make them 
               <br />
               less desirable as connections to England? 
               <br />
               By making their trade more valuable, will 
               <br />
               you make her more anxious to get rid 
               <br />
               of it ? By reducing their Federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬁ‘</span> will 
               <br />
               you lessen their interest for England ? By 
               <br />
               making them stronger for each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span> other’s 
               <br />
               aid, will you make her less willing to 
               <br />
               discharge a lesser than a greater responsi- 
               <br />
               bility? But if the thing did not answer 
               <br />
               itself, England has answered that she 
               <br />
               “ cordially approves” of our plan of union, 
               <br />
               —and she has always been accounted a pretty 
               <br />
               good judge of her own Imperial interests. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) She does not consider our 
               <br />
               union inimical to those interests. Instead 
               <br />
               of looking upon it with a dark and discourag- 
               <br />
               ing frown, she cheers us on by her most 
               <br />
               cordial approval and bids us a hearty “ God 
               <br />
               speed” in the new path we have chosen to 
               <br />
               enter. (Hear, hear.) But I put it on 
               <br />
               provrncial grounds as well. We are not 
               <br />
               able to go alone, and if we attempted it we 
               <br />
               would almost certainly go to our own 
               <br />
               destruction—so that as we cannot go alone, 
               <br />
               and as we do not desire union with the 
               <br />
               United States, it is the duty of every man to 
               <br />
               do all in his power to strengthen the connec- 
               <br />
               tion with Great Britain. And how shall we 
               <br />
               do it? Is it by compelling the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government to negotiate at Charlottetown, 
               <br />
               for every man and musket required for our 
               <br />
               defence, to negotiate again at Halifax, and 
               <br />
               again at Frederickton, and again at St. 
               <br />
               John, and again at Quebec? Is it by hav- 
               <br />
               ing these ﬁve separate governments that we 
               <br />

               are to render the connection desirable and 
               <br />
               appreciated, or is it by putting the power of 
               <br />
               these colonies into the hands of one General 
               <br />
               Government and making the negotiations 
               <br />

               <br />
               the whole transaction and expediting what- 
               <br />
               ever is to be done between the two countries. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I will content myself, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, with those principal motives to 
               <br />
               union; ﬁrst, that we are in the rapids, and 
               <br />
               must go on ; next that our neighbors will not, 
               <br />
               on their side, let us rest supinely, even if 
               <br />
               we could do so from other causes; and 
               <br />
               thirdly, that by making the united colonies 
               <br />
               more valuable as an ally to Great Britain, we 
               <br />
               shall strengthen rather than weaken the 
               <br />
               Imperial connexion. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> Let me 
               <br />
               now, sir, call your attention to the diﬁiculties, 
               <br />
               past and present, which this great project 
               <br />
               had to encounter, before it reached the 
               <br />
               fortunate stage in which we now ﬁnd it. 
               <br />
               When it was ﬁrst advocated by individuals, 
               <br />
               however eminent, of course it had but scanty 
               <br />
               chance of success. (Hear, hear.) That was 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst stage; when, as in 1822 and 1839, 
               <br />
               it found favor with Downing'street, it excited 
               <br />
               the suspicions of the colonists ; when it was 
               <br />
               identiﬁed with the Quebec and Halifax 
               <br />
               railway project, it shared the fate,—it was 
               <br />
               sacriﬁced to the jealousies and dissensions 
               <br />
               which destroyed that particular undertaking. 
               <br />
               When, as in the case of my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               GALT’s) motion in 1858, and my own motion 
               <br />
               in 1860, the subject was mooted in this 
               <br />
               House by a private member, the Ministry of 
               <br />
               the day could not allow so grave a measure 
               <br />
               to succeed in other bands than their own; 
               <br />
               when, as was the case in 1858, the Ministry 
               <br />
               committed themselves to it, the Opposition 
               <br />
               complained that Parliament had not been 
               <br />
               consulted. When Canada proposed tomove, 
               <br />
               in 1859, Newfoundland alone responded; 
               <br />
               when Nova Scotia moved, in 1860, New 
               <br />
               Brunswick alone agreed to go with her ; at 
               <br />
               all events, Canada did not then consent. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Of late years the language of 
               <br />
               the Colonial Oﬂicc, of Mr. LABOUOHERE, of 
               <br />
               Sir BUsta errou, and of the lamented 
               <br />
               Duke of NEWCASTLE, was substantially : 
               <br />
               “ Agree among yourselves, gentlemen, and 
               <br />
               we will not stand in the way.” Ah ! there 
               <br />
               was the rub—“ Agree among yourselves !” 
               <br />
               Easier said than done, with ﬁve colonies so 
               <br />
               long estranged, and whose former negotia- 
               <br />
               tions had generally ended in bitter contro- 
               <br />
               versies. Up to the last year there was no 
               <br />
               conjunction of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances</span> favorable to
