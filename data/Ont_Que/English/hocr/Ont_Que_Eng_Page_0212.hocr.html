               fore when the Legislative Council was made 
               <br />
               elective. The Lower Canada members will 
               <br />
               recollect that when the law was passed in 
               <br />
               England, under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂuences</span> which to this 
               <br />
               day remains unearthed, the clause was blot- 
               <br />
               ted out from our Constitution which we in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada justly regarded as our only 
               <br />
               against the encroachments and 
               <br />
               the domination of Upper Canada ; and 
               <br />
               in point of fact, for the striking out or 
               <br />
               changing of that clause, Upper Canada would 
               <br />
               never have demanded representation by 
               <br />
               population, and the difﬁculties which have 
               <br />
               resulted from this question would not have 
               <br />
               occurred, and we should have heard nothing 
               <br />
               of the Confederation measure which is now 
               <br />
               before us. Had the people of Upper Canada 
               <br />
               been well convinced that the Constitution 
               <br />
               could not he changed, they would have sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to sacriﬁces r'ather than create a 
               <br />
               useless agitation. It is said that we are to 
               <br />
               have guarantees for our institutions. But 
               <br />
               who will say that the guarantees left to us 
               <br />
               may not vanish when the measure reaches 
               <br />
               England, in the same way as the guarantee 
               <br />
               we had against representation by popula- 
               <br />
               tion ? At all events I still maintain that our 
               <br />
               institutions are not guaranteed in any way 
               <br />
               whatsoever, and this is clearly shown by Sir 
               <br />
               N. F. BBLLBAU himself, as I have already 
               <br />
               had occasion to prove. We are asked to 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce 'the election of the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council ; but is the system proposed a better 
               <br />
               one ? I do not think so, for to my mind the 
               <br />
               mode in which it is proposed to constitute 
               <br />
               that House a pears to be unsound in every 
               <br />
               way. Not on yare the peeple to be deprived 
               <br />
               of an important right, but the prerogative of 
               <br />
               the Crown is to be infringed by limiting the 
               <br />
               number of members to be appointed. It is 
               <br />
               painful to take a backward step of this kind, 
               <br />
               and to abandon a reform, the fruit of the 
               <br />
               persevering struggles of so many eminent 
               <br />
               men ; and I believe that if we consent to this 
               <br />
               change, the consequences of the act will soon 
               <br />
               be seen. In order to show that the defects 
               <br />
               of the system are very real, I will cite the 
               <br />
               opinion of the Hon. the Secretary of State 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the Colonies, set forth in his despatch to

               HON. Mn. FERRIER said—Honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, I had almost resolved to give a 
               <br />
               silent vote for the resolutions now before the 
               <br />
               House, but having, especially since I have 
               <br />
               had the honour of a seat in the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council, been accustomed to take note of 
               <br />
               passing events in the history of Canada, I 
               <br />
               think I may he allowed to occupy a short 
               <br />
               time in speaking of what has transpired in 
               <br />
               this country in past years, and more particu- 
               <br />
               larl of what has transpired within the last 
               <br />
               twe ve months. In t ears there were two 
               <br />
               great uestions whic h itated both East—- 
               <br />
               em an Western Canada. he one was the 
               <br />
               Seigniorial question in Lower Canada; the 
               <br />
               other was the Cler y Reserve question in 
               <br />
               Western Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ighese</span> two questions, for 
               <br />
               many years, occupied the attention of the 
               <br />
               Legislature and of the statesmen conducting 
               <br />
               successive governments. At last a settlement 
               <br />
               of these important questions was arrived at— 
               <br />
               I believe satisfactory to the majority of the 
               <br />
               people. Since that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> no great questions 
               <br />
               of public interest have occupied the minds of 
               <br />
               the people, or have been urged either by the 
               <br />
               Government of the day or by the leaders of 
               <br />
               the Opposition. The consequence has been 
               <br />
               that a political warfare has been waged in 
               <br />
               Canada for many years, of a nature calculated 
               <br />
               almost to destroy all correct political and 
               <br />
               moral principle, both in the Legislature and 
               <br />
               out of it. Has it not been the fact that any 
               <br />
               man who, through life, had sustained a _ 
               <br />
               character, either as a private individual or a 
               <br />
               professional man, no sooner accepted oﬂice in 
               <br />
               the Government than the Opposition and the 
               <br />
               Op sition papers would attack him at once
