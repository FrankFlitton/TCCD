               the Honorable'Attoruey General 'East must 
               <br />
               remember that he himself was one of those 
               <br />
               who raised the ﬂag of freedom at St. Charles, 
               <br />
               and donned the cap of liberty. At that 
               <br />
               period, Mr. SPEAKER. the Honorable Attor- 
               <br />
               ney General East did not shrink from open 
               <br />
               rebellion against the Crown, in order to secure 
               <br />
               what he considered the legitimate liberties of 
               <br />
               his fellow-citizens; to-day he does not shrink 
               <br />
               from a baronetcy, the reward of the treason 
               <br />
               he is prepared to consummate against his 
               <br />
               same follow—citizens. (Hear, hear.) I said 
               <br />
               a moment ago that French-Canadians had 
               <br />
               every reason to fear for the safety of their 
               <br />
               institutions under Confederation, and I will 
               <br />
               prove it by quoting a few passages from the 
               <br />
               celebrated report of Lord DURHAM—a report 
               <br />
               which has been used as a model by the 
               <br />
               Government in preparing their scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation—in fact the latter is copied 
               <br />
               almost word for word from that able sum- 
               <br />
               mary of the means to be adopted for the 
               <br />
               utter annihilation of French nationality in 
               <br />
               this country. (Hear, hear.) To those who 
               <br />
               may feel inclined to consider my fears un- 
               <br />
               founded, I have but one thing to say: you 
               <br />
               may rest assured that the English members 
               <br />
               will not allow themselves to be led by the 
               <br />
               few French-Canadian members of the Federal 
               <br />
               Government, and that they will strive con- 
               <br />
               scientiously, and in some sort naturally, to 
               <br />
               carry out the work initiated by Lord DUR- 
               <br />
               HAM, and carried on up to this day with a 
               <br />
               degree of skill and ability which, though de- 
               <br />
               feated in some instances, was none the less 
               <br />
               calculated to produce the results foreseen and 
               <br />
               desired by Great Britain. I will read to 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               for Vaudreuil (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HARWOODl</span> said there 
               <br />
               were as many Catholics in London as there 
               <br />
               were in Rome itself, the centre of Catholicity. 
               <br />
               Well, what is the value of that assertion? 
               <br />
               Does it prove anything in favor of his argu- 
               <br />
               ment? How many members are there in 
               <br />
               the English Parliament to represent the Ca- 
               <br />
               tholics of Great Britain? If I am not mis- 
               <br />
               taken, I think there are but two or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three.</span> 
               <br />
               Now I ask what inﬂuence can the Catholic 
               <br />
               population have in that Parliament, and what 
               <br />
               power have they to protect their institu- 
               <br />
               tions and their liberties ? If the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Vaudreuil thinks he has brought 
               <br />
               forward an unanswerable argument, he is 
               <br />
               very much mistaken, for the argument 
               <br />
               turns entirely against him. (Hear, hear. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘:</span> 
               <br />
               The honorable member for Vaudreuil also 
               <br />
               brought forward, in favor of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, an argument which bears a cer- 
               <br />
               tain appearance of plausibleness and weight. 
               <br />
               He said that if we adopt Confederation, 
               <br />
               Lower Canada will enjoy the rich coal 
               <br />
               mines of New Brunswick. Does the honor- 
               <br />
               able member fancy that the coal is to be de- 
               <br />
               livered to us free of all cost and charges, and 
               <br />
               without our having to give anything in ex- 
               <br />
               change for it? (Hear, hear.) Really, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, it seems to me that when only 
               <br />
               such arguments as these are available in sup 
               <br />
               port of a case, it would be quite as well to 
               <br />
               say nothing about it. It may be that the 
               <br />
               praises profusely bestowed by the Honorable 
               <br />
               Attorney General East on the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Vaudreuil are well deserved. It 
               <br />
               may be that the Honorable Attorney General 
               <br />
               thinks so; but for my part—I say it in all 
               <br />
               sincerity—I consider that the style of elo
