               <br />
               This historical sketch will demonstrate to us 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we owe no gratitude to England for 
               <br />
               those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> reforms which were obtained 
               <br />
               for us only through the unyielding patriot- 
               <br />
               ism of our great men, who, with intelligence, 
               <br />
               energy and perseverance, valiantly strove 
               <br />
               for the constant defence of our rights. We 
               <br />
               shall also see that, if they obtained the 
               <br />
               system of government and the political 
               <br />
               liberty for which they struggled, it was be- 
               <br />
               cause we had for our neig bore the states of 
               <br />
               the American Union, and that side by side 
               <br />
               with the evil was its remedy. We shall see 
               <br />
               that whenever England stood in need of us 
               <br />
               to defend her power, she made concessions 
               <br />
               to us; but that when the danger was once 
               <br />
               over, colonial fanaticism always attempted to 
               <br />
               withdraw those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concessions</span> and to destroy 
               <br />
               the inﬂuence and the liberties <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the French 
               <br />
               race. Each page of the parliamentary his- 
               <br />
               tory of our country offers a fresh <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proof</span> of 
               <br />
               this. But we then had men who knew how 
               <br />
               to struggle for a noble cause, and who did 
               <br />
               not shrink from the danger which that 
               <br />
               struggle entailed. I hope, Mr. SPEAKER, that 
               <br />
               we have still some of those men without 
               <br />
               fear and without reproach in Lower Canada ; 
               <br />
               I hope the present Ministry are sincere at 
               <br />
               the moment when they are giving up the 
               <br />

               they can arrive at a happy conclusion with 
               <br />
               their scheme of Confederation, I shall be 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst to congratulate them, and posterity

               mencement of English domination in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The ﬁrst political struggle 
               <br />
               between the French and the English ele— 
               <br />
               ments in the country occurred only a few 
               <br />
               years alter the treaty of capitulation had 
               <br />
               been signed. The general then command- 
               <br />
               ing in Canada established a system of mili- 
               <br />
               tary government. There may have been 
               <br />
               ground for such a system after so long and 
               <br />
               bloody a war as that which was just over, 
               <br />
               and which had left behind it so much 
               <br />
               legitimate animosity in the hearts of the 
               <br />
               conqueror and the conquered. However, 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treaty</span> of capitulation declared that the 
               <br />
               Canadians should be “ subjects of the king,” 
               <br />
               and as such they Were entitled to represen- 
               <br />
               tative government. The faith of treaty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> 
               <br />
               therefore violated from the commencement 
               <br />
               ofthe English domination in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> and as 
               <br />
               I shall have the honor of shewing, this was

               but the ﬁrst link in the long chain of arbi-
