               the General Legislature may at any time 
               <br />
               undo an thing they may have done. One

               <br />
               migration; one province wishes, perhaps, 
               <br />
               te encourage immigration of a certain kind, 
               <br />
               say, for instance, from the continent of Eu- 
               <br />
               rope. It is a legitimate wish; but the F ed- 
               <br />
               eral Legislature may, perhaps, in the varying 
               <br />
               shifts of public opinion, adopt a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> 
               <br />
               policy, and reverse all that the province may 
               <br />
               have done. To what end give powers to 
               <br />
               the local parliaments which may thus be 
               <br />
               taken away at any moment by the Federal 
               <br />
               Legislature ? (Hear, hear.) But, Mr. SPEAK- 
               <br />
               EB, there are a hundred other cases as to 
               <br />
               which I could satisfy the House, had I time 
               <br />
               for doing so, that more or less of this confu- 
               <br />
               sion arises. Take the subject of marriage 
               <br />
               and divorce for one—a subject on which there 
               <br />
               is a great deal of local prejudice and feeling, 
               <br />
               and into which even religious convictions 
               <br />
               largely enter. That matter is given to the 
               <br />
               General Legislature. But on the other hand 
               <br />
               the larger matter, civil rights—of which 
               <br />
               this of marriage and divo'rce, from one point 
               <br />
               of view, forms a mere part-—is given to the lo- 
               <br />
               cal legislatures. I turn to another matter, hap- 
               <br />
               hazard—the subjects of railway legislation, of 
               <br />
               railway incorporation, and of railway amalga— 
               <br />
               mation. What Legislature has power in these 
               <br />
               matters under this scheme? I am not sure that 
               <br />
               there are not here as nice a lot of pretty little 
               <br />
               questions as one would desire to see in a sum- 
               <br />
               mer’s‘day. And I am not alone in the matter of 
               <br />
               this criticism. Her Majesty’s Colonial Secre- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               London Times. In an article most eulcgistie 
               <br />
               of these resolutions on the whole, the writer 
               <br />
               in the London Times says—“ But the most 
               <br />
               important clause in the whole resolutions, and 
               <br />
               unfortunately by no means the easiest to 
               <br />
               understand, is the one which deﬁnes the 
               <br />
               powers of the Central Federal ' lature." 
               <br />
               He then quotes the words of the resolutions, 
               <br />
               and goes on to say :—

               It is exceedingly ditlicult to construe these pro- 
               <br />
               visions. First, general powers of legislation are 
               <br />
               given in the widest terms to the General Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment; then a power is iven especial] to make 
               <br />
               laws on thirty-seven subjects, one of t ose being 
               <br />
               all matters of a general character not exclusively 
               <br />
               reserved to the local legislatures. Nothing is 
               <br />
               exclusively reserved to the local legislatures, and 
               <br />
               itwonld seem, therefore, that the effect of this 
               <br />
               clause is to cut the power of central legislation 
               <br />
               down to matters of a general character—a most 
               <br />
               vague and unsatisfactory deﬁnition, and one sure, 
               <br />
               if it be retained, to produce conﬂict and con- 
               <br />
               fusion. In the same way, what are matters of a 
               <br />
               private and local nature not assi ed to the Gen 
               <br />
               eral Parliament ? We have failed to discover 
               <br />
               any matters of a private and local nature which 
               <br />
               are so assigned, and therefore the power will be 
               <br />
               limited by the words “private” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">md</span> “local,” so 
               <br />
