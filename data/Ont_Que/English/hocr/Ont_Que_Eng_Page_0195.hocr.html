               told that Confederation is become necessary 
               <br />
               for the defence of the country. For one 
               <br />
               moment I will admit that it might increase 
               <br />
               our means of defence, but that is assuredly no 
               <br />
               reason for urging the adoption of the measure, 
               <br />
               as now attempted to be done. With Con- 
               <br />
               federation, neither the number of men in the 
               <br />
               several provinces, nor the pecuniary resources 
               <br />
               now at their disposal, will be increased. I 
               <br />
               cannot see what vast increase of strength this 
               <br />
               Confederation is to give forthwith, for England 
               <br />
               is fully entitled at this moment to dispose, 
               <br />
               without let or hindrance, of all the resources, 
               <br />
               both in men and money, possessed by the 
               <br />
               colony, just as well as she will be after 
               <br />
               Confederation is eﬂected. That is therefore 
               <br />
               no reason to make us urge on the adoption of 
               <br />
               the measure, especially as we risk nothing by 
               <br />
               giving the people time to study, examine and 
               <br />
               understand the new Constitution of which we 
               <br />
               are desirous to make them a present. They 
               <br />
               tell us that the Intercolonial Railway is to be 
               <br />
               a military road. But if it be so, how happens 
               <br />
               it that nobody has thought of another part of 
               <br />
               the country in which a military road is much 
               <br />
               more called for. I can hardly believe that 
               <br />
               anybody can be serious in this, while they 
               <br />
               overlook the real military road which would be 
               <br />
               wanted in the event of hostilities,—I mean a 
               <br />
               railway between Quebec and Montreal, on the 
               <br />
               north shore of the River St. Lawrence. In 
               <br />
               order to render the Intercolonial Railway of 
               <br />
               any avail as a military road, the North Shore 
               <br />
               Railway must also be built, for the present 
               <br />
               road on the south shore may be easily out 
               <br />
               and occupied by the enemy. Leaving Quebec 
               <br />
               it takes the direction of the United States, 
               <br />
               and leaving Montreal it takes the same direc- 
               <br />
               tion to meet the other branch at Richmond. 
               <br />
               In case of war the Americans would have 
               <br />
               but a short distance to advance to take 
               <br />
               ssession of either one or the other of these 
               <br />
               ranches. I shall now proceed to examine 
               <br />
               whether the plan of Confederation is really 
               <br />
               what it seems to be. I hear it said that Con- 
               <br />
               federation, as it is proposed, will be a Federal 
               <br />
               union—but it seems to me that it will be rather 
               <br />
               a Legislative union, at least as far as regards 
               <br />
               the most important interests of Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               The 29th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">section</span> of the scheme submitted to 
               <br />
               us says: “ The Federal Parliament shall have 
               <br />
               the power of making laws for the peace, the 
               <br />
               well-being, and the good government of the 
               <br />
               Confederate provinces, and in particular in 
               <br />
               respect of the following matters.” The powers 
               <br />
               of the Federal Government will be in reality 
               <br />
               unlimited. The fact of the enumeration of

               <br />
               of divorce, I consider that the power of legis 
               <br />
               lating upon it ought to be vested <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> the 
               <br />
               Federal Government; but as to the passing 
               <br />
               of a marriage set, we have the authority of 
               <br />
               the past to convince us that Lower Canada 
               <br />
               will never be satisﬁed with what is proposed 
               <br />
               in the plan of Confederation. On a former 
               <br />
               occasion, when a member of the Parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada moved to enact that marriage 
               <br />
               should be made a civil contract, all the mem- 
               <br />
               bers for Lower Canada voted against the 
               <br />
               motion, and the whole country was opposed 
               <br />
               to it. I shall also inquire whether the Federal 
               <br />
               Government will not have the right to enact 
               <br />
               that religious corporations shall no longer 
               <br />
               exist in the country, or that they shall not be 
               <br />
               allowed to hold real property, except what is 
               <br />
               absolume necessary for their lodging accom- 
               <br />
               modation. According to the resolutions which 
               <br />
               have been submitted to us, the Federal Gov— 
               <br />
               ernment would certainly have this right. It 
               <br />
               has been said that article 15 of the 43rd 
               <br />
               resolution replies to this objection, but I can 
               <br />
               see nothing in that article which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restricts</span> the 
               <br />
               right of the Federal Government to legislate 
               <br />
               on this matter. The 43rd resolution deﬁnes 
               <br />
               the powers of the local governments, and arti- 
               <br />
               cle 15 of that resolution declares that they 
               <br />
               may make laws respecting “property and 
               <br />
               civil rights, excepting those portions thereof 
               <br />
               assigned to the General Parliament.” That 
               <br />
               article reserves to the local legislatures nothing 
               <br />
               relative to religious corporations, and the 
               <br />
               Federal Government would have full power to 
               <br />
               decree that those corporations shall not hold 
               <br />
               immovable pr0perty. The supreme power is 
               <br />
               that which has the right to legislate upon, 
               <br />
               and regulate the existence of, the corporations 
               <br />
               in question, and they can only possess civil 
               <br />
               rights so long as the Government permits them 
               <br />
               to exist. The same might be said of most of 
               <br />
               the institutions to which Lower Canada is 
               <br />
               attached. I am therefore right in saying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> 
               <br />
               so far as those things which Lower Canada 
               <br />
               most holds to are concerned, Confederation is 
               <br />
               in fact a Legislative union, because upon the 
               <br />
               Federal Government is conferred the right of 
               <br />
               legislating upon those subjects which Lower 
               <br />
               Canada holds most dear. It appears to me 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it is the more important not to proceed
