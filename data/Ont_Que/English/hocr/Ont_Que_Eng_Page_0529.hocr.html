               HON. MB. CAMPBELL—Before the 
               <br />
               House rises, I desire to submit a statement 
               <br />
               of the revenue of the Island of Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward, which has come into my hands since 
               <br />
               the close of the debate on the proposed union 
               <br />
               of Canada and the Lower Provinces. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Niagara seemed to take 
               <br />
               exception to what I said in relation to that 
               <br />
               particular point, and I am therefore happy 
               <br />
               to be able to satisfy the hon. member that 
               <br />
               what I then stated is fully sustained by the 
               <br />
               authentic return now before me. I hold in 
               <br />
               my hand a “Report of the Comptroller of 
               <br />
               Customs and Sundry Statistics ” of that 
               <br />
               colony for the year 1863, which shows that 
               <br />
               the total revenue of the island for that year 
               <br />
               was £61,688 148. 4d., island currency, equal 
               <br />
               to £41,125 168. 3d., sterling, an increase 
               <br />
               over the previous year of nearly 35 per cent. 
               <br />
               The hon. member seemed to think it impos- 
               <br />
               sible that such a sum as I had stated should 
               <br />
               have been raised, and suggested that a great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%;“</span> must have come from local sources. 
               <br />

               <br />
               duties on imports for 1863 was £46,057 68. 
               <br />
               7d., island currency, from the post oﬁce 
               <br />
               £1,590, and from custom house oﬂice fees, 
               <br />
               £71 9s. 9d. ; together £47,718 163. 4d., 
               <br />
               island currency, or about £32,000, sterling, 
               <br />
               equal to $156,000 or thereabouts. There 
               <br />
               are a good many other items of revenue, but 
               <br />
               I have selected these three, as those certain 
               <br />
               to come into the treasury of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> General

               Government, and there may be others. But 
               <br />
               it will be seen that these alone would make 
               <br />
               up the sum I gave as the revenue of the 
               <br />
               island, which would be available for the 
               <br />

               ' MR. DUN KIN , continuing his speech 
               <br />
               from yesterday, said—Mr. SPEAKER, when 
               <br />
               the kindness of the House permitted me to
