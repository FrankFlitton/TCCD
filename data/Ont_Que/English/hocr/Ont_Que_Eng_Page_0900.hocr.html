               <br />

               <br />

               agreed upon the resolutions that are now 
               <br />
               submitted to this House. In them I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               principles which do not harmonize with my 
               <br />
               pledges to the people, and without an appeal 
               <br />
               to the people I cannot support the measure 
               <br />
               now before the House. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               will not here say anything of the merits of 
               <br />
               the resolutions, but simply state that they 
               <br />
               embrace principles which I cannot support on 
               <br />
               account of the promises that I have made to 
               <br />
               my constituents. The peeple of my county 
               <br />
               have been led by the Globe to believe that 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be a very 
               <br />
               dangerous affair for the country, and that it 
               <br />
               would not be useful either as a military or 
               <br />
               commercial undertaking. Looking at it 
               <br />
               from a military point of view, it is well 
               <br />
               known that part of the proposed line would 
               <br />
               run within twenty-six miles of the American 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">frontier,</span> and that communication could be 
               <br />
               cut off at any moment by an American army; 
               <br />
               and that as a commercial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itndertaking</span> it 
               <br />
               could never compete with the water route 
               <br />
               during the season of navigation; and in 
               <br />
               the winter it would be comparatively useless 
               <br />
               on account of the depth of snow. They 
               <br />
               have been ted that it would never pay for 
               <br />
               the grease that would go on the axles. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) When I went before them and 
               <br />
               stated that I would support the MACDONALD- 
               <br />
               DOBION <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?rovernment,</span> they said that Govern— 
               <br />
               ment should be looked upon with suspicion, 
               <br />
               as they had granted ten thousand dollars for 
               <br />
               the survey of the Intercolonial Railway; but 
               <br />
               I told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> that the best guarantee that they 
               <br />
               could have that that work would not be pro- 
               <br />
               ceeded with, was that the Hon. Mr. DOBION 
               <br />
               was in the Cabinet, and that he had revi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               0 f that railway. Another question that I found 
               <br />
               a little embarrassing was that of separate
