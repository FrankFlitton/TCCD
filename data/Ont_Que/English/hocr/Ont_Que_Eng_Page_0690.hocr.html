               congratulate the Government upon the stand 
               <br />
               they have taken on this matter. There was

               unfavorable news from the Lower Provinces. 
               <br />
               For my own part I have not shared in that 
               <br />
               feeling, but continued to have conﬁdence 
               <br />
               that the Government would pursue the only 
               <br />
               pr0per course, and ask the House to pro- 
               <br />
               nounce upon the scheme on its merits. If 
               <br />
               the result of the ﬁrst elections held in New

               Brunswick is a true indication of the state 
               <br />
               of feeling in that province, then it is plain 
               <br />
               that defeat awaits the present proposition 
               <br />
               for union in that quarter; but as yet no 
               <br />
               province has pronounced upon it, either for 
               <br />
               it or against it; and the intelligence received 
               <br />
               that the union party have met with unlocked 
               <br />
               for reverses at the New Brunswick elections, 
               <br />
               however dampening to the prospects of early 
               <br />
               success, is no suﬂicient reason why we, the 
               <br />
               originators of the scheme, should set the 
               <br />
               bad example of summarily giving it up. 
               <br />
               We have a plain duty to discharge in 
               <br />
               regard to the proposition laid before Par- 
               <br />
               liament by the Government, and that is, 
               <br />
               either to accept or reject it as a whole. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Sir, I will not occupy the 
               <br />
               time of the House so long as I probably 
               <br />
               would have done, had I spoken at an earlier 
               <br />
               stage of the debate, and that for two reasons, 
               <br />
               because the ground has been all gone over 
               <br />
               by those who have spoken already, and 
               <br />
               because I think the Government have good 
               <br />
               ground for urging upon the House the pro- 
               <br />
               priety of bringing the debate to a close as 
               <br />
               soon as possible. I can easily understand 
               <br />
               that it is a matter of paramount importance 
               <br />
               to have the views of the Canadian Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment laid before the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               at the earliest possible moment. I cannot, 
               <br />
               however, feel it to be consistent with a pro- 
               <br />
               per discharge of my duty to give a silent 
               <br />
               vote. Having spent some time amongst 
               <br />
               my constituents prior to the opening of this 
               <br />
               session, and had conversations with the 
               <br />
               peeple in reference to this scheme, at my 
               <br />
               meetings with them I gave expression to 
               <br />
               certain objections which I felt in my own 
               <br />
               mind to certain details of the scheme, if I 
               <br />
               did not express those objections on the ﬂoor of 
               <br />
               the House. ( Hear, hear.) But,Mr.SPEAK- 
               <br />
               ER, while I discussed freely and candidly 
               <br />
               what appeared to me the objectionable feat- 
               <br />
               ures of the scheme, I stated most distinctly 
               <br />
               to my constituents that in the event of no 
               <br />
               alteration being agreed to by the governments 
               <br />
               of the several provinces, the scheme as a 
               <br />
               whole, just as it stood, ought to be accepted ; 
               <br />
               and that in the event of the alternative being 
               <br />
               offered to Parliament of acceptin or rejecting 
               <br />
