               (Hear, hear.) Some Of the details were

               objected to, but the scheme as a whole was

               <br />
               of Opinion was, that it was not at all desirable

               <br />
               that check should not derive its power from 
               <br />
               the same source, and in the same man- 
               <br />
               ner. I have, however, for some time in- 
               <br />
               clined to the opinion that the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council might, with safety, be abolished 
               <br />

               <br />
               effected an immense saving to the country. 
               <br />
               In carrying out this scheme, very much, of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coursekwill</span> depend upon the character of

               arrangements. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Srlma, 
               <br />
               I am no alarmist, but disguise it as we may, 
               <br />
               this country is at the present moment deep- 
               <br />
               ly depressed. I entirely dissent from sen- 
               <br />
               timents enunciated by honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the ﬂoor of this House as to the general 
               <br />
               prosperity of Canada; the actual state of 
               <br />
               matters is not as they represent it. Through 
               <br />
               a failure of crops for a number of years back 
               <br />
               in Upper Canada, that section of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince is in a state of agricultural and com- 
               <br />
               mercial prostration; farmers and others are 
               <br />
               unable to meet their engagements to the 
               <br />
               merchant, who, in consequence, is unable to 
               <br />
               meet his liabilities to the wholesale dealers, 
               <br />
               and the result is that scores, I may say 
               <br />
               hundreds, are obliged to collapse and go into 
               <br />
               liquidation ; bank agencies are being with- 
               <br />
               drawn from the country districts, and bank- 
               <br />
               ing accommodation very much curtailed. 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, these are facts that cannot 
               <br />
               be gainsayed. Every branch of industry is 
               <br />
               almost paralyzed at the present moment, and 
               <br />
               a general gloom hangs like a pal] over the 
               <br />
               land. Under these circumstances, it behoves 
               <br />
               the Government to do everything in their 
               <br />
               power to revive and foster industry in the 
               <br />
               country. Sir, I will not say that this Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment does so, but governments have been 
               <br />
               too much .in the habit of borrowing from 
               <br />
               the banks that capital which ought to go 
               <br />
               into circulation for the beneﬁt of the trade 
               <br />
               of the country. I hold that it is the duty 
               <br />
               of all. governments to refrain from doing 
               <br />
               anything <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that'will</span> bear upon the people’s 
               <br />
               industry; and I implore this Government to 
               <br />
               turn their attention to the position of this 
               <br />
               country just new, and do all they can to 
               <br />
               better the condition of the people. While, 
               <br />
               sir, there are features in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition</span> 
               <br />
               before you which, if they stood alone on 
               <br />
               their merits, I should certainly oppose, 
               <br />
               yet, as lstated before, I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taink</span> them 
               <br />
               of suﬂicient importance to justify me in
