               concur with honorable entlemen that the

               fate for weal or woe depends upon the course 
               <br />
               we shall now pursue, and I, for one, feel not

               the burthen of that responsibility from my

               shoulders. I am fully prepared to assume it

               at once upon the merits of the scheme as it is 
               <br />
               evolved in these resolutions, and I do not 
               <br />
               wish to shield myself behind either an ad-

               honorable friend the member or the division 
               <br />

               <br />
               just been rejected by an unmistakable vote of 
               <br />
               this House, or the larger motion, of which my 
               <br />
               honorable friend from Niagara has given no- 
               <br />
               tice, for an appeal to the people, and to which 
               <br />
               I shall presently again refer. An objection 
               <br />
               has been taken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> h’mine by the honorable 
               <br />
               member from Niagara to the constitution of 
               <br />
               the Conference which sat at Quebec, that they 
               <br />
               were, in the ﬁrst place, self-appointed ; and, in 
               <br />
               the second place, that the great principle of 
               <br />
               representation based upon population was not 
               <br />
               carried out, because although the Lower Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces possessed each, and even collectively, 
               <br />
               a much smaller population than Canada, yet 
               <br />
               they had a much larger number of members 
               <br />
               in the Congress than we had. As to the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               objection, of their being self-appointed or self- 
               <br />
               constituted, some one had to take the initia- 
               <br />
               tive in the matter, and no one had better au- 
               <br />
               thority than the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> governments to say 
               <br />
               who should represent their respective pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in the Conference. Will honorable gen— 
               <br />
               tlemen contend that the delegates were self- 
               <br />
               appointed when they were appointed by the 
               <br />
               Ministry of the day, who are responsible to 
               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly, which, in its turn, 
               <br />
               is responsible to the people at large ? Then, 
               <br />
               as to the second objection, that the numbers 
               <br />
               were unequal, the honorable gentleman ou ht 
               <br />
               to know that the principle of representation 
               <br />
               by population does not apply to the Confer- 
               <br />
               ence in the same way that it does to the re- 
               <br />
               presentation in this and the other House of 
               <br />
               Parliament. Here the vote of every individ- 
               <br />
               ual member counts upon a division on an

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               question, and so numbers become of the 
               <br />
               utmost importance. But in the Conference 
               <br />
               the votes were counted by provinces, and not 
               <br />
               by single votes, so that it was impossible that 
               <br />
               any one province could be swamped by the 
               <br />
               others by reason of their having a larger re- 
               <br />
               presentation. The only affect of an undue

               representation from any province would be to 
               <br />
               increase the diﬂiculty the delegates from that

               way, work any injustice to the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I have no doubt the Conference found 
               <br />
               their greatest diﬁiculty in bringing the mem-

               bers of each section to agree among them- 
               <br />
               selves. (Hear, hear, from the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               CAMPBELL.) If the del tes from any 
               <br />
               province felt that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coäî</span> not agree to 
               <br />
               any of the questions submitted to them, 
               <br />
               they had but to say so, and the scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation, so far as they were concerned, 
               <br />
               would have been at an end. The argument 
               <br />
               of unfair representation is, therefore, quite 
               <br />
               fallaeious. There could really be no danger 
               <br />
               from the number of representatives not being 
               <br />
               in proportion, so long as each province had 
               <br />
               the power of protecting itself from any injus- 
               <br />
               tice. which might be attempted to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perpe—</span> 
               <br />
               trated against it by the others. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It has also been objected that the present Ca- 
               <br />
               nadian Administration was formed upon the 
               <br />
               avowed policy of forming a. Federal union 
               <br />
               between Upper and Lower Canada only, and 
               <br />
               that the Government has exceeded their con- 
               <br />
               stitutional powers by substituting an union of 
               <br />
               all the provinces instead of what they had 
               <br />
               promised. Do we not all remember that the 
               <br />
               avowed policy of the Government was a Fed- 
               <br />
               eral union of these provinces, I mean Upper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada ﬁrst, leaving it open to 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces and the colonies of 
               <br />
               the great west to fall into the union when— 
               <br />
               ever they might ﬁnd it their interest to do 
               <br />
               so? Ministers, no doubt, had not the slight- 
               <br />
               est idea that the larger scheme could be ac- 
               <br />
               com lished as soon if not sooner than the 
               <br />
               sm ler one. I told my constituents, on com- 
               <br />
               ing before them for re-election, that there was 
               <br />
               an urgent necessity for a different union be— 
               <br />
               tween Upper and Lower Canada from that 
               <br />
               which now exists, and that there was not time 
               <br />
               to include the Lower Provinces in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               scheme. But the movement has outrun my 
               <br />
               expectation, and I believe that of every 
               <br />
               member of the House. And is the House to 
               <br />
               reject the larger scheme when it is the easiest 
               <br />
               of accomplishment, simply because it had a 
               <br />
               secondary place in the ministerial programme? 
               <br />
               I think the Charlottetown Conference was a 
               <br />
               good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opportunity,</span> and that the Government 
               <br />
               has acte wisely in putting themselves in com— 
               <br />
               munication with it, and in taking up the 
               <br />
               whole union ﬁrst. But the honorable mem-
