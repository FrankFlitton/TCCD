               their conservative colleagues—it is this cry, 
               <br />
               this bugbear, this bête noire of annexation 
               <br />
               raised by hon. gentlemen on the other side 
               <br />
               of the House. Why, sir, it is only a few 
               <br />
               months since we had the great Constitutional 
               <br />
               party organized in this country, and baptized 
               <br />
               with an amount of eloquence and parade such 
               <br />
               as never attended the birth of a party in any 
               <br />
               other country. We were told by the leaders 
               <br />
               of this great Constitutional party that the 
               <br />
               British Constitution in this country must be 
               <br />
               defended; that the country was divided into 
               <br />
               two parties—the Annexation party and the 
               <br />
               Constitutional party—and that the reformers 
               <br />
               composed the former, while the conservatives 
               <br />
               desired to perpetuate British connection. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend the member for Lambton 
               <br />
               was singled out for attack, and told that he 
               <br />
               and those with whom he acted desired to 
               <br />
               hand the country over to the Americans; 
               <br />
               that he was unfaithful and untrue to his 
               <br />
               allegiance ; that he carried the sign of 
               <br />
               democracy on his face; and the whole Re- 
               <br />
               form party was branded last summer by the 
               <br />
               Conservative leaders as annexationists, who 
               <br />
               desired to uproot and overthrow the British 
               <br />
               institutions of this country. Well, sir, what 
               <br />
               do we ﬁnd now ? We ﬁnd the same charges 
               <br />
               hurled at the minority in this House—my 
               <br />

               <br />
               leaders of this same great Constitutional 
               <br />
               party ; and we ﬁnd the Honorable Provincial 
               <br />
               Secretary, the Honorable Postmaster Gen-

               <br />
               colleagues only a few short months ago. 
               <br />
               Have they suddenly turned to view these 
               <br />
               charges as just, or do they still think, as 
               <br />
               they thought last summer, that they are 
               <br />
               unfair and unfounded? If they were unfair 
               <br />

               <br />
               expostulation, they should allow them to be 
               <br />
               hurled at us without a word of expostulation 
               <br />

               these charges reiterated, that they might 
               <br />

               have pitied us a little for the sake of former 
               <br />
               associations. I have thought that the great 
               <br />
               Liberal party of Upper Canada might have 
               <br />
               come a little to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rescue</span> of their former 
               <br />
               colleagues, and said to those who uttered 
               <br />
               these false <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accusations—"‘</span> Don’t hound down 
               <br />
               these men too much; we know and have 
               <br />
               acted with them: they are not annexation- 
               <br />
               ists, they are not rebellious, and we know 
               <br />
               that your accusations against them are un- 
               <br />
               fair and ungenerous.” But, sir, throughout 
               <br />
               this debate these members of the Government 
               <br />
               have listened to attacks of this kind—the 
               <br />
               great Reform party of Upper Canada, which 
               <br />
               only yesterday, as it were, was smarting 
               <br />
               under the lash that is now cracked over our 
               <br />
               heads, which only yesterday writhed under 
               <br />
               the odium of these false representations—sat 
               <br />
               silently by, without a word of expostulation, 
               <br />
               without a word in defence of their old 
               <br />
               friends, whom they know to he unjustly and 
               <br />
               slanderously accused. (Hear. hear.) Now, 
               <br />
               why I speak of this matter is because I fear 
               <br />
               that these gentlemen, who have long been 
               <br />

               <br />

               overwhelmed by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preponderance</span> of con-

               servative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> in the Government and 
               <br />
               conservative inﬂuence in the country. I 
               <br />
               know that they do not feel comfortable 
               <br />
