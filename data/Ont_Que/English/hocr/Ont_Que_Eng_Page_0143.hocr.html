               ? Were we not as safe now as we would 
               <br />

               <br />
               we were on an inclined plane, and he (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. SANBOBN) supposed that like Holland we

               must dyke ourselves up, lest we slide away

               to be thankful for. His own impression was

               diﬂiculties with the United States, but they 
               <br />
               had never exhibited a spirit of aggression 
               <br />
               towards us, except in times of war, which had

               arisen from issues between Great Britain and

               entertained such purposes now any more than
