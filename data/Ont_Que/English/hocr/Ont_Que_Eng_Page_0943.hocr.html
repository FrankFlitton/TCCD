               MB. DUFRESNE—The hon. member dis- 
               <br />
               tinctly sees the mote in his neighbor’s eye, 
               <br />
               but he cannot in any way discover the beam 
               <br />
               in his own ! He forgets that he wearied this 
               <br />
               House for ﬁve or six hours, reading passages 
               <br />
               from history calculated to excite prejudice 
               <br />
               against a nation which is in a majority both 
               <br />
               here and elsewhere. I can only account for 
               <br />
               his having forgotten his own speech so soon, 
               <br />
               by taking it for granted that the honorable 
               <br />
               member did not himself make the research 
               <br />
               required in order to swell it up to its vast di- 
               <br />
               mensions, for it was nothing but a mass of 
               <br />
               scraps with which he wearied the House 
               <br />
               during ﬁve long hours. (Hear, hear, and 
               <br />
               laughter.) I do not wish to be severe, but I 
               <br />
               trust the hon. member will pay attention to 
               <br />
               the remarks I now desire to make. He as- 
               <br />
               serted, on the ﬂoor of this House, that the 
               <br />
               liberals had struggled to obtain responsible 
               <br />
               government. If he said that of the men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who</span> 
               <br />
               really did do so,it would be all very well; but 
               <br />
               if he asserts it of those who form his own 
               <br />
               party, he is greatly in error ; for we all know 
               <br />
               that that party has always protested against 
               <br />
               the union and against responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment. (Hear, hear.) That party declared, 
               <br />
               at elections and elsewhere, on every occasion, 
               <br />
               that responsible government was a deception 
               <br />
               and a snare—an insult cast in our teeth by 
               <br />
               England. (Hear, hear.) That has been the 
               <br />
               cry of his political party ever since we ob— 
               <br />
               tained responsible government. How, then, 
               <br />
               can he have the hardihood to assert that we 
               <br />
               owe it to them? (Hear, hear.) The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Richelieu also said that the clergy 
               <br />
               were wrong in 1837, and that they are wrong 
               <br />
               now in su porting the Government.

               words spoken in this House misquoted, but I 
               <br />

               <br />
               tactics carried to such excess as it has been 
               <br />
               in this instance, with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to myself, by the

               honorable member for Montcalm. Hear, 
               <br />
               hear, from the Opposition.) What said 
               <br />
               with reference to the episcopacy and the men 
               <br />
               of talent who adorn it, was this—I stated 
               <br />
               that with our present system of public in- 
               <br />
               struction in our rural districts, every child is 
               <br />
               enabled to receive such an education as will 
               <br />
               ﬁt him to aspire to the highest position in the 
               <br />
               country, and to the highest rank in social 
               <br />
               life. I then added, in proof of my assertion, 
               <br />
               that we now see in the highest ranks in 
               <br />
               society men belonging to humble country 
               <br />
               families, whose parents <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possetsed</span> neither the 
               <br />
               fortune nor the inﬂuence necessary to push 
               <br />
               their children forward, and that they had sue- 
               <br />
               ceeded only through their own talents, 
               <br />
               their industry, and the advantages aﬂ'orded by 
               <br />
               our system of education. I also said, in 
               <br />
               proof of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my</span> assertion, that the children of the 
               <br />
               rural popu ation had attained seats on the 
               <br />
               judicial and ministerial benches, and even 
               <br />
               among the episcopacy. Now, any one who 
               <br />
               understands the obvious meaning of words 
               <br />
               will admit that it is impossible to interpret 
               <br />
               that sentence as an expression of astonishment 
               <br />
               that there should be men of talent in the epis-

               copacy, as the honorable member makes a
