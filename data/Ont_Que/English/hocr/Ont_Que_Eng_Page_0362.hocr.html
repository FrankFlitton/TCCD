               <br />
               defending ourselves, we would be placed for 
               <br />
               ﬁve months in a very disagreeable and trying 
               <br />
               position, having no opportunity of obtaining 
               <br />
               the powerful suceour of the Mother Country. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) That must be so easily under- 
               <br />
               stood, that I shall make no further remark 
               <br />
               upon it. But, my statemcnt about the pro— 
               <br />
               vines being placed upon an inclined plane may 
               <br />
               require some little comment and explanation. 
               <br />
               I say that, if we do not cultivate with our 
               <br />
               sister provinces—the Maritime Provinces—a 
               <br />
               close commercial, political, and social inter- 
               <br />
               course—being all of us British subjects, all 
               <br />
               of us monarchists, owin allegiance to the 
               <br />
               same Crown—if we neglect the cultivation of 
               <br />
               that intercourse, we run a great danger. We 
               <br />
               are, in our present position, small, isolated 
               <br />
               bodies, and it may probably be with us, as 
               <br />
               in the physical world, where a large body 
               <br />
               attracts to itself the smaller bodies within the 
               <br />
               sphere of its inﬂuence. If we do not make 
               <br />
               those alliances with the Lower Provinces—if 
               <br />
               we do not open with them those communica- 
               <br />
               tions, political, social, and commercial, which 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emential</span> for our own interest, we shall 
               <br />
               little by little lose some of those principles 
               <br />
               we now esteem so much ; we shall lose little by 
               <br />
               little our attachmcnt to the Mother' Country, 
               <br />
               and the interesting reminiscences which, with 
               <br />
               many of us, now give intensity to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attach.</span>

               <br />
               hear.) And really, hon. gentlemen, if I 
               <br />
               were to form my opinion by some of the 
               <br />
               speeches which we have heard in this Honor- 
               <br />
               able House since this debate was opened, I 
               <br />
               think there are some hon. gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who,</span> 
               <br />
               from the way in which they have expressed

               themselves, might be supposed to be-—although 
               <br />
               I hope in reality they are not—already half

               way down the inclined plane. (Hear, hear 
               <br />
               and laughter.) Well, hon. gentlemen, I say 
               <br />
               that if we want to avoid that, we must have 
               <br />
               a Federal union with our fellow-subjects of 
               <br />
               the British Provinces, and that besides we 
               <br />
               must have easy means of access to the sea- 
               <br />
               board, so that, in case of danger, help can 
               <br />
               be immediatel forwarded to Canada and to all 
               <br />
               parts of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%ederal</span> union, and that we may

               that, if this Confederation did not take place, 
               <br />
               Canada could not become prosperous. I never 
               <br />
               said anything of the kind. I said expressly 
               <br />
               the contrary. Perhaps I may not recisely 
               <br />
               apprehend the meaning of the wor “ pros- 
               <br />
               perous.” But I said this, that Canada had 
               <br />
               within itself all the means to become popul— 
               <br />
               one, to become wealthy, to become a great 
               <br />
               le. But on the other hand, I said that 
               <br />
               Canada and the other British American Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, without union, could not become a 
               <br />
               “powerful,” as distin 'shed from a pros- 
               <br />
               perous people. I sai that we in Canada 
               <br />
               could not become a powerful people unless we 
               <br />
               had some maritime elements, unlœs we had 
               <br />
               the means, by having harbors and ports of 
               <br />
               our own open at all seasons, of communicatin 
               <br />
               freely with all the nations of the worl . 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) That is what I said. Incver 
               <br />
               stated that Canada could not become prosper- 
               <br />
               ous, make money, and so forth. No; I think 
               <br />
               Canada can do that; but Canada, even though 
               <br />
               its population should reach forty millions— 
               <br />
               which it may in a century <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hence-wan</span> never 
               <br />
               be a powerful nation, unless its power is felt 
               <br />
               all over the world ; and how can its power he 
               <br />
               so felt, unless it has its seaports open all the 
               <br />
               year round? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) And I said—- 
               <br />
               “ Point out to me the nation in this world 
               <br />
               which is powerful, that has not some maritime 
               <br />
               elements.” I say there is no one in the 
               <br />
               world. Every nation whose power has been 
               <br />
               felt over the globe, has been a nation that 
               <br />
               had some maritime outlet. But Canada, 
               <br />
               situated as it is, is in great want of free ac- 
               <br />
               cess to the sea; and, as long as we are shut 
               <br />
               up, during ﬁve months of the year. without

               being able to communicate with the rest of 
               <br />
               the world—for, notwithstanding our ﬁne 
               <br />
               river, we cannot be said to have a real mari- 
               <br />
               time element—we are in truth a dependent 
               <br />
               people. (Hear, hear.) I have some notes in 
               <br />
               French, made with the intention of answering 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen who spoke in that lan- 
               <br />
               guage; but I think, having commenced, that 
               <br />
               will go on in English. It has been asked by 
               <br />
               several honorable gentlemen how we were to 
               <br />

               orities in Upper and Lower Canada respec— 
               <br />
               tively. We have in Upper Canada a Catho- 
               <br />
               lic minority, in Lower Canada a Protestant 
               <br />
               minority. Well, those minorities are now in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possemion</span> of certain rights; and, ii“ we were 
               <br />
               not to legislate at all upon those rights, my 
               <br />
               inte retation of the scheme is, that they 
               <br />
