               To my mind, that is the way in which the

               agitation in connection with representation

               by population has continued during the past 
               <br />
               ten years. Going back to the time of the 
               <br />
               defeat of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CARTIER-MACDONALD</span> Ad- 
               <br />
               ministration, we ﬁnd that that Administra- 
               <br />
               tion had considered it an open question. 
               <br />
               The MAODONALD-SICOTTE Administration, 
               <br />
               which succeeded, resolved to treat it as a 
               <br />
               close question. They agreed to leave it in 
               <br />
               abeyance, but I never understood that their 
               <br />
               supporters from Upper Canada agreed to 
               <br />
               abandon it. It was stated distinctly at the time 
               <br />
               of the formation of that Government, that any 
               <br />
               abandonment of the question was a matter 
               <br />
               altogether with the Government, and was not 
               <br />
               binding upon their supporters. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               That government adopted what was called 
               <br />
               the double-majority principle, but I never 
               <br />
               understood that a majority of their supporters 
               <br />
               from Upper Canada agreed to accept it as a 
               <br />
               basis, or a means of securing the settlement 
               <br />
               of the grievances of Upp’er Canada. What 
               <br />
               the ,Upper Canada Reform <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party</span> agreed to 
               <br />
               was, that as there was great corruption and 
               <br />
               extravagance in the administration of the 
               <br />
               ﬁnances of this country, for the sake of 
               <br />
               securing administrative reform they would 
               <br />
               allow the question of representation by popu- 
               <br />
               lation to remain in abeyance for a time. 
               <br />
               However, the double majority principle 
               <br />
               would not work. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               DONALD-SIOOTTE Govern ment were defeated, 
               <br />
               and the MAODONALD-DOBION Government 
               <br />
               was formed. They treated the question in 
               <br />
               the same way as the CARTIER-MACDONALD 
               <br />
               did—loft it an open question. While that

               There was never a vote aimed more distinctly 
               <br />
               than that at the Honorable the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance; it was declared by a majority of 
               <br />
               this House that he was the means of the loss 
               <br />
               of this $100,000 to the country. The majo-

               the Governor General to dissolve the House ; 
               <br />

               willing to overlook his oﬂ'ence, to treat the

               vote of the House as of no consequence 
               <br />
               whatever, and to become colleagues of that 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman in the Government. 
               <br />
               (ﬂeur.) Thus the present Coalition was 
               <br />
               formed with its policy of Confederation. I 
               <br />
               believe that the agitation for representation 
               <br />
               by population had been less active for three 
               <br />
               years preceding the foruation of that gov- 
               <br />
               ernment than at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> time during the last 
               <br />
               ten years ; but the mere fact of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment being defeated seemed to be a suﬂicient 
               <br />
               excuse for these honorable gentlemen to join 
               <br />
               men to whom they had been Opposed for 
               <br />
               years, and to come down to this House with 
               <br />
               a proposal tor a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> of t e provin- 
               <br />
               ces. For my own part,I am no opposed 
               <br />
               to a Confederation of these provinces, on a 
               <br />
               proper basis, although I would rather have 
               <br />
               seen a legislative union of them preferred. 
               <br />
               I have no sympathy with those members in 
               <br />
               their opposition to the scheme, who, while
