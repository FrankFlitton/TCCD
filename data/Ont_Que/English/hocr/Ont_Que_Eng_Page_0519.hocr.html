               <br />

               serious trouble in the matter of its local

               although, unfortunately, perhaps, there is 
               <br />
               in this part of the scheme some confusion of 
               <br />
               inconsistent features of the two systems. 
               <br />
               Great Britain has not yet, in any true sense 
               <br />
               of the term, federated herself with any of 
               <br />
               her colonies. She just retains a nominal 
               <br />

               But in that case we got our own way in 
               <br />
               effect directly afterwards. I am referring

               called the conduct of our own domestic

               had given tous by Great Britain a control

               practically unlimited over our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs;</span> 
               <br />
               she lets us do what we like, while professing 
               <br />
               to retain a perfect nominal supremacy over 
               <br />
               us. She appoints our Governor General, 
               <br />
               but when he comes here, he does what we 
               <br />
               want, not what she may want. She can, if 
               <br />
               she likes, disallow all our statutes; but for 
               <br />
               all practical purposes she never does. She 
               <br />
               may, if she chooses, alter or repeal the 
               <br />
               Charter of our liberties which she granted to 
               <br />
               us, but she never thinks of doing such a 
               <br />
               thing, and we know she will not. Well,
