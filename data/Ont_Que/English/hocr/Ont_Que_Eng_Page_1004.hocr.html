               Mn. J. B. E. DORION—Really, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, if the honorable member for Beau- 
               <br />
               harnois meant what he said, he has given us 
               <br />
               something new. But I do not believe he is 
               <br />
               really serious when he tells us that we should 
               <br />
               wait until the constitutions of the local gov- 
               <br />
               ernments are submitted to us, before judging 
               <br />
               of the merits of the resolutions now before 
               <br />
               us. However, supposing him tobe perfectly 
               <br />
               in earnest, and that he had no intention of 
               <br />
               triﬂing, as he sometimes does, does he fancy 
               <br />
               for one moment that we are going to accept 
               <br />
               the reasons he brings forward to induce us to 
               <br />
               vote against an appeal to the people ? If so, 
               <br />
               he is very much mistaken. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               can easily understand that he is embarrassed, 
               <br />
               and that he should shield himself even under 
               <br />
               weak arguments in voting against the motion 
               <br />
               in amendment, for hc promised at two elec- 
               <br />
               toral meetings to vote for an appeal to the 
               <br />
               people. (Hear, hear.) He says he will not 
               <br />
               vote for an appeal to the people, because he is 
               <br />
               not acquainted with the details of the mea- 
               <br />
               sure ; but why, then, does he vote on the 
               <br />
               main motion without knowing these details ? 
               <br />
               He knows that the Government have told us 
               <br />
               that we must vote Confederation before they 
               <br />
               bring down the constitution of the local gov- 
               <br />
               ernments, and that they intended going to 
               <br />
               England to secure the new Constitution, 
               <br />
               without submitting to us the plan of the local 
               <br />
               constitutions. It will be too late when the 
               <br />
               delegates return, and after England has given 
               <br />
               us a new Constitution, to submit the present 
               <br />
               resolutions to the people. (Hear, hear.) And 
               <br />
               if we can judge here of this grand scheme of 
               <br />
               Confederation—as the hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says—</span> 
               <br />
               without having before us the details of the 
               <br />
               organization of the local governments, why 
               <br />
               should not the peOple, in like manner, be af-

               forded an opportunity of recording their opin- 
               <br />
               ion of the scheme ? The reasons advanced 
               <br />
               by the honorable member are utterly futile.

               on this motion,I feel it to be my duty to make a

               few remarks explanatory of the vote I intend 
               <br />
               to give. When I addressed the House the 
               <br />
               other evening, I stated that I had given a 
               <br />
               pledge to my constituents that when the motion 
               <br />
               came up in this House for submitting the 
               <br />
               scheme of a union of the Provinces of British 
               <br />
               North America to the people of this province, 
               <br />
               I would feel it to be my duty to vote for it. 
               <br />
               The language I used was something like this, 
               <br />
               that although I was in favor of the Federation 
               <br />
               of the British North American Provinces, yet 
               <br />
               that as the measure was to affect not only 
               <br />
               those now inhabiting these provinces, but 
               <br />
               others to follow us, I would insist upon it 
               <br />
               that the question should be submitted to 
               <br />
               the people before going into effect, while upon 
               <br />
               the canvass in my riding, I stated that I looked 
               <br />
               upon the resolutions submitted in the light of 
               <br />
               the basis of an agreement that might have 
               <br />
               been entered into by a number of individuals 
               <br />
               desirous of going into a partnership, which no 
               <br />
               one could alter without the consent of the 
               <br />
               others. I was, therefore, not at all surprised 
               <br />
               to hear the Honorable Attorney General West, 
               <br />
               at the opening of the discussion, say that we 
               <br />
               could not change that treaty, that we must 
               <br />
               vote on it in this way—either accept or reject 
               <br />
               it as a whole. It was said that if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peep-1e</span> 
               <br />
               sent me to the House as their representative, 
               <br />
               I would be found voting for their resolutions 
               <br />
               as they were, without seeking to amend them 
               <br />
               in any respect. Although I believed that the 
               <br />
               resolutions would be presented and pressed as 
               <br />
               they stood, I did not believe that no amend- 
               <br />
               ment would ever be made to them ; and 
               <br />
               although the Parliament of Canada has been 
               <br />
               told that it cannot alter the scheme, I am not 
               <br />
               without hope that when the delegation pro- 
               <br />
               ceeds to England,eertain necessary amendment 8 
               <br />
               will be introduced by the Government of Great 
               <br />
               Britain. Now, sir, I consider that to a cer- 
               <br />
               tain extent the members opposed to the details 
               <br />
               of the scheme, but who are disposed to favor 
               <br />
               the general principle, have put their political 
               <br />
               consciences in the hands of the honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen on the Treasury benches; therefore I 
               <br />
               am in hopes that the resolutions will not pass 
               <br />
               into law exactly in the shape in which they 
               <br />
               have been presented to this House. Being 
               <br />
               sent here to represent the people, and feeling 
               <br />
               the matter to be a ve important one, affecting 
               <br />
               very materially the ‘onstitution under which 
               <br />
               they live, I consider it my duty to vote for 
               <br />
               such an amendment as that which has been 
               <br />
               submitted by the honorable member for Peel. 
               <br />
               I was strenghtened in that view of the ease by
