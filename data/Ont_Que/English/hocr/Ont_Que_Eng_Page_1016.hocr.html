               <br />
               sonable to suppose that the American sympa-

               thizers in New Brunswick have been defeated 
               <br />
               at the polls, instead of triumphant. The Hon. 
               <br />
               President of the Council explains the differ- 
               <br />
               ence between Canada and New Brunswick, as 
               <br />
               to the desirability of having new elections, by 
               <br />
               saying that there was a new election there 
               <br />
               because the term of the Legislature was about 
               <br />
               to expire. Well, this would have been our 
               <br />
               last session too, if the Confederation scheme 
               <br />
               had passed, and therefore supposing the Con- 
               <br />
               federation scheme to have gone into operation 
               <br />
               as soon as the Government anticipated it 
               <br />
               would, we should have been exactly in the 
               <br />
               same position as New Brunswick in relation 
               <br />
               to a new election. The same reasons for 
               <br />
               having- a new election there exist here, and 
               <br />
               there is no better reason to be assigned for 
               <br />
               refusing to allow the people of Canada to ex- 
               <br />
               press themselves on this project, than there 
               <br />
               was for the Government of New Brunswick to 
               <br />
               refuse a dissolution of the Legislature of that 
               <br />
               province. But while we see the Government 
               <br />
               of that province willing and anxious to give 
               <br />
               the people an opportunity of expressing their 
               <br />
               will, how differently are the people of Canada 
               <br />
               treated ! (Hear, hear.) The Hon. President 
               <br />
               of the Council has alluded to a majority of 
               <br />
               the French-Canadians being in favor of the 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme. I ﬁnd by the vote 
               <br />
               that twenty-six voted in favor of it, and twen- 
               <br />
               ty-two against. Among the twenty-six were 
               <br />
               three members of the Administration who 
               <br />
               propounded the scheme, and were so inter- 
               <br />
               ested in the result of the vote, that in all 
               <br />
               fairness they ought not to be counted. De- 
               <br />
               ducting these, the ﬁgures would stand twenty- 
               <br />
               three to twenty-two. —

               MB. J OLY—I think not, because they

               <br />
               Out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twentyosix,</span> there are at least half 
               <br />
               a dozen whose conduct has been condemned 
               <br />
               in the most direct manner by their constitu- 
               <br />
               ents, in public assemblies duly held for the

               <br />
               Rouville, Chambly, L’Assomption, &amp;0. So if 
               <br />
               we take the French-Canadians and place the 
               <br />
               matter in a fair and equitable footing, we will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that they are about e ually divided inthis 
               <br />
               House, and that it is hat to tell whether the

               <br />
               It is impossible to know what the opinions of 
               <br />
               the French-Canadians are at this moment, or 
               <br />

               <br />
               elections. The French-Canadians are nearly a 
               <br />
               million of people, and I think they are en- 
               <br />
               titled to be heard on this scheme as much as 
               <br />
               any of the Lower Provinces; and if for no 
               <br />
               other purpose than to give them an oppor— 
               <br />
               tunity of expressing themselves, there ought 
               <br />
               to be a general election. I say that we have 
               <br />
               been taken by surprise through the rapid 
               <br />
               manner in which this scheme has been intro- 
               <br />
               duced and carried through this House. We 
               <br />
               have been told that because our leaders would 
               <br />
               not agree to any arrangement by which the 
               <br />
               demands of Upper Canada could be met, 
               <br />
               either in whole or in part, the scheme has 
               <br />
               been imposed upon us. If that alternative 
               <br />
               had been presented to us at an earlier day, I 
               <br />
               think it would have been ible for us to 
               <br />
               have met our Upper Can ian friends in a 
               <br />
               scheme of conciliation, agreeing upon a mea- 
               <br />
               sure which, if not satisfactory to all, would, 
               <br />
               at all events, draw as more closely to one 
               <br />
               another. For instance, the principal com- 
               <br />
               plaint is that Upper Canada pays two-thirds 
               <br />
               of the taxes, and is allowed to have control of 
               <br />
               only one-half the money contributed by those 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes.</span> I will not say that I would grant re- 
               <br />
               presentation by population rather than be 
               <br />
               forced to accept the Confederation scheme; 
               <br />
               but I can say that I ﬁnd the claim of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, in reference to the ﬁnances, perfectly 
               <br />
               fair and just, and I only rise to express my 
               <br />
               Opinion, as one of the members of this House, 
               <br />
               to that effect. I would be quite willing to 
               <br />
               enter into some arrangement that would give 
               <br />
               to Upper Canada a greater proportion of the 
               <br />
               expenditure, in proportion to its population, 
               <br />
               and stake my chances of reëlection upon that 
               <br />
               declaration. (Hear, hear.) I dare say that 
               <br />
               many in Upper Canada would not bequite 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with that; but for my part, I do not 
               <br />
               feel that I have a right to offer more. I 
               <br />
               merely wish to show that Lower Canadians 
               <br />
               are not so lost to all sense of justice as not 
               <br />
               to recognise the correctness of that principle, 
               <br />
               and are not so much opposed to the making 
               <br />
               of some concessions as many of the people of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada seem to imagine. If we had 
               <br />
               been informed as to what was coming, 1 think 
               <br />
               we certainly should have gone into some ar- 
               <br />
               rangement towards suiting the views of Up- 
               <br />
               per Canada, by increasing her share of con- 
               <br />
               trol on the revenue, rather than be compelled 
               <br />
