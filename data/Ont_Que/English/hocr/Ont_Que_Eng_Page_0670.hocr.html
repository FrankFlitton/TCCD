               knowing that the Hon. Mr. TILLEY has been 
               <br />
               defeated. (Ironical cheers.) I repeat that I 
               <br />
               have experienced to-day a considerable degree 
               <br />
               of hap iness in announcing that the man who,

               at the ead of the Government of New Brun- 
               <br />

               exceeded the authority with which he was

               was sent to Charlottetown to o tain—the man

               who went throughout the length and breadth

               faith of the then Canadian Government—I 
               <br />
               say I have happiness in announcing that he

               he made the charge of bad faith against the

               <br />
               Hon. Mr. TUPPER that the agreement of 1862 
               <br />
               respecting the Intercolonial Railway was to
