               <br />
               null as regards the Canon law and the law of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. There are ecclesiastical au- 
               <br />
               thorities in Upper Canada just as there are in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, but as the Civil law there is 
               <br />
               not the same as it is here, the couple whose 
               <br />
               marriage would be void under the Canon law 
               <br />
               but not under the Civil law—for in the eyes 
               <br />
               of the law the marriage would be valid and 
               <br />
               binding, and neither husband nor wife could 
               <br />
               remarry without having obtained a divorce— 
               <br />
               the couple, I say, would have the right of ap- 
               <br />
               plying to Parliament, who might legally de-

               declared by the ecclesiastical authorities. 
               <br />
               But the nullity of the marriage must ﬁrst be 
               <br />
               proved to the satisfaction of the ecclesiastical 
               <br />
               authorities and under the Canon law, and 
               <br />
               then Parliament might annul it on that evi—

               with the local governments. I think that 
               <br />
               danger lies in the provision that the General 
               <br />
               Government is to appoint all our judges. It 
               <br />
               is said, as the Honorable Attorney General 
               <br />
               East stated the other day, that there will be 
               <br />
               French-Canadians in the Executive of the 
               <br />
               Federal Government, but their number will 
               <br />
               be limited, and if the Executive is composed 
               <br />
               of ﬁfteen members for instance, there will 
               <br />
               only be one or two French-Canadians at the 
               <br />
               most. Well, suppose the French-Canadian 
               <br />
               Ministers recommend the appointment of a 
               <br />
               person as judge, and that all thcir colleagues 
               <br />
               oppose it, the former will have the right to 
               <br />
               protest, but the majority will carry the day, 
               <br />
               and all that the minority can do will he to 
               <br />
               retire from the Government. But in that 
               <br />
               case they will be replaced, and things will go 
               <br />
               on as before. That is all. The same argu- 
               <br />
               ment applies to the appointment of legislative 
               <br />
               councillors; and when I call to mind all the 
               <br />
               injustices committed by the Legislative Coun- 
               <br />
               cil of Lower Canada, which was nominated 
               <br />
               by the Crown and in a spirit hostile to the 
               <br />
               great mass of the population, I cannot con- 
               <br />
               eeive that French-Canadians can be found 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               tem which closed our common schools, by re-
