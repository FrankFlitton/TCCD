               tion we should have occupied under a legis-

               <br />
               the Federal Legislature is vested with the 
               <br />
               power of legislating, not only on the question 
               <br />
               of marriage and divorce, but also on the 
               <br />
               civil rights of the French-Canadians. It 
               <br />
               can. whenever it chooses, attack our civil 
               <br />
               laws. The hon. member for Montmorenc 
               <br />
               admits that the 43rd clause, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paragraph</span> 
               <br />
               15, assure the protection of our civil rights, 
               <br />
               and says that if that portion of the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions had not been inserted, the local legisla- 
               <br />
               tures would alone have had the right to deal 
               <br />
               with the matter. Mr. SPEAKER, a single 
               <br />
               glance at our civil code is sufﬁcient to con- 
               <br />
               vince any one of this. Under article 74 of 
               <br />
               title 5, I ﬁnd the following :_“ Marriage is 
               <br />
               dissolved solely by the natural death at one 
               <br />
               of the parties; so long as they both live, it 
               <br />
               is indissoluble.” If it be true that our 
               <br />
               French civil law declares that marriage can- 
               <br />
               not be dissolved by any means whatsoever, nor 
               <br />
               by any authority; if the right of legislating 
               <br />
               on marriage and divorce had not been left 
               <br />
               to the General Legislature, no person could 
               <br />
