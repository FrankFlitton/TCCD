               <br />
               they and we can all feel an honest pride. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hen,</span> hear.) They will not feel as we have 
               <br />
               hitherto done, doubtful how long our system 
               <br />
               of constitutional government, and the bless- 
               <br />
               ings ﬂowing from it, were to last. I trust. 
               <br />
               therefore, that the formation of a stable 
               <br />
               government, and the devising of a system 
               <br />
               of emigration that will be attractive to the 
               <br />
               people of England, Ireland and Scotland, 
               <br />
               will do a vast deal to keep up that constant 
               <br />
               attachment to the Mother Countr which we 
               <br />
               all desire to see strengthened. ( ear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We shall then not only have the ordinary 
               <br />
               motive to present to emigrants, of self- 
               <br />
               interest—the opportunity to make money 
               <br />
               merely, but the other interest of attachment 
               <br />
               in a permanent way, to the soil, without a 
               <br />
               desire to go back to the Mother Country after 
               <br />
               a competence shall have been gained—for 
               <br />
               the sentiment of nationality will soon take 
               <br />
               root among us. Now, sir, I think that so 
               <br />
               far as the danger of union leading to 
               <br />
               independence is concerned, those who are 
               <br />
               most earnest in desiring to perpetuate the 
               <br />
               union, need not have much apprehension. 
               <br />
               But, it may be said, that from the necessity 
               <br />
               of our position there is danger that we shall 
               <br />
               feel our material and commercial interests 
               <br />
               so strongly bound up with the United States, 
               <br />
               and feel so reliant in our own strength as a 
               <br />
               great country, that we will eventually form a 
               <br />
               closer alliance with that republic than any 
               <br />
               of us desire, and that the formation of the 
               <br />
               present union is the ﬁrst step towards 
               <br />
               annexation. I do not think we need have 
               <br />
               any tears on that score. I do not think our 
               <br />
               interests would lead us in that direction. At 
               <br />
               the present time we are almost entirely 
               <br />
               dependent upon the United States commer- 
               <br />
               cially. We are dependent upon them for 
               <br />
               an outlet to the ocean during the winter 
               <br />
               months. If they choose to suspend the 
               <br />
               bonding system, or by a system of consular 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certiﬁcates</span> make it practically useless; if 
               <br />
               they abolish the reciprocity treaty, and 
               <br />
               carry the passport system to a greater degree 
               <br />
               of stringency, we should feel our dependence 
               <br />
               upon that country even in a greater and 
               <br />
               much more practical way than we do at the 
               <br />
               present time. And perhaps, sir, it is worth 
               <br />
               our while to consider whether this may not 
               <br />
               be the real motive which dictates the policy 
               <br />
               theyare now pursuing! (Hear, hear.) But,

               perceive no one element of danger to us in 
               <br />
               this union. I certainly did try, during the 
               <br />
               many months in which the process of incuba-

               <br />

               tion to its various phases as I possibly could. 
               <br />
               I looked upon it, I confess, with suspicion at 
               <br />
               the outset; I felt it was launching us into 
               <br />
               an unknown future, and that we were 
               <br />
               changing a system, that we got along with 
               <br />
               in comparatively a satisfactory manner, for 
               <br />
               one that was, in some of its aspects, new 
               <br />
               under the British Constitution. I say now, 
               <br />
               however, after giving to it the fullest consid— 
               <br />
               eration I am capable of giving, that I do not 
               <br />
               see, in any one respect, how the cementing 
               <br />
               of these colonies together in the bonds of 
               <br />
               government can tend to make us independent 
               <br />
               of Great Britain If I did, I should feel it 
               <br />
               my duty to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> a most uncompromising 
               <br />
               opposition, and to endeavor to defeat it by 
               <br />
               every means in my power. But, sir, I do see 
               <br />
               a great danger the other way. I see that if 
               <br />
               we remain a mere congeries of isolated colo-

               nies, hostile in some degree to each others’ 
               <br />
               interests, there is danger ahead. I see 
               <br />
               that danger existing and threatening us in 
               <br />
               the United States. I see that if we do not 
               <br />
               unite and form one Central Government, 
               <br />
               giving it the power to direct all the physical

               tion may be necessary, that we are liable to 
               <br />
               be overrun by that power. And this I con-
