               that, when he enters into the province of

               one who is familiar with the doctrine of 
               <br />

               discretion under the circumstances. But 
               <br />
               then he must do so within the trust that is 
               <br />
               given him and not beyond the trust.

               HON. MR. SANBORN-—My hon. friend

               Canada to change the constitution of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               that act does not cover his ar ument, will

               purpose when the constitution of this 11 ouse

               HON. MB. SANBORN—We must feel 
               <br />
               that, according to the rules of law, we are 
               <br />
               asked here to go beyond the duties which 
               <br />
               our electors sent us into this House to dis- 
               <br />
               charge. I contend that neither any act on 
               <br />
               our own Statute Book, nor any Imperial Act, 
               <br />
               authorizes us to assume that they elected us . 
               <br />
               to come here to demolish the whole fabric of 
               <br />
               our Constitution; and to seek to form another 
               <br />
               and entirely different political system, em- 
               <br />
               bracing a number of other provinces, so that 
               <br />
               our identity is entirely swamped and lost. 
               <br />
               I must say that, if my hon. friend feels 
               <br />
               bound at all by the trust committed to him 
               <br />
               by those who sent him here as a representa- 
               <br />
               tive of the people, I conceive he is neces- 
               <br />
               sarily bound to this, that he must sustain 
               <br />
               the elective principle with regard to the 
               <br />
               constitution of the proposed Legislative 
               <br />
               Council. It is impossible, I think, to arrive 
               <br />
               at any other conclusion. (Hear, hear.) M 
               <br />
               hon. friend made use of one ex ression, wit 
               <br />
               apparently some degree of re uctance—the 
               <br />
               term “ buncombe.” I think that was sug- 
               <br />
               gestive, and very suggestive. For, if those 
               <br />
               who are favoring this principle favor it for 
               <br />
               What my hon. friend characterizes as “ bun- 
               <br />
               combe,” then they are seeking popularity 
               <br />
               with the people—they are seeking what the 
               <br />
               people want—(hear, hear)—and that argu- 
               <br />
               ment certainly does not avail my hon. friend 
               <br />
               in his present position ; for he maintains 
               <br />
               that the people fully understand this thing, 
               <br />
               and want it. If this be the case—if the 
               <br />
               whole Province of Canada is bent upon hav- 
               <br />
               ing this scheme—then those who are trying 
               <br />
               to resist it are standing alone, and are either 
               <br />
               acting patriotically, or are beside themselves. 
               <br />
               They cannot certainly be acting from any 
               <br />
               desire to obtain opularity, because, accord- 
               <br />
               ing to my hon. riend, they are just doing 
               <br />
               what the people do not want them to do. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I know that the position of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend is somewhat embarrassing. 
               <br />
               He resides in a section of the province. 
               <br />
               where he feels there is a dilliculty that needs 
               <br />
               to be removed in some way or other; and 
               <br />
               he is now endeavoring to show that the best 
               <br />
               means of removing that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculty</span> is to em- 
               <br />
               brace a great many other difﬁculties of a 
               <br />
               huge character, and of which we cannot 
               <br />
               fully comprehend the consequences. When 
               <br />
               an hon. gentleman is prepared to take that 
               <br />
               ground, I think it would be better for him 
               <br />
               to take it in silence, than to attempt to sus- 
               <br />
               tain it by reason. As regards Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span>
