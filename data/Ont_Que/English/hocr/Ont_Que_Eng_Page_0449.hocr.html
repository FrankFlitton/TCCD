               <br />
               agitation among a portion of the community

               for makin a new canal from Toronto to the 
               <br />

               not thinkit ever can be; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">evenifitcouldbeﬁ</span> 
               <br />
               it is entirely beyond our resources at the 
               <br />
               present time. I am convinced that the true 
               <br />
               route for a canal (if a new one should be un- 
               <br />
               dertaken) to the Georgian Bay is up the 
               <br />
               Ottawa, because that would be giving a great 
               <br />
               backbone to the country. If we had a ﬁne 
               <br />
               canal, capable of carrying vessels of war in 
               <br />
               that direction, it would be a splendid means 
               <br />
               of defence, as well as a great highway for the 
               <br />
               commercial products of the west. Of course 
               <br />
               I know this to be impossible at the present 
               <br />
               time, but I think it exceedingly desirable that 
               <br />
               we should press on the attention of the Gov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               whatever in arriving at a conclusion as to the 
               <br />
               comparative cost. The route that is most 
               <br />
               feasible——that alluded to by the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Richelieu—the northern or eastern 
               <br />
               route by the Bay of Chaleurs, is about 655 
               <br />
               miles from Halifax to Quebec. It is already 
               <br />
               constructed to Truro, some 55 miles from 
               <br />
               Halifax, and from Quebec 140 miles to 
               <br />
               Rivière du Loup. This will leave nearly 400 
               <br />
               miles to be built. Major ROBINSON estimates 
               <br />
               the cost of the road at about £7,000 per mile, 
               <br />
               or about £2,800,000 altogether. I do not 
               <br />
               think, judging from the statement he gives of 
               <br />
               the grades in the road, the bridges to be built, 
               <br />
               and the material to be found along the line, 
               <br />
               that it is a fair inference that the cost would 
               <br />
               equal the amount he sets down. The charac- 
               <br />
               ter of the ground over which the road will 
               <br />
               pass is very similar to the railways of Canada.
