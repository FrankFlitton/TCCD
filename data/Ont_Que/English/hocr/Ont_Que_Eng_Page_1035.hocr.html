               lation—“ No man with Anglo-Saxon blood 
               <br />
               in his veins will submit to the present

               <br />
               yet he accuses us now of taking hasty 
               <br />
               action in this matter. When the MACDON- 
               <br />
               ALD-SIOOTTE Administration was formed, he 
               <br />
               devoted himself to denouncing the Hon. Pro- 
               <br />
               vincial Secretary, who was then Commissioner 
               <br />
               of Crown Lands. He used all his power in 
               <br />
               abusing that gentleman, and he prophesied 
               <br />
               what the result would be when that gentle- 
               <br />
               man appeared again before the people of Up- 
               <br />
               per Canada. l gave my opinion plainly at 
               <br />
               the time, and I do not believe that any per- 
               <br />
               son used such strong language as the honor- 
               <br />
               able gentleman himself. The question had 
               <br />
               come to be one that must be settled in one 
               <br />
               way or the other. It was quite clear to me 
               <br />
               for one, and to the people of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               that the Federation project was the only thing 
               <br />
               we could have to remedy the state of affairs 
               <br />
               in which they were placed. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               But I had forgotten one point in regard to 
               <br />
               the Coalition arrangements being made to 
               <br />
               carry on the public aﬂ‘airs. When the liber- 
               <br />
               al members held a meeting to consider the 
               <br />
               prepositions made by their Government, the 
               <br />
               honorable member lor Cornwall attended and 
               <br />
               took an active part in the business of the 
               <br />
               meeting, and heartily approved of the pro- 
               <br />
               ject. lie declined, it is true, to vote yea or 
               <br />
               nay on the ﬁrst resolution, approving the policy 
               <br />
               proposed, but that was merely because the re- 
               <br />
               solution was so worded as to expressly approve 
               <br />
               of M r. BROWN’S share in the perfecting of the 
               <br />
               arrangements made. This is proved by the 
               <br />
               terms of the second resolution, which was 
               <br />
               moved by the honorable member for Cornwall 
               <br />
               himself. (Hear, hear.) _ The motion was in 
               <br />
               the following terms—_“ That the proposition 
               <br />
               for at least three members of the Opposition 
               <br />
               entering the Government be accepted.” Mr. 
               <br />
               MACKENZIE of Lambton, moved in amend— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment—“</span> That the proposition for three mem— 
               <br />
               bers of the Opposition entering the Cabinet be 
               <br />
               rejected, and that the proposition for the 
               <br />
               settlement of our sectional difﬁculties receive 
               <br />
               an outside support.” The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment</span> only 
               <br />
               received eleven votes; the eloquence of the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Cornwall carried the 
               <br />
               meeting against my resolution. That honor— 
               <br />
               able gentleman also moved the third resolu- 
               <br />
               tion, as follows—“That it is all-important that 
               <br />
               Mr. BROWN should be one of the party to 
               <br />
               enter the Cabinet.” Only three gentlemen— 
               <br />
               viz., Hon. Mr. Bnows and Messrs. BUBWELL 
               <br />

               sir, if the honorable member was sincere 
               <br />
               then, how are we to account for his course 
               <br />

               (Hear, hear.) Considering the part that 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman had in organizing the 
               <br />
               Government, it did seem very extraordinary 
               <br />
               that he should have repeatedly reproached 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen opposite with having 
               <br />

               HON. MB. BROWN—Hear, hear.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               MB. A. MACKENZIE—Was it possible 
               <br />
               that he urged the formation of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment with a view to destroy the liberals who 
               <br />
               had entered it ? I believed then that the best 
               <br />
               course to pursue was to give the Conservative 
               <br />
               Government a thorough outside support. I 
               <br />
               have always had a strong objection to party 
               <br />
               coalitions. I felt then, as I do now, that they 
               <br />
               may lead to later results not foreseen at the 
               <br />
               time, and all that I wished was that the 
               <br />
               Liberal party should give their support to the 
               <br />
               Administration for the purpose for which it 
               <br />
               was formed, that support to cease when the 
               <br />
               object should be accomplished. The honor- 
               <br />
               able member for Cornwall thought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘erently,</span> 
               <br />
               and I do not think it becomes that hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man to get up now and denounce those hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen for the course they have taken.

               He is not able to say that he did not vote. 
               <br />
               He voted as here recorded, and with the 
               <br />
               desire that I have always had to have every-

               thing of this kind recorded to prevent future 
               <br />
               misunderstanding, I took the trouble to 
               <br />
               have a certiﬁed copy of the proceedings, from 
               <br />
               which I have just quoted. When any hon— 
               <br />
               orable member took that course in the cauciis, 
               <br />
               I think he was clearly bound to adhere to the 
               <br />
               same course. (Hear, hear.)

               DR. PARKER—Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brennan,</span> 1 had 
               <br />
               some intention of voting for the resolution 
               <br />
               in your hands, sir, until I heard the speech 
               <br />
               of the mover, the hon. member for Peel; but 
               <br />
               that gentleman has quite convinced me that 
               <br />
               I ought not to do so. (Hear and laughter.) 
               <br />
               He proved most conclusively that the pro- 
               <br />
               posed Confederation was in itself a most 
               <br />
               satisfactory and desirable measure, and that 
               <br />
               the internal state of these provinces, as well as 
               <br />
               the threatening aspect of foreign affairs, were 
               <br />
               conclusive reasons for its immediate adoption. 
               <br />
               Defences, he told us, were immediately re- 
               <br />
               quired, and that they could only be made 
               <br />
               eﬁ'ective by ﬁrst uniting the provinces. 
               <br />
               Accepting this argument and others advanced 
               <br />
               by that hon. member, the conclusion is that 
               <br />
               the necessity for Confederation is imperative 
               <br />
               and immediate. But, sir, how does this
