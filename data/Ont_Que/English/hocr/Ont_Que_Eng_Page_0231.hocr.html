               HON. MB. CHRISTIE—Like other hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have preceded me, I am over- 
               <br />
               come with the importance of this subject; 
               <br />
               and I would fail in my duty were I to give 
               <br />
               a silent vote on the very grave question now 
               <br />
               before the House. I feel that, in the lan- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guage</span> of my hon. friend from the Eastern 
               <br />
               Division, it is a question of the greatest possi- 
               <br />
               ble importance; and I think the House has 
               <br />
               great reason to congratulate itself on the man- 
               <br />
               ner in which the discussion of it has been 
               <br />
               approached—in the way in which it has been 
               <br />
               treated, both by the friends of the resolutions 
               <br />
               and by those who have opposed them. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Difference of opinion there must be 
               <br />
               on all great public questions. ( Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It is idle to expect that we should all be 
               <br />
               agreed on this any more than on any other 
               <br />
               great public question ; and after all, the most 
               <br />
               correct judgment, which can be formed on 
               <br />
               any occasion, is but an approximation to the 
               <br />
               truth. (Hear, hear.) All those who have 
               <br />
               preceded us in the work of constitution- 
               <br />
               making, have left, on the structures which 
               <br />
               they have erected, the impress of that at- 
               <br />
               tribute-which prevades humanity—imperfec- 
               <br />
               tion. We have a very lamentable instance 
               <br />
               of this in the case of our neighbors on the 
               <br />
               southern side of the line. As was well said, 
               <br />
               by a prominent member of the Government 
               <br />
               in another place, the Constitution of the 
               <br />
               United States “was one of the most wonder- 
               <br />
               ful works of the human intellect—one of the 
               <br />
               most marvellous efforts of skill and organiza- 
               <br />
               tion that ever governed a free people. But 
               <br />
               to say that it was perfect would be wrong.” 
               <br />
               The wonder is that men with the limited 
               <br />
               amount of experience which its authors 
               <br />
               possessed, should have framed such an in- 
               <br />
               strument. It has stood many rude tests, 
               <br />
               and but for the existence in the social com- 
               <br />
               pact of our American friends, of an element 
               <br />
               in direct antagonism to the whole genius of 
               <br />
               their system—negro slavery—the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of the United States would have con- 
               <br />
               tinued to withstand—yes, and after the 
               <br />
               extinction of that element, will continue to 
               <br />
               withstand—all the artillery which their own 
               <br />
               or foreign despotism can array against it. 
               <br />
               Their institutions have the same features 
               <br />
               with our own. There are some points of 
               <br />
               variance; but the same rest principle is 
               <br />
               the basis of both—that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liga,</span> liberty and the

               pursuit of happiness are the unalienable 
               <br />

               <br />
               governments are instituted among men, 
               <br />
               deriving their just powers from the consent 
               <br />
               of the overned. This is the secret of the 
               <br />
               strengt of the British Constitution, and 
               <br />
               without a free and full recognition of it,no 
               <br />
               government can be strong or permanent. I 
               <br />
               am free to admit that the scheme before us 
               <br />
               has some defects, which, in my judgment, 
               <br />
               will mar its well-working; but, at the same 
               <br />
               time, I am conﬁdent that, if it should be- 
               <br />
               come law, these defects can and will be 
               <br />
               remedied. The gentlemen composing ama- 
               <br />
               jority of the Conference, who were the 
               <br />
               authors of these resolutions, honestly thought 
               <br />
               that their views were right, but the time will 
               <br />
               come when they or their successors will see 
               <br />
               that they were wrong, and the errors will be 
               <br />
               rectiﬁed. We are told the resolutions must 
               <br />
               be either accepted or rejected. Therefore, 
               <br />
               the question which we must solve is, whether 
               <br />
               these defects are so serious as to render it 
               <br />
               our duty to reject them, or are the advantages 
               <br />
               likely to result from their adoption more 
               <br />
               than equivalent to the drawbacks. I hold 
               <br />
               that the substitution of appointment by the 
               <br />
               Crown for the elective rinciple, in this 
               <br />
               Chamber, is a great o jection. I have 
               <br />
               always been an advocate of the elective prin- 
               <br />
               ciple ; still I shrink from the responsibility 
               <br />
               of voting against the scheme because of 
               <br />
               that objection. (Hear, hear.) We had 
               <br />
               reached a condition almost bordering on 
               <br />
               anarchy ; and I am sure from the conﬂict of 
               <br />
               passions that prevailed—and it is not my 
               <br />
               design to blame one political party or the 
               <br />
               other for it, I simply state a fact, freely con- 
               <br />
               ceded by bcth parties—that a state of things 
               <br />
               existed for which a remedy of some kind must 
               <br />
               be found. And it is a cheering fact that in the 
               <br />
               midst of this state of things we have found 
               <br />
               men patriotic enough to merge former dif- 
               <br />
               ferences and unite together for the purpose 
               <br />
               of framing a Constitution which will secure 
               <br />
               exemption from the evils under which we 
               <br />
               have labored. And although it may entail 
               <br />
               —I am not here to state that it will not en- 
               <br />
               tail—additional cost upon the country, yet 
               <br />
               that is not a valid argument against the adop- 
               <br />
               tion of the scheme. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               House and the country have to take this into 
               <br />
               consideration, whether, if it be rejected, we 
               <br />
               can devise a plan better ﬁtted to extricate us 
               <br />
               from our present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁcnlties,</span> and which will
