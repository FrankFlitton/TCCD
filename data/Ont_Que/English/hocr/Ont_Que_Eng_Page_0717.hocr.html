               hear.) The hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hoehelg</span> 
               <br />
               told us that the Constitution of the Belgian 
               <br />
               Senate is less conservative than that of the 
               <br />

               the members of the Belgian Senate are in

               part changed every four years. To this I 
               <br />
               reply, that the conservative principle may he 
               <br />
               found elsewhere than in the manner of select- 
               <br />

               <br />
               in Belgium it is found in the excessively 
               <br />
               high standard of qualiﬁcation which is re-

               everywhere few in number, can aspire to 
               <br />
               enter it. In Belgium the Constitution re- 
               <br />
               quires that there shall be one man qualiﬁed 
               <br />

               and that man must pay one thousand ﬂorils 
               <br />
               of direct taxes. Will it be said that the 
               <br />
               Belgian Senate, so constituted, is not more 
               <br />
               conservative than our Legislative Council

               will be—the Belgian Senate, in‘whieh none 
               <br />
               can sit but very rich men and large landed 
               <br />
               proprietors ? (Hear, hear.) I. am answered 
               <br />
               that one-half this Senate is renewed every 
               <br />
               four years, and that the Crown may dissolve 
               <br />
               it at pleasure. But can the Crown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revert</span> 
               <br />
