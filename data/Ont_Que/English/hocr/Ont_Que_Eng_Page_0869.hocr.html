               HON. Ma. LAFRAMBOISE—I think 
               <br />
               that the plan conceived by Lord <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DURHAM</span> 
               <br />
               was that of a legislative union and a Con- 
               <br />
               federation of all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> North American 
               <br />
               Provinces. We are about to begin with 
               <br />
               Confederation, but we shall ﬁnish with a 
               <br />
               legislative union. Confederation, as has 
               <br />
               been well observed by that eminent states- 
               <br />
               man, is the ﬁrst step to a legislative union.
