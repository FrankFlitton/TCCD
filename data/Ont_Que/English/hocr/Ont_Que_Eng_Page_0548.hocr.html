               touched on these in another connexion; but 
               <br />
               they call for some further notice, and in 
               <br />
               giving it them, I will try not to repeat myselt'. 
               <br />
               Judging from much of the language which 
               <br />
               we have heard on the ﬂoor of this House, one 
               <br />
               would suppose we must be on the verge of a 
               <br />
               war with the United States. For my part, I 
               <br />
               believe nothing of the kind. But if we 
               <br />
               were, would it be at all the right thing for 
               <br />
               us to abstain from the more pressing ques- 
               <br />
               tions of our defences and the organization of 
               <br />
               the militia, and to be instead discussing here 
               <br />
               these plans of a Federal Union, Provincial 
               <br />
               Constitutions, and I know not what? These 
               <br />
               we are called upon, I admit, to discuss 
               <br />
               in a tremendous hurry, to settle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off-hand,</span> in 
               <br />
               workable or unworkable shape, nobody seem- 
               <br />
               ing to know or to care which, everybody 
               <br />
               professing to hope that all will come right 
               <br />
               in the end, whether he thinks it will or not. 
               <br />
               But, sir, I say again, if war were imminent 
               <br />
               with the United States, the one question for 
               <br />
               us would be the state of our defences, the 
               <br />
               organization of our militia, how much Eng- 
               <br />
               land can do for us, how much we can do for 
               <br />
               ourselves, how much England and we, each 
               <br />
               of us, are to undertake to do together. That 
               <br />
               isnot the question at the present time at 
               <br />
               all, and I therefore take it that the outcry 
               <br />
               raised in connection with this scheme, about 
               <br />
               our defences and the militia, is just so much 
               <br />
               buncombe. (Hear, hear.) If honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite believed in it, I am cer- 
               <br />
               tain that the pressing question would be 
               <br />
               taken up ﬁrst. Further, if such danger 
               <br />
               were not even pretty far <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">03,</span> I for one 
               <br />
               _Would be disposed to think that the tak-

               tlons comes a little late in the day. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> near, real danger of war with the 
               <br />
               United States, it would be quite too late 
               <br />
               for us to be sitting here, gravely discussing 
               <br />
               a political union, to be consummated months 
               <br />
               hence, at soonest, and then only to lead to 
               <br />
               the construction of railways which will take 
               <br />
               years, and defences which cannot be put in 
               <br />
               order for months or years, and to future 
               <br />
               developments of all kinds, which it will take 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> on years to carry out. If war, I say, 
               <br />
               18 Imminent, these ulterior undertakings, 
               <br />
               though begun now, would be begun all too 
               <br />
               late. Whenever there is such danger, our 
               <br />
               defence will not be found in the making of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federal</span> or other constitutions, or in paper 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dlﬁplay</span> of any kind, but must be found in

               of the Mother Country, and backed with all 
               <br />
               the power she can bring to bear upon the 
               <br />
               conﬂict. Supposing that time come, we 
               <br />
               have plenty of governing machinery for 
               <br />
               that defence. We do not need, in order 
               <br />
               to it, a viceroy and court, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> lieutenant-

               goveruors, and all the complicated political 
               <br />
               apparatus of this scheme. We could get 
               <br />
               along just as well under our present system, 
               <br />
               and I think better. Certainly, if modiﬁed 
               <br />
               as I have indicated it might be —if improved 
               <br />
               by the better development of our relations 
               <br />
               to the Empire—the system which would 
               <br />
               thence result would be as good as that here 
               <br />
               offered for our acceptance—indeed, would be 
               <br />
               much better. But, sir, the real danger is 
               <br />
               not of war with the UnitedStates. It is 
               <br />
               from what I may call their paciﬁc hostility 
               <br />
               —-from trouble to be wrought by them within 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               custom-house annoyances—passport annoy- 
               <br />
               ances ; from their fomenting difﬁculties 
               <br />
               here, and taking advantage of our local 
               <br />
               jealousies ; from the multiplied worries 
               <br />
               the may cause us by a judicious alternation 
               <br />
               of ullying and coaxing, the thousand inci- 
               <br />
               dents which may easily be made to happen if 
               <br />
               things are not going on quite well in this 
               <br />
               country, and the people and government of the 
               <br />
               States are minded to make us feel the conse- 
               <br />
               quences of our not getting on quite so well as 
               <br />
               we might. Whether the union of the States 
               <br />
               is restored or not, this kind of thing can go on. 
               <br />
               The danger is, that either the whole United 
               <br />
               States, or those portions of the United States 
               <br />
               which are near us, and which are really stronger 
               <br />
               than we are, and enterprising enough and am- 
               <br />
               bitious enough, and not very fond of us, and 
               <br />
               not at all fond of the Mother Country, not at 
               <br />
               all unwilling to strike a blow at her and to 
               <br />
               make us subservient to their own interest and 
               <br />
               ambition—the danger is, I say, that the United 
               <br />
               States, or those portions of the United States 
               <br />
               near us, may avail themselves of every oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity to perplex us, to embroil us in trouble, 
               <br />
               to make us come within the disturbing in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuences of their strong local attraction.— 
               <br />
               Now, to pretend to tell me that the United

               States or the Northern States, whichever you 
               <br />
               please, are going to be frightened, from a 
               <br />
               policy of that kind, by our taking upon our- 
               <br />
               selves great airs, and forming ourselves <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1nto_a</span>
