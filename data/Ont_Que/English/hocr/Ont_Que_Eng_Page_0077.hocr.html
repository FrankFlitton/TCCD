               Grown WASHINGTON; and not only so, but 
               <br />
               when the Americans came as invaders, they 
               <br />
               fought against the armed forces of ARNOLD, 
               <br />
               MONTGOMERY and others. (Cheers) At- 
               <br />
               tempts were made to excite hostility to Feder- 
               <br />
               ation on the ground that, under the regime of a 
               <br />
               local legislature, the English Protestant minor- 
               <br />
               ity would not be fairly dealt with. He thought 
               <br />
               the way in which the French Canadians had 
               <br />
               stood by British connection, when there were 
               <br />
               but few British in the province, was a proof 
               <br />
               that they would not attempt to deal unjustly 
               <br />
               now by the British minority, when their num- 
               <br />
               bers were so much greater. On this point, 
               <br />
               appealing to the evidence of history, he would 
               <br />
               ’quote from the work which he had already 
               <br />
               quoted. At a time when there were, perhaps, 
               <br />
               hardly a few hundred English Protestant resi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               name of WASHINGTON, to which he had already 
               <br />
               brieﬂy referred, was circulated throughout 
               <br />
               the country by ABNOLD’s invading army. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman here read a number of ex- 
               <br />
               tracts from General WASHINGTON’S proclama- 
               <br />
               tion, addressed to the inhabitants Of Canada. 
               <br />
               It made the most earnest appeals to the Lower 
               <br />
               Canadians to join the other colonies. “We 
               <br />
               rejoice,” said General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">WASHINGTON,</span> “ that 
               <br />
               our enemies have been deceived with regard to

               ve even dared to say—that the Canadians 
               <br />
               were not capable of distinguishing between the 
               <br />
               blessings of libert and the wretchedness of 
               <br />
               slavery; that gratifying the vanity Of a little

               circle of nobility would blind the people of 
               <br />

               ses had been made by the republican general;

               <br />
               of the French Canadian peOple. There was 
               <br />
               another despatch, or rather proclamation, issued 
               <br />
               in 17 7 8, by Baron D’ESTAING, commander of 
               <br />
               the French ﬂeet, which was acting in aid of 
               <br />
               the American revolutionary party. The 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman read some extracts from 
               <br />
               this proclamation, as follows :—“ I shall not 
               <br />

               <br />
               mired his talents and genius for war, who loved 
               <br />
               his cordiality and frankness, the principal

               characteristics of our nobility, whether there 
               <br />
               be other names in other nations among which 
               <br />
               they would be better pleased to place their own. 
               <br />
               Can the Canadians, who saw the brave MONT- 
               <br />

               of their hands. I shall not Observe to the min-

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               tical indulgence will be lessened proportionably 
               <br />
               as those sovereigns shall have less to fear. I
