               <br />
               have admitted them at once. When 
               <br />
               we approached the question, we found 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces in process of de- 
               <br />

               <br />
               perceived that the Confederation which we 
               <br />
               proposed to them would be much more 
               <br />
               advantageous to all the provinces than that 
               <br />
               upon which they were engaged, and they at 
               <br />
               once consented to accept our proposition.

               been submitted to this House. The hon.

               member for Hochelaga. has, therefore, no 
               <br />
               right to reproach us with having altered the 
               <br />
               plan promised to the House, since it is word 
               <br />
               for word that which we promised. This 
               <br />
               measure, as I observed a short time ago, 
               <br />
               cannot last, unless it protects the interests 
               <br />
               of all. Now, we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> interests in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, in which reside two popula-

               tions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ‘erin</span> g in origin, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁering</span> in religion, 
               <br />
               and speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> languages. On the 
               <br />
               other hand, Upper Canada has a homogeneous 
               <br />
               population, but one professing different 
               <br />
               religions, and so it is with respect to the 
               <br />
               several Maritime Provinces. In these latter 
               <br />
               provinces, also, we have more than one hun- 
               <br />
               dred thousand fellow countrymen of French 
               <br />

               <br />
               care to protect these diﬁ'erent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests,</span> and 
               <br />
               to preserve the rights of this population, by

               us come to an understanding on this word, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER. What we desire and wish, 
               <br />
               .is to defend the general interests of a great 
               <br />
               country and of a powerful nation, by means 
               <br />
               of a central poWer. On the other hand,we 
               <br />
               do not wish to do away with our diﬂ‘erent 
               <br />
               customs, manners and laws; on the contrary,

               protecting in the most complete manner 
               <br />
               by means of Confederation. Under the 
               <br />
               new system there will be no more reason 
               <br />
               than at present to lose our character as
