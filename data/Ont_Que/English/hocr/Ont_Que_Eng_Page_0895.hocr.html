               You seem to forget your words and deeds of 
               <br />
               yesterday. When he occupied a seat on the 
               <br />
               Treasury benches, the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Chateauguay was constantly rising to tell us 
               <br />
               that we were a factions Opposition, a dreadful 
               <br />
               Opposition, because we did not allow the 
               <br />
               Government to do just what they liked. 
               <br />
               But he does not think his own opposition to- 
               <br />
               day factions, he who has risen ﬁfty-ﬁve times 
               <br />
               in the course of this debate, and who cuts up 
               <br />
               every question like fresh butter. He says to- 
               <br />
               day that the Government wishes to choke oﬂ' 
               <br />
               discussion and to prevent the members of the 
               <br />
               Opposition from speaking, and yet he has spo- 
               <br />
               ken ﬁfty-ﬁve times l The hon. member for Lot- 
               <br />
               biniere (MrJOLY) told us, the other day, that 
               <br />
               the people are in a condition of torpor, and 
               <br />
               that they must be awakened. If they are in 
               <br />
               a condition of torpor anywhere, they are cer- 
               <br />
               tainly not so in Lower Canada; but if they 
               <br />
               were, they would undoubtedly be awakened 
               <br />
               by all the ﬁne speeches delivered by honor- 
               <br />
               able members on the other side of the House, 
               <br />
               and on observing the great resistance which 
               <br />
               they oﬁ'er to divorce and their fervent energy 
               <br />
               in maintaining family ties unbroken. Those 
               <br />
               gentlemen loudly proclaim to us that we ought 
               <br />
               not to vote for divorce; but it is quite‘unne- 
               <br />
               cessary for them to tell us so—all Catholics 
               <br />
               are perfectly well aware that it is their duty 
               <br />
               to vote against divorce. W'e know that the 
               <br />
               laws of Parliament cannot prevail over those 
               <br />
               of the Church. And we are not voting for 
               <br />
               divorce in voting for the scheme of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation; and the declamations of hon. members 
               <br />
               on the other side of the House, on this sub- 
               <br />
               ject, cannot carry conviction into the minds 
               <br />
               of any one. Nobody asks us to enact a law 
               <br />
               to allow civil magistrates to celebrate mar- 
               <br />
               riages, and all that is said by the Opposition 
               <br />
               in relation to this question only amounts to a 
               <br />
               tempest in a tea-pot. At any rate we may 
               <br />
               congratulate ourselves upon the conversion of 
               <br />
               hen. members, and now they need only tell 
               <br />
               the truth for the future, and their past sins 
               <br />
               will be forgiven them. However, although 
               <br />
               they constitute themselves the protectors of 
               <br />
               our religion and nationality, it is evident that 
               <br />
               the people do not yet very ﬁrmly believe in

               <br />
               in view of al their ﬁne declarations, will 
               <br />
               probably think that they are going to ally 
               <br />
               themselves with our friends ; but if they do 
               <br />
               not do so, it will then be perceived that they 
               <br />
               are not sincere, and then so much the worse 
               <br />
               for them. In the meantime the people will 
               <br />
               consider the scheme which is submitted to us, 
               <br />
               and will judge it upon its merits, without 
               <br />
               allowing themselves to be led away by 
               <br />
               appeals to prejudices and insinuations made by 
               <br />
               honorable members on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House. I shall, at a later period, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">]:</span> upon 
               <br />
               the question itself, but I will not ollow the 
               <br />
               example of the honorable member for Riche- 
               <br />
               lieu, who gave us along speech with the help of 
               <br />
               GARNEAU‘S History of Canada, which he read 
               <br />
               out nearly from one end to the other. Nor 
               <br />
               will I -utter threats either, and no one 
               <br />
               of us will say, “If matters do not go on in 
               <br />
               this way, or in that, you will see.” In a 
               <br />
               country like ours, we do not say “you will 
               <br />
               see l” To do so is to try to create useless 
               <br />
               excitement among the people, and all honest 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wen</span> should rcprove such conduct. Besides, 
               <br />
               who is the man who has inﬂuence enough 
               <br />
               to raise the people at the present moment? 
               <br />
               Certainly not our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. 
               <br />
               CHERRIER, for he is too peaceable, too devout, 
               <br />
               and too good a Catholic to tell the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian people to rise and ﬁght against the 
               <br />
               scheme of the Government by force of arms. 
               <br />
               No, he will rather tell them to respect 
               <br />
               authority, and claim their rights if they 
               <br />
               consider themselves injured, because he is 
               <br />
               aware that it is better to respect one’s father 
               <br />
               than to ﬁght against him. As to Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               PAPINEAU, that distinguished man has 
               <br />
               undergone mortiﬁcation enough in his public 
               <br />
               life, and feels enough regret for his friends 
               <br />
               and fellow-countrymen who perished at St. 
               <br />
               Denis and elsewhere, to prevent his wishing 
               <br />
               to recommence playing that game. The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Bagot reproached the 
               <br />

               <br />
