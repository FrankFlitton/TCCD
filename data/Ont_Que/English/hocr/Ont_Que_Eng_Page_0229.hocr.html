               much of this law as may appear rational and 
               <br />
               good. I refer to the territorial divisions and 
               <br />
               the propriety of causing them to be repre- 
               <br />
               sented by persons who have vested interests 
               <br />
               therein; and indeed how could any one rep- 
               <br />
               resent with equal devotion and advantage a 
               <br />
               division, as the man who had sacred rights 
               <br />
               therein, whether by personal residence or the 
               <br />
               ownership ‘of the property upon which his 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcation rests, and who clings to it be- 
               <br />
               cause it has descended to him from his an- 
               <br />
               cestor, or because he has acquired it by the 
               <br />
               sweat of his brow, his vigils and his toils? 
               <br />
               I hope it will not be said that I intend by my 
               <br />
               remarks upon this law to dis arage the resi- 
               <br />
               dents in the towns, for the division which I 
               <br />
               have the honor to represent embraces part of 
               <br />
               the most populous city in Canada, and I only 
               <br />
               accepted the charge after the refusal of two 
               <br />
               of its most eminent citizens—eminent equally 
               <br />
               by their large fortunes and their social posi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               learned by their own experience or by that of 
               <br />
               others, that public life did not present suﬂi-

               HON. MR. CURRIE—Before recording 
               <br />
               my vote on the amendment before the House, 
               <br />
               I feel it my duty to say a few words in refer- 
               <br />
               ence to that amendment. I cannot say that I 
               <br />
               altogether concur in the manner in which it is 
               <br />
               drawn, but at the same time I feel called upon, 
               <br />
               as an elected member, to support it. I feel 
               <br />
               that it would ill become me——-that l would be 
               <br />
               hardly discharging my duty to my constitu- 
               <br />
               ents—if I were to sit silently by and give my 
               <br />
               vote to change the Constitution under which I 
               <br />
               was elected. (Hear, hear.) I feel that there 
               <br />
               is something extraordinary in the fourteenth 
               <br />
               of these resolutions before the House, and I 
               <br />
               would like to hear the Government give a 
               <br />
               full explanation as to the manner in which 
               <br />
               that resolution was arrived at in the Conference. 
               <br />
               Bear in mind, honorable gentlemen, that the 
               <br />
               eleventh resolution declares that “the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Legislative Council shall be ap- 
               <br />
               pointed by the Crown under the great seal of 
               <br />
               the General Government, and shall hold oiiice 
               <br />
               during life.” Thus the House will see that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eli</span> this resolution the Crown has the right for

               sent.” Then the fourteenth resolution de- 
               <br />
               clares that “ the ﬁrst selection of the members

               <br />
               qualiﬁed and willing to serve.” Now, honor— 
               <br />
               able gentlemen, I have always understood-— 
               <br />
               my reading of books on constitutional law has 
               <br />
               given me to understand—that the greatest of 
               <br />
               England’s statesmen who have spoken on the 
               <br />
               question of the Royal prerogative, have always 
               <br />
               broadly laid it down as a rule that the prero- 
               <br />
               gative should never and could never be 
               <br />
               'mited. How is it then that these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(thirty-</span> 
               <br />
               three individuals, talented, able and gifted, 
               <br />
               as no doubt they were, who met in the room 
               <br />
               behind me and sat with closed doors, saw ﬁt 
               <br />
               to hamper and cripple the operation of that 
               <br />
               good rule? (Hear, hear.) Should the pre- 
               <br />
               rogative of the Crown in the selection of mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House be limited? It may be 
               <br />
               true that, residing in many of the divisions in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada represented in this House, 
               <br />
               there may be good men, competent men, well 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed men ; but it is equally true that 
               <br />
               there may be just as good, able and talented 
               <br />
               men, outside of them as in it. Why, then, 
               <br />
               should the doors of this House be closed 
               <br />
               against these men ? Why is it, I would like 
               <br />
               to know, that the prerogative of the Crown is 
               <br />
               to be restricted so as to prevent the choice of 
               <br />
               these men ?

               <br />

               <br />
               certain portions of the country. Well, ese

               divisions have been made so as to secure to 
               <br />

               <br />
