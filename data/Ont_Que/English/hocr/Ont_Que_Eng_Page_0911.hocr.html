               For my own part, Mr. SPEAKER, I re-

               <br />

               or dishonest; on the contrary, I am willing 
               <br />
               to believe that they act according to their 
               <br />
               convictions, and with perfect good faith. I 
               <br />
               desire that others will judge me in the same

               matter according to my honest convictions 
               <br />

               <br />
               preservation of that nationality and those 
               <br />
               institutions which have been transmitted to 
               <br />
               us by our fathers, as the reward of so many 
               <br />
               struggles and sacriﬁces. (Hear, hear.) At 
               <br />
               this advanced stage of the debate, it is not 
               <br />
               my intention to combat or discuss all the 
               <br />
               arguments which have been urged in favor 
               <br />

               <br />
               that I have not been convinced by the hon. 
               <br />
               . gentlemen who have spoken before me, that 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maple</span> of Lower Canada; and my Opinion 
               <br />
               on this subject is so ﬁrmly grounded, that I 
               <br />
               should despise myself if, for the sake of not 
               <br />
               separating from my party, I were to vote for 
               <br />
               Confederation, my convictions being so strong 
               <br />
               and so sincere. ( r, hear.) We were taught 
               <br />
               to believe, till Within the last two or three 
               <br />
               days, that the most ample discussion of the 
               <br />
               question would beallowed ; but, by the moving 
               <br />
               of the previous question, the face of things 
               <br />
               has undergone a change. This House, and all 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, supposed that before being 
               <br />
               called upon to vote on the main question, we 
               <br />
               should have had an opportunity of obtaining 
               <br />
               an expression of the opinion of the people. 
               <br />
               I am persuaded that if, after a full and 
               <br />
               complete discussion of the measure in this 
               <br />
               House, the people were called upon for their

               opinion, the would be more decidedly 
               <br />
               opposed to nt‘ederation than they ever 
               <br />
               were to any measure. (Hear.) Unfor- 
               <br />
               tunately, as the previous question has been 
               <br />
               moved, we must vote on the resolutions as 
               <br />
               they stand, without being able even to move 
               <br />
               amendments which might render them less 
               <br />
               objectionable to the country. I now come 
               <br />
               to the appeal to the people. Well, I main- 
               <br />
               tain that in voting to change the constitution 
               <br />
               of the Government, without consulting the 
               <br />
               people on the subject, the members of this 
               <br />
               House are exceeding their powers; and that 
               <br />
               even if the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were.</span> in favor of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, they ought not to pass it,as they 
               <br />
               are now about to do, without special authority. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for South 
               <br />
               Lanark (Mr. MORRIS) has told us that this 
               <br />
               is no new question—that it has been for a 
               <br />
               long time a subject of discussion—that the 
               <br />
               pe0ple understood it thoroughly, and that 
               <br />
               the members of this House were privileged 
               <br />
               to vote on it without referring it to their 
               <br />
               constituents. I am quite aware that much 
               <br />
               has been written on the subject of the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the provinces ; but has the 
               <br />
               question ever been discussed before the 
               <br />
               people at elections ? I am fully convinced 
               <br />
               and perfectly certain this question was never 
               <br />
               brought up at any election, nor the question 
               <br />
               of any Confederation at all. It has never 
               <br />
               been laid before the people, and the people 
               <br />
               have never expressed an opinion on the 
               <br />
               subject. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me 
               <br />
               ' that the amendment which is to be moved 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Peel (Hon. J. 
               <br />
               H. CAMERON), after the present resolutions 
               <br />
               have been voted by the House, will be in a 
               <br />
               singular position. (Hear, hear.) I have 
               <br />
               understood the explanations given by the 
               <br />
               Honorable Attorney General for Upper 
               <br />
               Canada (Hon. J. A. MAODONALD), re- 
               <br />
               lative to the resolution of the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Peel—that the resolutions before 
               <br />
               the House would be passed ﬁrst, and that 
               <br />
               afterwards, when the House went into com— 
               <br />
               mittee, the hon. member for Peel would 
               <br />
               move his amendment, namely, “ that the 
               <br />
               House will vote the Address to Her Majesty 
               <br />
               this evening, in order that the Government 
               <br />
               may despatch it to England tO-morrow, if 
               <br />
               they please, and that on Monday afternoon 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Peel will come and 
               <br />
               move. an Address to His Excellency, praying 
               <br />
               that he will refer these resolutions to the 
               <br />
               people.” (Hear, hear.) I confess that I do
