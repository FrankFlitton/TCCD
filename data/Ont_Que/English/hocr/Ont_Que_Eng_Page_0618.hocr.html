               Well, Mr. SPEAKER, this scene of devasta- 
               <br />
               and vandalism on our continent, which at 
               <br />
               that period contained hardly a thousand 
               <br />
               white inhabitants, gives the clue to all the 
               <br />
               events which followed from that date up to 
               <br />
               the conquest of Canada by the English. 
               <br />
               This fact is a corroboration of the principle 
               <br />
               that provides that the stronger nation shall 
               <br />
               Oppress the weaker. unless by special <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circum-</span> 
               <br />
               stances the one is protected against the other. 
               <br />
               This is the proof that the sectional equality 
               <br />
               secured by the system of government which 
               <br />
               we now possess has alone been effective in 
               <br />
               Canada to enable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerent</span> nationalities to 
               <br />
               live together on terms of equality, and to 
               <br />
               labor successfully for the advancement of 
               <br />
               the common prosperity. (Hear, hear.) But 
               <br />
               the strife which began in 1613, between 
               <br />
               France-and England, became more deadly 
               <br />
               after a century and a half of occupation ; it 
               <br />
               spread along the whole frontier of New 
               <br />
               France. At the instigation of the rival race, 
               <br />
               Indian tribes fell upon all the French settle- 
               <br />
               ments in the country, and an incessant and 
               <br />
               vindictive war was kept up with the sole 
               <br />
               object of driving the Frénch off the ,conti- 
               <br />
               nent. We know at the .present day what 
               <br />
               the result of that contest was. We are told 
               <br />
               that we have no reason to complain of the 
               <br />
               system of government which we now have. 
               <br />
               That is true. But if we have that government 
               <br />
               itis because, ever since the conquest, the 
               <br />
               remnant of the French nation which re- 
               <br />
               mained in the land have striven bravely to 
               <br />
               obtain it. Had it not been for the American 
               <br />
               revolution, we too would have had our large 
               <br />
               share of suﬁ'ering and humiliation, similar 
               <br />
               tothat which the Acadians were made to 
               <br />
               undergo. The treatment to which they were 
               <br />
               subjected by England is an example of what 
               <br />
               might have happened to us, but for our 
               <br />
               number, and, subsequently, but for the vici- 
               <br />
               nity to us of the American Republic. There 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> in Acadia a nucleus of French people, 
               <br />
               who lived peaceably and happily, and who 
               <br />
               had submitted to English domination with- 
               <br />
               out arnurmur ; and yet, because they were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leak</span> and had no longer the arm of France 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> protect them, they were transported, like 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Degrees</span> on the coast of Africa, by philan- 
               <br />
               thropic England. This is an important 
               <br />
               historical fact which must not be forgotten, 
               <br />
               and the details of which it is well to set before 
               <br />

               (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mounts)</span> told us the other day that we

               ought. to thank England, and be most grate- 
               <br />
               ful to her for the system of government 
               <br />
               which we received from her. Butto whom 
               <br />
               do we owe that system? Do we owe it to 
               <br />
               the liberality of England? Did we not 
               <br />
               obtain our political rights only at the time 
               <br />
               when she could no longer refuse them to us 
               <br />
               with safety ? No, Mr. SPEAKER, our grati-

               tude and our thanks are only due to those 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen of ours who at all times 
               <br />
               bravely strove to obtain them. When we 
               <br />
               see French colonies which still groan under 
               <br />
               the English colonial system, and which 
               <br />
               complain to Europe of the treatment to 
               <br />
               which they are subjected, the conclusion 
               <br />
               must be come to that we owe nothing to 
               <br />
               England, but that on the contrary we owe 
               <br />
               all to those who, after an age of strife, 
               <br />
               obtained for us that governmental <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reform</span> 
               <br />
               which we enjoy. In order that our people

               The war of 1774 began <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> misfortunes; that 
               <br />
               of the seven years completed its total ruin. For 
               <br />
               some time the English agents acted with the 
               <br />
               greatest severity; the courts, by the most ﬂagrant 
               <br />
               violation of the law, by systematic denial of

               <br />

               down your houses and use them for fuel.” “If

               <br />
               against your villages.” Nothing could induce 
               <br />
               these honorable men to do an act against which 
               <br />
               their consciences exclaimed, and which, in 
               <br />
               the opinion of many people, England had no 
               <br />
               right to demand from them. “ The Acadians,”

               subjects, as they had not taken the oath 
               <br />
               of allegiance, and they could not, therefore, 
               <br />
               be considered rebels; nor were they to be 
               <br />
               looked upon as prisoners of war, nor to be 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the simple condition of remaining neutral.” But
