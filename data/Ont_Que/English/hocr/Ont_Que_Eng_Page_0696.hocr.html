               he has now abandoned the defence of these

               institutions and handed them over to the ten-

               der mercies of the Honorable President of

               <br />
               the honorable member for South xford be 
               <br />
               evidence of hostility to the institutions of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, how he eXplains his own po- 
               <br />
               sition, and that of his party, when they cast 
               <br />
               in their lot with the honorable member for 
               <br />
               South Oxford, while earning his popularity 
               <br />
               by, as he says, attacking the institutions of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, and abandoned the Honorable

               <br />
               defence of those institutions? ( ear, hear.)

               I think the question is one not easily an- 
               <br />
               swered. The honorable gentleman must either 
               <br />
               have been politically dishonest before, or po- 
               <br />
               litically dishonest now, and he can take 
               <br />
               either horn of the dilemma he pleases.

               Mn. J OLY—I never supported the Honor- 
               <br />
               able Attorney General East, and if I have 
               <br />
               been forced upon the same side as the honor- 
               <br />
               orable member for South Oxford, it was be- 
               <br />
               cause we were united together in opposition 
               <br />
               to that honorable gentleman. That was the 
               <br />
               only bond of union that connected us to- 
               <br />

               <br />
               population we were always divided. What I 
               <br />
               meant in the observation I made, that has 
               <br />
               been alluded to by the honorable member, is 
               <br />
               this, that the Honorable President of the 
               <br />
               Council had gained the position he occupies 
               <br />
               now by attacking Lower Canada, and the 
               <br />
               Honorable Attorney General East his, by as- 
               <br />
               suming to defend it; and when at length they 
               <br />
               found that the game would no longer answer, 
               <br />
               when the Honorable President of the Council 
               <br />
               saw himself excluded forever from a seat in

               the Ministry if he continued to play it, they 
               <br />
               banded together, and we now see the result.

               declares, the institutions of Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               I have already said that all parties are not 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with this scheme; and while on 
               <br />
               this point, I wish to allude for a moment to 
               <br />
               the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
               <br />
               It is the only reference I shall make on this 
               <br />
               branch of the subject. When addressing 
               <br />
               my constituents, I took exception to this 
               <br />
               portion of the resolutions. 1 did so, not 
               <br />
               because I cared very much whether we had 
               <br />
               in this country a Legislative Council nomi- 
               <br />
               nated by the Crown or elected by the people, 
               <br />
               but, the nominative system having been 
               <br />
               superseded by the elective, I preferred to 
               <br />
               have it as it was. It was in these terms that 
               <br />
               I spoke to the people. After having ad- 
               <br />
               dressed one or two meetings, I saw the 
               <br />
               despatch of the Colonial Secretary, and I 
               <br />
               noticed that this matter of the constitution 
               <br />
               of the Council was pointed out as one which 
               <br />
               required revision; and I took it for granted 
               <br />
               that communications would be opened be- 
               <br />
               tween the several Colonial Governments such 
               <br />
               as would possibly lead to a change. Doubtless 
               <br />
               there are snﬂicient reasons why this has not 
               <br />
               been done. But, although I would have 
               <br />
               liked it to have been so, and although it 
               <br />
               would have concurred more closely with the 
               <br />
               views of Upper Canada, I do not think it of 
               <br />
               suﬂieient importance to warrant me in reject- 
               <br />
               ing the scheme on that account. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) If it involves the rejection of the 
               <br />
               whole scheme, I do not feel myself warranted 
               <br />
               in pressing lor an amendment on the point. 
               <br />
               (ﬂeur.) ln framingaconstitution of this kind, 
               <br />
               everybody must be aware that an agreement 
               <br />
               could never have been arrived at except on 
               <br />
               the principle or compromise and concession. 
               <br />
               It is perfectly useless—itis worse than useless 
               <br />
               —to suppose that any of the several sections 
               <br />
               of a wide-spread territory could come together 
               <br />
               with a view to the formation of a union 
               <br />
               among themselves, unless each one of these 
               <br />
               sections was prepared to sacriﬁce and give 
               <br />
               up something. What right, I would ask, 
               <br />
               had we to expect that all the other colonies 
               <br />
               would agree to the views of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               or to the views of Canada as awhole ? What 
               <br />
               right had we to expect that the Province of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. would agree with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> in our

               views with reference to every particular 
               <br />
               matter? What right had we inUpper Canada 
               <br />
               to expect that in framing this scheme we 
               <br />
               would be able to expunge the se arate school
