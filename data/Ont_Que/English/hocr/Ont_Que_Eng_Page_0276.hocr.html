               HON. MR. DORION—In 1862, when the 
               <br />
               question of the construction of this road was 
               <br />
               before the country. what was the c raised 
               <br />
               by honorable gentlemen opposite ? by, that 
               <br />
               the MACDONALD-SICOTTB Government had 
               <br />
               pledged itself to build a railway at whatever 
               <br />
               cost it might come to; and those who were 
               <br />
               loudest in these denunciations, were the very 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have now undertaken to build 
               <br />
               the road without knowing or even enquiring 
               <br />
               what the cost of it will be. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               This, if I remember right, was the purport of 
               <br />
               a speech made by the Hon. Attorney General 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               it may be attacked and seized. An enemy 
               <br />
               could destroy miles of it before it would be 
               <br />

               <br />
               it would be a mere trap for the troops passing 
               <br />
               along it, unless we had almost an army to keep 
               <br />
               it open. Upon this uestion of defence, 
               <br />
               we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heird</span> so much nring the past two 
               <br />
               or three years that I think it is time now 
               <br />
               we should have some plain explanations about 
               <br />
               it. We heard the other day from the honor- 
               <br />
               able member for West Montreal—and I am 
               <br />
               always glad to quote him, he is usually so 
               <br />
               correct—(laughter—tbat in less than a year 
               <br />
               the American army, the army of the North- 
               <br />
               ern States, was increased from 9,000 to 800,- 
               <br />
               000 mon ready for service, and that in less 
               <br />
               than four years they were able to put to sea 
               <br />
               a ﬂeet which, in point of numbers—I do not 
               <br />
               say in armament or value—was equal to the 
               <br />
               entire naval force of England. Well, the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman might have gone further 
               <br />
               and shown that within a period of four years 
               <br />
               the Northern States have called into the ﬁeld 
               <br />
               2,300,000 men—as many armed men as we 
               <br />
               have men, women and children in the two 
               <br />

               being raised and equipped. It is stated that, 
               <br />
               in view of these facts, it is incumbent upon 
               <br />
               us to place ourselves in astute of defence. 
               <br />
               Sir, 1 say it here candidly and honestly, that 
               <br />
               we are bound to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everything</span> we can to pro-

               not bound to ruin ourselves in anticipation of

               battles of Canada cannot be fought on the 
               <br />
               frontier, but on the high seas and at the great 
               <br />
               cities on the Atlantic coast; and it will be 
               <br />
               nothing but folly l'or us to cripple ourselves by 
               <br />
               spending ﬁfteen or twenty millions a year to 
               <br />
               raise an army of 50,000 men for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">par?”</span> 
               <br />
               of resisting an invasion of the country. he 
               <br />
               best thi that Canada can do is to keep 
               <br />
               quiet, an to give no cause for war. (Hear,
