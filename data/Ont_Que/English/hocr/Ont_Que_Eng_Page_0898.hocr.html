               I have also other resolutions, identical in 
               <br />
               character, adopted in several other parishes 
               <br />
               in the county, but I shall abstain from read- 
               <br />
               ing them. (Hear, hear.) Now, Mr. SPEAK- 
               <br />
               EB, in order to explain clearly to honorable 
               <br />
               members the peculiar position in which- the 
               <br />
               county which I have the honor to repre- 
               <br />
               sent is placed, I have toinform them that 
               <br />
               whatever line is adopted for the Intercolonial 
               <br />
               Railway, if it should be built-—and I hope 
               <br />
               that it will be built without Confederation— 
               <br />
               it must, in any case, pass through the whole 
               <br />
               of the county—an extent of more than ﬁfty 
               <br />
               miles—and subsequently be carried through 
               <br />
               a great extent-of virgin forest, to which the 
               <br />
               inhabitants of my county are the most nearly 
               <br />
               situated. The advantages reaped by the 
               <br />
               localities, Mr. SPEAKER, in which works of 
               <br />
               such magnitude are being carried out, both as 
               <br />
               regards their construction and their subse- 
               <br />
               quent maintenance, and the other advantages 
               <br />
               .accruing to settlements from the building 
               <br />
               of a railway, are well known. All this has 
               <br />
               been perfectly well understood by the in- 
               <br />
               habitants of my county ; that is to say, that 
               <br />
               in respect of material interests,Confederation 
               <br />
               might be beneﬁcial to us—an opinion which 
               <br />
               I also hold myself; but they have also, how- 
               <br />
               ever, understood that as it is with individ- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nale,</span> so it is with nations—that the richest 
               <br />
               are not always the happiest. And believ- 
               <br />
               ing that the French-Canadian nationality 
               <br />
               would be endangered if Confederation 
               <br />
               should be carried out, they did not hesitate 
               <br />
               for an instant to pronounce against the scheme, 
               <br />
               and charged me, as their representative, 
               <br />
               to oppose it here in their name; so that in

               hear.‘ I must say, Mr. SPEAKER, thatI 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greatly</span> regret that several of the gentlemen 
               <br />
               with whom I have worked and With whom I 
               <br />
               still work, should have so strongly based 
               <br />
               their objections to Confederation on the con- 
               <br />
               struction of the Intercolonial Railway. To 
               <br />
               listen to those gentlemen, one would really 
               <br />
               believe that Canada ends here at Quebec, or 
               <br />
               that the part which is situated below is not 
               <br />
               worth occupation. I invite those gentlemen 
               <br />
               to examine with a little more attention the 
               <br />
               map of the province as far as its lower ex- 
               <br />
               tremity—the Bay of Chaleurs and Gaspé, 
               <br />
               and they will perceive that it contains a 
               <br />
               tolerably vast territory and good land adapt- 
               <br />
               ed for colonization—a fact of which they 
               <br />
               may also convince themselves by glancing 
               <br />
               at the colonization reports. They will per- 
               <br />
               ceive, I say, that if the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way were made by the line called Major 
               <br />
               ROBINSON’S line, but not by New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               as recommended by the resolutions submit- 
               <br />
               ted tc us, we should, before many years had 
               <br />
               elapsed, see an immense population settled 
               <br />
               on that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territory,</span> which is capable of con- 
               <br />
               taining more than 100,090 souls; and sev- 
               <br />
               eral of the gentlemen who oppose the con- 
               <br />
               struction of that road, and who reside in 
               <br />
               counties in which there is no room for the 
               <br />
               surplus population, might induce that sur- 
               <br />
               plus population to go and settle on the ter- 
               <br />
               ritory in question, and would have no rea- 
               <br />
               son to regret having done so. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               And, Mr. SPEAKER, besides the advantages 
               <br />
               which that road would bring to the trade of 
               <br />
               Canada in general, it would, if made to com- 
               <br />
               municate with the Gulf of St. Lawrence by 
               <br />
               way of Ristigcuche, have the immediate eﬁect 
               <br />
               of imparting an impulse to the working of 
               <br />
               our ﬁsheries, which are capable of giving em- 
               <br />
               ployment to several thousand more persons 
               <br />
               than are now engaged in them. The eﬁ'ect 
               <br />
               of this would be to keep our young men at 
               <br />
               home, and even to bring them back from 
               <br />
               the United States, where many of them 
               <br />
               now are. I, therefore, invite the gentlemen 
               <br />
               who are opposed to the railway in question 
               <br />
               to join with us in hurrying the construction 
               <br />
               of it, for it will be one of the best means 
               <br />
               of restoring equality of population between 
               <br />
               the two provinces, and of .stiﬂing the cry 
               <br />
               which is so deafening to us Lower Canadians 
               <br />
               —the cry for representation by population. I 
               <br />
               willingly admit, Mr. SPEAKER, that public 
               <br />
               opinion below Quebec appeared at ﬁrst to be 
               <br />
               favorable to Confederation, or at least that 
               <br />
               there was a disposition to submit to it, be—
