               <br />
               senator is elected is eight years, and the 
               <br />
               elections take place for one-half of them every

               <br />
               sition of the Senate can also take place, because 
               <br />
               it may be dissolved like the Lower House. 
               <br />
               New, under these circumstances, there can be 
               <br />
               no clashing of any duration between the two 
               <br />
               Belgian Chambers, and the Senate cannot 
               <br />
               obstruct, for an indeﬁnite period, the action of 
               <br />
               the Lower House. If a difference should 
               <br />
               arise between the two bodies, the Government 
               <br />
               can remedy it by new elections, by which 
               <br />
               senators would be returned favorable to the 
               <br />
               views of the people. Thus the Senate is not 
               <br />
               conservative, from the sole fact of the 
               <br />
               electoral qualiﬁcation of the senators being 
               <br />
               very high. What I consider excessive and of 
               <br />
               a too conservative character in the constitu— 
               <br />
               tion of the Legislative Council of the Con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federation,</span> is that no power exists which can 
               <br />
               change its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">composition</span> in the case of a col- 
               <br />
               lision between it and the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons. The councillors will be appointed for 
               <br />
               life, and their number is ﬁxed. By what 
               <br />
               means shall we be able to prevent the Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Council from stoppin the progress of 
               <br />
               business <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it"</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> shou d arise with the 
               <br />
               Lower House? The honorable member for 
               <br />
               Montmorency says that the obstacle will be 
               <br />
               broken down; but if no other remedy than 
               <br />
               that is provided, I say that the principle is 
               <br />
               faulty. It does not do, when we frame a 
               <br />
               Constitution, to open the door to obstacles 
               <br />
               which can only be surmounted by breaking 
               <br />
               them down. (Hear, hear.) In England, 
               <br />
               where the House of Lords is very conserva- 
               <br />
               tive, the Crown has power to name new peers, 
               <br />
               and it is precisely the possession of that 
               <br />
               power of creating new peers which has pre- 
               <br />
               vented the breaking down of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obstacle—:-</span> 
               <br />
               which prevented a revolution in 1832. The

               honorable member for Montmorency himself 
               <br />

               other matters which are left to the joint juris— 
               <br />
               diction of the Federal and Local Legislatures,

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ridden the next day by a law of the Federal 
               <br />
               Legislature. (Hear, hear.) I shall not 
               <br />
               touch upon the question of the ﬁnances, but I 
               <br />
               must say that the ﬁgures given by the Hon. 
               <br />
               Solicitor General East do not agree with 
               <br />
               those in the Public Accounts. I do not know . 
               <br />
               where he obtained them, but for my part I 
               <br />
               have been unable to ﬁnd them. When I 
               <br />
               enquired whether Lower Canada was to 
               <br />
               pay the Municipal Loan Fund debt, he 
               <br />
               did not think proper to answer. When I 
               <br />
               asked the Hon. Minister of Finance whether 
               <br />
               Lower Canada would be charged with the 
               <br />
               debt contracted for the redemption of the 
               <br />
               Seigniorial dues, with the Common School 
               <br />
               Fund, the Municipal Loan Fund, and the in— 
               <br />
               demnity payable to the townships, amount— 
               <br />
               ing in the whole to $4,500,000, he re- 
               <br />
               plied that he would bring down a pro- 
               <br />
               position at some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">futuxe</span> period for the 
               <br />
               settlement of these questions, but he has not 
               <br />
               thought proper to give any explanations. 
               <br />
               Well, I have stated that besides the debt of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$67,000,000</span> due by the province, there are 
               <br />
               more than $3,000,000 due to Upper Canada 
               <br />
               as compensation for the Seigniorial indemnity, 
               <br />
               and that in ﬁxing at $62,500,000 the debt 
               <br />
               to be assumed by the Federal Government, 
               <br />
               there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w</span> ill remain about $9,000,000 to divide 
               <br />
               between Upper and Lower Canada. With 
               <br />
               the amount of the Municipal Loan Fund 
               <br />
               debt and of the other items which I have 
               <br />
               mentioned, Lower Canada will ﬁnd herself 
               <br />
               charged with a local debt of $4,500,000. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) When we entered the union 
               <br />
               we had a debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$500,000;</span> we have expend- 
               <br />
               ed since the union, on public works in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, about $13,000,000, and we go out of 
               <br />
               the union with a debt of $27,500,000 as our 
               <br />
               preportion of the Federal debt, besides our 
               <br />
               own special debt of $4,500,000, whilst Upper 
               <br />
               Canada will go out of it without any local 
               <br />
               debt on giving up the indemnity to which 
               <br />
               she is entitled under the Seiguiorial Act of 
               <br />
               1859. Well, I assert that it is an unjust
