               Mu. MOGIVERIN—I am glad to hear 
               <br />
               all these explanations. As I said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before,</span> I 
               <br />
               wish for the fullest and freeest discussion. 
               <br />
               I may not have made myself aequainted with 
               <br />
               all the details of the scheme, and a question 
               <br />
               of this importance t to be discussed in 
               <br />
               all its bearings. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> is a point, however, 
               <br />
               which did occur to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me.</span> as objectionable. Then

               <br />
               that this has been imposed simply in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> 
               <br />
               way of a stumpege. (Hear, hear.) There 
               <br />
               are, no doubt, various objections which may 
               <br />
               be brought against these resolutions. There 
               <br />
               are grounds enough for honorable gentle- 
               <br />
               men in the opposition to make excellent 
               <br />
               speeches against them. But what I would 
               <br />
               wish to impress upon the House is this, that 
               <br />
               we should approach this subject in a spirit of 
               <br />
               candor, honœtly desiring to meet the question 
               <br />
               fairly in all its bearings. The question is 
               <br />
               simply this, Shall we vote for these resolu- 
               <br />
               tiens, notwithstanding their imperfections? 
               <br />
               [freely admit that, in my view, there are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imperfections</span> in the scheme. But shall we, 
               <br />
               on that account, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span> the responsibility of 
               <br />
               throwing out the resolutions ? That, I think, 
               <br />
               is the tion we have to comider. Honor- 
               <br />
               able gendemen may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁer</span> from me, but I feel 
               <br />
               that the advantages of the contemplated union 
               <br />
               are such, that notwithstanding ' the objection- 
               <br />
               able features in the scheme, I would not be 
               <br />
               doing my duty to my constituents, I would 
               <br />
               not be discharging the duty I owe to my 
               <br />
               country, were I to vote against it, and thus 
               <br />
               lend my inﬂuence to ent the consummation 
               <br />

               great importance. He said that he should

               oppose this scheme—that he should vote 
               <br />
