               have listened attentively to the arguments 
               <br />
               in favor of the scheme, but no attempt has 
               <br />
               been made to demonstrate these things. It

               to know in what manner such an end is 
               <br />
               promoted by this measure. Are we not

               we not already living under the control of 
               <br />
               the same executive power? Do we not ﬁght

               under the same ﬂag, and pay allegiance to 
               <br />
