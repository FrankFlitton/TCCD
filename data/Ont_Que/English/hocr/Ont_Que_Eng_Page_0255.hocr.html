               <br />

               <br />
               of Lower Canada, a single act to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beagcund</span> in

               which it can be shown that the Lower Canadians

               low subjects of English origin professing the

               <br />
               on this subject. And why ? Because the 
               <br />
               limits of the counties in Lower Canada were 
               <br />

               fection can be found in Canada, it must be 
               <br />
               in the person of the honorable Judge Mom. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Before laying his project be— 
               <br />
               fore the Executive Council, that gentleman 
               <br />
               did me the honor to consult me in the matter, 
               <br />
               and on two occasions I attended by appoint- 
               <br />
               ment at his oﬁice to advise with him on the 
               <br />
               details of his scheme. The divisions of the 
               <br />
               other branch of the Legislature were worked 
               <br />
               out so as to give our Protestant English fel- 
               <br />
               low subjects everything which could be con- 
               <br />
               sidered fair in every sense of the word. I 
               <br />
               say also that the same spirit was manifested 
               <br />
               in regard to the working out of the divisions 
               <br />
               of the Legislative Council. I assisted to 
               <br />
               work them out in conjunction with the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. CAUCHON, and I do assert here most 
               <br />
               solemnly that our whole trouble and study 
               <br />
               was to try and devise some means so as to 
               <br />
               give the English portion of the community 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada something like fair play. 
               <br />
               And when I am conscious of having done 
               <br />
               these things, Ifeel it comes hard on me to hear 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen say that there is no se- 
               <br />
               curity for them in the future, but that the 
               <br />
               French—the Papists—may do anything they 
               <br />
               choose in the lower branch of the L 'slature. 
               <br />
               But, honorable gentlemen, if the lower branch 
               <br />
               of the Legislature were insensate enough and 
               <br />
               wicked enough to commit some ﬂagrant act of 
               <br />
               injustice against the English Protestant por- 
               <br />
               tion of the community, they would be checked 
               <br />
               by the General Government. But the hon-
