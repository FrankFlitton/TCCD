               South Oxford and from Sherbrooke, who,

               our ﬁnancial position will be beneﬁted by

               the Confederation. I have compared those

               facts and those ﬁgures, and I must confess 
               <br />
               I have conﬁdence in their conclusions. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I have heard it urged, sir, 
               <br />
               that because some counties in New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick have rejected the men who have 
               <br />
               adopted Confederation as a policy, we ought 
               <br />
               therefore to abandon the scheme. Well, 
               <br />
               sir, we are either bound in good faith to 
               <br />
               carry out the engagement entered into at 
               <br />
               Quebec or not, and I say with m friend the 
               <br />
               Honorable Attorney General est, we are 
               <br />
               bound in all conscience and honor, and in 
               <br />
               every principle of law or equity, to adhere 
               <br />
               to the agreement entered into. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The tu quoque argument is not a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">god</span> defence to such a breach of good

               'th. What a sorry ﬁgure should we 
               <br />
               cut, sir, before the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               with this argument in our months:— 
               <br />
               “The Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and Prince Edward Island broke 
               <br />
               faith, violated their pledges, were untrue 
               <br />
               to their engagements, and we followed 
               <br />
               their example." I think, sir, such a position 
               <br />
               would be pitiable, and would tend to lower 
               <br />
               as in the eyes of the Imperial Government. 
               <br />
               (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear."</span> I maintain that the principle 
               <br />
               enunciated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> my friend the Honorable 
               <br />

               must adept <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> resolutions, and we must 
               <br />
               take them before the Imperial Government, 
               <br />

               <br />
               own self-respect. (Hear, hear.) When that 
               <br />
               is accomplished, our duty will be ended. If 
               <br />
               the Maritime Provinces will not adhere to 
               <br />
               the arrangement, we shall have done our

               when I moved the adjournment last night,

               it was not my intention to oﬂ'er to-day a

               general review,of the scheme which is under 
               <br />

               <br />
               been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬁeiently</span> discussed to enable the
