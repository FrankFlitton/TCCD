               so much larger matters are at stake? I do 
               <br />
               say, sir, that if there were no example for 
               <br />
               it—-if our Legislature had not shown that it 
               <br />
               was the pe0ple’s right to have a voice on all 
               <br />
               matters affecting them largely—we should 
               <br />
               now proceed to make that precedent. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I do net mean to say, however, in speak- 
               <br />
               ing thus, that I am adverse in the slightest de- 
               <br />
               gree to there being a dissolution of the House; 
               <br />
               but it strikes me that we will have a great 
               <br />
               many side-issues in a contest of that kind, and 
               <br />
               cannot, therefore, arrive at the direct sense 
               <br />
               of the people so closely as we should be able 
               <br />
               to do by a square vote of yea or nay. N ever- 
               <br />
               theless, it is of very great importance that 
               <br />
               before advancing to the end of the proceed- 
               <br />
               ings that we have contemplated by passing 
               <br />
               these resolutions, they should ﬁrst be 
               <br />
               submitted to the country in some way. I 
               <br />

               sion; and I am also desirous that the public 
               <br />
               should be awakened from that apathy which 
               <br />
               has been alluded to by the hon. member for

               <br />
               among the people upon this question. The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Peel has asserted that 
               <br />
               there could not be half a dozen gentlemen 
               <br />

               say that this country could go on and 
               <br />
               prosper—but I say it could prosper for the

               desire that any change should take place 
               <br />

               <br />
               the fullest and freest opportunity of express- 
               <br />
               ing themselves upon its desirability. I 
               <br />
               desire that the people should have this 
               <br />
               scheme presented to them, side by side 
               <br />
               with the proposal for a legislative union, 
               <br />
               that we may ascertain whether or not 
               <br />
               they would adopt a Federal union, in pre- 
               <br />
               ference to 3. Legislative union. I have 
               <br />
               been charged with having advanced argu- 
               <br />
               ments in discussing the resolutions, which 
               <br />
               were as applicable and favorable to a Federal 
               <br />
               as to a Legislative union, and that I said 
               <br />
               nothing more favorable to the one than to 
               <br />
               the other. Well I admit that if you take 
               <br />
               three or four isolated points of a man’s argu- 
               <br />
               ment, you can make them support exactly 
               <br />
               the opposite of that which his whole course 
               <br />
               of argument was calculated to uphold, and 
               <br />
               when you put all of my remarks together, 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd that they bear strongly in favor 
               <br />
               of the legislative form of union. This much 
               <br />
               will be found, that every argument which I 
               <br />
               advanced that could be said to favor Federa- 
               <br />
               tion, was also an argument in favor of a 
               <br />
               Legislative union ; and, in addition, I brought 
               <br />
               prominently to view the greater economy 
               <br />
               connected with the. working of the latter. 
               <br />
               Iconsider that argument a strong one, in 
               <br />
               view of the circumstances at present existing 
               <br />

               <br />
               country is such that it is not able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> bear 
               <br />
               additional heavy burdens; and if we are 
               <br />
               going to make a change in our Constitution, 
               <br />
               that change should he of a character that 
               <br />
               Would lessen those burdens instead of in- 
               <br />
               creasing them, if possible. And if we must 
               <br />
               incur a heavy burden for defensive purposes, 
               <br />
               let us have as much saving, in other respects, 
               <br />
               as we can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> so that there will be as little
