               the union of Upper and Lower Canada. The 
               <br />
               noble lord had recommended the adoption of a 
               <br />
               general legislative union of all the British 
               <br />
               North American Provinces, and also the sub- 
               <br />
               mission of the question to the people of those 
               <br />
               provinces for their approval. He said, “ But 
               <br />
               the state of the lower province, though it 
               <br />
               justiﬁes the proposal of an union, would not, I 
               <br />
               think, render it gracious or even just on the 
               <br />
               part of Parliament, to carry it into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ‘ect</span> with- 
               <br />
               out referring it to the ample deliberation and 
               <br />
               consent of the people of those colonies.” N ow, 
               <br />
               sir, I take it that what is alluded to here is 
               <br />
               the consent of the legislatures of those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. If this House should be dissolved, 
               <br />
               and the measure passed in England be of 
               <br />
               a permissive character, it would, when re- 
               <br />
               turned, either be accepted” or rejected by 
               <br />
               the House, and in the meantime the con- 
               <br />
               stituencies could be consulted in reference 
               <br />
               to it. (Hear, hear.) The necessity for 
               <br />
               this has been proved by some of the remarks 
               <br />
               which have been made by honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               who have addressed the House_on the subject. 
               <br />
               Several honorable members, who advocated the 
               <br />
               measure, stated that they had already placed 
               <br />
               it before their constituents, and that they had 
               <br />
               their endorsement in voting for it as they 
               <br />
               intended to do. That is right as far as it 
               <br />
               goes, but it only shows that these honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen deemed it necessary to take that 
               <br />
               course and consult their constituents, thus 
               <br />
               fortifying themselves by securing beforehand 
               <br />
               their approval. (Hear, hear.) It is said 
               <br />
               that doctors disagree, but I think the same 
               <br />
               may be said of lawyers ; for we ﬁnd the honor- 
               <br />
               able member for Peel saying that it would be 
               <br />
               unconstitutional to take the course advocated 
               <br />
               by the honorable member for N orth‘Ontario. 
               <br />
               But I concur rather in the mode of appeal to the 
               <br />
               people proposed by the honorable member for 
               <br />
               North Ontario, “ yea ” or “ nay,” than in that 
               <br />
               of the honorable member for Peel. The prin- 
               <br />
               ciple has been acknowledged by the Parliament 
               <br />
               ot' Canada, and it has been introduced into 
               <br />
               our county councils, so far that any sum 
               <br />
               exceeding $20,000 cannot be levied without 
               <br />
               the consent of the people having been ﬁrst 
               <br />
               obtained. I believe that we should support 
               <br />
               Federation, or the fears entertained by many 
               <br />
               may be realized, that its rejection may have a 
               <br />
               tendency towards <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'annexation.</span> I did not 
               <br />
               hesitate to give my adhesion to the resolutions 
               <br />
               of the Conference, believing as I do that 
               <br />
               their adoption is calculated to beneﬁt these 
               <br />
               provinces, and also to strengthen the connec- 
               <br />
               tion between this country and Great Britain. 
               <br />

               rather singular in passing through the coun-

               <br />
               were supposed to be in favor of American 
               <br />
               institutions had expressed himself as in favor 
               <br />
               of the scheme now before the House. I look 
               <br />
               upon that as a strong argument in its favor. 
               <br />
               As I have already stated, sir, although I am 
               <br />
               in favor of the measure, I think it but right 
               <br />
               that it should be submitted to the people, for 
               <br />
               their approval, before being carried into eﬁ'ect, 
               <br />
               and therefore I deem it my duty to vote for 
               <br />
               the amendment of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Peel. (Hear, hear.)

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               MB. JACKSON—I have only a word or 
               <br />
               two to say, Mr. SPEAKER, before the vote is 
               <br />
               taken on this motion. I cannot reconcile the 
               <br />
               conduct of the honorable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">memba</span> for Peel in 
               <br />
               voting that an Address should be presented 
               <br />
               to Her Majesty in favor of the scheme, and 
               <br />
               then move to have it submitted to the people. 
               <br />
               The honorable member for Peel has made out 
               <br />
               a case for the resolutions which have been 
               <br />
               adopted by this House. He stated that the 
               <br />
               peeple of Upper Canada were in favor of it; , 
               <br />
               he has no objection to it himself; it meets 
               <br />
               with his hearty concurrence. I can easily 
               <br />
               conceive how my honorable friend from North 
               <br />
               Ontario can vote for this resolution; but I 
               <br />
               cannot understand how an honorable gentle 
               <br />
               tleman can vote that an Address shall be 
               <br />
               presented to the Queen, asking Her Majesty 
               <br />
               to submit the scheme to the Imperial Legis- 
               <br />
               lature, and, after that has been voted, turn 
               <br />
               round and vote that the scheme should be 
               <br />
               submitted to the people. I cannot understand 
               <br />
               that. If I voted for the motion now before 
               <br />
               the House, I should think I was acting in 
               <br />
               opposition to the vote I gave before. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I stated the other evening that my 
               <br />
               constituents were in favor of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rHouse</span> 
               <br />
               adopting this measure, and that they did not 
               <br />
               consider an appeal to the people necessary. 
               <br />
               In accordance with their decision I gave my 
               <br />
               vote, and I shall now vote in opposition to 
               <br />
               the motion of the honorable member for Peel. 
               <br />
               If it was necessary, I think I could show to 
               <br />
               the House that if it were submitted to the 
               <br />
               people, side issues would be raised, irrelevant 
               <br />
               altogether to the main question, in order to
