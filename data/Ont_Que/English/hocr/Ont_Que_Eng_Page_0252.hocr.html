               ask honorable gentlemen if the country is in

               tion of expense, I am not sure whether I 
               <br />
               would not be in favor of returning to the 
               <br />
               primitive system of administering the affairs 
               <br />

               scheme—by a Governor in Council. (Laugh- 
               <br />
               ter.) For there is no question that our an- 
               <br />
               nual expenditure will be, under Confedera- 
               <br />

               <br />
