               Upper Canadian that if he goes into this 
               <br />
               treaty with a view of violating its letter and 
               <br />

               <br />
               duty he owes to Upper Canada as well as

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'to</span> Lower Canada and the sister provinces. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I do- not desire to enter into 
               <br />
               a treaty with the object of escaping its obli- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> gations at some future time ; and it is because 
               <br />
               I wish to do what is right, that I point out 
               <br />
               those things in the scheme that I believe to 
               <br />
               be wrong, and which, unless they are modi- 
               <br />
               ﬁed, I cannot support by my vote. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It would be a breach of faith on the 
               <br />
               part of Upper Canada in a few years after 
               <br />
               this to say, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2;</span> We want an increased repre- 
               <br />
               sentation; we want a larger amount for our 
               <br />
               local purposes,” when with their eyes open, 
               <br />
               her representatives accepted the document 
               <br />
               now before the House, and with a clear 
               <br />
               apprehension of what they were doing, made 
               <br />
               themselves parties to this treaty. Why, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, is it that Lower Canada has so 
               <br />
               long resisted the cry for an increased repre- 
               <br />
               sentation to the western section of the 
               <br />
               province? Simply because the treaty of 1840 
               <br />
               granted to both sections equality on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House. (Hear, hear.) I regret ex— 
               <br />
               ceedingly that the Government intend to 
               <br />
               force this measure upon the people without 
               <br />
               appealing to them on the question, and 
               <br />
               knowing whether it meets with their approval 
               <br />
               ornot. (Hear,hear.) In thatsame speech of 
               <br />
               the Hon. Minister of Finance to which I have 
               <br />
               already made allusion, one of his strongest 
               <br />
               points was this, that the Union Act of 1840 
               <br />
               was forced on the people of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               without their consent. (Hear. Yet, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKEB, what do we ﬁnd ? Ve ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               intelligent and enterprising people of N ew- 
               <br />
               Brunswiek have rejected this measure, and 
               <br />
               that it is not favored either by the people of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia. 
               <br />
               We ﬁnd, further, petitions coming in every 
               <br />
               day against the measure from all parts of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. (Hear, hear.) And yet, in 
               <br />
               ' the face of all this opposition, the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment presume to force the measure upon 
               <br />
               the country. But then we are told that the

               <br />

               were made. We are told that this is a

               document of concessions; but I declare that 
               <br />
               I have failed to sec any concessions whatever

               <br />
               were all made to the Maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> 
               <br />
               I repeat that the delegates who met in 
               <br />
               Quebec as the representatives of provinces, 
               <br />
               and who had equal weight in the Con- 
               <br />
               ferenc with Canada, are now to be treated 
               <br />
               as if they were of no account ; that if the 
               <br />
               people of Canada, representing three-fourths 
               <br />
               of the whole population, decide upon it, 
               <br />
               it will be carried through. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Then we are told that the danger of war 
               <br />
               is very imminent. I fail to see that. The 
               <br />
               Government brought in an Alien Bill, 
               <br />
               and a large majority in the House voted 
               <br />
               for it, because they believed it necessary, 
               <br />
               at the time, to secure the peace of the 
               <br />
               country ; and in like manner they will he 
               <br />
               supported by this House in any measure 
               <br />
               which may be required for the purpose of 
               <br />
               adding to our security. But I ask, sir, if 
               <br />
               these resolutions were carried to-night, how 
               <br />
               much they would add to our peace and 
               <br />
               security ? What increased facilities of com- 
               <br />
               munication would they give us with the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces, until it was possible to 
               <br />
               build the Intercolonial Railway ? Very many 
               <br />
               years must necessarily elapse before that 
               <br />
               work could he completed ; meanwhile, the 
               <br />
               whole question of union could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diseased;</span> 
               <br />
               objections could be considered, and the people 
               <br />
               could be consulted. Thus, without hastily 
               <br />
               pressing on a measure which might eventnate 
               <br />
               in disappointment and misery, a sound and 
               <br />
               judicious measure might be devised, which 
               <br />
               would meet with the approval of the country, 
               <br />
