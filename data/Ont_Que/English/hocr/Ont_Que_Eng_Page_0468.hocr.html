               more extravagance necessary to carry on the

               <br />
               Hon. the President of the Council? It was 
               <br />
               said that the peo le of the section of the pro-

               ﬁed that there was extravagance in the 
               <br />
               Government, that the people of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada were absorbing too large a propor— 
               <br />
               tion of the revenue that was paid by the 
               <br />
               people of Upper Canada. It was asserted 
               <br />
               that the peOple of Upper Canada were ay- 
               <br />
               ing seven-tenths of the whole revenue 0 the 
               <br />
               country; that we had not suﬂicient repre- 
               <br />
               sentation in Parliament; and that there was 
               <br />
               ruin staring us in the face, because we had 
               <br />
               not our proper voice in the Legislature, by 
               <br />
               means of which we might resist the extrava- 
               <br />
               gance of Lower Canadians. It was said 
               <br />
               that for every appropriation made for Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, a corresponding one bad to be 
               <br />
               made for Lower Canada, and thereby the 
               <br />
               people of Upper Canada were paying more 
               <br />
               than their fair share into the common purse 
               <br />
               of the country. Taking that view of the 
               <br />
               case, I would ask the Honorable President 
               <br />
               of the Council, who is so warm in advocating 
               <br />
               these resolutions, how much the people of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada will be called upon to pay 
               <br />
               more than Lower Canada in the new scheme? 
               <br />
               [understand that Lower is to receive 8888,— 
               <br />
               531 from the Federal Government. As 
               <br />
               Upper Canada has been paying two-thirds, 
               <br />
               nay, as much as seven-tenths into the general

               <br />
               that is the position in which that branch of 
               <br />
               the question stands; but it is said that we are 
               <br />
               to become a great people, third, I think, in 
               <br />
               rank of the nations of the earth. It is said 
               <br />
               that, because we unite with a people who 
               <br />
               have less than a million of inhabitants, while 
               <br />
               we have nearly two and a half millions, we 
               <br />
               are to become this vast nation, and to hold a 
               <br />
               position in the world above that of all nations 
               <br />
               except three on the face of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> globe. Well, 
               <br />
               it does not strike me that the mere fact of 
               <br />
               our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">joining</span> the Lower Provinces to this pro— 
               <br />
               vince by the Intercolonial Railway is going 
               <br />
               to give us that position. We need a vast 
               <br />
               pepulation as well as a vast country to acquire 
               <br />
               that greatness. It is said that we will be 
               <br />
               stronger by this union; that we will be better 
               <br />
               able to protect ourselves in the event of hos- 
               <br />
               tilities breaking out between this country 
               <br />
               and the United States. But is that true? 
               <br />
               (Cries of“ Yes, yes,” and “ No, no.”) Are 
               <br />
               we to become at once an independent nation 
               <br />
               that will make treaties with foreign nations, 
               <br />
               or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> we still to be dependent on the British 
               <br />
               Crown—a dependency that I hope will never 
               <br />
               be done away with? (Hear, hear.) Let it 
               <br />
               be understood that I am not to be dazzled 
               <br />
               by those ideas of greatness that are being 
               <br />
               held out to us. We can never be so great 
               <br />
               in any way as we can by remainin a depen- 
               <br />
               dency of the British Crown. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lgvery</span> one 
               <br />
               of these provinces is true and faithful 
               <br />
               in its allegiance to the British Crown, and 
               <br />
               if that power makes war, each will do all 
               <br />
               that lies in its power to defend its own ter- 
               <br />
               ritory and assist the Mother Country. But 
               <br />
               how do we gain strength from the scheme ? 
               <br />
               We obtain many hundreds of miles of addi— 
               <br />
               tional frontier, and we do not get men in 
               <br />
               proportion. (Hear, hear.) We shall build 
               <br />
               a railway that cannot possibly be of much 
               <br />
               use to us, but that will be subject to destruc- 
               <br />
               tion by the enemy, and will be indefensible 
               <br />
               and diﬂicult to keep open. The armies that 
               <br />
               will be brought against us by the United 
               <br />
               States will be too great to be resisted along 
               <br />
               the entire frontier, and no ordinary force 
               <br />
               will be suﬁcient to protect so long a line of 
               <br />
               communication. I therefore argue that the
