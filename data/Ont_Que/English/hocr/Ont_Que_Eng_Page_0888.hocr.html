               great obstacle to the political progress of our 
               <br />
               country arises from the vast number of per- 
               <br />
               sons who arrive amongst us each year from 
               <br />

               <br />
               is true, but their minds wander over the sea 
               <br />
               between the two hemispheres, and they act 
               <br />
               as though they were in England, in Sect- 
               <br />
               land, or in Ireland, without considering our 
               <br />
               position, our social and political relations; 
               <br />
               and they think they need only cry out 
               <br />
               “ Loyalty, loyalty !” to make the people rush 
               <br />
               to arms; but I repeat again, that if it be 
               <br />
               attempted to force the people into a change 
               <br />
               such as is new proposed, the people of the 
               <br />
               rural districts will become hostile to those 
               <br />
               who force it upon them, and they will not 
               <br />
               ﬁght in defence of such a Constitution, as 
               <br />
               they would ﬁght in defence of a principle 
               <br />
               they approved of, and of a political position 
               <br />
               with which they were satisﬁed. (Hear, hear ) 
               <br />
               I have but one word more to say on this 
               <br />
               subject, and it is this : it is all very well to 
               <br />
               say that the debt of the United States is 
               <br />
               enormous ; that will not frighten the peeple, 
               <br />
               for, notwithstanding the war between the 
               <br />
               North and the South, if we consider the 
               <br />
               wealth and resources of the United States, 
               <br />
               that debt will not be by any means so formi- 
               <br />
               dable a matter to deal with as we have been 
               <br />
               told In January last, the receipts of 
               <br />
               the United States Treasury amounted to 
               <br />
               831,000,000—one million a day; and notwith- 
               <br />
               standing that fact, despite the heavy taxes 
               <br />
               paid, and paid willingly, by the American 
               <br />
               people, commercial prosperity is far greater 
               <br />
               in that country than it is here, as those who 
               <br />
               now visit the country cannot fail to notice. 
               <br />
               On the ﬁrst of December last, the close of 
               <br />
               the ﬁscal year, the debt of the United States 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1.740,690,480.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With</span> a population of 
               <br />
               32,000,000 this debt does not, therefore, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exceed</span> 856 per head. 1 have already 
               <br />
               shewn that under Confederation, our debt 
               <br />
               would be 840 per head in Canada. Com- 
               <br />
               paring our resources with those of the 
               <br />
               American union, we were much more deeply 
               <br />
               indebted than they were at the period of the 
               <br />
               last annual report of the Treasury. It is 
               <br />
               easier for them to collect two dollars than 
               <br />
               for us to collect one. But with their im— 
               <br />
               mense resources, their boundless commerce, 
               <br />
               their ever-increasing manufactures, if the 
               <br />
               war were to end tomorrow, the United 
               <br />
               States would pay off their debt in a few 
               <br />
               years, if the government continued to levy 
               <br />
               the same amount of taxes that they now do.

               that changes such as those proposed in

               our social and political condition, are the 
               <br />
               surest means of bringing it about, be- 
               <br />
               cause they are of a nature to create serious 
               <br />
               discontent, and a constant conﬂict between 
               <br />
               us and our neighbors; and the peeple, far 
               <br />
               from being satisﬁed with that, will be but 
               <br />
               ill-inclined to defend such a state of things. 
               <br />
               I beg, in conclusion, to call the attention of 
               <br />
               hen. members to the fact, that while it is 
               <br />
               proposed to change our Constitution, the 
               <br />
               Government refuse to give us any details or 
               <br />
               explanations as to the proposed changes; 
               <br />
               and I assert that it is our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">du!</span> y not to vote 
               <br />
               for these changes blindly. With reference 
               <br />
               to what I have said, 1 have not said it with-

               I am ready to abide the consequences that
