               told that this great scheme is to settle all 
               <br />

               very dull of comprehension, but I must con- 
               <br />
               fess that I cannot see that. We have diﬁcul-

               proved, and we seek to settle those diﬁiculties

               by forming a union with provinces that are

               Upper Canada for a just representation in

               Parliament, and we are told that, because we

               I cannot see that that result will follow,

               Mr. SPEAKER, we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here,</span> in the 
               <br />
               language of one of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most,</span> determined 
               <br />
               opponents of the principle of representation 
               <br />
               according to population, very good reasons 
               <br />
               given for coming to the conclusion that the 
               <br />
               granting of increased representation in the 
               <br />
               Lower Legislature will amount to nothing, 
               <br />
               while the same just principle is denied in 
               <br />
               the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
               <br />
               I hope I may be incorrect, but I am of 
               <br />
               opinion that if this scheme goes into opera- 
               <br />
               tion, we shall witness the difﬁculty alluded 
               <br />
               to on the ﬂoor of the Confederate Legislature 
               <br />
               in less than six months after its organization. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) And the unfair representation 
               <br />
               which Upper Canada will have in the Upper 
               <br />
               Chamber must exist throughout all time. 
               <br />
               Nor will she . be able to add even one 
               <br />
               member, no matter how great may be the 
               <br />
               preponderance of her population over other 
               <br />
               parts of the Confederacy And this equality 
               <br />
               of,votes between Upper Canada and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada will act, as Mr. CAUCHON tells his 
               <br />
               Lower Canadian friends, as a perfect counter- 
               <br />
               poise to the legislation of the Lower House. 
               <br />
               In connection with this subject, there is 
               <br />
               another feature of the scheme which is 
               <br />
               painful to contemplate, in which we are, I 
               <br />
               think, about to advance backwards. The quali- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation of a Legislative Councilloris now 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">88,000;</span> but it is proposed to reduce it to 
               <br />
               84,000, which I regard as retrogressive. 
               <br />
               And in the case of Prince Edward Island 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland, the qualiﬁcation may be 
               <br />
               personal property as well as real estate—in 
               <br />
               other words, the legislative councillors from 
               <br />
               those provinces may be peddlers of jewelry 
               <br />
               or any other commodity, whose stock in trade 
               <br />
               may be burned up while they are attending 
               <br />
               a session, rendering them unable longer to 
               <br />
               qualify. (Hear, hear.) But there is a much 
               <br />
               worse feature than that : it will have 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cﬁect</span> of introducing into the Upper

               a crisis may be approached without very 
               <br />
               much diﬁiculty, and who might plead <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> 
               <br />
               own circumstances as an ample apology in

               quieting their consciences for the votes they
