               to be prepared, unless we intend to form part 
               <br />

               <br />
               readily understand how men with annexation

               tendencies, and who are inclined towards 
               <br />
               republican institutions, would rejoice at our 
               <br />
               present position. I can understand how men 
               <br />
               who wish to see the whole continent converted 
               <br />
               into one great republic, are pleased at diﬁicul-

               ties being created between the Empire and the 
               <br />
               provinces. But those who entertain different 
               <br />
               views see plainly that some steps must be 
               <br />
               taken, that we must go to work earnestly to 
               <br />
               build u a nationality independent of the 
               <br />
               United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States,</span> though not in hostility toit, 
               <br />
               to counteract the tendency so evident on every 
               <br />
               hand to drive us into their arms. We know 
               <br />
               very well what must be the result of the steps 
               <br />
               which they are now taking—unless we ourselves 
               <br />
               take measures in another direction—unless we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd another outlet to the ocean— unless we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd some other channels for our trade and 
               <br />
               commerce, they knew that we must inevitably 
               <br />
               fall into their arms. That is another reason 
               <br />
               why I wish to see no delay in the union and 
               <br />
               in the amalgamation of the British provinces, 
               <br />
               in order that we may at once consolidate our- 
               <br />
               selves into one people, and at. once endeavor to 
               <br />
               abolish those barriers which now exist between 
               <br />
               us, and develope the feeling that we have com- 
               <br />
               mon interests, and that we are dependent the 
               <br />
               one upon the other, which can never be the 
               <br />
               case so long as division walls exist. It seems 
               <br />
               really astonishing to my mind that any man 
               <br />
               who really desires to see built up on this con- 
               <br />
               tinent a nationality independent of the United 
               <br />
               States, should offer any opposition to the pro- 
               <br />
               posal now before us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) So 
               <br />
               much has been said with regard to our 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial and commercial position and pros- 
               <br />
               pects, that I think it is quite unnecessary 
               <br />
               for me to say anything further on the 
               <br />
               subject. I am quite sure that I could not place 
               <br />
               the matter before you as well as it has been 
               <br />
               submitted by those who have preceded me. 
               <br />
               But it is natural that each speaker should 
               <br />
               dwell upon that which most impresses his own 
               <br />
               mind. I am persuaded that in every point of 
               <br />
               view—in view of our dependence upon, and 
               <br />
               precarious relations with the United States, 
               <br />
               in view of a desired union with the British 
               <br />
               provinces ; in view of our connection with the 
               <br />
               Empire—we should be culpably lacking in our

               time our productions are actually passing

               <br />
               extension. It is only n to refer to 
               <br />
               the position and characteristics of the different 
               <br />
               provinces, to see at once how exactly they 
               <br />
               supply the wants and deﬁciencies of each 
               <br />
               other. Suﬁee it to say that we are agricul- 
               <br />
               tural and manufacturing, whilst they are, and 
               <br />
               must remain, principally a maritime popula- 
               <br />
               tion, requiring for consumption that with 
               <br />
               which we can supply them. I know it is said 
               <br />
               that these channe s of commercial intercourse 
               <br />
               may be opened up without union. But we 
               <br />
               need to feel ourselves to be one people, with 
               <br />
               identical interests, dependent upon each other; 
               <br />
               and what can do this as well as a political 
               <br />
               union, bringing us together into one legisla— 
               <br />
               ture and under one government? Perhaps it 
               <br />
               is not too much to say that our commercial 
               <br />
               interests would be furthered more in ten years 
               <br />
               under a political union, than it would be in 
               <br />
               thirty years without it. (Hear, hear.) In 
               <br />
               connection with this subject, I am naturally 
               <br />
               reminded of the Intercolonial Railway. Now, 
               <br />
               sir, it appears to me, although the Interco— 
               <br />
               lonial Railway has been dragged into this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques-</span> 
               <br />
               tion—although the expense of that undertak- 
               <br />
               ing has been dwelt upon by the opponents of 
               <br />
               this scheme as if it were part of the scheme and 
               <br />
               of this scheme alone—I believe that whatever 
               <br />
               the event, whether there be a Confederation 
               <br />
               of the provinces or not, the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way is an indispensable necessity. The ex- 
               <br />
               pense of that railway is, therefore, a question 
               <br />
               altogether apart from this scheme, and can— 
               <br />
               not be allowed to enter into the arguments 
               <br />
               I do not look upon the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway, at the present time, in the 
               <br />
               light of a proﬁtable commercial undertaking, 
               <br />
               neither, to any great extent, as a valuable 
               <br />
               military undertaking. (Opposition cries of 
               <br />
               “Hear,hear.”) There is not the least doubt that 
               <br />
               when we are not actually engaged in hostil- 
               <br />
               ities, it would be of the greatest advantage in 
               <br />
               furnishing us with an outlet at all seasons 
               <br />
               of the year. Before actual hostilities, as in 
               <br />
               the Trent aﬁ'air, we need it to secure our inde- 
               <br />
               pendence of the United States in bringing 
               <br />
               rapidly troops and munitions of war into the 
               <br />
