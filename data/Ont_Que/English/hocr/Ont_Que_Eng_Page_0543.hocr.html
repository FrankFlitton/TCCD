               to the interest of the Empire, which is real] 
               <br />
               that of all its what is wanting, as 
               <br />
               have said, is an effective federalization of the 
               <br />
               Empire as a whole, not a subordinate federa- 
               <br />
               tion here or there, made up out of parts of it. 
               <br />
               I have neither time nor strength te-night to 
               <br />
               go fairly into thequestion of how this thing 
               <br />
               should be done ; but a few words more as to 
               <br />
               that, I must be pardoned for. Until latterly 
               <br />
               in Canada we have not had, and some colo- 
               <br />
               nies have not now, I believe, a Minister of 
               <br />
               Militia. Even we have not as yet, in our 
               <br />
               Cabinet, a minister to attend to what ma be 
               <br />
               called Imperial aﬂ'airs. It is not the business 
               <br />
               of any minister, nor is it even distinctly recog- 
               <br />
               nized as that of the Ministry as a whole, in any 
               <br />
               of these provinces, to attend to what is really 
               <br />
               at the present juncture the most important part 
               <br />
               of our whole public business—the regulation 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> between them and the Mother 
               <br />
               Country. I know it may be said this is in 
               <br />
               the hands of the Governor. 80 are other 
               <br />
               things. But for them, we see the need of his 
               <br />
               having advisers. And <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> to this, if a Cabinet 
               <br />
               leaves it wholly to him, that practically 
               <br />
               amounts to its neglecting these aﬂ'airs alto- 
               <br />
               gether. Let me go back to a point or two in 
               <br />
               the history of affairs in Canada within the re- 
               <br />
               collection ot' all honorable entlemen. In 
               <br />
               1862,when the then Militia B' was before the 
               <br />
               House, it was asked over and over again by 
               <br />
               gentlemen of the Opposition, what communica- 
               <br />
               tions, if any, had been received from the Im— 
               <br />
               perial Government in respect of the defence of 
               <br />
               this province; and the answer invariably was, 
               <br />
               that there had been none, none known to the 
               <br />
               Administration, as an administration. Now, 
               <br />
               if there had then been an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁicen—the</span> Pro- 
               <br />
               vincial Secretary, the Minister of Militia, or 
               <br />
               any other member of the Government-— 
               <br />
               whose duty it had been and was to attend to 
               <br />
               that important branch of the public service; 
               <br />
               if the relations between the Mother Country 
               <br />
               and this province had been known to be in his 
               <br />
               charge, such an answer as that could never 
               <br />
               have been given, nor the second reading of 
               <br />

               Of course, nobody denies that the Governor 
               <br />
               General is the channel of communication 
               <br />

               He is the Queen’s representative and servant,

               and his communications with the Home Gov-

               this, still besides these communications of

               <br />
               —and, if our Imperial relations are to be 
               <br />
               maintained, there must be—a further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clan</span> of 
               <br />
               communications between the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments,</span> 
               <br />
               as to which the Governor should be advised by 
               <br />
               a minister whose particular duty it should be 
               <br />
               to manage aﬂ'airs between the Mother Conn 
               <br />
               and ourselves, and to be in effect a local as -

               <br />
               advisers of the Crown in England. In one 
               <br />
               word, we have got to develops the Imperial 
               <br />
               phase, so to speak, of our provincial system ; 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd the means of keeping our policy and 
               <br />
               that of the Mother Country in harmony; and 
               <br />
               if we do not, we cannot lon keep up our con- 
               <br />
               nection with the Empire. f this were done— 
               <br />
               if we had in our several provincial adminis- 
               <br />
               trations some member charged with this de- 
               <br />
               partment of the public service, as latterly we 
               <br />
               have come to have one charged with the cog- 
               <br />
               nate subject of the militia and defence of 
               <br />
               the country—if these ministers of Imperial 
               <br />
               relations made periodical visits home, so as 
               <br />
               there to meet one another and such members 
               <br />
               of the Imperial Government or others as the 
               <br />
               Crown might charge to meet and confer with 
               <br />
               them—if there were thus organised, some sort 
               <br />
               of advisory colonial council upon the precedent 
               <br />
