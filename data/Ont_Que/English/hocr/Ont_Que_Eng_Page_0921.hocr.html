               vocate annexation to the United States. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve there are many persons in Canada who, 
               <br />
               tho h entertaining feelings of true loyalty to 
               <br />

               way or other—they cannot exactly tell how-— 
               <br />
               annexation would bring about an extraordinary 
               <br />
               and sudden state of prosperity. I differ 
               <br />
               entirely, even in the material and practi- 
               <br />
               cal points of view, from the theorists and 
               <br />
               visionaries who entertain so false a convic- 
               <br />
               tieu. How, I would ask, is this country, 
               <br />
               with diminished means at its command, to be 
               <br />

               future of Canada, thatthat future does not

               depend so much upon our lands as upon our 
               <br />
               waters. The land— the terra ﬁrma—of 
               <br />
               Canada is not inviting to those who have 
               <br />
               tilled the soil of Great Britain or explored 
               <br />
               the vast fertile plains to the west of Lake 
               <br />
               Michigan. Our country is just on a par 
               <br />
               with the northern part of the State of New 
               <br />
               York, and with the States of Vermont and

               New Hampshire in respect of climatic condi-

               tions and conditions of soil. But we possess 
               <br />
               one immense advantage over those countries, 
               <br />
               an advantage which gives us a distinctive

               position on this continent-—the possession of 
               <br />

               <br />
               heritage for our own special advancement. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I feel quite certain that nine- 
               <br />
               tenths of the people of Canada would not be 
               <br />
               de rred from taking their chance as a nation 
               <br />
               t h the fear that they may some day 
               <br />
               have to strike a blow in defence of their 
               <br />
               country; and of all else, whether of reality 
               <br />
               or of sentiment, that should be dear to a 
               <br />
               brave and loyal people. We stand here the 
               <br />
               envied possessors of, take it all in all, the 
               <br />
               greatest river in the world; the keepers of 
               <br />
               one of the great portals to the Atlantic; and 
               <br />
               I trust that Canadians will never be found to 
               <br />
               yield possession of their heritage till wrested 
               <br />
               from them by force! And that must be a 
               <br />
               force, they may rest assured, not merely suf- 
               <br />
               ﬁcient to over-match the pecple of these

               moments longer, while I touch upon one 
               <br />
               very important point. I refer to the 69th

               resolution, foreshadowing the colonizing 
               <br />
