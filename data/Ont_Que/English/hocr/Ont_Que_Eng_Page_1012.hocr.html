               strength enough to assume the burdens it 
               <br />

               And I thought it likely that it would take

               years to accomplish. I would not consent, 
               <br />
               therefore, that any party should make this

               HON. Ma. BROWN —The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               is entirely mistaken. He will ﬁnd there is 
               <br />
               no member of this Government who has any 
               <br />
               idea of shirking this question for an hour. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) And he will see that that is 
               <br />
               the very basis of our present policy. In the 
               <br />
               original negotiations for this Coalition, 
               <br />
               while I admitted that it was a good thing 
               <br />
               and a desirable thing that we should look for 
               <br />
               the future of these provinces in the direction 
               <br />
               of provincial union, yet I contended there 
               <br />
               was a present remedy which we should have 
               <br />
               and could have of our own motion, until the 
               <br />
               other was obtained. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               will admit that we have been wonderfully, 
               <br />
               unexpectedly successful in the policy we 
               <br />
               initiated in July last; and I am prepared to 
               <br />
               say, as I have always been prepared to say, 
               <br />
               that if practicable, this measure is a better 
               <br />
               one than the smaller scheme. But so far 
               <br />
               from its being a different remedy from ours, 
               <br />
               I say it is but an extension of our plan— 
               <br />
               that we who have contended for represent- 
               <br />
               ation by population for so many years, are 
               <br />
               getting all that we asked and something more. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It is true that our Lower 
               <br />
               Canada friends have obtained security for 
               <br />
               their local institutions. For my part, I am 
               <br />
               glad they have got it. Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               have always been willing t ey should have 
               <br />
               it. I can appeal to my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Kamouraska (Hon. Mr. CHAPAIB) whether 
               <br />
               I have not always yearly, for thirteen years 
               <br />
               past, said to him that I was willing to con- 
               <br />
               sider the position of Lower Canada with 
               <br />
               reference to her local institutions, and to 
               <br />
               give any protection for them which might 
               <br />
               be thought to be reasonable. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               And I say this is an admirable compromise 
               <br />
               under the circumstances—and I say it will 
               <br />
