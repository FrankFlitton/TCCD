               from amongst ourselves now absorbed in the

               Western States. Again, we shall have the 
               <br />
               trade of that country carried through our

               seaboard of the produce of a land which I 
               <br />
               look upon as one of the greatest grain— 
               <br />
               producing countries on the continent, equal 
               <br />
               in this respect to any of the fertile states of 
               <br />
               the west. (Hear, hear.) If we look at the 
               <br />
               marvellous growth cf those states, we may 
               <br />
               form some idea of what our North-West 
               <br />
               territory may become, if properly de- 
               <br />
               veloped. In 1830 the whole of that vast 
               <br />
               country was a wilderness. Now we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               its exportation of grain, in addition to the 
               <br />
               quantities consumed, amounting to 120,000,- 
               <br />
               000 annually. The population within a 
               <br />
               short period has increased from ],500,000 
               <br />
               to upwards of 9,000,000. We ﬁnd it now, 
               <br />
               in fact, an empire of itself, possessing all the 
               <br />
               resources of wealth that any country could 
               <br />
               desire. What then may we not expect our 
               <br />
               great North—West to become? If we had it 
               <br />
               opened up, Canada would be the carriers of 
               <br />
               its produ:e, as the Middle States are the 
               <br />
               carriers of the Western States, and the manu- 
               <br />
               facturers of its goods as the Eastern States 
               <br />
               are now the manufacturers of the goods con- 
               <br />
               named by the west. We would occupy 
               <br />
               towards it precisely the same position as the 
               <br />
               Eastern States occupy towards the Western ; 
               <br />
               the produce of the N orth-Wcst would ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               proﬁtable market amongst us, while our 
               <br />
               manufactories would increase and prosper, 
               <br />
               and we would be placed entirely independent 
               <br />
               of the United States in our commercial rela- 
               <br />
               tions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S‘Hear,</span> hear.) As we are now si- 
               <br />
               tuated, t e United States afford us a market, 
               <br />
               especially for our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coarse</span> grains, which 
               <br />
               will not bear the expense of long trans- 
               <br />
               portation. They have taken of our pro—

               duce twenty millions annually since the 
               <br />
               Reciprocity treaty was negotiated. That 
               <br />
               trade must necessarily seek other channels. 
               <br />
               If we can open up the North-West; if 
               <br />
               we enlarge and improve our inland water
