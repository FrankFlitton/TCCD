               an English-speaking member for wer Ca-

               <br />
               serve that there seems to be a good deal of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               phi1030phical excess. Whose words are 
               <br />
               those—“ GOD hath made of one blood all the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Is not that the true theory of race? For 
               <br />
               my part, I am not afraid of the French Ca-

               <br />
               not because I am of the same religion as 
               <br />
               themselves; for origin and language are bar-

               riers stronger to divide men in this world

               I believe that my Protestant compatriots 
               <br />
               need have any such fear. The French Ca- 
               <br />
               nadians have never been an intolerant people; 
               <br />
               it is not in their temper, unless they had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been.</span>

               been as it'has been with other races of all
