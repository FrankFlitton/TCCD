               postponed the scheme for the union of the

               <br />
               French-Canadian peOple was needed. Peace

               having been established, it was resolved to 
               <br />
               carry out the measure, and a bill for the pur—

               <br />
               ing the people of Lower Canada, it was sought 
               <br />
               to force upon them a Constitution under which 
               <br />
               they were to have a smaller representation 
               <br />
               than Upper Canada; moreover, Lower Can-

               <br />
               and the language of Lower Canada was to be 
               <br />
               banished from the Legislature. Happily, the 
               <br />
               scheme found opponents in the Imperial Par- 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂ’orts</span> of our enemies, the bill was thrown out 
               <br />
               at the second reading. Then, as at the present 
               <br />
               day, those who aimed at our destruction were 
               <br />
               loud in favor of passing the bill, at any price, 
               <br />
               before the peeple had an Opportunity of pro- 
               <br />
               testing. At the present moment, those who
