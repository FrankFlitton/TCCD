               that hon. gentlemen from Lower Canada 
               <br />
               would have yielded representation by popu-

               <br />
               representatives of Upper Canada that they 
               <br />
               could accept of no change which would 
               <br />

               dens we have to bear, as this scheme does; 
               <br />
               for that was the charge made over and over 
               <br />
               again at the polls in Upper Canada, that we 
               <br />
               were laboring under heavy burdens which 
               <br />
               had been cast upon us by successive govern- 
               <br />
               ments, owing to the inﬂuence of the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces. (Hear, hear.) Sir, I cannot 
               <br />
               conceive it to be possible that any body of 
               <br />
               men sent here by the people under the Con- 
               <br />
               stitution will make changes in that Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion which were not contemplated by those 
               <br />
               who sent them here, without submitting 
               <br />
               those changes ﬁrst to the people. They have 
               <br />
               not been agitated at the polls, and the people 
               <br />
               seem to think that they should be consider- 
               <br />
               ed, and there is an apathy amongst them 
               <br />
               that does not prove that they are well dis- 
               <br />
               posed towards the scheme. It is true that 
               <br />
               the boast is made that they are all in favor 
               <br />
               of it, and a recent meeting at Toronto is 
               <br />
               pointed to as showing what their feeling is 
               <br />
               upon the subject. Well, of course, the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Lambton and the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Kent were at that meeting, and they said, 
               <br />
               and no doubt believed that those who com- 
               <br />
               posed that meeting were very distinguished 
               <br />
               individuals. (Laughter.) And because 
               <br />
               these distinguished individuals were present, 
               <br />
               and resolutions were carried in favor of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, then it was at once assumed 
               <br />
               that the whole country was in favor of the 
               <br />
               scheme. But it ought to be recollected that 
               <br />
               that meeting was got up by a number of 
               <br />
               young men—talented and able young men, 
               <br />
               no doubt, but still young and enthusiastic— 
               <br />
               associated together to form or reorganize a 
               <br />
               Reform association, and that it was attended 
               <br />
               only by them and those friendly to them and 
               <br />
               their views, and not by the citizens of To- 
               <br />
               ronto, assembled for the purpose of deter- 
               <br />
               mining whether the scheme should be 
               <br />
               adopted or not. It cannot be assumed, there- 
               <br />
               fore, that a meeting of that kind truly re- 
               <br />
               ﬂected the opinion of the people of Toronto; 
               <br />
               nor would this conclusion be arrived at when 
               <br />
               it is remembered that when a gentleman got 
               <br />
