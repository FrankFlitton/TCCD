               I think.on the ﬁrst proposition, that our

               <br />

               remain as we at present stand, separate 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the adjoining republic to acquire posses-

               undoubtedly would, that this could be done

               <br />
               the means, I am satisﬁed, of deterring them

               from such an enterprise. And I am satisﬁed, 
               <br />
               too, that the pe0ple of England would he

               <br />
               believe the very intimation of this Confed- 
               <br />
               eration has awakened the world to the great- 
               <br />

               <br />
               country. (Hear, hear.) That these views 
               <br />
               are shared in by eminent statesmen in Eu- 
               <br />
               rope is also a signiﬁcant fact. Lord HOUGH- 
               <br />
               TON, on seconding the Address on the late 
               <br />
               Speech from the Throne, very emphatically 
               <br />
               declared, in regard to that portion in which 
               <br />
               allusion is made to Confederation, “ that he 
               <br />
               was glad of this movement, because he con- 
               <br />
               fessed that he believed the future ot the 
               <br />
               world rested not in isolated municipalities, 
               <br />
               but in great empires.” And the Earl of 
               <br />
               DERBY, too, in his remarks on that occasion, 
               <br />

               as aﬂording a means of defence against
