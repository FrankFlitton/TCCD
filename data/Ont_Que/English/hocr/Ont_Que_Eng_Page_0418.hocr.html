               do you believe that those statesmen will look 
               <br />
               kindly upon the act? Even my honorable 
               <br />
               friend from Hochelaga has admitted that 
               <br />
               there must be in that case a dissolution of 
               <br />
               the union between Upper and Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               That honorable gentleman stated in his 
               <br />
               speech the other night, that if this measure 
               <br />
               failed there must be Federation between the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> ; and what, I would ask, is that but 
               <br />
               a dissolution of the resent union? It is 
               <br />
               certainly a dissolution of the present union 
               <br />
               to adapt some new Federative system as be- 
               <br />
               tween Upper and Lower Canada. But does 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman think that he will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in the separation of these provinces an 
               <br />
               element of strength? 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">How.</span> Ma. BOLTON—That is what you

               to do now.

               ou. Ma. ROSE—No, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brennan,</span> I 
               <br />
               do not propose to do anything of the kind,

               as my honorable friend will acknowledge, if 
               <br />
               he will but bring his mind, dispassionately 
               <br />
               and earnestly, to the consideration of the 
               <br />
               question. There is no one more capable of 
               <br />
               seeing and appreciating the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imﬁortant</span> fea-

               tnres of this scheme than he. ut my hon. 
               <br />
               friend has strong feelings, and sometimes is 
               <br />
               led away by preconceived jealousies or fears; 
               <br />
               I say that if my honorable friend will bring 
               <br />
               his strong intellect to bear on this scheme, 
               <br />
               he will ﬁnd in it none of those dangers 
               <br />
               which ordinarily attach to the Federal form 
               <br />
               of government. I must now say a few more 
               <br />
               words in reference to the uestion of our 
               <br />
               ability to provide for the efenees of the 
               <br />
               country. I have already stated—and I 
               <br />
               must apologise to the House for the digres- 
               <br />
               sion which has been forced upon me—that 
               <br />
               I do not believe that, if we reverted back to 
               <br />
               our original condition, the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment would be as much disposed to aid us 
               <br />
               in the construction of the works necessary 
               <br />
               for our defence, as if they found that in the 
               <br />
               presence of a common danger we were united 
               <br />
               together to repel the common enemy. Isay 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government would not in such 
               <br />
               a case be actuated simply by a regard to 
               <br />
               the expense of constructing these works—in 
               <br />
               which I understand the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               will have to bear a share—but she would be 
               <br />
               deterred from so doing by the further con- 
               <br />
               sideration, that when built, these works 
               <br />

               <br />
               earnest in this uestion on account of the 
               <br />
               observations which have been made by my 
               <br />
               honorable friend the member for Hochelaga, 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. DORION) observations which I 
               <br />
               am sure he did not mean to have such an 
               <br />
               eﬂ'ect, but which nevertheless have a most 
               <br />
               mischievous tendency. That hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               stated that our true policy was, in feet, neu- 
               <br />
               trality; that it was hopeless for us to attempt 
               <br />
               to defend ourselves against the overwhelming 
               <br />
               force which the United States could bring to 
               <br />
               bear against us, and that with our small 
               <br />
               population we would be very much in the 
               <br />
               same position as Denmark when opposed to 
               <br />
               the armies of Austria and Prussia. Indeed, 
               <br />
               he almost went as faras a gentleman who no 
               <br />
               longer holds a seat in this House, when he 
               <br />
               said that “ the best armament for Canada 
               <br />
               was no armament at all.” I am sure that 
               <br />
               had the honorable gentleman felt that any 
               <br />
               injury would he done—any false impression 
               <br />
               produced on the public mind—b the use of 
               <br />
               observations like these, he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> not have 
               <br />
               employed them at all. But I ma say that
