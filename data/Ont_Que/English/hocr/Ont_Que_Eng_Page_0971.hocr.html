               to bear. It has been said that the disposi- 
               <br />
               tion in England to take part in our defence 
               <br />
               was owing to the fact that Canada had 
               <br />
               manifested a disposition also to make pro- 
               <br />
               vision for defence. Now, supposing 'we 
               <br />
               should fail at any time‘ hereafter to hear what 
               <br />
               may be considered in England a fair propor- 
               <br />
               tion of this cost, what would be the conse- 
               <br />
               quence? Why, we might be placed again 
               <br />
               in preciSely the same position in which we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd ourselves to-day. England might with- 
               <br />
               draw her troOps from this province, and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vref'use</span> to engage in any defensive works, 
               <br />
               unless we undertook more than in the epin- 
               <br />
               ion of the people of this country we are able 
               <br />
               to bear; and hence it is my opinion that if 
               <br />
               it was desirable that this question of Con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">erderation</span> should be submitted to the people 
               <br />
               at all for their adoption, the first and indis- 
               <br />
               pensable step to have taken was to arrange 
               <br />
               with the Imperial Government the terms 
               <br />
               and conditions as regards the question of 
               <br />
               defence upon which we are to enter this 
               <br />
               new state ot political existence. ln this 
               <br />
               sense I do not regret that the scheme, as far 
               <br />
               as the Lower Provinces are concerned—j udg- 
               <br />
               ing from recent events in New Brunswick 
               <br />
               and the utterances of public men in the 
               <br />
               other colonies—is likely to be delayed in its 
               <br />
               accomplishment; and I am not sorry that 
               <br />
               the Canadian Government, by this action of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces, will be compelled to 
               <br />
               consult with the Imperial authorities and 
               <br />
               arrange with them the proportion we are to 
               <br />
               bear of the cost of maintaining the defence 
               <br />
               of the country. (Hear, hear.) It may be 
               <br />
               almost providential that we are compelled, 
               <br />
               by the force of circumstances in the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, to take this step now; and I must 
               <br />
               say that heretofore there has been a disposi- 
               <br />
               tion manifested on the part of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to keep the peeple in ignorance upon 
               <br />
               this subject; but I trust that when these 
               <br />
               negotiations shall have taken place with the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government, we shall know pre— 
               <br />
               cisely what the Government has done and 
               <br />
               what it has agreed to do, and that the exact 
               <br />
               proportion of expense that we are expected 
               <br />
               to bear will be laid before this House and 
               <br />
               submitted to the opinion of the people of 
               <br />
               this country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) I make these 
               <br />
               remarks, sir, merely because to me the 
               <br />
               point appears to be a very important 
               <br />
               one, and because I believe the fullest 
               <br />
               information will be indispensable to this 
               <br />
               House in the future discussions that may 
               <br />

               <br />

               and expressing extreme regret, as a Canadian

               gentlemen who support this scheme. Sir, 
               <br />
               in a British Legislature, where it is proposed 
               <br />
               to build up a great monarchical- constitution 
               <br />
               on this continent, on the model which has 
               <br />
               ﬂourished in England, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regret</span> that any 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman should have found it 
               <br />
               necessary to charge a seditious and disloyal 
               <br />
               intention upon all those who cannot agree 
               <br />
               with them in supporting this scheme. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) For myself—I say it sincerely 
               <br />
               and earnestly, though I have boasted less of 
               <br />
               my loyalty and attachment to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span>

               Crown and Constitution than some hon. mem— 
               <br />
               bers of this House—I think I may say there is 
               <br />
               no one who loves more than I love the Brit- 
               <br />

               <br />

               tem, and no man who believes more ﬁrmly 
               <br />
               than I believe that it would give to the 
               <br />
               people of these colonies that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greatness,</span>

               prosperity and freedom that have distin-

               <br />

               ances of our public men, I think it is a 
               <br />
               cause of deep regret that hon. gentlemen

               <br />
               which they have boasted so much, and which 
               <br />
               they aﬁrm has induced them to sink minor

               disinterested and self-denying exponents, 
               <br />
               have not seen ﬁt, in the discussion of this
