               <br />
               I shall conﬁne myself to making a few 
               <br />
               remarks upon the question in respect of 
               <br />
               defence. — Every one acknowledges that in 
               <br />
               order to defend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a‘èountry</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effectually</span> there 
               <br />
               must be unity of action, uniformity of system, 
               <br />
               and a combination of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means</span> of defence. 
               <br />
               Without uniformity, without unity, it is im- 
               <br />
               possible to make any serious attempt at 
               <br />
               defence in case of attack, and the divided 
               <br />
               country falls an easy prey to the enemy. So 
               <br />
               general is this rule that history shews us 
               <br />
               that weak nations have always united 
               <br />
               together, have always coalesced when they 
               <br />
               were attacked or were in fear of being 
               <br />
               attacked by a powerful enemy. The North 
               <br />
               American colonies did so in 1775, when they 
               <br />
               wished to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> resistance to the Mother 
               <br />
               Country. They organized themselves into 
               <br />
               a Confederation, and it was in consequence. 
               <br />
               of their so doing that they were able to 
               <br />
               resist what they considered as an act of 
               <br />
               Oppression on the part of England. Had 
               <br />
               those colonies, instead of organizing them- 
               <br />
               selves as they did, had each of them a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> system of defence, and had there 
               <br />
               been no uniformity in their tactics, England 
               <br />
               would have had an easy bargain of them. 
               <br />
               And is itto be supposed, if they had not ban d- 
               <br />
               ed themselves together, so as to possess a cer- 
               <br />
               tain amount of strength, that they would have 
               <br />
               obtained the alliance and the assistance of 
               <br />
               France? When a feeble power is attacked 
               <br />
               by a powerful enemy, it should seek to ally 
               <br />
               itself with other states which have interests 
               <br />
               in common with it, in order that they may 
               <br />
               defend themselves in common. So far as 
               <br />
               we are concerned, if we are desirous of 
               <br />
               assisting the Mother Country in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂ'ering</span> an 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂ‘ectual</span> resistance to invasions by the 
               <br />
               American people, we ought to have unity of 
               <br />
               command, in order that we might be able to 
               <br />
               send the militia from the centre and cause 
               <br />
               them to extend towards the circumference. 
               <br />
               In case of war with our neighbors, we should, 
               <br />
               of necessity, be compelled, by the very force 
               <br />

               other European countries were formerly

               peopled by different races, who constituted 
               <br />
               so many different communities; but they 
               <br />
               became united, they entered into confedera-

               <br />
               an hon. member of this House, to show the 
               <br />
               fatal nature of this system to the nations 
               <br />
               who adopted it; but he ought to know that 
               <br />
               the decadence of Greece only began from 
               <br />
               the moment when she abandoned the Federal 
               <br />
               system. The hon. member for Lotbiniére 
               <br />
               sought to prove that confederations were the 
               <br />
               source of all sorts of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disturbances;</span> and in 
               <br />
               support of what he said, he read out to us 
               <br />
               the table of contents of the history of South 
               <br />
               America, in which he found a long list of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">êchaufourées,</span> movements, agitations, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">risingﬁ,</span> 
               <br />

               to deny the facts quoted by the honorable
