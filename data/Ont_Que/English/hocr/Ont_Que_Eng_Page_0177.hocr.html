               of Confederation, but I think it depends 
               <br />
               altogether upon the details Of that scheme 
               <br />
               whether they will give it their approval or not. 
               <br />
               I have no hesitation in declaring what is the 
               <br />
               opinion of the peeple Of my division. I meet 
               <br />
               and mingle with them almost daily, and have 
               <br />
               had ample Opportunities of ascertaining their 
               <br />
               views and sentiments. I believe that a very 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> proportion Of them have no ﬁxed and 
               <br />
               deﬁnite opinions with regard to this scheme. 
               <br />
               They are in favor of Confederation, but they 
               <br />
               have no deﬁnite distinct ideas in regard to the 
               <br />
               details of the scheme proposed. If they knew 
               <br />
               that their taxation would be largely increased 
               <br />
               by it, and that it would add heavily to the 
               <br />
               public burdens, they would not support it. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I think, then, that we who are 
               <br />
               placed here to conserve and protect the in- 
               <br />
               terests Of the public, should be extremely 
               <br />
               careful and analyse these resolutions thor- 
               <br />
               oughly, and ascertain, as nearly as possible, 
               <br />
               what their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> is likely to be, before we take 
               <br />
               the responsibility of voting for them. I have 
               <br />
               no hesitation in declaring that there never was 
               <br />
               a period in the history of Canada when the 
               <br />
               people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffered</span> more than they do at present. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) In consequence of ”the per— 
               <br />
               sonal, municipal and national indebtedness, 
               <br />
               the farmers of the country were never placed 
               <br />
               in a worse position than that which they now 
               <br />
               occupy. (Hear, hear.) When we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               property has depreciated in value within the 
               <br />
               sat ﬁve years, twenty, thirty, forty, ay, and 
               <br />
               even sixty per cent.; when we ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               crops of the country have been steadily de- 
               <br />
               creasing in quantity and value within that 
               <br />
               period; when we ﬁnd that the people are dis- 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with the manner in which the coun- 
               <br />
               try has been governed during the last eight or 
               <br />
               ten years; when we ﬁnd all this, we may be- 
               <br />
               lieve that they are prepared to accept almost 
               <br />
               any change that promises a relief from their 
               <br />
               present diﬂiculties. But we were placed here 
               <br />
               to conserve their interests, to look after their 
               <br />
               welfare, and should not hastily adopt any 
               <br />
               scheme, proposed by any Government — 
               <br />
               whether all of one party stripe or not—— 
               <br />
               without fully examining it and weighing the 
               <br />
               results likely to ﬂow from it. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It is said that the public is well acquainted 
               <br />
               with the nature of the scheme. I demur to 
               <br />
               that statement in toto. The public is not 
               <br />
               acquainted with it in all its bearings, and if 
               <br />
               there is one thing I regret, it is this, that it 
               <br />
               has not been made a party measure. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I regret this because, although perhaps 
               <br />
               no party could have carried it as a party 
               <br />

               <br />
               more thoroughly canvassed and its demerits 
               <br />
               more thoroughly exposed. Our public men 
               <br />
               would have ranged themselves on either side ; 
               <br />
               some would have favored it, and others would 
               <br />
               have o posed it; they would have pointed out 
               <br />
               its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delicious</span> as well as its good points; the 
               <br />
               whole subject would have been fully venti- 
               <br />
               lated, and the result would have been that, 
               <br />
               if passed at all, the scheme would have been 
               <br />
               as perfect as it was possible to have made it. 
               <br />
               But what do you ﬁnd now? You scarcely 
               <br />
               see a newspaper from one end of the country 
               <br />
               to the other that is not full of laudations of 
               <br />
               the scheme. And why ? Because the leading 
               <br />
               public men of the country have thought proper 
               <br />
               to makea fusion ; the leading daily journals on
