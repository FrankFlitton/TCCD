               gland and generous France stood silent

               lockers on. (Hear, hear.) From the Caucasus 
               <br />
               we have had the exodus of a nation from the 
               <br />
               land they defended for centuries, in bitter 
               <br />
               pilgrimage, losing thousands and tens of 
               <br />
               thousands on the way, to seek in the wilds 
               <br />
               of Asia for subsistence and freedom. On this 
               <br />
               continent the great nation which adjoins us 
               <br />
               has resorted to the bitter arbitrament of the 
               <br />
               sword, and an interneeine and deplorable 
               <br />
               combat is being waged on a scale unknown 
               <br />
               since the Russian campaign and the great 
               <br />
               Napoleonic wars. These things, according to 
               <br />
               the stern rules of statecraft, may be right, 
               <br />
               and nations possibly cannot break the hard 
               <br />
               law of non-intervention ; but when we see 
               <br />
               such events passing around us, must we not 
               <br />
               come to the conclusion that power must of 
               <br />
               necessity increase and encroach, or that it is 
               <br />
               as unreasonable now as it ever has been, and 
               <br />
               that pure justice and abstract right, without 
               <br />
               armed battalions to support them, will neither 
               <br />
               preserve integrity of territory nor secure pro- 
               <br />
               tection of person. Again, in the discoveriesin 
               <br />
               the arts and sciences, we can perceive how 
               <br />
               much the power of great states have become 
               <br />
               increased as compared with the smaller ones. 
               <br />
               The telegraph has annihilated time, railroads 
               <br />
               and steamers have devoured space. War can 
               <br />
               only be waged by nations possessing vast 
               <br />
               resources in money, warlike engines and 
               <br />
               materials. One iron-clad man-of-war, with 
               <br />
               her complement of Armstrong guns, would 
               <br />
               cost the year’s revenue of a province. (Hear, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> And if we look around us we see this 
               <br />
               principle of territorial aggrandizement, this 
               <br />
               gathering together of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diaiecta</span> membra of 
               <br />
               nations ; this girding up of the loins of em- 
               <br />
               pires for coming events is steadily carried 
               <br />
               out. The principle of centralization is ra- 
               <br />
               pidly going on, ispressing together the great 
               <br />
               nations, and rendering it necessary for smaller 
               <br />
               nations and provinces to unite, and cen- 
               <br />
               tralize for their common defence. (Hear, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> The subject is not one of theory, 
               <br />
               but of fact. Look at Italy, such a short time 
               <br />
               ago a weak and scattered congeries of states, 
               <br />
               now united into one powerful government.

               had peculiar difﬁculties of our own. Usually

               <br />
               tions, our governments have fallen likehouses 
               <br />
               of cards. Coalition and party governments 
               <br />
               alike have met the same fate, and it had 
               <br />
               become seriously to be considered as to 
               <br />
               whether responsible government was not a 
               <br />
               failure in Canada. Before the cry for an 
               <br />
               increased representation for Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               several of our best public men were driven 
               <br />
               from political life ; and it must have become 
               <br />
               clear to those who watched events that there 
               <br />
               must soon have been a readjustment of the 
               <br />
               representation based partly, at least, on 
               <br />
               numbers, or a dissolution of the union. I 
               <br />
               think, air, that those who have read and 
               <br />
               proﬁted by the events of the past, and have 
               <br />
               considered what is likely to occur in the 
               <br />
               future, must be satisﬁed that a repeal of the 
               <br />
               union between Upper and Lower Canada 
               <br />
               would be a very great misfortune. And as 
               <br />
               to representation according to population, 
               <br />
               the appeals to prejudices and passions, and 
               <br />
               possibly well grounded fears which must 
               <br />
               result from granting that to Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               would be must disastrous. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               We should have had, in Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               a very large amount of discontent and 
               <br />
               even disaﬁ'ection; and, therefore, I con- 
               <br />
               sider it a great advantage to Canada that 
               <br />
               the adoption of Confederation will meet these 
               <br />
               difﬁculties without causing the discontent 
               <br />
               and disaﬂ'ection which either of the above 
               <br />
               measures would inevitably arouse. (ﬂeur.) 
               <br />
               But, sir, I may be asked, will these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, if united, become a great power? 
               <br />
               Sir, I shall frankly answer that 1 think 
               <br />
               not at present, nor will I venture to predict 
               <br />
               what the future has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> store for us ;but I 
               <br />
               think thereby we obtain a greater chance of 
               <br />
               obviating the evils to which I have referred, 
               <br />
               and we in Canada shall also overcome our 
               <br />
               peculiar difﬁculties — and this I say, that 
               <br />
               united, we shall possess advantages which 
               <br />
               separate, though portions of the same empire, 
               <br />
               we cannot realize. (Cheer-5.) We shall be 
               <br />
               one to deliberate, to decide and to set. We 
               <br />
               shall have but one tariﬁ'; trade will be un- 
               <br />
               shackled, our intercommunication will be 
               <br />
               unbroken, the Lower Provinces will give us
