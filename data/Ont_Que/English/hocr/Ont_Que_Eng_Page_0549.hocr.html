               <br />
               and astute as any we have here. The dan-

               <br />
               of our own going on here, and internal troubles, 
               <br />
               while these annoyances on the part of our

               neighbors across the border are being multi-

               plied upon us; and that England may at the 
               <br />
               same time be feeling that the tie between her 
               <br />

               <br />
               and humiliation put upon us do not concern 
               <br />
               her so much as they would have done when 
               <br />
               our connection with her was practically more 
               <br />
               intimate. In and before 1840, after the 
               <br />
               troubles which had been distracting Canada 
               <br />
               were put down, it was declared, and perfectly 
               <br />
               well understood, that the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               was simply determined to hold on to the con- 
               <br />
               nection with this country. And the know- 
               <br />
               ledge of that expressed determination gua- 
               <br />
               ranteed us a pretty long term of comparative 
               <br />
               feedom from annoyances and trouble of the 
               <br />
               kind to which I have been referring. If, 
               <br />
               now, a different idea is to prevail—if the no- 
               <br />
               tion is to go abroad that we are, by creating 
               <br />
               ourselves into a new nationality, to be some— 
               <br />
               what less connected with the Empirc than 
               <br />
               these provinces heretofore have been, then I 
               <br />
               do apprehend that a very diﬁerent future is 
               <br />
               before us, and that in all sorts of ways, by 
               <br />
               vexations of all kinds, by the fomenting of 
               <br />
               ever trouble within our own borders, whether 
               <br />
               originating from abroad, or only reacted on 
               <br />
               from abroad, we shall be exposed to dangers 
               <br />
               of the most serious kind. And, therefore, so 
               <br />
               far from seeing in our relations towards the Uni- 
               <br />
               ted States, any reason why we should assume a 
               <br />
               position of semi-independence, an attitude of 
               <br />
               seeming deﬁance towards them, I ﬁnd in them 
               <br />
               the strongest reason why, even while regard- 
               <br />

               <br />
               possible, we should endeavor to make all the 
               <br />
               world see that we are trying to strengthen 
               <br />
               our union with the Mother Country—that 
               <br />
               we care far less about a mere union with 
               <br />
               neighboring provinces, which will frighten no 
               <br />
               one in the least, but that we are determined to 
               <br />
               maintain at all hazards and draw closer, that 
               <br />
               connection with the Mother Country which 
               <br />
               alone, so long as it lasts, can and will protect 
               <br />
               us from all serious aggression. (Hear, hear.)
