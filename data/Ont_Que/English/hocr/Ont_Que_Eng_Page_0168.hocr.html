               <br />
               his speech commenced yesterday, as fol- 
               <br />
               lows :—In the remarks I oﬁ‘ered to this 
               <br />
               House yesterday, hon. gentlemen, I desired 
               <br />
               tostate my reasons for voting against the 
               <br />
               amendment of my hon. friend from Wellin — 
               <br />
               ton, and for the resolutions of Hon. Sir E. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%.</span> 
               <br />
               Tacnt. I stated that I believed the Con- 
               <br />
               federation scheme was desired by an over- 
               <br />
               whelming majority of the people of this 
               <br />
               country, certainly by a very large majority of 
               <br />
               my own constituents. I stated further that 
               <br />
               as the resolutions had been before the 
               <br />
               country for a long time—for a number of 
               <br />
               months—and as there was no evidence what- 
               <br />
               ever before us of their being disapproved 
               <br />
               of as a whole, or indeed any one of them, we 
               <br />
               had good reason to assume that the people 
               <br />
               were satisﬁed. The press had published 
               <br />
               them in full, and there was not one petition 
               <br />
               against the measure. We have every ri ht to 
               <br />
               assume that the people are in favor 0 Con- 
               <br />
               federation. I went on further, and said that 
               <br />
               during last autumn, I was constantly and 
               <br />
               daily bringing the matter before a very large 
               <br />
               constituency, where it was always approved 
               <br />
               of. During a portion of that canvass, one of 
               <br />
               my opponents mooted what I may call the 
               <br />
               smaller Confederation—that is, the Confed- 
               <br />
               eration of the two parts of Canada, and the 
               <br />
               peeple rejected and scouted it, while approv- 
               <br />
               ing of the larger one. (Bean) I went on 
               <br />
               tosay, with respect to the proposed change 
               <br />
               in the constitution of this House, that I did 
               <br />
               not look u n it as a disfranchisementof the 
               <br />
               electors, though the nominative was to be 
               <br />
               substituted for the elective principle, because 
               <br />
               while the nomination was not to be made by 
               <br />
               the people directly, it was to be made on the 
               <br />
               recommendation of their representatives in 
               <br />
               the other House of Parliament,—in fact in a 
               <br />
               manner analogous to the mode adopted for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selecting</span> the Senate of the United States— 
               <br />
               tve senators being elected by the Legisla- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tureof</span> each state. In our case the men- 
               <br />
               arehical principle was strictly preserved, 
               <br />
               and the Legislative Council was to be ap- 
               <br />
               pointed by the Crown, on the advice of the 
               <br />
               Government of the day. If I viewed it as a 
               <br />
               measure of disfranehisement, then, looking 
               <br />
               at my obligation to maintain the franchise of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> peeple, I should have more hesitation in 
               <br />
               voting for it. An hon. gentleman has said 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               that the change, from the nominative to the 
               <br />
               elective plan, was made at the demand of 
               <br />
               the people. That assertion is not historical- 
               <br />
               l correct; it is not correct as far as Upper 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ganada</span> is concerned, and I think not with 
               <br />
               respect to Lower Canada either. There <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was,</span> 
               <br />
               at one time, a desire in Lower Canada, for 
               <br />
               the election of its legislative councillors, 
               <br />
               but the public men who carried out the 
               <br />
               change, did so more out of respect to the 
               <br />
               traditions of the country than from any 
               <br />
               pressure that existed then. In Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada, I am quite sure, that so far from the 
               <br />
               people desiring it, they were either lukewarm 
               <br />
               or opposed to it. The liberal and reform 
               <br />
               party of Upper Canada were all opposed to 
               <br />
               it. It is well known that the late Hon. 
               <br />
               ROBERT <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BALDWIN,</span> so many years the leader 
               <br />
               of 'that party, was always opposed to the 
               <br />
               change. And it is also well known, that the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who is and has been for years 
               <br />
               the leader of that ty, and who now holds in 
               <br />
               the Government t e position of the President 
               <br />
               of the Council (Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Baown),</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposed</span> 
               <br />
               the change to the very last wherever is in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence extended, in the press which he con- 
               <br />
               trolled, and in his place in Parliament I 
               <br />
               myself saw him stand u to vote against the 
               <br />
               third reading of the bil . It cannot, there- 
               <br />
               fore, be said that the alteration was made at 
               <br />
               the earnest desire of the peOple. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I went on further, and stated that ]. 
               <br />
               looked on the measure as one which did not 
               <br />
               admit of amendment, since if we were to 
               <br />
               amend it, there were nine other houses 
               <br />
               which might claim the right to do the same, ' 
               <br />
               and it could, perhaps, never be carried out. 
               <br />
               I then expressed approval of the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               arrangements contemplated, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differed</span> from 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Port Hope (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Salmons),</span> who said the revenues of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in past times should have been made 
               <br />
               the basis on which they should bring their 
               <br />
               debts into the Confederation. Inasmuch as 
               <br />
               we are not to continue separate provinces, 
               <br />
               and not to contribute separate revenues to 
               <br />
               the treasury, but are to be subject to the 
               <br />
               same imposts and to have one tariﬁ', a 
               <br />
               capitation basis is the proper one, and not 
               <br />
               that desired by my hon. friend. (Hear.) I 
               <br />
               went on to say that the triﬂing amount to 
               <br />
               be paid to New Brunswick by the Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, for ten years, was necessary under the 
               <br />
               circumstances, and ought not to be allowed 
               <br />
               to weigh for one moment against the beneﬁts 
               <br />
               to be derived from the proposed arrangement.
