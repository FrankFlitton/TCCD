               the way such conclusions are formed abroad. 
               <br />
               I remember a vote which was misconstrued, 
               <br />
               much to the prejudice of this country—I 
               <br />
               refer to that on the Militia Bill rejected in 
               <br />
               1862. There is no doubt the rejection of 
               <br />
               that bill gave rise to the opinion which pre- 
               <br />
               vails in England—and you cannot convince 
               <br />
               the people there to the contrary—that Cana- 
               <br />
               dians are unwilling to defend themselves. 
               <br />
               Nothing could be more unjust to our people 
               <br />
               than to entertain such an idea, nothing 
               <br />
               more unjust even to the majority who voted 
               <br />
               against that bill ; but still that was the con- 
               <br />
               viction arrived at, which it took a long time 
               <br />
               to modify, and which is not entirely removed 
               <br />
               to this day. I believe that vote has cost the 
               <br />
               country a very large sum of money in various 
               <br />
               ways. (Hear, hear.) In conclusion, let me 
               <br />
               just say that we cannot remain any longer as 
               <br />
               we are; we have to advance in some direc- 
               <br />
               tion, and I believe we are going in the right 
               <br />
               direction when we proceed towards Confed- 
               <br />
               eration. I am very much disposed to agree 
               <br />
               with the honorable and gallant Premier, that 
               <br />
               we are on the top of an inclined plane, and 
               <br />
               that if we do not adopt Confederation, we 
               <br />
               shall very likely ﬁnd ourselves descending it 
               <br />

               HON. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR.‘BOULTON</span> said he rejoiced to

               orable member who had just spoken, a gentle- 
               <br />
               man so well calculated to sustain its credit, 
               <br />
               and to assist by his enlightened and thoroughly 
               <br />
               patriotic views in the di as] of the many 
               <br />
               and important questions With which it had to

               deal, in a manner worthy of the House and 
               <br />
               beneﬁcial to the country. With respect to the 
               <br />
               measure in debate, he must state he was de- 
               <br />
               lighted at the principles it embodied. He 
               <br />
               was strongly in its favor, and so far from re- 
               <br />
               garding it as imperilling the interests of the 
               <br />
               province, thought it eminently ada ted to 
               <br />
               advance its prosperity and welfare. 6 was 
               <br />
               not a young man, having numbered more than 
               <br />
               half a century of years, during the greater 
               <br />
               part of which period he had ﬁlled a seat in 
               <br />
               either one or the other of the Houses of Par- 
               <br />
               liament, but he had never yet known a mea- 
               <br />
               sure of equal importance brought under dis- 
               <br />
               cussion. He mi ht possibly not live to see it 
               <br />
               carried, but hope and expected he would, and 
               <br />
               if it were, he had no doubt it would realize 
               <br />
               all the anticipations of its framcrs, and issue 
               <br />
               in the test <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantage</span> not to the colonies

               <br />
               During the time he had been in Parliament he

               <br />
               earnest urpose to vote rightly, but yet he had 
               <br />
               two or t ee votes to regret, and that which 
               <br />
               he most regretted, was the one he ve against 
               <br />
               the union of Upper and Lower anada. In 
               <br />
               this he felt now, as he had felt before, that he 
               <br />
               was wrong, but his consolation was that he 
               <br />
               had acted independently and conscientiously, 
               <br />
               not allowing himself to swerve from what he 
               <br />
               regarded as his duty even by the earnest en- 
               <br />
               treaties of one of his most valued friends, the 
               <br />
               then Attorney General for Upper Canada, who 
               <br />
               had taken a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> view of the case. He 
               <br />
               now recognized the wisdom of the measure, 
               <br />
               and was glad his fears had been disa pointed, 
               <br />
               and that great beneﬁts had resulted rom it to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bothdsections.</span> He viewed the union now pro- 
               <br />
               pose as ra ht with the largest advantages 
               <br />
               to all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Biiigtish</span> North American Provinces, 
               <br />
               and believed his anticipations would be rea- 
               <br />
               lised. He had often crossed the Atlantic and 
               <br />
               travelled extensively in E land and the United 
               <br />
               States, but it was not unti last summer, as he 
               <br />
               acknowledged with shame, that he had paid a 
               <br />
               visit to the Lower Provinces, now proposed to 
               <br />
               be united with Canada. This ignorance of sister 
               <br />
               colonies so near to our own country, he thought, 
               <br />
               was not creditable to any legislator, and he 
               <br />
               hoped other honorable members would feel it 
               <br />
               their duty to acquire for themselves informa- 
               <br />
               tion which was so necessary to their position. 
               <br />
               Well, he had been there last summer, and his 
               <br />
               opinions respecting those countries had imme- 
               <br />
               diately undergone a very sensible change. He 
               <br />
               had not expected to see such a beautiful city 
               <br />
               as St. John, N. B., or such a place as Hali- 
               <br />
               fax. He had conceived the people as poor 
               <br />
               and struggling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for.</span> existence, but was delighted 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd merchants doing a great business, and 
               <br />
               exhibiting as high a standing and as much 
               <br />
               enterprise as any in Canada. Then, these 
               <br />
               provinces were distinguished by the most de— 
               <br />
               voted attachment to the British Empire and 
               <br />
               loyalty to the British Crown, sentiments which 
               <br />
               he was unfeignedly delighted to observe. He 
               <br />
               hoped these sentiments would continue to pre- 
               <br />
               vail and even be strengthened by the Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion now contemplated. (Hear, hear.) When . 
               <br />
               he represented a constituency in Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada and had to seek reelection, he had always 
               <br />
               hung out his ﬂag with “British supremacy ” 
               <br />
               inscribed thereon — (hear, hear,) —— and he 
               <br />
               hoped that the sentiment would continue to 
               <br />
               be cherished in the country so long as he 
               <br />
               lived. As to the allegations of some honorable 
               <br />
               members that the people were ignorant as to 
               <br />
               the merits of the measure roposed, he could 
               <br />
               say that, so far as the loc ity from which h
