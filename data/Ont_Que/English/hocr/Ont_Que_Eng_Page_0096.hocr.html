               of Canada to accomplish the construction of a

               <br />
               without exception, have felt in the same way, 
               <br />
               and the MAODONALD—SICOTTE Administration 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               then asked why, since there was to be a disso- 
               <br />
               lution and an appeal to the people of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick on the subject, there should not be 
               <br />
               one in Canada? The answer to that has al- 
               <br />
               ready been given. The term of Parliament 
               <br />

               <br />
               have had to go to their constituents to give an 
               <br />
               account of their conduct during the previous 
               <br />
               four years, it was thought better to anticipate 
               <br />
               the time of its dissolution by three or four 
               <br />
               months. In Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               however, where the elections were more 
               <br />
               recent, there are to be no elections. I will 
               <br />
               add that this mode of appealing to the people 
               <br />
               is not British but American, as under the 
               <br />
               British system the representatives of the peo-

               land and Scotland, and between England and 
               <br />
               Ireland were effected, there were no appeals to 
               <br />
               the people, it being assumed that the people's 
               <br />
               chosen representatives were uite competent to
