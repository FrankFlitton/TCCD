               <br />

               <br />
               think. is unworthy of the leader of this 
               <br />
               House. (Hear, hear.) I deny that I have 
               <br />
               ever snecred at the defence question. During 
               <br />
               my life, it has been more than a sentiment 
               <br />
               with mc—it has been a principle that this 
               <br />
               country should be defended. I know it is a 
               <br />
               duty we owe to the Empire, as a self-gov- 
               <br />
               erning colony, to contribute a fair proportion 
               <br />
               of our means for defence. And I am sure I 
               <br />
               speak the sentiments of every honorable 
               <br />
               member on this side, when I say that we are 
               <br />
               prepared, to the extent of our resources, to 
               <br />
               contribute all we can for that object. But it 
               <br />
               is not only that we are called upon to con- 
               <br />
               tribute means for our defence ; we shall be 
               <br />
               called upon also, in the time of danger, to 
               <br />
               contribute men, to shed the best blood of the 
               <br />
               country, to see our ﬁelds devastated, our 
               <br />
               towns destroyed, our trade and commerc: 
               <br />
               ruined. All these are consequences of a 
               <br />
               state of war, which must necessarily fall 
               <br />
               upon us, in the event of that calamity arising. 
               <br />
               We have all that to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider,‘and</span> we have 
               <br />
               the consciousness also that, without a very 
               <br />
               large amount of Imperial aid, it would be 
               <br />
               impossible for us for a long time to resist an 
               <br />
               invasion of this country. But, while taking 
               <br />
               this ground, let us not be led away by this 
               <br />
               buncombe talk of loyalty—by the dragging 
               <br />
               in of the name ot the Sovereign and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               their supporters, they say to them that they 
               <br />
               must do what they bid them, because the 
               <br />
               Queen has said this, and the Governor 
               <br />
               General has said that, and they constantly 
               <br />
               refer to “ loyalty.” For my own part, I never 
               <br />
               invoke the aid of that term—for I always 
               <br />
               take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> for granted that men are loyal, until 
               <br />
               they prove by word or deed that they are 
               <br />
               disloyal. (Hear, hear.) The imputations 
               <br />
               east on our loyalty are a gratuitous insult
