               do this, and then I will forgive him for the

               illiberality which he exhibits towards those who 
               <br />
               have honætly endeavored, to the best of their

               <br />
               now under your consideration. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I could forgive my honorable friend altogether, 
               <br />
               if, like my honorable friend opposite, he took 
               <br />
               the ground that the scheme ought to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delayed</span> 
               <br />
               until aftera general election. But, instea of 
               <br />
               that, he leaves no stone untumed to prejudice 
               <br />
               this House against the measure. It seems to 
               <br />
               me-that if he could prejudice the House enﬁ- 
               <br />
               ciently against it to insure its defeat, as a 
               <br />
               whole, he would leave no stone unturned to 
               <br />
               accomplish it. So far from showing that he 
               <br />
               is in favor of the scheme, I cannot for one 
               <br />
               moment imagine how any one can believe him 
               <br />

               “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">f</span> am in favor of the scheme, but opposed to

               those details tested and tried in all its bearin , 
               <br />
               so far as such a thing was possible, by gen e- 
               <br />
               men as intelligent and well informed upon the 
               <br />
               subjects embraced as any honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               in this House ? Every honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               now listening to me knows very well that it 
               <br />
               was not possible to ado a scheme that could 
               <br />
               not be found fault wrth. No matter what 
               <br />
               scheme was put. upon the table of this House, 
               <br />
               even if my honorable friend had been able to 
               <br />
               submit a scheme inﬁnitely superior to this, 
               <br />
               does anybody believe that certain honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen in this House would have supported 
               <br />
               it? The resolutions me be objectionable 
               <br />
               here and objectionable ere, but it is for 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen to consider all the 
               <br />
               circumstances out of which they have grown, 
               <br />
               and consider whether, under those circum- 
               <br />
               stances, they ought not to be adopted as a whole 
               <br />
               by the House. Honorable gentlemen say, 
               <br />
               where is the advantage to be gamed by Canada 
               <br />
               from Confederation ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Well.</span> now, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">v</span> can any 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen in his senses believe 
               <br />
               that the removal of the obstacles to inter- 
               <br />
               course between the provinces, the doing away 
               <br />
               with the customs duties, and the developing 
               <br />
               the trade of the St. Lawrence, is no advantage 
               <br />
               to Canada ? Can it be said that to open up 
               <br />
               commerce with three millions of people along 
               <br />
               the St. Lawrence and the lakes will be of no

               pretend to deny that there is no additional 
               <br />
               strength in union over isolation ? Does any 
               <br />
               man pretend to say that eight hundred or a 
               <br />
               thousand men belonging <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘to</span> a regiment are

               <br />
               of all these provinces are comparatively weak 
               <br />
               in their present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isolated</span> state. If we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can“</span>

               say to the Uniœd States that we had the con-

               sirous to avert an appeal to force of arms ? 
               <br />
               It is the strength of a large number of people 
               <br />
               wielded by one mind, aﬂ‘ording a power vastly 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               from Niagara took occasion, in the course of 
               <br />
               his remarks, to throw doubt u one or two 
               <br />
               of my statements, and partic arly in regard 
               <br />
               to the value of the mineral deposits of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. I stated that I could satisfy the 
               <br />
               House that there were mineral <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depmite</span> in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland of a valuable character. I 
               <br />
               will not detain the House by reading itat 
               <br />
               length, but I hold in my hand a copy of .a 
               <br />
               report that was made on that œlony in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1840,</span> 
               <br />
               stating that these deposits consisted of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gallons,</span> 
               <br />
               gypsum, marble, gold, iron, copper, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ete.</span> 
               <br />
               There are most important lead mines in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opu-</span> 
               <br />
               ation, and Professor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sesame</span> states that 
               <br />
               he saw 3,500 pounds of pure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">galerie</span> thrown 
               <br />
               from a vein at a single blast. He goes on in 
               <br />
               this report to describe the very convenient 
               <br />
               position of the mines, showing that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they.“</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               twelve or ﬁfteen feet of water. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repcs</span> 
               <br />
               plainly shows that my honorable friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
