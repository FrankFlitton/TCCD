               <br />
               A strange comment on that earnest desire for 
               <br />
               economy, which is claimed to have dictated 
               <br />
               the whole of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangements.</span> (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) If that was the intention, the per- 
               <br />
               formance has fallen far short of it. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) And before I go further, there 
               <br />
               occurs to me this consideration, arising out 
               <br />
               of this state of things—out of this abun- 
               <br />
               dance, not to say plethora, that is meant w 
               <br />
               characterize the provincial exchcquers, what- 
               <br />
               ever may be the case with the Federal 
               <br />
               exchequer under the system—one considera- 
               <br />
               tion, I say, connected with this, which should 
               <br />
               notbe lost sight of when we are talking about 
               <br />
               the application of anything in the least like 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> government to our provinces. I 
               <br />
               never yet heard of an elected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span> body 
               <br />
               that had much control over a government, 
               <br />
               unless it had hold of the strings of a purse 
               <br />
               from which the government wanted to get 
               <br />
               something. In the old days, before responsi- 
               <br />
               ble government was thought of—in the days 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> casual and territorial revenues gave 
               <br />
               provincial governments all they wanted, or a 
               <br />
               little more—provincial legislatures had mighty 
               <br />
               little to do with government, and, if they 
               <br />
               complained of agrievance, were little likely 
               <br />
               tobe listened <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to}</span> It Was even the same long 
               <br />
               before at home. When the English Crown 
               <br />
               had its abundance of resources, English kings 
               <br />
               cared little for their parliaments. But when 
               <br />
               their resources were exhausted, and they could 
               <br />
               not borrow easily, and had to ask for taxes, 
               <br />
               then the House of Commons began to acquire 
               <br />
               power, and, in course of time, became the 
               <br />
               body it is now. I shall be surprised if we do 
               <br />
               not ﬁnd, in the event of this Confederation 
               <br />

               for good than many would wish to have 
               <br />
               them, that the machine of state will not be

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether</span> driven by their means. But there

               Gentlemen will go to their constituents with 
               <br />
               an easy conscience, telling them: “ True, we

               I am afraid in many constituencies the ans-

               <br />
               analogies. and there is another even nearer. 
               <br />
               Years ago, we in Canada said we would for ever 
               <br />
               give a certain ﬁxed sum per annum for an edu- 
               <br />
               cation fund. It was to be divided, in a cer- 
               <br />
               tain ratio, between Upper and Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               But from time to time, as the census shewed 
               <br />
               changes of their relative population, the divi- 
               <br />
               sion was to be altered. In a little while this 
               <br />
               alteration of ratio gave Lower Canada less 
               <br />
               money and Upper Canada more. “ Oh! but,” 
               <br />
               said the Administration, “we cannot do that 
               <br />
               with Lower Canada. After having had distrib- 
               <br />
               uted to her so many thousands a car, she could 
               <br />
               not stand having ever so much ess. No, no; 
               <br />
               we cannot do that. What shall we do, then ? 
               <br />
               In our estimates we will put in a vote for 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, just to keep her ﬁgure up to 
               <br />
               the mark of what she has been receiving. 
               <br />
               And what then? Why, of course, we must 
               <br />
               add a vote for Upper Canada in the same pro- 
               <br />
               portion, just to take her so much further beyond 
               <br />
               her former ﬁgure.” (Hear, hear.) To be 
               <br />
               sure, I do ﬁnd, with reference to this subven- 
               <br />
               tion, a pleasant little expression, which one 
               <br />
               wishes may be carried out. It is to be “ in
