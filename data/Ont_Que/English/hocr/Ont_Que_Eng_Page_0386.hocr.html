               <br />
               we cannot remain in the position in which 
               <br />
               we are. The hon. m rmber for Hochelaga <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> 
               <br />
               said so for ten years 'past, and undertook to 
               <br />
               change it. He said the position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'was</span> no 
               <br />
               longer tenable in [854, and if it was not 
               <br />
               tenable then, it is still less so in 1865. I 
               <br />
               now come to the other alternative proposed 
               <br />
               to us—that of independence Men may be

               <br />

               <br />
               we-had better have independence than Con- 
               <br />
               federation. For my part, I believe that the 
               <br />
               independence of the'llritish North American 
               <br />
               Provinces would be the greatest misfortune 
               <br />
               which could happen to them; it'would be to 
               <br />
               leave us at the mercy of our neighbors,‘ and 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throw</span> us into their arms. Independence 
               <br />
               would make us masters of our position, but 
               <br />
               at the same time we should be deprived of 
               <br />
               the protection of England. and without that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> by no means <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁeult</span> toforesee what 
               <br />
               would become of as. The hon; member for 
               <br />
               Hochelaga may think it to our advantage to 
               <br />
               be weak, but in that opinion I do not coin- 
               <br />
               side; I consider that it is better to be in a 
               <br />
               position to meet the enemy in case of his 
               <br />
               attaching us. Let it be well understood 
               <br />
               that without the protection of England we 
               <br />
               can do nothing. And besides the outlay 
               <br />
               which would be entailed by our providing 
               <br />
               for our defence, there would also be enor- 
               <br />
               mous expenditure in order to keep up in a 
               <br />
               suitable manner our relations with foreign 
               <br />

               <br />
               the support and assistance of’ England, we 
               <br />
               should have to maintain an army and a very 
               <br />
               expensive government, we should have to 
               <br />
               keep up diplomatic relations with other 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">countries,</span> and provide means to defray a host

               nadas, proposed by the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Hochelaga. In his manifesto of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1861</span> he 
               <br />
               told us in what position we should then be.

               is a very bad argument—an argument by no 
               <br />
               means a lvantageous to Lower Canada. The 
               <br />
               hon. member says in that manifesto that it 
               <br />
               would be quite an easy matter to secure the 
               <br />
               silence of Upper Canada. by granting it four 
               <br />
               or ﬁve more members than Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               But the hon. member very well knows that 
               <br />
               it we were to grant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> based on 
               <br />
               population, it would not bc four or ﬁve 
               <br />
               members we should have to give to Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, but the seventeen members which 
               <br />
               it is now prOposed to give Upper Canada by 
               <br />
               the plan of Confederation. The increase 
               <br />
               would not be based on an imaginary number. 
               <br />
               But even with four or ﬁve members more in 
               <br />
               the present union, Upper Canada could 
               <br />
               impose its decision on all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questions</span> which 
               <br />
               might come before the House. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga has told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> that under 
               <br />
               the proposed syste r. Upper Canada mll have 
               <br />
               seventeen members more th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'n</span> Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               and that the English element will be in- 
               <br />
               creased by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">addirion</span> of all the members 
               <br />
               from the Lower Provinces, and that they 
               <br />
               will enter into a league against us Lower 
               <br />
               Canadians. I must say, I do not think the 
               <br />
               hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pays</span> a very high compliment 
               <br />
               to his ex-colleague the Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hamon,</span> 
               <br />
               when he says that because the members will 
               <br />
               be English, they will be against us French- 
               <br />
               Canadians. So great was his conﬁdence in 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Chateauguay, that he 
               <br />
               took him into his Government, and would 
               <br />
               take him again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> if he had the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity; and yet the hon. member for lloche- 
               <br />
               lags speaks of the English as though they 
               <br />
               were our natural enemies. For my part, I 
               <br />
               do not think they are; moreover, the 
               <br />
               question before us is not the formation of a 
               <br />
               Local Government only. We are considering 
               <br />
