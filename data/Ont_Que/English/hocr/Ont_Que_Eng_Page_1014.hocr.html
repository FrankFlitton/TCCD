               friend from South Oxford went to his own

               details before the people? (Hear, hear.)

               known. He surely will not argue from the

               more that the people are in favor Of the

               <br />
               the people were in favor of that system, or

               there is one other point to which I wish to

               refer. The Honorable Attorney General

               <br />
               the honorable member for North Ontario, 
               <br />
               said that the people of all the provinces 
               <br />
               were against a legislative union.

               that he has been wrong for the last twenty

               day. Well, sir, that is all that I rose to say

               —to say that the Honorable President of the

               <br />

               peal to the people in these elections on the 
               <br />
               details of this scheme; that it was not in the

               contemplation of the electors at the last gen- 
               <br />
               eral election; that the whole Liberal party 
               <br />
               were opposed to it as a means of settling the 
               <br />
               Canadian diﬂiculty ; that it was never brought 
               <br />
               forward until the crisis of June last; that the 
               <br />
               people have consequently had no opportunity 
               <br />
               of pronouncing upon it; and that we have no 
               <br />
               right to dispose of it ﬁnally without an appeal 
               <br />

               MR. MAGILL—I had no intention of

               I have only to say that when the subject was

               brought before the electors of the city of

               <br />
               time ago to the electors. I think that the
