               <br />
               to deal with it here. The Lower Provinces, 
               <br />
               we think, are smaller political communities 
               <br />
               than ourselves. Their legislative councils, 
               <br />
               their Houses of Assembly, we do not call quite 
               <br />
               so considerable as our own. We are in the 
               <br />
               habit of thinking that among the legislative 
               <br />
               bodies in the British Empire, we stand num- 
               <br />
               ber two; certainly a great way behind the 
               <br />
               House of Commons, but having no other body 
               <br />
               between us and them in point of importance. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear. The Lower Provinces, I say, 
               <br />
               are not so big as we are, and yet how differ- 
               <br />
               ently has our Parliament been treated from 
               <br />
               the way in which their smaller parliaments 
               <br />
               have been. And the apology, the reason as- 
               <br />
               signed why we are treated as we are, is, that 
               <br />
               this thing is a binding treaty, if not yet be- 
               <br />
               tween the provinces, at least between the 
               <br />
               governments of the other provinces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. But how does the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia address 
               <br />
               his houses of parliament ? “ It is not my pro- 
               <br />
               vinces,” says he, “and I have no mission to 
               <br />
               do more than aﬂ'ord you the amplest and freest

               <br />
               —ne does not call it a treaty—he calls it 
               <br />
               merely “a proposal, which seriously involves 
               <br />
               your own prospects.” I suppose it does; but, 
               <br />

               <br />
               call it even an agreement.
