               MB. A. MACKENZIE resumed the ad- 
               <br />
               journed debate. He said — Before proceed- 
               <br />
               ing, Mr. Spuxsa, to discuss the measure of 
               <br />
               Confederation itself, I think it desirable to 
               <br />
               revert for a moment to the position which 
               <br />
               we have occupied, in discussing those con- 
               <br />
               stitutional questions that have so long separ- 
               <br />
               ated parties, and involved the two sections 
               <br />
               of the province in serious dissensions. I do 
               <br />
               this to meet the charges of inconsistency 
               <br />
               brought against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself</span> and others, because 
               <br />
               we support the present Coalition Government 
               <br />
               with a view to obtain the solution of the 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties with which we have had to 
               <br />
               contend—in a way not perhaps hitherto 
               <br />
               advocated very extensively, especially in that 
               <br />
               part of the province to which I myself 
               <br />
               belong. Since I had the honor of having a 
               <br />
               seat in this House, I have never advocated 
               <br />
               representation by population as the sole 
               <br />
               measure I would accept as a settlement of 
               <br />
               those diiiculties. In the ﬁrst speech I ever 
               <br />
               made in this House, I used the following 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meuse:—</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am not myself bound down to representation 
               <br />
               by population as the only possible measure. If 
               <br />
               the opponents of that measure can suggest any 
               <br />
               other remedy, I am quite willing to give it a can-
