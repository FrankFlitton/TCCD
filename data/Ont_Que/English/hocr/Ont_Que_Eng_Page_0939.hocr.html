               MR. DUFRESNE (Montcalm)—Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, in rising at this moment to express 
               <br />
               my humble opinion on the merits of the reso- 
               <br />
               lutions now under discussion by this House, 
               <br />
               I.do not intend to follow the formula or pre— 
               <br />
               amble hitherto invariably adopted, by saying 
               <br />
               that I approach the subject with fear and 
               <br />
               trembling. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear, and laughter.) But 
               <br />
               though I do not approach the question with 
               <br />
               anxiety and hesitation, it is not that I feel 
               <br />
               myself more competent than others for the 
               <br />
               treatment of it; it is simply for the good 
               <br />
               reason that I rely upon the indulgence of this 
               <br />
               House. We all know how diﬂicult it is for 
               <br />
               a person who isnot an habitual public speaker, 
               <br />
               or a member of the legal profession, to ex- 
               <br />
               press himself with facility before a distin- 
               <br />
               guished and highly educated body of men 
               <br />
               such as I now have the honor to address. I 
               <br />
               look upon the resolutions submitted to us as 
               <br />
               expressing the sentiments of the people, 
               <br />
               through their constitutional organ the L ' 
               <br />
               lature. We ask our Sovereign and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theeﬁl:</span> 
               <br />
               perial authorities to unite, by means of a 
               <br />
               Federal union, all these Provinces of British 
               <br />
               North America. In examining this question, 
               <br />
               and in order to express more clearly and fully 
               <br />
               my 0 inion of these resolutions, I may say 
               <br />
               that accept them for many reasons, but 
               <br />
               chieﬂy as a means of obtaining the repeal of 
               <br />
               the present legislative union of Canada, and 
               <br />
               securing a peaceable settlement of our sec- 
               <br />
               tional diﬁculties. I accept them, in the 
               <br />
               second lace, as a means of obtaining for 
               <br />
               Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> the absolute and exclusive 
               <br />
               control of her own aﬁ'airs. I accept them, 
               <br />
               thirdly, as a means of pe tuating French- 
               <br />
               Canadian nationality in this country. I ac- 
               <br />
               cept them, fourthly, as a more effectual means 
               <br />
               of cementing our connection with the Mother 
               <br />
               Country, and avoiding annexation to the 
               <br />
               United States. I accept them, ﬁfthly and 
               <br />
               lastly, as a means of administering the affairs 
               <br />
               of the country with greater economy. Such 
               <br />
               are my reasons for accepting the Confederation 
               <br />
               scheme submitted to us by the Government. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I shall not undertake to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss the merits of all the resolutions, for the 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen who have already spoken 
               <br />
               have ably and fully developed the merits of 
               <br />
               the whole question; and, besides, if I may 
               <br />
               dare say it without being thought ridiculous, 
               <br />
               I have undergone a heavy loss—I have, in

               resignation under my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> heavy 'on. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intended.</span> to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> some-

               and as the honorable member for Vaudreuil 
               <br />
               has treated the subject so powerfully, I shall

               refrain from entering into the matter. And 
               <br />
               here again the House will be the gainer.

               itself has already been fully treated with far

               statements made by honorable members of the

               Liberals coming forward in this House as the

               <br />
               (Hear, hear, and laughter.) The honorable 
               <br />
               member for Richelieu gave us in pompous 
               <br />
               terms a sketch of the beneﬁts derived from 
               <br />
               the union of the Canadas. I must say that I 
               <br />
               listened to him with no little astonishment, 
               <br />
               for it was the ﬁrst time I ever heard a demo- 
               <br />
               crat—a demagogue—lauding the union and 
               <br />
               the public men whom the country has, since 
               <br />
               the union, placed at the head of aﬂ'airs. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) He told us that we had had 
               <br />
               statesmen who succeeded in securing a triumph 
               <br />
               for the rights of Lower Canada—men who 
               <br />
               protected our interests and caused us to ad- 
               <br />
               vance in the path of progress. “ We see 
               <br />
