               upon the powers of the General Government

               the changes would be rung night after night

               <br />
               fall into the trap they have laid, and I know 
               <br />
               honorable members are fully aware of the

               designs of these honorable gentlemen. They 
               <br />
               cannot complain that they have not had an 
               <br />
               Opportunity of moving amendments. They 
               <br />
               have had three weeks to do it, and they have 
               <br />
               not yet moved one or given notice of one. 
               <br />
               Then, sir, what will be the consequences, on 
               <br />
               the other hand, if the previous question is not 
               <br />

               question is not put, Confederation is defeated.
