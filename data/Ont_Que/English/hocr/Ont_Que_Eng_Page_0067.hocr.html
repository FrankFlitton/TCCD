               of their extent until I stood on the shore of Lake

               man alone had been mistaken, but even the

               Hon.Mr. TILLEY, one of the most distinguished 
               <br />
               statesmen of New Brunswick, had made the

               not on that side, for they need but turn to a 
               <br />
               celebrated speech of one of our own leading 
               <br />
               men—a speech regarded almost as an im rtant 
               <br />
               state paper—and there it was stated t at the 
               <br />
               United Provinces would become the third 
               <br />
               maritime power in the world. (Hear, Hear.) 
               <br />
               England, it said, was ﬁrst, then the United 
               <br />
               States, and the speaker doubted if France 
               <br />
               could take the third rank before us. Our 
               <br />
               sea-going tonnage would be ﬁve millions, and 
               <br />
               our lake tenu e seven millions. These were 
               <br />
               vast ﬁgures, an it almost bewildered the mind 
               <br />
               to conceive their magniﬁcent proportions. 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) Now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supposincr</span> all these vessels 
               <br />
               were 500 tons each, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> require 14,000 
               <br />
               to make up the sum, but unfortunately the 
               <br />
               census showed that we had but 808 sailors to 
               <br />
               navigate them—rather a small number it must 
               <br />
               be admitted for 14,000 ships. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> (Great laugh- 
               <br />
               ter.) The way the mistake—to use the mildest 
               <br />
               expression—was made, was simple enough. 
               <br />
               The vessels were entered at the Custom 
               <br />
               Houses every time they came in and left port, 
               <br />
               and as some of them came into ort 200 times 
               <br />
               in the year, as at Toronto for instance, their 
               <br />
               tonnage was counted 200 times. It was 
               <br />
               in this way to run up our inland marine to 
               <br />
               seven millions of tons. But then if the pro- 
               <br />
               ducts of Canada were as great as Mr. LYNCH 
               <br />
