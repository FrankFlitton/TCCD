               that a friend, an honorable member of this

               House, intimated to me yesterday that this 
               <br />
               course was likely to be pursued by the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in order to crowd this measure 
               <br />
               through the House. I scouted the idea. I 
               <br />
               thought it was impossible that a government, 
               <br />
               numbering in its ranks public men who have 
               <br />
               played a prominent part in the parliamentary 
               <br />
               history of this country for some years, could 
               <br />
               resort to so base a trick—(cheers and coun-

               <br />
               measure in the manner they have done—after 
               <br />
               having introduced it in a most unparliament- 
               <br />
               ary and unconstitutional manner—and seeing 
               <br />
               that amendments would be made to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sevefal</span> 
               <br />
               of the propositions contained in the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions adopted by the Conference which assem- 
               <br />
               bled in Quebec, they shut off all opportunity 
               <br />
               to amend the measure by moving the previous 
               <br />
               question. (Hear, hear.) Why was it not 
               <br />
               stated by the Honorable Attorney General 
               <br />
               West himself that we would be able to get 
               <br />
               at the sense of the House upon every one of 
               <br />
               the propositions, by moving amendments? 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) In full conﬁdence that that 
               <br />
               pledge would be kept, when my honorable 
               <br />
               friend who sits near me told me he had reason 
               <br />
               to believe that this very course was in con- 
               <br />
               templation, I re at 1 scouted the idea. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) shall not oﬂ'er any further 
               <br />
               observations on this point at the present mo- 
               <br />
               ment, beyond remarking that if the object be 
               <br />
               to curtail debate, as the honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               says it is—if his real motive be in truth to ar- 
               <br />
               rive at an early vote upon this question—his 
               <br />
               own statement shows how utterly futile his 
               <br />
               motion is to accomplish that end. It was 
               <br />
               not at all necessary that the honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tleman should have told us that we may 
               <br />
               discuss the previous question. We are now, 
               <br />
               by a compact which I presume will not be

               <br />

               <br />
               tunity of putting on record their views, even 
               <br />
               in the inconvenient form of amendments, upon 
               <br />
               the various propositions which are proposed 
               <br />
               to be embodied in this Address to the Crown. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Sir, the honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               says that the information received by tele- 
               <br />
               graph in reference to the defences renders it 
               <br />
               necessary that an early decision should be 
               <br />
               come to in the matter of Federation. But 
               <br />
               what has been the course of the honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite, throughout this debate, 
               <br />
               when the subject of the defences has been re- 
               <br />
               ferred to ? When we have said—“ Putus in 
               <br />
               'on of the necessary information to 
               <br />
               consider the subject of the defences, which 
               <br />
               must be discussed in connection with the 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation,” what has been the 
               <br />
               reply ? Why, that there was no natural or 
               <br />
               necessary connection between the two sub 
               <br />
               jects. (Hear, hear.) Thus, when the honor- 
               <br />
               able gentlemen were asked to bring down the 
               <br />
               information in regard to the defences, they 
               <br />
               have maintained that there is no connection 
               <br />
               between the two questions; but when they 
               <br />
               have a purpose to serve by so doing, they re— 
               <br />
               verse their position and say, “ By all means 
               <br />
               rush this thing through with all possible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speed,</span> 
               <br />
               in order that the country may be placedin a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pû</span> 
               <br />
               sition of defence.” I think, sir, weare entitled 
               <br />
               at this stage of the debate, and under these 
               <br />
               circumstances, to demand that all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">infor-</span>

               mation in possession of the Government m 
               <br />
               regard to the defences, should be laid before 
               <br />
               the House. I believe there is no better re- 
               <br />
               cognized parliamentary rule than this, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>

               when a Minister of the Crown rises <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in]!!!</span>

               General West the question—and I pause for
