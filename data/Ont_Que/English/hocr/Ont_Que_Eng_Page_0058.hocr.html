               in the opinion, but I thought it would be 
               <br />

               <br />
               against this were, that, in the ﬁrst place, it

               would cause additional expense; in the next 
               <br />

               <br />
               men to be representatives. My reply was 
               <br />
               that the number is rapidly increasing as 
               <br />
               we increase in education and wealth; that 
               <br />
               a larger ﬁeld would be open to political am- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tatives; that by having numerous an small- 
               <br />
               er constituencies, more people would be in— 
               <br />

               <br />
               there would be a wider ﬁeld for selection for 
               <br />
               leaders of governments and leaders of parties. 
               <br />
               These are my individual sentiments,—whieh,

               <br />
               which no one will say is large or extensive, 
               <br />
               when it is considered that our present

               number in Canada alone is one hundred

               <br />
               left to the Parliament of the Confederation, 
               <br />

               apply to the whole Confederation. In consid- 
               <br />
               ering the question of the duration of Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, we came to the conclusion to recom- 
               <br />
               mend a period of ﬁve year s. I was in favor of 
               <br />
               a longer period. I thought that the duration 
               <br />
               of the local legislatures should not be short- 
               <br />
               ened so as to be less than four years, as at pre- 
               <br />
               sent, and that the General Parliament should 
               <br />
               have as long a duration as that of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom. I was willing to have gone to the 
               <br />
               extent of seven years; but a term of ﬁve years 
               <br />
               was preferred. and we had the example of the 
               <br />
               New Zealand carefully considered, not only 
               <br />
               locally, but by the Imperial Parliament and 
               <br />
               which gave the provinces of these islands 
               <br />
               a general parliament with a duration of ﬁve 
               <br />
               years. But it was a matter of little import- 
               <br />
               ance whether ﬁve years or seven years was 
               <br />
               the term, the power of dissolution by the 
               <br />
               Crown having been reserved. I ﬁnd, on look- 
               <br />
               ing at the duration of parliaments since the 
               <br />
               accession of George III. to the Throne, that 
               <br />
               excluding the present parliament, there have 
               <br />
               been seventeen parliaments, the average pe- 
               <br />
               riod of whose existence has been about 
               <br />
               three cars and a half. That average is less 
               <br />
               than t e average duration of the parliaments 
               <br />
               in Canada since the union, so that it was 
               <br />
               not a matter of much importance whether we 
               <br />
               ﬁxed upon ﬁve or seven years as the period 
               <br />
               of duration of our General Parliament. A 
               <br />
               good deal of misapprehension has arisen from 
               <br />
               the accidental omission of some words from 
               <br />
               the 24th resolution. It was thought that by 
               <br />
               it the local legislatures were to have the 
               <br />
               power of arranging hereafter, and from time 
               <br />
               to time of readjusting the different constitu- 
               <br />
               encies and settling the size and boundaries 
               <br />
               of the various electoral districts. The mean- 
               <br />
               ing of the resolution is simply this, that for 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst General Parliament, the arrange- 
               <br />
               ment of constituencies shall be made by the 
               <br />
               existing local legislatures; that in Canada, 
               <br />
               for instance, the present Canadian Parliament 
               <br />
               shall arrange what are to be the constituen- 
               <br />
               cies of Upper Canada, and to make such 
               <br />
               changes as may be necessary in arranging 
               <br />
