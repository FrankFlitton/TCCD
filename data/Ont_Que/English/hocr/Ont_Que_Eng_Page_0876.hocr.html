               great arguments advanced in support of 
               <br />
               the proposed scheme is that the electoral 
               <br />
               divisions are very extensive, and that 
               <br />
               the rich alone, by means of their wealth, 
               <br />
               can attain a seat in that House. It costs 
               <br />
               so much now-a-days, it is said, to carry 
               <br />
               an election! If that argument were of any

               value as regards the Legislative Council, it 
               <br />
               should have equal weight as regards the

               It is nothing else than a plot! (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I am opposed to this scheme of Confederation, 
               <br />
               because we are offered local parliaments which

               <br />
               it will soon be ound, as it is in fact destined 
               <br />
               to become, a mere taxing machine. Nothing

               <br />

               <br />
               ment and Parliament, will exceed $2,000,000. 
               <br />
               The revenue will fall far short of that amount. 
               <br />
               Direct taxation would be a necessary conse-

               quence of the establishment of the new sys- 
               <br />
               tem, without any compensation for the fresh 
               <br />
               burthen which the people must hear. I have 
               <br />
               said enough to shew the difference between 
               <br />
               the American federal system and that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> 
               <br />
               for our adoption. In the American union 
               <br />
               each state is sovereign over all that immediate- 
               <br />
               ly concerns it. Here, everything would be 
               <br />
               submitted to the General Parliament. Lower 
               <br />
               Canada is opposed to free trade in money, 
               <br />
               and desires to limit the rate of interest; and 
               <br />
               yet this she could not do, inasmuch as that 
               <br />
               very ordinary question would be under 
               <br />
               the control of the General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parlianﬁnt.</span> 
               <br />
               Whether the principle be a sound one or not, 
               <br />
               it is admitted that nine-tenths of our people 
               <br />
               desire that the rate of interest should be ﬁxed. 
               <br />
               Each state of the American union regulates 
               <br />
               questions of this kind as it chooses, without 
               <br />
               the intervention of neighboring states, or of 
               <br />
               the Washington Government. Thus, the rate 
               <br />
               of interest varies in a great many of the 
               <br />
               states, and in others it is not ﬁxed. In 
               <br />
               Vermont the rate is six r cent.; in New 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,York,</span> seven r cent.; in hic, ten per cent.; 
               <br />
               in Illinois, thirty per cent.; and in the other 
               <br />
               states, trade in money is free. These are facts 
               <br />
               which prove that the real Federal system 
               <br />
               resembles in no sense that which we are asked 
               <br />
               to adopt. (Hear, hear.) I might give a 
               <br />
               host of facts of this kind in support of my 
               <br />
               'tion; but I shall conﬁne in self to one.
