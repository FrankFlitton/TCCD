               word for it, you will like them. I have been 
               <br />
               on seven or eight journeys there, and have 
               <br />
               seen much of the people, and the more I have

               seen of them, the more I res ected and 
               <br />
               esteemed them. (Hear, hear.) say, then, 
               <br />
               to these gentlemen, that if you want to feel 
               <br />
               any patriotism on the subject ; if you want to

               <br />
               tween these people and ourselves, bring us

               a common nationality will grow up of itself 
               <br />
               without being forced by any man’s special

               very pretty fellow at a parish vestry, but do 
               <br />
               you call such a forked-radish as that, a man ?

               <br />
               lathe language. (Hear, hear.) Sir, there is 
               <br />
               one other argument for this union, or rather 
               <br />
               an illustration of its mutually advantageous 
               <br />
               character, which I draw from the physical 
               <br />
               geography and physical resources of the whole 
               <br />
               territory which it is proposed to unite ; but 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> I draw the attention of the House to 
               <br />
               It, I may perhaps refer to a charge that pro- 
               <br />
               bably will be made against me, that I am 
               <br />
               making what may appear to be a non—politi- 
               <br />
               cal speech. If it be non-political in the 
               <br />
               sense of non-partisan, then I plead guilty to 
               <br />
               the charge ; but I think that on some of the

               (Hear, hear.) It was remarked by the late Sir

               tish Government had attempted to maintain

               States, it would have been impossible to do 
               <br />
               so. These boundaries extend to Ohio on the

               We sometimes complain of our inland nan- 
               <br />
               gation, that we have it free but half the year 
               <br />
               round, but what it lacks at one season, it 
               <br />
               amply compensates by its vast capacity. 
               <br />
               (Cheers.) Last summer, when we visited

               <br />
               our river system to the open sea, I could not 
               <br />
               help often recurring to the vast extent of the
