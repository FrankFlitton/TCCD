               HON. MR. EVAN TUREL—As one of the 
               <br />
               friends of the present Administration, I must 
               <br />
               say that I am surprised by the conduct of the 
               <br />
               Government and the extreme position in which 
               <br />
               they choose to place themselves. For my part, 
               <br />
               I am in favour of the principle of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, and one of those who maintain that by 
               <br />
               means of that principle the rights and liber- 
               <br />
               ties of each of the contracting parties may be 
               <br />
               pmerved; but, on the other hand, I am of 
               <br />
               opinion, and I do not disguise it from myself, 
               <br />
               that it may be so applied as to endanger and 
               <br />
               even destroy, or nearly so, the rights and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privileges</span> of a state which is a party to this 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               oufederation. Everything, therefore, depends 
               <br />
               on the conditions of the contract. As a friend 
               <br />
               of the Administration I can understand, as 
               <br />
               well as any one, that any Confederation and 
               <br />
               particularly such a one as this which is now 
               <br />
               laid before us, can only be brought about by 
               <br />
               means of a compromise; and, on this account, 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St…—and</span> it is probably needless to 
               <br />
               proclaim it here—I am ready and disposed 
               <br />
               to go to as great a length as it is possible for 
               <br />
               any man to go. I am also one of those who, 
               <br />
               when we are called upon to unite, under the 
               <br />
               œgis of a strong government, the different 
               <br />
               provinces of British North America, and 
               <br />
               when I see that the general interest calls for 
               <br />
               such a union, will give my cordial support to 
               <br />
               all who seek to establish such a government. 
               <br />
               I shall always be prepared to meet them half- 
               <br />
               way; but when the question assumes a diﬁ‘er— 
               <br />
               ent shape, as it now does, and when, in con-

               <br />
               House yesterday, the Constitution proposed to 
               <br />
               us seems to concern none but the rovinces of 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada, I say, r. SPEAK- 
               <br />

               <br />
               longer called upon to be so generous. I say 
               <br />
               that if we admit that New Brunswick, by its 
               <br />
               recent repudiation, and Nova Scotia and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island are no longer parties to the 
               <br />
               contracts agreed on between the provinces, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> we have new to ask of England to 
               <br />
               modify the Constitution only in relation to 
               <br />
               the two Canadas, I say that the conditions 
               <br />
               are no longer the same as they concern us— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(hear,</span> hear -—and that I am on that account 
               <br />
               much less ' posed to allow the Government

               which we have been compelled to accept in 
               <br />
               very unfavorable circumstances. I do not 
               <br />
               hesitate in saying that the position assumed 
               <br />
               by the Government is a very dangerous one 
               <br />
               for themselves, and for those who would glad- 
               <br />
               I assist them to pass a good scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               ederation. If I understand aright, the in- 
               <br />
               tention of the Government, in moving the 
               <br />
               previous question, is to place their friends in 
               <br />
               the awkward position of not being able to 
               <br />
               move any modiﬁcation of the plan. In our 
               <br />
               altered position we are going, therefore, to 
               <br />
               say to England that we were obliged to sub- 
               <br />
               mit to such and such concessions in order to 
               <br />
               come to an understanding; that the other 
               <br />
               provinces have backed out of the bargain, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding these onerous concessions and 
               <br />
               the compromise which we were obliged to 
               <br />
               make, and which have not been accepted b

               the other parties; and that, in the face of 1 
               <br />
               this, we come to pray that our Constitution 
               <br />
               may be altered so as to accord with thoæ 
               <br />
               very same onerous conditions which we had 
               <br />
               accepted at the Quebec Conference. Why 
               <br />
               tie us down so strictly now ? Why should 
               <br />
               we not avail ourselves of the retrogression of 
               <br />
               the provinces to make alterations in the 
               <br />
               scheme which will be less onerous for us ? I 
               <br />
               think it my duty to declare that the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, in acting as they have done, place their 
               <br />
               friends in a very awkward position. For my 
               <br />
               part, Mr. SPEAKER, I am strongly in favor 
               <br />
               of Confederation, and am ready to support the 
               <br />
               Government in their eﬁ'orts to release the 
               <br />
               chariot of the state from the position in 
               <br />
               which it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now.</span> lies; but I wish, on the other 
               <br />
               hand—and I think it is but bare justice to say 
               <br />
               it——I wish that Ministers should place us in 
               <br />
               such aposition before the country, that I and 
               <br />
               all others may be able to say that we have 
               <br />
               done our best to improve the situation. This is 
               <br />
               why I so deeply regret that the Government 
               <br />
               have thought lit to take their present arbitrary 
               <br />
               attitude. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) I acknowledge, with 
               <br />
               the Administration, that time is precious; 
               <br />
               but we ought not, in avoiding one danger, to 
               <br />
               risk falling into another. I acknowledge 
               <br />
               also that the course of events which has 
               <br />
               taken place within a few days gives reason 
               <br />
               to apprehend that British rule in the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of British North America may cease 
               <br />
               altogether in a few years. I admit all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> 
               <br />
               dan ere, Mr. SPEAKER; but on the other 
               <br />
               han I do not eoneeal from myself that the 
               <br />
               extreme position in which we are placed does 
               <br />
               not tend to diminish them. On the contrary, I 
               <br />
               am greatly afraid that if public opinion be 
               <br />
               too deeply stirred by the imposition of a new
