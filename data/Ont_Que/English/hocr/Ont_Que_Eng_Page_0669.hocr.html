               badly ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               We have before us an instance of the danger 
               <br />
               of men undertaking to make treaties without 
               <br />
               authority. This is the kind of penalty 
               <br />
               which they pay, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> I think we have an

               <br />
               due to them, and which they will receive. 
               <br />
               Sir, we ﬁnd that in New Brunswick, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and Prince Edward Island, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union</span> 
               <br />
               took place between the Government and the 
               <br />
               Opposition for the purpose of arranging a 
               <br />
               plan by which those provinces should be 
               <br />
               joined together. They had the authority of 
               <br />
               their respective governments and legislatures 
               <br />
               before entering into that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference.</span> They 
               <br />
               met together by deliberate pre-arrangement, 
               <br />
               with full consent, unlike the manner in which 
               <br />
               the gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposite‘</span> precipitated them- 
               <br />
               selves into a union fever, growing out of a 
               <br />
               political contingency. When the delegates 
               <br />
               went to Charlottetown, from their respective 
               <br />
               provinces, to treat of matters of great impor- 
               <br />
               tance to the peOple of those provinces, and 
               <br />
               considered it to be a desirable obj ect to obtain 
               <br />
               the union of the Maritime Provinces, they 
               <br />
               were interrupted in their deliberations by the 
               <br />
               members of the Canadian Government.— 
               <br />
               Greater inducements were then oﬁ'ered them, 
               <br />
               and they were ﬁlled with higher hopes and 
               <br />
               expectations of the good things to be derived 
               <br />
               from the Confederation ol all the provinces. 
               <br />
               Lieutenant-governorships, chief-j nsticeships, 
               <br />
               and lite-memberships of the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council were all held out in the prospective 
               <br />
               by the Canadian Ministers. By these means 
               <br />
               they inveigled these men from the object for 
               <br />
               which they met, and undermined the purpose 
               <br />
               they were assembled to promote. The Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Ministers said :—-“Never mind your 
               <br />
               union of these provinces. Come away from 
               <br />
               Charlottetown with us, and we will show you 
               <br />
               plans by which your ambition may be bett .r 
               <br />
               gratiﬁed, although you may thereby betray 
               <br />
               the trust of the people who sent you here. 
               <br />
               They <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> not be satisﬁed, but never mind 
               <br />
               them—they can be managed in some way 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atterwards.</span> We will show you the way.” 
               <br />
               This, in eﬁect, was the language used towards 
               <br />
               the delegates. They took the bait <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> 
               <br />
               them, and the next thing we heard of 
               <br />
               was the adjournment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Convention 
               <br />
               to Halifax, where the delegates enjoyed the 
               <br />
               “ feastof reason and the ﬂow of soul” for a

               <br />
               where convivialities were renewed, and ﬁnally 
               <br />
               they all agreed to come to Quebec, and we 
               <br />
               all recollect the subsequent feastings in 
               <br />
               Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto and 
               <br />
               Hamilton. I will not allude to the meeting 
               <br />
               that took place here, because it is well known 
               <br />
               what the result of the Conference was; but I 
               <br />
               will speak of the sequel to these proceedings 
               <br />
               —the events that subsequently happened in 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces. Hon. Mr. TILLEY knew 
               <br />
               he could have submitted the scheme of the 
               <br />
               Quebec Conference to the people of New 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick-:that</span> he could have summoned 
               <br />
               the Parliament of that province and ascer- 
               <br />
               tained what its wishes were—as early as the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government could. But he did 
               <br />
               nothing of the kind. He knew he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vicr</span> 
               <br />
               lated the trust reposed in him, and that he 
               <br />
               had given reason for a withdrawal of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple’s conﬁdence; but he thought that by 
               <br />
               bringing on an election in the country, he 
               <br />
               could gain his own ends by the unsparing use 
               <br />
               of all the inﬂuence a government can employ 
               <br />
               on such occasions, and by employing all the 
               <br />
               arts of cajolery for the purpose of deceiving 
               <br />
               the peeplr and winning them over to his own 
               <br />
               selﬁsh purposes. Well, what is the result ? 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honer.</span> TILLEY and his followers are routed 
               <br />
               horse and foot by the honest people of the 
               <br />
               province, scouted by those whose interests 
               <br />
               he had betrayed and whose behests he had 
               <br />
               neglected; and I think his fate ought to be a 
               <br />
               warning to those who adopted this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> 
               <br />
               without authority, and who ask the House to 
               <br />
               ratify it en bloc, without having sought or 
               <br />
               seeking to obtain the sanction of the people. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) I come now, sir, to a matter 
               <br />
               personal perhaps more to myself than to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               one else. I would ask the House who was it

               that assailed the Government of Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ence to the construction of the Inter-colonial 
               <br />
               Railway; and whose statement was it that 
               <br />
               was reëchoed on the ﬂoor of this House over 
               <br />
               and over again, that Canada had lowered its 
               <br />
               character and dignity by failing to go on wit I 
               <br />
