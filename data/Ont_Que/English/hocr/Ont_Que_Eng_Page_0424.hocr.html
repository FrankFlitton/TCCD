               the fundamental conditions and principles of 
               <br />
               the union. I think there has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through.</span> 
               <br />
               out a most wise and statesmanlike distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of powers, and at the same time that 
               <br />
               those things have been carefully guarded 
               <br />
               which the minorities in the various sections 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reguired</span> for their protection, and the regu-

               <br />
               unnaturally desirous of retaining for itself. 
               <br />
               So far then as the objection is concerned 
               <br />
               of this union being federative merely 
               <br />
               in its character, and liable to all the diﬁ-

               culties which usually surround federal 
               <br />
               governments, I think we may fairly consider 
               <br />
               that there has been a prOper and satisfactory 
               <br />
               distribution of power, which will avert many 
               <br />
               of .those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculties.</span> (Hear, hear.) But, 
               <br />
               sir. there is another objection made to it, 
               <br />
               and one upon which, from my stand-point, 
               <br />
               Idesire to make some observations, and that 
               <br />
               is with reference to the manner in which the 
               <br />
               rights of the various minorities in the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces have been protected. This is unques- 
               <br />
               tionably a grave and serious subject of con- 
               <br />
               sideration, and especially so to the minority 
               <br />
