               was: Was Confederation of the British North 
               <br />
               American Provinces necessary in order to in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was necessary for those objects. It would be 
               <br />
               observed that the English speaking opponents 
               <br />
               of the scheme, in Lower Canada, pretended 
               <br />
               a fear of this element being absorbed by the 
               <br />
               French Canadian; while the opponents, com-

               <br />
               be called the old Papineau Tail—whose sole 
               <br />
               idcawas annexation to the United States——said 
               <br />
               they were afraid of the extinction of French 
               <br />

               <br />
               to be sincere in their opposition to the scheme— 
               <br />
               except in so far as they desired to carry 
               <br />
               Canada into the American Union. The

               absorption of this province into the United

               draft of the American Constitution, which he 
               <br />
               would read. It was as follows: “ Art. 7. 
               <br />
               Canada, according to this Confederation and 
               <br />
               joining in the measures of the United States, 
               <br />
               shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the 
               <br />
               advantages of this union; and shall be equally 
               <br />
               with any other of the United States, solemnly 
               <br />
               bound to a strict observance of, and obedience 
               <br />
               to, these articles; as shall be also any other 
               <br />
               colony which shall be admitted into this Con- 
               <br />
               federacy. The eleven votes in Congress shall 
               <br />
               be increased in proportion as the Confederacy 
               <br />
               is extended. But, except Canada, no other 
               <br />
               colony shall be admitted into the Confederacy

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               at the Institut Canadien of Montreal, where 
               <br />
               it was resolved that it was for the interests of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada—in the interests of the French

               HON. Mn. DORION said that was not the

               forth that the interests of Lower Canada

               would be better secured by annexation to the

               they were aware that as soon as this project

               to the proceedings of the delegates having
