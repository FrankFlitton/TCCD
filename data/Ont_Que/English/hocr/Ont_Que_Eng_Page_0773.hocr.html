               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sehen</span> e is nothing more or less than a scheme

               to construct the Intercolonial Railway. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) If it was not necessary for

               some parties that that road should be 
               <br />

               money necessary for our own local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purposes,</span>
