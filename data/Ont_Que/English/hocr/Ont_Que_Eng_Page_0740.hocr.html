               (Hear, hear.) It is well known that our ﬁnan-

               the real condition of our aﬂ'airs may be fully

               exhibited to the people, the gentlemen on 
               <br />
               the Treasury benches have suddenl come to

               portant information, but, forsooth, we are 
               <br />
               asked to pass a vote of credit to be accounted 
               <br />
               for at the next session. A prorogation is 
               <br />

               in a state of uncertainty as to its future, un-

               til it shall please these gentlemen to return 
               <br />
               from their mission. When we consider the 
               <br />
               effect which the blandishments of the Trea- 
               <br />
               sury benches but too frequently produce 
               <br />
               upon members sent to this House to carry 
               <br />
               out certain avowed principles and measures; 
               <br />
               when we see the class to which I allude vio— 
               <br />
               lating the promises made to their consti-

               tuents and going over “body and bones” to

               a Government they were elected specially to 
               <br />
               oppose, we need not be astonished shortly to 
               <br />
               learn that inﬂuences and blandishments in 
               <br />
               higher uarters will have the like effect on 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gengemen</span> opposite when abroad, who will 
               <br />
               ever be ready to ﬁnd a plausible excuse for 
               <br />
               any gross betrayal of the trusts reposed in 
               <br />
               them by liant and subservient followers. 
               <br />
               The avowed object for the immediate proro- 
               <br />
               gation of the session is the imminent danger 
               <br />
               which threatens this province, and yet we 
               <br />
               are kept in the dark as to the real cause for 
               <br />
               alarm. We are told, however, that a large 
               <br />
               outlay, but the amount is not stated, is to be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«leveled</span> to fortifying certain portions of

               Canada by the Home Government; and that 
               <br />
               we are to be asked to contribute an unknown 
               <br />
               sum of money towards the same object. But 
               <br />
               when we ask for more deﬁnite information, 
               <br />
               we are met by the assurance that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span>

               rance of the position in which we are to be

               people of this country should be to vote what 
               <br />

               <br />
               in this country, I believe, who is unwilling 
               <br />
               to give his quota of taxes for the work of- 
               <br />
               defence; but there must be a limit to every-

               nistration, is as sound now as it was then; 
               <br />
               and if the force of the American army two
