               The larg er scheme, Mr. SPEAKER, is 
               <br />
               evidently a failure. (Hear, hear.) And I 
               <br />
               will tell you why I think it a failure. This 
               <br />
               scheme was to be agreed to by all the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, and the different Governments were 
               <br />
               to bring it down for the consideration of 
               <br />
               their several Houses of Parliament. The 
               <br />
               leaders of the Op osition in New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, as well as t e Government of that 
               <br />
               province agreed to a treaty, as it is called, 
               <br />
               and went back to submit that treaty to their 
               <br />
               Legislature for approval. But being defeated 
               <br />
               in New Brunswick, it is not possible for the 
               <br />
               arrangement to be carried out. What reason 
               <br />
               has the Government for believing that those 
               <br />
               who have been just elected in New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick as opponents of the scheme will allow 
               <br />
               it to be brou ht down for the consideration 
               <br />
               of their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legisïature?</span> How can it be expected 
               <br />
               that a free peOple will agree to a scheme, 
               <br />
               from the terms of which they entirely dis- 
               <br />
               sent? It seems to be the idea of honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite, that if this Legislature 
               <br />
               adheres to the scheme, it will be forced upon 
               <br />
               the unwilling people of New Brunswick—- 
               <br />
               that some process will be found by which 
               <br />
               the Government of that province will be 
               <br />
               induced to submit it to their Legislature. 
               <br />
               They seem to imagine that the rejection of 
               <br />
               the TILLEY Government, and, consequently, 
               <br />
               of their Confederation scheme, by the peo- 
               <br />
               ple, is a matter that can be traced only to 
               <br />
               the annexation proclivities of a large section 
               <br />
               of the people of New Brunswick. If that is 
               <br />
               so, we ought immediately to appoint a day 
               <br />
               of general thanksgiving, in this appro riate 
               <br />
               time of Lent, for the blessing of eing 
               <br />
               relieved from any danger of union with such 
               <br />
               apeople. (Hear, hear, and laughter.) It 
               <br />
               would be one of the greatest misfortunes 
               <br />
               that could happen our province to be con- 
               <br />
               nected with those annexationists.

               said there were many in that portion of the 
               <br />
               province who were inﬂuenced by a desire for 
               <br />
               connection with the United States, and that 
               <br />
               there were capitalists from Boston and from 
               <br />
               Maine whose interests lay in having New 
               <br />
               Brunswick more closely coupled with the 
               <br />
               destiny of the United States. If these are

               the feelings that induced the gentlemen who

               <br />
               they are a people with whose views we of 
               <br />
               Canada should have no sympathy. If the 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the Treasury benches suppose 
               <br />
               that b passing these resolutions they will

               condition that they shall oppose the treaty 
               <br />
               or Convention scheme, to turn round and 
               <br />
               support it. then what' shall we say of such 
               <br />
               men? What shall we say of men who, 
               <br />
               after having obtained the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffrages</span> of the 
               <br />
               people as Opponents of the scheme, shall turn 
               <br />
               round immediately after they have got into 
               <br />
               oﬂice, and in effect perjure themselves? 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) We have, unfOrtuuately, 
               <br />
               enough of that class of legislators in Canada, 
               <br />
               without linkin our destinies with like 
               <br />
               persons from ew Brunswick. If that is 
               <br />
               the character of the people to whom we are 
               <br />
               to be united, then all I can say is, that they 
               <br />
               are not a desirable class to have added to 
               <br />
               Canada. If it is contemplated that they are 
               <br />
               going to compel those gentlemen to vote 
               <br />
               approval of the scheme, who have been 
               <br />
               elected specially to Oppose it, it would be 
               <br />
               very interesting to know by what process it 
               <br />
               is to be done. Are they to be bribed into 
               <br />
               acquiescence, or forced into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submission?</span> If 
               <br />
               the latter, then we must presume that they 
               <br />
               are not of the race of British freemen who, 
               <br />
               elsewhere, would resent with indignation—— 
               <br />
               ay, rebel—belore yielding up their indepen- 
               <br />
               dence; and in that view, they are again 
               <br />
               unworthy of association with us. There is 
               <br />
               no doubt that the gentlemen who have been 
               <br />
               elected in New Brunswick have deliberately 
               <br />
               considered their position, and whether it is 
               <br />
               attempted to bribe them or coerce them, they 
               <br />
               will manfully resent it. I do not believe it 
               <br />
               is desirable to have a Confederation 
               <br />
               adopted by either course. What are we to 
               <br />
               gain by compelling such a community to 
               <br />
               come in with us? Will they not, for all 
               <br />
               time to come, cast upon us the reﬂection 
               <br />
               that they became part and parcel of the 
               <br />
               Confederacy without their consent? Is it 
               <br />
               desirable w have to do with neighboring 
               <br />
