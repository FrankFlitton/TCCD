               HON. Ms. SEYMOUR said :—Honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, I desire to make one or two re- 
               <br />
               marks in reply to something which fell from 
               <br />
               my honorable friend the Commissioner of 
               <br />
               Crown Lands, in reference to the objections 
               <br />
               I took on a former occasion to the details of 
               <br />
               this scheme. That honorable gentleman, 
               <br />
               after ex laining one or two minor points,dis- 
               <br />
               posed o the others by saying that I opposed 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everything.</span> As that statement might imply, 
               <br />
               if honorable members of this House were not 
               <br />
               acquainted with me, that my course had been 
               <br />
               factions, I desire to state what I have op- 
               <br />
               posed. Having been always a strong advo- 
               <br />
               cate of retrenchment and ﬁnancial reform, I 
               <br />
               have opposed the exorbitant expenses of the 
               <br />
               Government. I have op the extrava- 
               <br />
               gance which has madet e expenses of the 
               <br />
               civil government of Canada exceed those of 
               <br />
               any other country on the lace of the globe, 
               <br />
               in proportion to the revenue. I have always 
               <br />
               opposed the expenditure of money without 
               <br />
               the authority of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I have always opposed the extravagant nts 
               <br />
               and subsidies to the Grand Trunk Railway 
               <br />
               Company. (Hear, hear.) My honorable 
               <br />
               friend opposite (Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Faults)</span> has 
               <br />
               spoken of the beneﬁt of the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               Railway, and of the great expenditure of 
               <br />
               English capitalists in the work. lt is true 
               <br />
               the work was undertaken by them, but 
               <br />
               Canada has borne her full share—has fulﬁl- 
               <br />
               led every agreement. And more than that, 
               <br />
               Canada has paid at the rate of thirty thousand 
               <br />
               dollars pcr mile for her railways; Canada 
               <br />
               has- contributed $15,142,000 in principal, 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5,400,000</span> in interest, without taking 
               <br />
               into consideration a large number of smaller 
               <br />
               matters. If a calculation be made from 
               <br />
               these amounts, it will be found as I have 
               <br />
               stated, that Canada has paid at the rate of 
               <br />
               $30,000 for all the railway which was re- 
               <br />
               quired, namely, from Quebec to Toronto, 
               <br />
               which would have connected with the Great 
               <br />
               Western, and formed a Trunk line through 
               <br />
               the province to Sarnia. If large sums have 
               <br />
               been expended; if lar e sums have been 
               <br />
               squandered, have not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%‘Juglish</span> contractors 
               <br />
               beneﬁted ? Are the people of Canada to be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blamed}</span> The scheme was planned by Eng- 
               <br />
               lish capitalists, and Canada fulﬁlled every 
               <br />
               obligation. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been;l</span> Now, there is 
               <br />
               another matter which I ave opposed. I 
               <br />
               have always opposed the loose system of 
               <br />
               management of the Crown lands, a system 
               <br />
               by which our splendid domain has been frit- 
               <br />
               tered away. I do not mean my remarks en 
               <br />

               the present, Commissioner of Crown Lands. 
               <br />
               He has only been in ofﬁce a few months, and 
               <br />
               I have not read his report. But I refer to 
               <br />
               the past, and I say that the whole of that 
               <br />
               domain has been squandered away in useless 
               <br />
               expenses. There is another matter which I 
               <br />
               have opposed—the Militia Bill of 1862. I 
               <br />
               admit that I Opposed that measure. That 
               <br />
               was a measure which was going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to”</span> entail 
               <br />
               upon the country an enormous expenditure, 
               <br />
               which would have exhausted our resources 
               <br />
               at a time when that expenditure was not 
               <br />
               required. Why, honorable gentlemen, was 
               <br />
               not the Trent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁculty</span> settled at the time ? 
               <br />
               Had not the American Government complied 
               <br />
               with the demands of Great Britain, and what 
               <br />
               threatened us to authorize that expenditure? 
               <br />
               There is one expenditure which I opposed, 
               <br />
               which might perhaps be questioned. I op— 
               <br />
               posed the Supply Bill in 1858, and I had 
               <br />
               then voting with me my honorable friend 
               <br />
               the Commissioner of Crown Lands. (Hear, 
               <br />
               and laughter.) Whether that vote can be 
               <br />
               defended from a constitutional point of view, I 
               <br />
               cannot say ; but every vote 1 have given in 
               <br />
               this House, or the other branch of the Legis- 
               <br />
               lature, has been given in accordance with 
               <br />
               what I conceived to be the interests of my 
               <br />
               native country. (Hear.) M y honorable 
               <br />
               friend the Commissioner of Crown Lands, 
               <br />
               alluded the other day to the conservative 
               <br />
               feature of the Senate in the United States, 
               <br />
               in allowing the same representation to small 
               <br />
               states as to the larger states. But this does 
               <br />
               not at all aﬁ'ect the general arrangement, 
               <br />
               because the large majority are large states. 
               <br />
               But while my honorable friend approves of 
               <br />
               this portion, he should have expressed an 
               <br />
               opinion en the whole system. In the United 
               <br />
               States, no change of Constitution can be ef- 
               <br />
               fected without the consent of two-thirds of 
               <br />
               both branches of the Legislature, and that 
               <br />
               must afterwards be sanctioned by three- 
               <br />
               feurths of the state governments. This is 
               <br />
               a conservative feature also. Then, what are 
               <br />
               the constitutions of the state governments ? 
               <br />
               I have here a clause taken from the Consti- 
               <br />
               tution of one of the states (Connecticut), 
               <br />
               which provides that :—
