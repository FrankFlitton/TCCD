               Hos. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Amr.</span> Gert. MACDONALD said-— 
               <br />
               Before the debate is resumed, I wish to say a 
               <br />
               few words. I would call the attention of the 
               <br />
               House to the telegram received to-day—which 
               <br />
               is rather confused in its terms—with reference 
               <br />
               to a debate in the House of Lords on the 
               <br />
               subject of the defences of Canada. According 
               <br />
               to this tel m, “Earl DE GREY,Secretaryof 
               <br />
               State for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">m,</span> admitted the importance of the 
               <br />
               question, but regretted that any doubt should 
               <br />
               be expressed of the conciliatory intentions of 
               <br />
               the Americans. The Government would ask 
               <br />
               a vote of £50,000 for the Quebec defences, 
               <br />
               while the Canadians would undertake the de- 
               <br />
               fences of Montreal and westward.” The 
               <br />
               amount, according to another statement, is 
               <br />
               £30,000. The ﬁgures are apparently a mis- 
               <br />
               take for £300,000. My object in rising was 
               <br />
               to state that so far as we could gather from 
               <br />
               this confused summary of the debate, the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government were about to ask a 
               <br />
               aeertain amount for the defences of Quebec, 
               <br />
               while the Canadians would undertake the 
               <br />
               defence of Montreal and the country west- 
               <br />
               ward. I may state it is quite true that 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government made a proposition 
               <br />
               some time ago to the effect that they were 
               <br />
               willing and prepared to recommend to Par- 
               <br />
               liament a vote for the defence of Quebec, as is 
               <br />
               here stated, provided this province undertook 
               <br />
               the defence of Montreal and points westward. 
               <br />
               Negotiations have been going on on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques</span> 
               <br />
               tion between the Imperial Government and 
               <br />
               the Canadian Government ever since, and I 
               <br />
               think that there is every reason to believe 
               <br />
               that these negotiations will result most favor- 
               <br />
               ably, and that arrangements will be made in a 
               <br />
               manner such as to secure the defence of 
               <br />
               Canada, both east and west—in a manner 
               <br />
               such as to ensure the fullest protection to the 
               <br />
               country, and as at the same time will not press 
               <br />
               unduly on the energies of the people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear)</span> 
               <br />
               Sir, these negotiations are still proceeding 
               <br />
               —-they have not yet concluded—and it must 
               <br />
               be obvious to every honorable member who 
               <br />
               has read this short synopsis of the debate in 
               <br />
               the Imperial Parliament, that it is of the 
               <br />
               greatest possible importance that Canada 
               <br />
               should not be unrepresented in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> at 
               <br />
               the present time. (Cheers) It must be 
               <br />
               evident to all that some of the leading mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Administration should be in 
               <br />
               England at this juncture, for the purpose of 
               <br />
               attending to Canadian interests, and of con- 
               <br />
               eluding these negotiations without any loss of 
               <br />
               time whatever. (Hear, hear.) It is desirable, 
               <br />
               as I stated yesterday, that the two uestions 
               <br />
               of Federation and Defence should be iscussed 
               <br />

               at the same moment, and that the opportunity 
               <br />
               should be taken of exactly ascertaining 
               <br />
               the position of British North America with 
               <br />
               respect to her degree of reliance on the Im-

               perial Government in a political sense, as well 
               <br />
               as with regard to the question of defence. 
               <br />
               Therefore, there should not be any loss of 
               <br />
               time whatever, and with that view the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment would ask this House—as the dis.-us- 
               <br />
               sion has already <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gone</span> on to a considerable 
               <br />
               length, and a great many honorable gentlemen 
               <br />
               have spoken on the subject—that it will offer 
               <br />
               no undue delay in coming to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusion</span> in 
               <br />
               this matter. Of course the Government would 
               <br />
               not attempt to shut down the ﬂoodgates against 
               <br />
               all discussion; but they would merely ask 
               <br />
               and invite the House m consider the import- 
               <br />
               ance of as early a vote as the house can pro- 
               <br />
               perly allow to be taken upon this question. 
               <br />
               It is for the House to determine whether the 
               <br />
               Federation scheme which has been pro (1 
               <br />
               by the Government and laid before the ones 
               <br />
               is one which, with all its faults, should be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adopted,</span> or whether we shall be thrown upon 
               <br />
               an uncertain future. In order that the House 
               <br />
               may at once come to an understanding in the 
               <br />
               matter, I shall, as I stated yesterday, take 
               <br />
               every possible step known to parliamentary 
               <br />
               usage to get avote as soon as it can con- 
               <br />

               to hear, and will still have an opportunit of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hearing,</span> from the honorable member from 
               <br />
               Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. BOLTON), who cries

               “ Hear, hear,” an expression cf opinion 
               <br />
               whether this scheme is so objectionable that 
               <br />
               the House would be wise in rejecting it, with 
               <br />
               nothing now offered as a substitute, and no 
               <br />
               future to look to. It will afford us all great 
               <br />
               pleasure to hear the honorable gentleman say 
               <br />
               whether we should adept this scheme. There 
               <br />
               is an independent motion on the paper of m 
               <br />
               honorable friend from Peel (Hon. J. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hy.</span> 
               <br />
               CAMERON). My motion does not interfere 
               <br />
               with that. But if the House should consider 
               <br />
               that this scheme ought to be adopted, my 
               <br />
               honorable friend will then have an opportunity 
               <br />

               THE SPEAKER—If honorable gentlemen

               desire it, I will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lead</span> the rule of the House as

               to the previous question. The 35th rule of
