               we could become a great nation ? It had 
               <br />
               never yet been the good fortune of any group 
               <br />
               of communities to secure national greatness 
               <br />
               with such facility. In past ages, warriors had 
               <br />
               struggled for years for the addition to their 
               <br />
               country of a single province. We had too, 
               <br />
               for instance, in our own days, the case of 
               <br />
               NAPOLEON III, who, after great expenditure 
               <br />
               of blood and treasure in the Italian diﬁiculty, 
               <br />
               had acquired Savoy and Nice, by ,which he 
               <br />
               had obtained an addition of nearly one mil- 
               <br />
               lion inhabitants to France—only one million 
               <br />
               souls, and if any person were for a moment 
               <br />
               to make a calculation of the value of the 
               <br />
               provinces acquired on one side, and the great 
               <br />
               cost on the other, he would at once see the 
               <br />
               great disproportion between the one and the 
               <br />
               other, and so ascertain the fact that the ter- 
               <br />
               ritory ac uired did not compensate the outlay. 
               <br />
               Here, in ritish North America, we had ﬁve 
               <br />
               diﬂ'erent communities inhabiting ﬁve separate 
               <br />
               colonies. We had the same sympathies, and 
               <br />
               we all desired to live under the British Crown. 
               <br />
               We had our commercial interests besides. It 
               <br />
               was of no use whatever that New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia and Newfoundland should have 
               <br />
               their several custom houses against our trade,

               the trade of those provinces. In ancient times, 
               <br />
               the manner in which a nation grew up was 
               <br />
               diﬁ'erent from that of the present day. Then 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst weak settlement increased into a vil- 
               <br />
               lage, which, by turns, became a town and a 
               <br />
               city, and the nucleus of a nation. It was 
               <br />
               not so in modern times. Nations were now 
               <br />
               formed by the agglomeration of communities 
               <br />
               having kindred interests and sympathies. 
               <br />
               Such was our case at the present moment. 
               <br />
               Objection had been taken to the scheme now 
               <br />
               under consideration, because of the words 
               <br />
               “ new nationality.” Now, when we were 
               <br />
               united together, if union were attained, we 
               <br />
               would form a litical nationality with which 
               <br />
               neither the national origin, nor the religion of 
               <br />
               any individual, would interfere. It was la- 
               <br />
               menœd b some that we had this diversity of 
               <br />
               races, an hopes were expressed that this dis- 
               <br />
               tinctive feature would cease. The idea of unity 
               <br />
               of races was utopian—it was impossible. Dis- 
               <br />
               tinctions of this kind would always exist. Dis- 
               <br />
               similarity, in fact, appeared to be the order of 
               <br />
               the physical world and of the moral world, as 
               <br />
               well as in the political world. But with regard 
               <br />
               to the objection based on this fact, to the 
               <br />
               eﬂ'ect that a great nation could not be formed 
               <br />
               because Lower Canada was in great part 
               <br />

               the combined talents, energy and courage of 
               <br />
               the three races together ? (Cheers) In our

               this way: we were of different races, not for

               the purpose of warring against each other, but 
               <br />

               awa with the distinctions of race. We could 
               <br />
               not ecrislate for the disappearance of the French

               <br />
               and French Canadians alike could appreciate 
               <br />
               and understand their position relative to each 
               <br />
               other. They were placed like great families 
               <br />
               beside each other, and their contact produced 
               <br />
               a healthy spirit of emulation. It was a beneﬁt 
               <br />
               rather than otherwise that we had a diversity 
               <br />
               of races. Of course, the difﬁculty, it would be 
               <br />
               said, would be to deal fairly b the minority. 
               <br />
               In Upper Canada the Catho ics would ﬁnd 
               <br />
               themselves in a minority; in Lower Canada 
               <br />
               the Protestants would be in a minority, while 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces were divided. Under 
               <br />
               such circumstances, would any one pretend 
               <br />
               that either the local or general governments 
               <br />
               would sanction any injustice. What would be 
               <br />
               the consequence, even supposing any such thing 
               <br />
               were attem tedby an one of the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments ? t would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> censured everywhere. 
               <br />
               Whether it came from Upper Canada or from 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, any attempt to deprive the 
               <br />
               minority of their ri hts would be at once 
               <br />
               thwarted. Under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federation</span> system, grant-

               these large uestions of general interest in

               which the ' erences of race or religion had 
               <br />
               no place, it could not be pretended that the

               rights of either race or religion could be 
               <br />
               invaded at all. We were to have a Gen-

               <br />
               these matters absorbed all individual interest.
