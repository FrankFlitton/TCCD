               Canada—I do not know how far this is applic-

               able to Lower Canada—whether it is not 
               <br />
               true that an immense number of our youth, 
               <br />
               now in the armies of the United States, have 
               <br />
               gone away because the preperties held by 
               <br />
               their fathers are so heavily mortgaged that 
               <br />
               they had no hope of retrieving them. 
               <br />
               Speaking for my own section, I can say that 
               <br />
               there is scarcely a young man who can now 
               <br />
               look forward, as was the rule ten or twelve 
               <br />
               years ago, to succeeding his father in the 
               <br />

               rally depressed state of the country, without 
               <br />
               any prospect of relief, causes a large amount 
               <br />
               of uneasiness in the public mind. And there 
               <br />
               is no doubt that a good deal of the feeling 
               <br />
               in favor of the scheme which honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tleman take credit for, is inﬂuenced by the 
               <br />
               desire to look for some change. as a relief 
               <br />
               from the depression under which we labour. 
               <br />
               And I am not without authority for the state- 
               <br />
               ment I am now making. I shall read from an 
               <br />
               article published only a day or two ago by 
               <br />
               one, whose name I am sure is well known to 
               <br />
               the commercial community generally—who 
               <br />
               has contributed more than any one else to 
               <br />
               the statistics of our trade and commerce by

               his labors in Toronto, and subsequently in 
               <br />
               Montreal—I allude to the Editor of the 
               <br />
               Trade Review. I shall read from that article, 
               <br />
               and shall then ask the House to say whether 
               <br />
               I have been exaggerating. I am now speaking 
               <br />
               more of the condition of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farmers,</span> and 
               <br />

               <br />
               money; I shall come presently to speak of 
               <br />
               the trade and commerce of the country, and 
               <br />
               shall prove from the same source that the 
               <br />
               statistics of our trade shew both to be in a 
               <br />
               deplorable condition. I do this to show that 
               <br />
               we should not blindly incur an immense 
               <br />
               liability in the matter of defence, when we 
               <br />
               have no means of meeting the outlay that 
               <br />
               may be imposed upon us. When the Hon.
