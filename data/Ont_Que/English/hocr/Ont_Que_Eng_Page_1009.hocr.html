               thank him for his support. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman may carry his resolution 
               <br />
               if he can, but I tell him that in that case no

               <br />
               perfectly comprehend that if any Address is

               to be carried to the Queen by the present 
               <br />
               Government, it must be the Address we have 
               <br />
               submitted to Parliament. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Ontario (Mr. M. C. CAMERON) 
               <br />
               says that we are attempting to dictate to the 
               <br />
               House—that we are endeavoring to take away 
               <br />
               from them the rightful powers of the mem— 
               <br />
               bars of this Legislature. We do nothing of 
               <br />
               the kind. The members of the Legislature 
               <br />
               - may act as they deem right; they may reject 
               <br />
               our Address, or amend it, or couple it with any- 
               <br />
               thing they please—all we say is, that we can- 
               <br />
               not be the bearers of a message shaped in the 
               <br />
               way the hon. member for Peel proposes. But 
               <br />
               if this House says there shall be an appeal to 
               <br />
               the people, it will get an appeal to the people 
               <br />
               at onee—to—morrow—(hear, hear)—and that 
               <br />
               without the mockery of going home to the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government with an Address asking 
               <br />
               in one breath that the bill may be passed into 
               <br />
               law, and in the next that it may not be passed 
               <br />
               into law. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peel has said that the legislatures of the 
               <br />
               other provinces have gone, or are going, to the 
               <br />
               people—and why not we ? The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               ought to know that the other legislatures were 
               <br />
               in a diﬁerent position from that which we 
               <br />
               occupied. As regards the New Brunswick 
               <br />
               Legislature, its term expired, I think, in May 
               <br />
               —they had not been for four years before 
               <br />
               their constituents—they were going soon at 
               <br />
               any rate, and they came to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that it was well to go at once. And so also 
               <br />
               it was in Newfoundland—the period when a 
               <br />
               dissolution must take place was rapidly ap— 
               <br />
               preaching, and they took the same course. 
               <br />
               The honorable gentleman says that if the 
               <br />
               Legislature of Nova Scotia do not approve of 
               <br />
               the resolutions, the Government will advise a 
               <br />
               dissolution. So probably would we under 
               <br />
               such circumstances. If this Legislature had 
               <br />
               not approved of the scheme, we would un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly, with His Excellency’s assent, have 
               <br />

               is there for a direct appeal to the people ? 
               <br />
               Here we have been discussing the question for 
               <br />
               cars— 
               <br />
               y HON. J. S. MACDONALD—0h! oh!

               ally understand this question just as well as 
               <br />
               the members of the Legislature. Those who 
               <br />
               are most difﬁcult to be made to understand 
               <br />
               are those who don’t want to understand. ’ 
               <br />
               Even the honorable member for Cornwall 
               <br />
               once understood this question, and if he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">does</span> 
               <br />
               not now it is because he has forgotten it. 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) If there were any doubt about 
               <br />
               public feeling, there might be propriety in 
               <br />
               going to the people. But is there any doubt 
               <br />
               about it ? I am not opposing the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman’s resolution on constitutional 
               <br />
               grounds. I am not denying the rights of the 
               <br />
               ‘people; if I had any doubt whatever about 
               <br />
               what would be the verdict of the people, I 
               <br />
               should be the ﬁrst to say that we ought to go 
               <br />
               to the people. But it is simply because I am 
               <br />
               satisﬁed there would be a. sweeping verdict of 
               <br />
               the people in favor of the measure, that I 
               <br />
               think it unnecessary to take it to the country. 
               <br />
               What would be the verdict of the people may 
               <br />
               be judged from what has been the vote of 
               <br />
               their representatives here, who are responsible 
               <br />
               to them. Never has there been such a ver- 
               <br />
               dict in this Parliament on any matter of grave 
               <br />
               importance as we have had in favor of this 
               <br />
               measure—in the Upper House a majority of 
               <br />
               three to one, and in the Lower House also a 
               <br />
               majority as nearly as possible of three to one. 
               <br />
               And of the six honorable members who were 
               <br />
               absent from the vote—the SPEAKER, and the 
               <br />
               ﬁve honorable members who were absent—ﬁve 
               <br />
               would have gone for it and only one against 
               <br />
               it—the House being divided, 94 for to 36 
               <br />
               against. And as regards those 36, more than 
               <br />
               one-half of them have risen in this House and 
               <br />
               declared themselves in favor of the general 
               <br />
               principle, and only opposed to some of the 
               <br />
               details. I say there never has been such a 
               <br />
               unanimous verdict from any Parliament in 
               <br />
               favor of any great constitutional change. And 
               <br />
               since the policy of the Government has been 
               <br />
               announced, no fewer than 50 out of our 
               <br />
               130 constituencies have been appealed to 
               <br />
               by elections, for the one House or the other 
               <br />
               —and in the whole of these, only four can 
               <br />
               didates offered themselves in opposition to 
               <br />
               this policy, and but two got elected—and
