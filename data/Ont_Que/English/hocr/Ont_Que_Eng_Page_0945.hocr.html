               (Laughter.) I do not desire to make any

               <br />
               able member told us of the astonishing pro- 
               <br />
               gress of the United States, in spite of the war 
               <br />
               and the enormous expenses it has entailed; 
               <br />
               and he told us that in ﬁve years from the 
               <br />
               present time New York will have paid off its 
               <br />
               debt; then why not unite ourselves with the 
               <br />
               State of New York? He did not say all 
               <br />
               that, but nearly all; it is the natural conclu- 
               <br />
               sion to be drawn from his 8 h. He tells 
               <br />
               us that the people are discontented, and that 
               <br />
               they will rise up in rebellion if we force Con- 
               <br />
               federation on them. But what means does 
               <br />
               he employ in order to excite the prejudices of 
               <br />
               the people ? We may judge of the means he 
               <br />
               resorts to in this instance by those he em- 
               <br />
               ployed in former da 8 to prejudice the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mople</span> 
               <br />
               against a measure avorable to their own in- 
               <br />
               terests, but unjust in some of its provisions, 
               <br />
               involving the spoliation of a particular class 
               <br />
               in society—I speak of the abolition of the 
               <br />
               Seigniorial Tenure. Were it not for the 
               <br />
               abolition of the Seigniorial Tenure, the 
               <br />
               seigniors <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would~</span> now be extremely wealthy. 
               <br />
               The eﬁ'ect, then, of that law was to despoil 
               <br />
               the seigniors for the beneﬁt of the pe0ple— 
               <br />
               whom the honorable member for Drummond 
               <br />
               and Arthabaska pretends to represent. But, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, how did the honorable member 
               <br />
               act at the time ? How did he attempt to 
               <br />
               deceive the people, and excite prejudices 
               <br />
