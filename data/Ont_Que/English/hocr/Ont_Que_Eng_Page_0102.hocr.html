               occurred, and on several occasions the power

               most irresponsible body in the world; and if a 
               <br />
               dead-lock should occur there would be no way

               HON. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hiOORE</span> said, as there was an 
               <br />
               evident desire for an adjournment, he would 
               <br />
               not occupy the time of the House for more 
               <br />
               than a few minutes, his intention being merely 
               <br />
               to refer to a portion of the remarks made 
               <br />
               by the honorable gentleman (Hon. Mr. VIDAL) 
               <br />
               who had just sat down. Though be generally 
               <br />
               agreed in what had been said by that honor- 
               <br />
               able member, there was one particular in which 
               <br />
               he (Hon. Mr. Moons) thought he was in error. 
               <br />
               He (Hon. Mr. VIDAL) seemed to have become 
               <br />
               impressed with the idea that it was not compe- 
               <br />
               tent for the House to amend the resolutions, but 
               <br />
               that they should either be ado ted or rejected 
               <br />
               as a whole. It was true the overnment had 
               <br />
               so laid it down, but he (Hon. Mr. Moons) held 
               <br />
               that the question could be dealt with in the 
               <br />
               same manner as any other that might come 
               <br />
               before the House. His honorable friend was 
               <br />
               also of opinion that, if no a tions or amend- 
               <br />
               ments were to be adopted, lt was wasting time 
               <br />
               to discuss the scheme. In this respect he 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. Moons) to diﬁ'er with the 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman, ho ding that it was not 
               <br />
               only useful, but essentially necessary that the 
               <br />
               details of a measure fraught with such grave and 
               <br />
               momentous importance to the country should 
               <br />
               be thoroughly discussed. A calm and con- 
               <br />
               siderate discussion—and every latitude for 
               <br />
               discussion—were necessary, and he hoped the 
               <br />
               Government would not press the measure with 
               <br />
               any unseeml haste, for they not only owed it 
               <br />
               to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature,</span> but to the country, that 
               <br />
               ample op rtuuity for consideration of the

               <br />
               representatives. He also considered it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">import</span> 
               <br />
               ant that members should have an opportunity 
               <br />
               to confer with their constituents on the sub- 
               <br />
               ject, in order to vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adedly</span> when the time 
               <br />
               came; and he trusœd the Government would 
               <br />
               not press the matter, nor hinder the expression 
               <br />
               of views, even if those views extended to 
               <br />
               amendment in certain particulars. The hon- 
               <br />
               orable gentleman then sat down, repeating 
               <br />
               that he thought the House might deal with 
               <br />
               the question as with any other that might 
               <br />
               come before it.
