               ﬁve, the one argument of the honorable mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Peel in demanding the turmoil and 
               <br />
               delay and expense of a general election was 
               <br />
               his tenderness as to the feelings of the Lower 
               <br />
               Canadians. (Hear, hear.) And yet, sir, the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Peel has seen the sort 
               <br />
               of agitation that is being carried on a ainst 
               <br />
               this measure in Lower Canada; he has card 
               <br />
               the way in which petitions against it have 
               <br />
               been concocted in this character, and sent 
               <br />
               broadcast over this country with urgent en- 
               <br />
               treaties to have them signed by men, women 
               <br />
               and children; he has seen these petitions 
               <br />
               come back here with hardly a genuine signa- 
               <br />
               ture appended to them; he has heard the ar- 
               <br />
               guments and the cries on which this agitation 
               <br />
               has been based. (Hear, hear.) I ask him 
               <br />
               if it is to aid and strengthen such an agitation 
               <br />
               against this measure that he demands a gen- 
               <br />
               eral election ? I ask him if there has been 
               <br />
               one argument against the scheme which, in 
               <br />
               his opinion, supplied any reasonable founda- 
               <br />
               tion for the agitation sought to be excited in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada; if there has been one cry at- 
               <br />
               tempted to be raised against it that honestly 
               <br />
               went to the true merits of the question ? If 
               <br />
               there has been, I have yet to hear it. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But, Mr. SPEAKER, the most curious 
               <br />
               part of the proposal of the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Peel is the attitude he would have us oc- 
               <br />
               cupy in addressing the Queen. We have 
               <br />
               already adopted an Address praying Her 
               <br />
               Majesty to pass an Imperial Statute giving 
               <br />
               eﬂ'ect to the resolutions of the Quebec Confer- 
               <br />
               ence; and the hon. member for Peel now asks 
               <br />
               that we shall pass a second Address raying 
               <br />
               that the said Imperial Act shall be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject</span> to 
               <br />
               the approval, and shall not be law until it 
               <br />
               obtains the ‘ap roval,of their high mightinesses 
               <br />
               the one hun red and thirty gentlemen who 
               <br />
               may happen to sit in the House of Assembly 
               <br />
               of the next Canadian Parliament. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) He would have us approach the 
               <br />
               Throne saying—“ May it lease Your Ma- 
               <br />

               <br />
               been adopted by the Governments of the ﬁve 
               <br />
               British American Provinces; we declare to 
               <br />
               you that this is the new Constitution we want 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ihr</span> British America ;' we pray Your Majesty 
               <br />
               to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> to it; we pray that the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament may pass an act enforcing this new 
               <br />
               Constitution on all these provinces, and that 
               <br />
               Your Majesty will assent to it. But at the 
               <br />
               same time we ask Your Majesty to do this 
               <br />
               only on one condition, namely, that the Legis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               next Legislature that may be chosen—shall

               member for Peel will permit me to tell him 
               <br />
               that if he fancies this would be a decorous

               mode of approaching the Sovereign, he has a 
               <br />

               <br />
               which it is their happiness to form a part. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) And further tell this honor- 
               <br />
               able gentleman and any other honorable 
               <br />
               member who may think with him, that if 
               <br />
               they expect honorable gentlemen to go to the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government and say—“ We ask you 
               <br />
               to take all the trouble of preparing this mea- 
               <br />
               sure—to assume it as your own—and to carry 
               <br />
               it through both Houses of Parliament against 
               <br />
               all opposition ; but at the same time we ask 
               <br />
               you to put in a clause that the Legislature of 
               <br />
               Canada shall be above the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, shall be above the Sovereign, and shall 
               <br />
               deal with your A‘ct just as it p1eases,”—then, 
               <br />
               I tell the House that parties must be found 
               <br />
               to convey that message, who are destitute of 
               <br />
               self-respect, and who have not a proper sense 
               <br />
               of the respect due to those holding the highest 
               <br />
               dignities of the realm. (Cheers) I do say 
               <br />
               that a more direct insult to the Crown could 
               <br />
               not be offered than that now proposed by the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Peel. But another 
               <br />
               most singular part of the proposal of the 
               <br />
               honorable member for Peel, is that while he 
               <br />
               is trying to pass this vote of want of conﬁ- 
               <br />
               dence in the Government—for if it is not 
               <br />
               that, it would, if carried, be at least a direct 
               <br />
               defeat of the policy of the Government-—he 
               <br />
               professes at the same moment an immense 
               <br />
               desire to strengthen the hands of the Adminis- 
               <br />
               tration. (Hear, hear.) He fancies, or pro- 
               <br />
               fesses to fancy, that if this motion of his were 
               <br />
               carried, the Government would take their dose 
               <br />
               placidly, and go meekly to England with the 
               <br />
               record of their defeat in their hands. He 
               <br />
               tells us in elfect,—-“I don’t want you, not- 
               <br />
               withstanding this vote, to hesitate about 
               <br />
               going to England—not at all. Your presence is 
               <br />
               wanted in England as quickly as possible. You 
               <br />
               ought to go immediately; you ought to talk 
               <br />
               strongly to the Imperial Government; you 
               <br />
               ought to tell them how they are to settle the 
               <br />
               defence question, how the reciprocity ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and so on. You must speak for the 
               <br />
               people of Canada in a bold and ﬁrm tone, that 
               <br />
               will do justice to the people of this country.” 
               <br />
               It is the honorable gentleman’s idea that we 
               <br />
               should go very strong to England, and his 
               <br />
               way of strengthening us is by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paæing</span> upon
