               of representative government that the electing 
               <br />

               is that not even the representative nnciple shall 
               <br />
               alone legislate. We have taken t e recaution

               <br />

               fold and invaluable shelter which we have raised

               Well, that was not voted upon without 
               <br />
               argument; for full opportunity was given to 
               <br />

               member for Peel committed an act of incon- 
               <br />
               sistency in voting for these resolutions, and 
               <br />
               then proposing this amendment What did 
               <br />
               the resolutions amount to? The honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman voted for an Address to the 
               <br />
               Queen, praying that she may be pleased to 
               <br />
               lay before the Imperial Parliament a measure 
               <br />
               for the union of these colonies, on the basis 
               <br />
               of the resolutions of the Quebec Conference. 
               <br />
               He voted for it because he approved of the 
               <br />
               proposition ; and if we had followed the 
               <br />
               practice of the Imperial Parliament, the Ad- 
               <br />
               dress would have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aflopted</span> by the vote 
               <br />
               which he and a majority of hen. members 
               <br />
               gave, and probably would be on its way to

               England now for presentation to Her Ma— 
               <br />
               jesty. It is a practice lately adopted to 
               <br />
               refer the Address formally to a committee, to 
               <br />
               report it back again to the House. Well, 
               <br />
               my hon. friend, by his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vote,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁrmed</span> that this 
               <br />
               Address should be sent to Her Majesty; but 
               <br />
               what does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this.</span> motion proposed by him de- 
               <br />
               clare? Why, that the Address which he de-

               clared by his vote should be presented to the 
               <br />
               Queen, should not be sent. That is the plain 
               <br />
               meaning of- it, and —-—I was going to say that 
               <br />
               it gives the lie to his former action, but—is 
               <br />
               the very Opposite to the previous vote of the
