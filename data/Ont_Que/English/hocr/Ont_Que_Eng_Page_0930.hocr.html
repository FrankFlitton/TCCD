               (Hear, hear.) I attribute this improvement

               in a great measure to the fact that we are

               <br />
               rather than of a legislative body. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Inasmuch, sir, as I have reasons, 
               <br />
               which perhaps are somewhat peculiar to 
               <br />
               myself, for entertaining the views which I 
               <br />
               hold upon this question, I trust I may be 
               <br />
               pardoned if I refer to some of the most 
               <br />
               prominent events connected with the progress 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> in Canada for some . years past. 
               <br />
               And here I may remark, that though the 
               <br />
               country has become more important, though 
               <br />
               our population has increased, and our pros- 
               <br />
               perity advanced, in perhaps as rapid a 
               <br />
               degree as any reasonable person could have 
               <br />
               expected, there are still some'respects in 
               <br />
               which we have not advanced, but rather 
               <br />
               retrograded than otherwise. I mean that 
               <br />
               the tone of feeling among the prominent 
               <br />
               men of the country has rather deteriorated 
               <br />
               than improved, since the introduction of 
               <br />
               responsible government. I, sir, am old— 
               <br />
               fashioned enough to believe, that although 
               <br />
               there may have been some objections to the 
               <br />
               mode of government which existed prior to 
               <br />
               the union, there was a higher tone among 
               <br />
               our public men in those days than has 
               <br />
               prevailed for some years past. Still, no doubt, 
               <br />
               there was much cause of complaint on the part 
               <br />
               of those who originated the agitation, which 
               <br />
               resulted in the rebellion of 1837. And speak- 
               <br />
               ing now in the light of the experience, many 
               <br />
               of us would probably be prepared to admit 
               <br />
               those gentlemen who took a prominent part 
               <br />
               in bringing about that rebellion, and whom 
               <br />
               we then considered it a duty to put down, 
               <br />

               of removing the just causes of complaint 
               <br />
               which had led to the revolt. The ﬁrst step 
               <br />
               was to bring about a union of the two pro-

               who were forced reluctantly to accede to it. 
               <br />
               There were at that time gentlemen worthy

               countrymen who denounced the union, and

               <br />
               an intelligent man in this country who will 
               <br />
               now say that those predictions have been

               member of this House, on either side, who 
               <br />
               would expect anybody to believe he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spoke</span> 
               <br />
               sincerely if he asserted that the union had 
               <br />
               been attended by disastrous results. The 
               <br />
               time has passed for hostile feelings to exist 
               <br />
               between the peOple of the two sections of 
               <br />
               this country—I say the two sections, for 
               <br />
               I have never allowed myself to speak of 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada as separate and 
               <br />
               distinct provinces or countries, as has been 
               <br />
               too much the practice. From the moment 
               <br />
               the union was consummated, I felt that we 
               <br />
               should look upon ourselves as inhabitants of 
               <br />
               one country, and not as the pe0ple <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,of</span> two 
               <br />
               distinct provinces. In some instances legis-

               lation might operate with greater advantage 
               <br />
               to one section, while in others it would be 
               <br />
               more beneﬁcial to the other section. But 
               <br />
               whatever was for the beneﬁt of one was for the 
               <br />
               good of the whole, inasmuch as it added to the
