               Hort. Ms.. ROSE- I do not deny that the

               it stronger and more enduring. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) Though I believe these relatibns will 
               <br />
               be somewhat changed, and we may have to 
               <br />
               consider what new aspect they will present, 
               <br />
               I believe this measure is forced upon us by 
               <br />
               the necessities of our position. The irre- 
               <br />

               <br />
               us to stand still. But, whether by this 
               <br />
               inevitable change the country shall gradually 
               <br />
               lose its dependent or protected character and 
               <br />
               assume more of the Federal relation, consti- 
               <br />
               tuting this a territorial division of the Em- 
               <br />

               <br />
               relations on a surer and more steadfast foot- 
               <br />

               <br />
               not be denied that that kind of opinion has 
               <br />
               obtained a good deal more force within the 
               <br />
               last few years, than those of us who desire to 
               <br />
               maintain the connection between these colo- 
               <br />
               nies and England would like that it should 
               <br />
               have obtained; and we cannot ignore the 
               <br />
               consequences which that increasing volume 
               <br />
               of public opinion may have upon the legisla- 
               <br />
               tion of England. Then there is another 
               <br />
               consideration which makes this subject stand 
               <br />
               out more prominently before the pecple of 
               <br />
               England at the present time than otherwise 
               <br />
               it would do, and that is, the state of its 
               <br />
               relations with the republic adjoining us, and 
               <br />
               the enormous military power which the 
               <br />
               United States have shewn, within the last 
               <br />
               two or three years, that they possess. In 
               <br />
               consequence of this, the state of opinion in 
               <br />
               England which might have been conﬁned 
               <br />
               for many years perhaps to mere theory, has 
               <br />
               been brought to a head. It is not now 
               <br />
               merely a question of abstract opinion,whether 
               <br />
               under such and such circumstances it would 
               <br />
               be better for this and other colonies to assume 
               <br />
               a more independent attitude towards Eng- 
               <br />
               land. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,But</span> it has been pressed with unex- 
               <br />
               pected abruptness to a practical issue before 
               <br />
               the people of England, and they have now 
               <br />
               to consider what the relations of Great 
               <br />
               Britain to these colonies would be, in the 
               <br />
               event of war with the United States; how 
               <br />
               far, in that event, it would be possible to 
               <br />
               protect this remote dependenc of the em- 
               <br />
               pire, to avoid disaster to the uglish ﬂag, 
               <br />
               and at a distance of 3,000 miles to maintain 
               <br />
               the prowess of the English name. It is this 
               <br />
               which has forced public Opinion so strongly 
               <br />
               in England to a consideration of the actual 
               <br />
               relations between this country and the Mother 
               <br />
               Country, and it is this state of facts with 
               <br />
               which we must deal now. It is, I repeat, 
               <br />
               past discussing as a more abstract matter of 
               <br />
               doctrine. We must look our situation in 
               <br />
               the face. We must consider the eventual- 
               <br />
               ities which press themselves on our notice, 
               <br />
               and it is our bounden duty to see whether 
               <br />
               we cannot ﬁnd in the union of these colonies 
               <br />
               security to ourselves and asource of strength 
               <br />
               to the Empire at large. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               With respect, then, to the objections urged 
               <br />
               by those who consider that this scheme may 
               <br />
               be leading us along a new and untrodden 
               <br />
               path towards independence, or at least to a 
               <br />
               more independent relation with reference to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> than that in which we now stand
