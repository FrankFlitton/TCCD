               ive legislatures. This is an era in the histo 
               <br />
               of both races—the earnest plighting of eac 
               <br />
               other’s faith as they embrace this scheme. 
               <br />
               It is remarkable that both should place such 
               <br />
               entire conﬁdence in one another; and in 
               <br />
               future ages our posterity on both sides will 
               <br />
               be able to point with pride to the period 
               <br />
               when the two races had such reliance the 
               <br />
               one on the other as that each was willing to 
               <br />
               trust its safet and interest to the honor of 
               <br />
               the other. ( ear, hear.) This mutual conﬁd- 
               <br />
               ence has not been brought about by any 
               <br />
               e hemeral or spasmodic desire for change on 
               <br />
               t c part of either; it is the result of the 
               <br />
               knowledge each race possesses of the charac- 
               <br />
               ter of the other, and of the respect each en- 
               <br />
               tertains for the other. (Hear, hear.) It is 
               <br />
               because we have learnt to respect each other’s 
               <br />
               motives and have been made to feel by expe— 
               <br />
               rience that neither must be aggressive, and 
               <br />
               that the interests of the one are safe in the 
               <br />
               keeping of the other. And I think I may 
               <br />
               fair y appeal to the President of the Council, 
               <br />
               that if, during the ten years in which he has 
               <br />

               has persistently made with all the earnestness 
               <br />

               <br />
               ed a deaf ear to them, but had gone with 
               <br />
               those of our own race and our own faith, the 
               <br />
               people of Upper Canada, who demanded this 
               <br />
               change, where, I would ask him, would have 
               <br />
               been our union to day? Would nota feeling 
               <br />
               of distrust have been established between the 
               <br />
               French and English races in the community, 
               <br />
               that would have rendered even the l'air con- 
               <br />
               sideration of it utterly impracticable ? 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Would the French have in

               that case been ready now to trust themselves

               thus strongly that our French follow—subjects 
               <br />
               are placing entire conﬁdence in us—in our

               not to be behind hand in placing conﬁdence 
               <br />
               in them. I feel that we have no reason as a

               minority to fear aggressions on the past of 
               <br />
               the majority. We feel that in the past we

               have an earnest of what we may reasonably

               expect the future relations between the two

               <br />
               have each carefully and prudently endeavored 
               <br />
               to place as fundamental conditions in this

               been carefully considered and carried out, 
               <br />

               <br />
               we need not have any apprehension in trust-

               other, no doubt those who prepared these
