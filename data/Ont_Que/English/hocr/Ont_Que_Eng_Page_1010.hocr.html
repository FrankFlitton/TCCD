               <br />
               certainly did not notice that he made it— 
               <br />
               while addressing the House. I was remark- 
               <br />
               ing that I had not heard one member from 
               <br />
               Upper Canada declare that a large majority 
               <br />
               of his constituents were not in favor of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               in this House and one in the other, who 
               <br />
               have just come from their elections—one 
               <br />
               from the city of Hamilton, situated in the 
               <br />
               county (South Wentworth) represented by 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman (Mr. RYMAL), and the 
               <br />
               other from the Legislative Council district, 
               <br />
               which includes the constituency of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (Mr. RYMAL)—and both of them 
               <br />
               declare that they have not the slighest 
               <br />
               doubt as to the feeling of their constituents 
               <br />
               —that it is strongly in favor of the measure. 
               <br />
               I repeat, then, that I have not as yet heard 
               <br />
               one hon. member declare that his constitu- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Riding of Wentworth than either one of those 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen. Neither of them has ever 
               <br />
               had the conﬁdence of the electors of South 
               <br />
               Wentworth. One of them was in a minority 
               <br />
               there, last fall, of 300. The other tried it 
               <br />
               some years ago, and had not the shadow of a 
               <br />
               chance.

               HON. MR. BROWN—That may be true. 
               <br />
               But the hon. gentleman should have stated 
               <br />
               this also, that Dr. SMITH ,the opponent of Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. BULL, declared he was in favor of the 
               <br />
               general principles of this measure, and that 
               <br />
               if the details were satisfactory, he would go 
               <br />
               for it. So that in fact both the candidates 
               <br />
               for that constituency, including the whole 
               <br />
               of Wentworth and the city of Hamilton, 
               <br />

               that he may have said so since his defeat, 
               <br />
               but I can only say that I conversed with 
               <br />
               Dr. SMITH myself while he was a candidate, 
               <br />
               and heard a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> opinion from him. 
               <br />
               But I think it ill became the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman to speak so disparagingly of the 
               <br />
               testimony of gentlemen as to the feeling of 
               <br />
               the county, simply because they were not 
               <br />
               strong in a particular contest. When he 
               <br />
               remembers how hard a ﬁght he himself had 
               <br />
               at last election, and that he was only elected 
               <br />
               by a very small majority, he was hardly in a 
               <br />
               position to throw discredit on such a score 
               <br />
               on the statement of hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               have just come from the people, and, after 
               <br />
               putting the measure fairly and squarely 
               <br />
               before the electors, have got an almost 
               <br />
               unanimous verdict in its favor. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Hamilton polled an immense 
               <br />
               majority, and it was not right for my 
               <br />
               honorable friend to indulge in a sneer 
               <br />
               because he may have been in a min- 
               <br />
               ority on a previous occasion. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, I might detain the House 
               <br />
               much longer in replying to what fell from 
               <br />
               honorable members who have spoken during 
               <br />
               this discussion. But I do not desire to keep 
               <br />
               the House from the vote. I would simply 
               <br />
               appeal to the members of this House, that if
