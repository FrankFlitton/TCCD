               matters not in the least to me. I have 
               <br />
               simply discharged what I conceived a duty 
               <br />
               to my fellow-religionists in Lower Canada. I 
               <br />
               bring to the knowledge of honorable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle.</span> 
               <br />
               men of the Roman Catholic persuasion what 
               <br />
               many of them seem to have been ignorant of. 
               <br />
               And it is all nonsense to endeavor to ignore 
               <br />
               the fact that I have brought before them. 
               <br />
               We know that in some Roman Catholic coun- 
               <br />
               tries absolute intolerance prevails. In Spain, 
               <br />
               for instance, not a Protestant church is al- 
               <br />
               lowed to be erected throughout the whole 
               <br />
               length and breadth of that country. It is of 
               <br />
               no use, therefore, for honorable gentlemen to 
               <br />
               jeer at what I say ; and when an edict of in— 
               <br />
               tolerance is again promulgated aud sent out 
               <br />
               to the world, emanating from the very head 
               <br />
               of the Romish Church, is it surprising, when 
               <br />
               the Protestants of Lower Canada are in a 
               <br />
               small minority, and know that they will be at 
               <br />
               the mercy of the hierarchy entertaining those 
               <br />
               views, that they should feel some reluctance 
               <br />
               to be left in that position. I know this very 
               <br />
               well, that the generality of Roman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics</span> 
               <br />
               in this country would avow, as they have 
               <br />
               done, their opposition to the sentiment I have 
               <br />
               quoted. I call upon them practically to dis- 
               <br />
               avow it, and I have conﬁdence that they will 
               <br />
               do 50. Whether they like the dilemma in 
               <br />
               which they are placed, or not, is another mat- 
               <br />
               ter. (Hear, hear.) Composed, as our society 
               <br />
               is, of those diﬂ'erent elements, when we have 
               <br />
               to discuss matters similar to that before us, 
               <br />
               when we have to adept a scheme involving 
               <br />
               the interests of minorities and sections, it is 
               <br />
               right that we should do so frankly and _hon— 
               <br />
               estly one to the other, and face to face. I
