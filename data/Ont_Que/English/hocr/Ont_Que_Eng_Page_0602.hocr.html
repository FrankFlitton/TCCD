               Mn. PERRAULT—Mr. SPEAKER, it is 
               <br />
               not without a degree of hesitation easy to 
               <br />
               be understood that I venture to give my 
               <br />
               reasons for my vote on the question of the 
               <br />
               Confederation of the Provinces of British 
               <br />
               North America. I hesitate, because I am 
               <br />
               conscious how much I fall short in respect 
               <br />
               of solid information and political experience 
               <br />
               to enable me to form a healthy and reliable 
               <br />
               jud ent of the various reasons tobe alleged 
               <br />
               on 0th sides of that vast question, the 
               <br />
               decision of which is pregnant with such 
               <br />
               serious consequences to the future welfare 
               <br />
               of the country. A further cause of my 
               <br />
               hesitation, Mr. SPEAKER, is that I see on 
               <br />
               the Ministerial benches men grown old in 
               <br />
               political warfare—men who for many years 
               <br />
               have been the leaders and guides ot‘ the 
               <br />
               majorities in the two Canadas—supportiug 
               <br />
               the scheme now submitted to us, and assur- 
               <br />
               ing us that it is the only remedy for all the 
               <br />
               difﬁculties of our present position. Still 
               <br />
               another cause of my hesitation is that I am 
               <br />
               aware of the great severity with which the 
               <br />
               Ministerial press visits all the adversaries 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> of the plan of Confederation, and of the 
               <br />
               small measure of justice which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it‘metes</span> 
               <br />
               out in estimating the motives of those 
               <br />
               who oppose this constitutional scheme, 
               <br />
               however upright their characters or 
               <br />
               honest the motives which actuate them. 
               <br />
               But I should consider myself wanting in my 
               <br />
               duty as a member if, swayed by these mis- 
               <br />
               givings, I did not state my motives in this 
               <br />
               House for my opposition to the project of 
               <br />
               Confederation. Os so important a question 
               <br />
               it is a duty to my constituents, it is a 
               <br />
               duty which I owe to myself, that I should 
               <br />
               justify the responsibility which I take upon 
               <br />
               myself in resisting a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measureyhich</span> is so

               strongly supported in this House, and I 
               <br />
               should think I failed in my dut and 
               <br />
               was unworthy of the seat which I ﬁll in it, if 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I.</span> did not add force to my opposition by 
               <br />
               citing the history of the past, by pourtrayiug

               Provinces of British North America are 
               <br />

               <br />
               venience of studying the question, I visited 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces in 1863, by way of the 
               <br />
               Gulf, and in 1864 by the Bay of Fundy. I 
               <br />
               am bound to say that I found the people 
               <br />
               everywhere in easy circumstances, and in- 
               <br />
               telligent, and doing honor to that part of 
               <br />
               the country. I was then enabled to appre-

               ciate the advantages and the inconveniences 
               <br />
               attending on the decision of the question of 
               <br />
               Confederation generally. On my return 
               <br />
               from my last journey, which I made in the 
               <br />
               month of August, 1864, in company with a 
               <br />
               certain number of the members of both 
               <br />
               Houses, it was said by the press that I had 
               <br />
               in several companies declared myself favor- 
               <br />
               able to the plan of a Confederation of all the 
               <br />
               provinces. At that time the Conference at 
               <br />
               Charlottetown had not taken place, and pub- 
               <br />
               lic opinion had already busied itself with 
               <br />
               classifying the members ot this House as 
               <br />
               favorers or opponents of Confederation. I 
               <br />
               had already, at that time, publicly expressed 
               <br />
               my opinion on the question through the 
               <br />

               <br />
               to which I still adhere, and that I have not 
               <br />
               found it necessary to alter my position in

               <br />
