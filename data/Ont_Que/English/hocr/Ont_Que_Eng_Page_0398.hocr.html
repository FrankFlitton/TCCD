               honorable member for Hochelaga feigns great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uneasiness</span> as to the position of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               in the Confederation, as well as to the matter

               of direct taxes. He spoke at t len h as

               to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperous</span> ﬁnancial position of wer

               Canada when she entered the union in 1841 ; 
               <br />
               but we must remember that before the union 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue</span> of Lower Canada was but 8580,- 
               <br />
               000, and that, nevertheless, she was compelled 
               <br />
               to provide for all local expenses and many 
               <br />
               items of general expense which, under the 
               <br />
               Confederation,will fall within the domain of 
               <br />
               the Federal Government, such, for instance, 
               <br />
               as the payment of the salaries of the judges, 
               <br />
               etc. Under the Confederation Lower Canada 
               <br />
               will have a surplus of over $200,000 on its 
               <br />
               local expenditure, even though the present ex- 
               <br />

               arable member for Hochelaga also said that

               culations of the President of the Council, 
               <br />

               can come from this side of the House. But 
               <br />
               the fact is the honorable member was anxious 
               <br />
               not to frighten the people at that time, and 
               <br />
               therefore it was that he spoke of sixteen mil-

               lions, whereas now he speaks of twenty. 
               <br />
               With regard to the amount of the public 
               <br />
               debt, the Hon. Minister of Finance has given 
               <br />

               <br />
               and prefer adopting his ﬁgures to following 
               <br />
               those of the honorable member for Hochelaga. 
               <br />
               The Hon. Minister of Finance told us that 
               <br />
               the total debt of the two Canadas, without 
               <br />
               counting the Sinking Fund, was $67,263,000, 
               <br />
               and that the Federal Government would un- 
               <br />
               dertake $62,500,000. There will therefore 
               <br />
               remain about $4,763,000 to be divided be- 
               <br />
               tween Upper and Lower Canada, and if Lower 
               <br />
               Canada takes for its share 84,500,000 as the 
               <br />
               honorable member stated, there will only re- 
               <br />

               do not see how the honorab e gentleman has
