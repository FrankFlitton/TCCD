               perceive that if the present union be con-

               of providing a remedy for our sectional diﬂi- 
               <br />
               culties. _The honorable member for Richelieu 
               <br />
               may play the alarmist as loudly as he likes. 
               <br />
               I can assure him that the vast majority of his 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen are too intelligent to be de- 
               <br />
               ceived. They know full well that the minority 
               <br />
               cannot control the majority. The duty of the 
               <br />
               minority is to better their position as far as 
               <br />
               possible, but they cannot pretend to dictate to 
               <br />
               the m aj ority—more especially when that major- 
               <br />
               ity is composed, if we are to believe the honor— 
               <br />
               able member for Richelieu, of men who de- 
               <br />
               light in oppressing others. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               The speech of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               Richelieu is the speech of a mere youth, and 
               <br />
               is devoid of weight and importance; but it is 
               <br />
               a speech which would have been extremely 
               <br />
               injurious to the best interests of Lower Cana- 
               <br />
               da, had it emanated from a man possessing a 
               <br />
               wider reputation or greater importance than 
               <br />
               that honorable gentleman enjoys. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear, and laughter.) He also stated that 
               <br />
               “ the cry of representation based upon popu- 
               <br />
               lation had been used in Upper Canada merely 
               <br />
               for the purpose of securing the success of 
               <br />
               party leaders, of enabling them to get into 
               <br />
               power.” But we know that commanders are 
               <br />
               leaders of men; that commanders are to be 
               <br />
               dreaded when they have followers at their 
               <br />
               back; and the Upper Canada leaders surely 
               <br />
               do not lack followers. The honorable member 
               <br />
               for Richelieu went on to say :—“ But we are 
               <br />
               in a good position I The liberals passed the 
               <br />
               Separate School Bill! ” I believe he was in 
               <br />
               the House when the Separate School Bill was 
               <br />
               passed ; but if hc was not present, he may be 
               <br />
               somewhat excuSable for that statement. I

               had called upon him to 'vc his vote, and 
               <br />
               forced him to record it. ( ear, hear.) Theœ 
               <br />
               are the facts as they occurred, and they are 
               <br />
               proof positive that liberalism is no better 
               <br />
               here than elsewhere. (Hear, hear.) The 
               <br />
               honorable member for Richelieu loudly 
               <br />
               accuses the majority of servility and vendity. 
               <br />
               There was a time when he spoke in a diﬁ’erent 
               <br />
               tone, when he himself formed part of the 
               <br />
               majority, and when he availed himself of that 
               <br />
               position to make a little trip to the Saguenay at 
               <br />
               the expense of the Government, and to write 
               <br />
               a little romance afterwards. (Hear, hear, 
               <br />
               and laughter.) For my part, Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               as one of the majority at present, I have yet 
               <br />
               to learn when and in what I havebeen servile 
               <br />
               towards my friends in the Government; nor 
               <br />
               am I aware how or when the majority have 
               <br />
               evinced venality, as the honorable member 
               <br />
               asserts. (Hear, hear.) The honorable mcm- 
               <br />
               ber for Richelieu has himself experienced the 
               <br />
               mode in which a majority evinced venality. 
               <br />
               and the lesson has evidently not been lost 
               <br />
               upon him. (Hear, hear.) The honorable 
               <br />
               member says——“ We have a magniﬁcent pub— 
               <br />
               lic domain in Lower Canada; we have an im- 
               <br />
               mense quantity of land, while Upper Canada 
               <br />
               has none left; we can establish magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               settlements, and increase our population. Let 
               <br />
               us remain as we are under the union.” Now, 
               <br />
               for my part, I assert that for that very reason 
               <br />
               we ought to accept Confederation in order 
               <br />
               that we may get the complete control of that 
               <br />
               noble domain, instead of holding it only in 
               <br />
               common with Upper Canada. He gives us a 
               <br />
               grand outline of all we could do with that 
               <br />
               splendid domain, and then says he does not
