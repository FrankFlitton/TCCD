               gentlemen, you may probably regard it as

               presumptuous in one so inexperienced as I 
               <br />

               <br />
               against the Hon. Commissioner of Crown 
               <br />
               Lands, and to venture to dispute the validity 
               <br />
               of the arguments adduced by him in his 
               <br />
               eloquent speech against the amendment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span>

               existing disparity in point of ability and in-

               ﬂuence, I do not shrink from the contest, for 
               <br />
               Ibelieve that I have truth and justiceon my 
               <br />
               side, and have conﬁdence that in its own 
               <br />
               inherent power, the truth will ultimately 
               <br />
               prevail. I have listened with delight to the

               <br />

               <br />
               the Constitution, but that the question before 
               <br />
               us was one simply for an address to the 
               <br />
               Crown. Now, strictly speaking, and tskin 
               <br />
               the words of the motion in their more liters 
               <br />
               sense, this statement is correct; but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask</span> 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen if it is fair or candid to en- 
               <br />
               deavor to lead the House to believe that this 
               <br />
               motion, which is undoubtedly for an address, 
               <br />
               is not in eﬂ'ect for a change in the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion ? Are we not plainl told that no Im- 
               <br />
               perial legislation will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tale</span> place on this 
               <br />
               subject, unless such an Address as this receives 
               <br />
               the assent of the Canadian Legislature? I 
               <br />
               hold. therefore, that the motion before us, 
               <br />
               though it be for an Address to Her Majesty, 
               <br />
               is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> a measure, which has for its object 
               <br />
               a change of the Constitution. Such being the 
               <br />
               case, the subject is one which demands our 
               <br />
               most careful consideration, and for which we 
               <br />
               ought to be allowed all the time requisite to 
               <br />
               the fullest and freest discussion. The changes 
               <br />
               which have been referred to, and with which 
               <br />
               it has been sought to compare this change, 
               <br />
               cannot with propriety be regarded as similar. 
               <br />
               I contend, in the language of the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman (Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SEYMOUR)</span> who has 
               <br />
               just preceded me, that this is in fact a revolu- 
               <br />
               tion : the word is not too strong. So far from 
               <br />
               its beingas has been stated, a simple change, 
               <br />
               like the mere introducin or reintroducing 
               <br />
               the use of the French <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Ianguage</span> into the 
               <br />
               Legislature, or even the more important ste 
               <br />
               of altering the constitution of this House, it 
               <br />
               is an entire alteration of our political condi- 
               <br />
               tion and relations, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affects</span> most deeply 
               <br />
               the whole country in all its varied interests. 
               <br />
               Whatever may be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correctness</span> or in-

               correctoess of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> opinion of my hon. friend
