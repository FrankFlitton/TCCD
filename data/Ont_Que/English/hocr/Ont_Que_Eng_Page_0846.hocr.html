               of safe for us, in the circumstances, is to

               have a cderal union of all our provinces—a

               social, political, commercial and military 
               <br />

               done all that men of courage and energy 
               <br />
               can be expected to do to mend our position, 
               <br />
               our future will not be so dark as the friends

               <br />

               <br />
               than they would be if united ? Are those 
               <br />
               persons not original in their ideas who allege 
               <br />
               that the endeavor of the Provinces of British 
               <br />
               North America to form a Confederation is a 
               <br />
               kind of provocation and deﬁance to the N orth- 
               <br />
               ern States? If the Northern States made 
               <br />
               this allegation, the most that could be said of 
               <br />
               it would be, that it would be a vain retext, 
               <br />
               as futile as it would be absurd. ot less 
               <br />
               ridiculous and misjudging are those persons 
               <br />
               who pretend that the Confederation of the 
               <br />
               Provinces of British North America would be 
               <br />
               a step towards annexation to the Northern 
               <br />
               States. Truly, there are some minds which 
               <br />
               have an odd way of looking at things. If, 
               <br />
               indeed, the opponents of Confederation would 
               <br />
               only prescribe some other remedy to obviate

               empire which is about to arise on this

               <br />
               ferring to history, we ﬁnd that confederations 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have'been</span> formed in nearly all ages, and that 
               <br />
               the principal cause of their formation has 
               <br />
               been, not only the purpose of mutual protec- 
               <br />
               tion, but a military object. These two mo- 
               <br />
               tives combined with a third, that of com- 
               <br />
               mercial advantages, suggested the project 
               <br />
               which now occupies our attention. Ame 
               <br />
               the ancient Greeks there were several <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federﬁ</span> 
               <br />
               unions, the two principal being the Ætolian 
               <br />
               and the Achœan'; the former, dating from a 
               <br />
               period long antecedent to that of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ALEXAN-</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DER,</span> was broken up by the subjection of the 
               <br />
               states composing the league to Rome, about 
               <br />
               180 years B. C.; the second, which was 
               <br />
               formed about 280 years B. C., was destroyed 
               <br />
               by the Romans about 150 years before the 
               <br />
               vulgar era. The Ætolian Confederation com- 
               <br />
               prised all the northern parts of Greece on the 
               <br />
               conﬁnes of Thessaly and Epirus, a portion of 
               <br />
               Central Greece, and several of the islands of 
               <br />
               the Ægean sea. This was a union rather of 
               <br />
               provinces than of cities. lt had a “Consti- 
               <br />
               tution,” “ States General,” a chief magistrate, 
               <br />
               a commander-in—chief, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> public 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers, with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> functions or powers; 
               <br />
               the power of declaring war and that of mak- 
               <br />
               ing peace, of levying taxes, coining money 
               <br />
               current at that time—all were intrusted to the 
               <br />
               Central Government. The Achœan League, 
               <br />
               on the contrary, was a union, not of pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, but of cities or towns—not less than 
               <br />
               seventy in number. There was a Federal 
               <br />
               capital, a “ Constitution,” different public 
               <br />
               oﬂicers, each invested with privileges and cer- 
               <br />
               tain powers and duties, too many to be enu- 
               <br />
               merated in this place. Who has not read the

               other the greatest captain of the Achcsan 
               <br />
               union? In reading the history of these na- 
               <br />
               tions we shall ﬁnd that it was their union 
               <br />
               which saved them so long from the inroads of ‘ 
               <br />
               their enemies, and which, for ages, preserved 
               <br />
               their autonomy. We next come to the Ital- 
               <br />
               ian Confederation of the middle ages. Like 
               <br />
               those of Greece, they derived their origin from 
               <br />
               military necessity. The League of Lom-
