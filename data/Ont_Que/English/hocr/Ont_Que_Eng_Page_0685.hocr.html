               Hon. Attorney General West, is bold, manly,

               and straightforward, and such as will entitle

               <br />
               the country. (Hear, hear.) It shows that 
               <br />
               they, at least, are in earnest on this great 
               <br />
               question of Confederation which they have

               opinion of the Opposition as to the motive

               which induced them to lay this measure

               before the House at the opening of the ses- 
               <br />
               sion, I think it must be utterly dispelled by 
               <br />
               the announcement just made to the House. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) If the scheme was worth any- 
               <br />
               thing when the Government, in the opening 
               <br />
               Speech this session, declared its intention of 
               <br />
               asking the consideration of the House for 1t, 
               <br />
               the same scheme must be worth as much 
               <br />
               now, and I trust that none of the diﬂiculties 
               <br />
               which may for a moment interpose, will pre- 
               <br />
               vent the Administration from carrying _1t 
               <br />
               through. (Hear, hear. It has been said 
               <br />
               that the measure whic the should have 
               <br />
               brought down was the smal er one, whilst 
               <br />
               they have introduced the larger. Now, srr, I 
               <br />
               hold that the greater always includes the less; 
               <br />
               and that the Government, instead of being 
               <br />
               blamed for the course they have taken, are en-

               tions of the importance of that now before the

               House are carried without considerable oppo- 
               <br />
               sition. I need only refer, as an example, to 
               <br />
               that of the Clergy Reserves, during the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion of which there were ﬁghts, ﬁerce and 
               <br />
               numerous, lasting for many years, until the 
               <br />
               measure was carried at last. And now, aswe 
               <br />
               are about to obtain what Upper Canada has 
               <br />
               sought for years—representation by popula- 
               <br />
               tion—we ﬁnd, unfortunately, difﬁculties inter- 
               <br />
               posing; but I hope that notwithstanding 
               <br />
               these, the Government will not falter, but will 
               <br />
               carry out the wish of the majority of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House and of the people of the

               DR. PARKER—If I understand cor- 
               <br />
               rectly the statement just made by the 
               <br />
               Government, they propose to send a delega- 
               <br />
               tion to England for the purpose of discussing 
               <br />
               the three questions of the Reciprocity treaty, 
               <br />
               the defences, and the scheme of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion now before the House. The Hon. 
               <br />
               Attorney General says that the question of 
               <br />
               the defences is very pressing, and that 
               <br />
               immediate action should also be taken with 
               <br />
               regard to the Reciprocity treaty. If these 
               <br />
               subjects are so pressing, they should be dealt 
               <br />
               with at once, irrespective <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> whether this 
               <br />
               scheme is carried or not. (Hear, hear.) A 
               <br />
               period of constitutional changes is most 
               <br />
               unfavorable for the preper consideration of 
               <br />
               these questions; and if the necessity is as 
               <br />
               urgent as represented, they should be taken 
               <br />
               up and considered at once, even in advance 
               <br />
               ofConfederation. Earl RUSSELL, then Lord 
               <br />
               JOHN RUSSELL, was severely ridiculed by the 
               <br />
               British press because he introduced a Reform 
               <br />
               bill during the Crimean war. I deprecate 
               <br />
               most strongly the attempt made to coerce 
               <br />
               constitutional changes upon this House 
               <br />
               and the country under the pressure of 
               <br />
               danger and coming war. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               He is no friend of Canada who is constantly 
               <br />
               creating alarm and raising the cuckoo cry 
               <br />
               of loyalty. (Hear, hear.) This Government 
               <br />
               was formed for the express purpose of dis- 
               <br />
               covering a remedy for our constitutional 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties, and I hold them to that engage- 
               <br />
               ment. This scheme is to unite the whole of 
               <br />
               the British North American Colonies; and 
               <br />
               if the treaty is adopted by the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government, if an Imperial Act is passed 
               <br />
               on the basis of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">réSolutions,</span> and the
