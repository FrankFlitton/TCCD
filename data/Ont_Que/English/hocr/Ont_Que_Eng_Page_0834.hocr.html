               put an end to already. In consequence of 
               <br />
               the state of the currency, many of the best 
               <br />
               interests of this country have been injured, 
               <br />

               What much greater injury can befall us, 
               <br />
               by the abrogation of the Reciprocity treaty,

               than that we now suffer through the de-

               <br />
               the repeal ol the Reciprocity treaty being 
               <br />
               a great calamity, it will lead to an agitation 
               <br />
               for organic changes which cannot fail to be 
               <br />
               of the greatest advantages to the future 
               <br />
               prosperity of the country. For my part I do 
               <br />
               not at all like the idea of a document of that 
               <br />
               kind, emanating from our Canadian Govern— 
               <br />
               ment, falling into the hands of the American 
               <br />
               people, and leading them to believe that 
               <br />
               in our estimation the repeal by them of the 
               <br />
               Reciprocity treaty would be calamitous to 
               <br />
               this country. (Hear, hear.) I repeat that 
               <br />
               I do not believe that the abrogation of that 
               <br />
               treaty will eventually be detrimental to our 
               <br />
               interests. It is true that we may snﬁ'er for 
               <br />
               four or ﬁve years, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffer</span> greatly, but we 
               <br />
               will be thrown upon our own resources, and 
               <br />
               ultimately become strong and self-reliant. 
               <br />
               Our merchants will no longer be denied an 
               <br />
               outlet to the ocean during ﬁve or six months 
               <br />
               in the year, except by the favor or forbearance 
               <br />
               of our Yankee neighbors. Let us put our 
               <br />
               hands into our pockets to build this Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway, and we will be opening a 
               <br />
               way to the ocean to our merchants and our 
               <br />
               farmers for shipping their products over 
               <br />
               their own territory. And when we are in 
               <br />
               that position, we shall be able to say to the 
               <br />
               people of the United States—“ You shall no 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁts of our ﬁsheries—we will close the naviga- 
               <br />
               tion of our canals a ainst you—and we will 
               <br />
               cease to permit, wit out the payment of a 
               <br />
               heavy duty, the importation into this country 
               <br />
               of your coarse grains for the supply of our 
               <br />
               distillers and brewers.“ And, sir, when it is 
               <br />
               stated that the importations of these grains 
               <br />
               have amounted to nearly two millions of 
               <br />
               bushels annually, it will be seen that after 
               <br />
               all the reciprocity is not altogether on one 
               <br />
               side. Hear, hear.) I think that they will

               then ac nowledge it will be better lor them 
               <br />
