               was said that the term of Parliament there 
               <br />

               he doubted whether the general election would

               unknown to the people. Under some pres-

               stand of it ?—-little or nothing. It had been 
               <br />
               said that if the scheme were not adopted new 
               <br />
               it would be in danger; but would it not keep 
               <br />
               good for a little while ? Was it feared that 
               <br />
               the peeple would ﬁnd out that it would 
               <br />

               not known to the people, he would vote against 
               <br />
               it. When the details came to be discussed, 
               <br />
               he believed some of them would not be ap- 
               <br />
               ved; and he also thought that the project 
               <br />
               not embrace all the provisions which it 
               <br />
               should embrace. Finally, he thought the 
               <br />
               Government should not set its face against 
               <br />

               <br />
