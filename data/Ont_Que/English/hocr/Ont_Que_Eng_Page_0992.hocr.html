               MR. M. C. CAMERON said—I have great 
               <br />
               pleasure, sir, in seconding the resolution 
               <br />
               which is now before the House, because I 
               <br />
               think it is very desirable that before any 
               <br />
               such a change as that which is. proposed 
               <br />
               should go into effect, the people, who are to 
               <br />
               be affected by the change, should have an 
               <br />
               opportunity of pronouncing upon it in a 
               <br />
               more decisive way than they can through 
               <br />
               their representatives in this House, who 
               <br />
               have been sent here for an entirely different 
               <br />
               purpose than that of making a change in the 
               <br />
               Constitution. It would not signify to me if 
               <br />
               the circumstances attending the union of 
               <br />
               Scotland with England, or of Ireland with 
               <br />
               England, had furnished no reason for con- 
               <br />
               tending that an appeal to the people was 
               <br />
               proper. They were entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from 
               <br />
               those under which we are existing. If there 
               <br />
               had been no precedents whatever, I say that 
               <br />
               at this enlightened day, when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> peeple 
               <br />

               management of their own aﬂ‘airs, no such a 
               <br />
               change as this should take place with- 
               <br />
               out their having a voice in it I do 
               <br />
               not feel, with the proposer of this resolu- 
               <br />
               tion, that it is absolutely necessary that 
               <br />
               a dissolution of this House should take 
               <br />
               place for the purpose of obtaining au expres- 
               <br />
               sion of the popular will. I do not see why 
               <br />
               the taking of a direct vote—yea and nay-— 
               <br />
