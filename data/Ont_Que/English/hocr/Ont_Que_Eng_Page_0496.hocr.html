               members of this House are well aware of the 
               <br />
               means used by the opponents of Confederation 
               <br />

               small, nay very small, minorities of the elect-

               ors; and to cite only one example, I shall take 
               <br />
               the case of the county of Hochelaga, in 
               <br />
               which the votes are about 2,400 in number. 
               <br />
               The friends of the honorable member for 
               <br />
               that county, without any previous notice, 
               <br />
               proceeded on a certain Sunday in the mouth 
               <br />
               of January last to one of the parishes of that 
               <br />
               county, being that of Sault-au-Récollet, 
               <br />
               which contains about three hundred voters. 
               <br />
               There they thundered out their anathemas 
               <br />
               against Confederation, as being subversive of 
               <br />
               religion, intended to crush the clergy, and 
               <br />
               ruin the people, ﬁnishing with an appeal to 
               <br />
               the patriotism of their audience and entree- 
               <br />
               ties that the would raise their voices against 
               <br />
               so objections le a measure. Next day we read 
               <br />
               in the Opposition papers: “ In the county of
