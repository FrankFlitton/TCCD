               claims that he has accomplished a great 
               <br />

               <br />
               him on that point. I assert that, instead of

               having gained for the Upper Province that 
               <br />
               boon, he has arrayed thirty additional votes

               against Upper Canada. He makes Upper 
               <br />
               Canada stand not as she is now, but with 
               <br />
               thirty additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">voices</span> to contend against.

               proportion, in fact, that we paid before to 
               <br />
               the whole revenue of the country. Let us 
               <br />
               see it“ I am singular in this view—let us see

               whether the gentlemen who compose the

               governments in the Lower Provinces do not 
               <br />
               entertain the same opinion. Hon. Mr. TILLEY

               made this representation in a speech which 
               <br />

               So close is the contest between parties in the

               by population was agitated, so far as Upper 
               <br />
               Canada is concerned, because we are paying

               so large a proportion of the revenue of the 
               <br />
               country; and should the Lower Provinces 
               <br />
               have a corresponding voice, we should still 
               <br />
               pay the same proportion of revenue—instead, 
               <br />

               the honorable gentleman quoted from a

               MB. CAMERON—I will give you a

               practical illustration of how this may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> 
               <br />
               our interest. It is a part of this scheme, or

               ought to have been a part of it, that the 
               <br />
               opening up of the N orth-West should he in- 
               <br />
               cluded in it; that improvements should be 
               <br />
               made in that direction so that we might have 
               <br />
               the advantage of the vast mineral wealth which 
               <br />
               exists there, and of the great stretch of

               territory available for agricultural purposes

               part of the Constitution—a necessity without 
               <br />
               which the scheme cannot go on. Now, 
               <br />
               suppose we ask in the Federal Legislature 
               <br />
               for the improvement of the North-West, 
               <br />
               because we consider it— for our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter-estate</span>

               have that territory opened up and improved,
