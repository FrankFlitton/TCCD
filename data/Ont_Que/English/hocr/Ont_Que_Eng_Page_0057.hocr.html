               <br />
               It is provided in the Constitution that in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst selections for the Council, regard

               <br />
               appears to me, is a wise provision. In all the

               provinces, except Prince Edward, there are 
               <br />
               gentlemen who hold commissions for the 
               <br />
               Upper House for life. In Canada, there are 
               <br />
               a number who hold under that commission ; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> but the majority of them hold by a com-

               mission, not, perhaps, from a monarchical 
               <br />
               point of view so honorable, because the 
               <br />
               Queen is the fountain of honor,—but still, 
               <br />
               as holding their appointment from the 
               <br />
               people, they may be considered as standing 
               <br />
               on a par with those who have Her Majesty’s 
               <br />
               commission. There can be no reason suggest- 
               <br />
               ed why those who have had experience in 
               <br />
               legislation, whether they hold their positions 
               <br />
               by the election of the people or have received 
               <br />
               preferment from the Crown—there is no 
               <br />
               valid reason why those men should be passed 
               <br />

               principle of representation by pepulation

               has been provided for in a manner equally

               ingenious and simple. The introduction of 
               <br />

               until, with the increasing population, it

               turn—that province being the best suited for 
               <br />

               tively permanent character of its population, 
               <br />
               and from its having neither the largest nor 
               <br />
               least number of inhabitants—we have been 
               <br />
               enabled to overcome the difﬁculty I have 
               <br />
               mentioned. We have introduced the system 
               <br />
               of representation by population without the 
               <br />
               danger of an inconvenient increase in the 
               <br />
               number of representatives on the recurrence 
               <br />
               of each decennial period. The whole' thing 
               <br />
               is worked by a simple rule of three. For 
               <br />
               instance, we have in Upper Canada 1,400,000 
               <br />
               of a population ; in Lower Canada 1,100,000. 
               <br />
               Now, the proposition is simply this—if Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, with its po ulation of 1,100,000, has 
               <br />
               a right to 65 mem ers, how many members 
               <br />
               should Upper Canada have, with its larger 
               <br />
               population of 1,400,000? The same rule 
               <br />
               applies to the other provinces—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proper-</span> 
               <br />
               tion is always observed and the principle of 
               <br />
               representation by population carried out, 
               <br />
               while, at the same time, there will not be 
               <br />
               deeennially an inconvenient increase in the 
               <br />
               numbers of the Lower House. At the same 
               <br />
               time, there is a constitutional provision that 
               <br />
               hereafter, if deemed advisable, the total 
               <br />
               number of representatives may be increased 
               <br />
               from 194, the number ﬁxed in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               instance. In that case, if an increase is 
               <br />
               made, Lower Canada is still to remain the 
               <br />
               pivot on which the whole calculation will 
               <br />
               turn. If Lower Canada, instead of sixty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve, shall have seventy members, then the 
               <br />
               calculation will be, if Lower Canada has 
               <br />
               seventy members, with such a population, 
               <br />
