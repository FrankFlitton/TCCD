               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It is all very well for the

               honorable member for North Ontario to 
               <br />

               of a legislative union, with local legislation

               <br />
               that side of the House, and not on this. It 
               <br />
               is the duty of the Government, who are re- 
               <br />
               sponsible to Parliament and to the people, to 
               <br />
               propose their measures, and if the honorable 
               <br />
               gentleman can convince the House that those 
               <br />
               measures are not adapted to the circumstances 
               <br />
               and interests of the country, we shall be 
               <br />
               obliged to leave this side of the House, and 
               <br />
               then the honorable gentleman from North 
               <br />
               Ontario can come over here and submit his 
               <br />
               scheme to Parliament. (Hear, hear.) But 
               <br />
               as we are here, and have taken it upon us to

               <br />
               this House. The outcry raised by gentlemen

               opposite against the propositions of the Gov-

               <br />
               the whole time of the House to it, roves 
               <br />
               that delay is their real object. If they have 
               <br />
               any arguments to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> against the scheme, 
               <br />
               they have had ample opportunity to present 
               <br />
               them. They have thought preper to talk of 
               <br />
               everything but the merits or demerits of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and I think also of the country, is exhausted.

               tained from doing so, especially in view of 
               <br />
               circumstances that have arisen on this as well
