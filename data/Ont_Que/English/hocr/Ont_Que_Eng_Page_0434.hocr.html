               <br />
               my lords, a most interesting contemplation that 
               <br />
               that project has arisen and has been approved by 
               <br />
               Her Majesty’s Government. It is certainly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con.</span> 
               <br />
               trary to what might be considered the old 
               <br />
               maxime of government in connection with the 
               <br />
               colonies, that we should here express, and that 
               <br />
               the Crown itself should express satisfaction at a 
               <br />
               … which tends to bind together in almost in- 
               <br />
               dependent wer our colonies in North America. 
               <br />
               We do still believe that though thus banded 
               <br />
               together they will recognize the value of British 
               <br />
               connection, and that while they will be safer in 
               <br />
               this amalgamation we shall be as safe in their

               <br />
               require much prudent consideration and great at- 
               <br />
               tention to revent susceptibilities. It will have 
               <br />
               todeal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> several British provinces, but with a 
               <br />
               race almost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foreign</span> in their habits and origin. I 
               <br />
               do ho it will u timately succeed, and that the 
               <br />

               <br />
               tegral North British American empire will have 
               <br />
               as much security and happiness as they can 
               <br />
               attain. 
               <br />
               Those who say that the people throughout 
               <br />
               the country are op d to this measure, I am 
               <br />
               satisﬁed, know very little what the sentiment 
               <br />
               of the country is. I believe there is a deep- 
               <br />
               rcoted sentiment of approbation of the steps 
               <br />
               that have been taken. I know that those 
               <br />
               who are perhaps most fearful with reference 
               <br />
               to it, and whose interests are perhaps most in 
               <br />
               jeopardy—the English speaking minority in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada—have considered it carefully, 
               <br />
               and with all their prejudices against it at the 
               <br />
               outset, are now warmly in its favor. I speak 
               <br />
               particularly of those who have rest interests 
               <br />
               at stake in the community whic I represent 
               <br />
               —the great and varied interests of commerce,

               trade, banking, manufactures and material 
               <br />

               <br />
               and there are none more competent in the 
               <br />
               province—have considered the scheme in a 
               <br />
               calm and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">businem—like</span> way, and have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deliber.</span>

               in carrying out the roject. I believe the 
               <br />
               question of preparing or the defence of this 
               <br />
               country is an imminent one. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               There is not, I repeat, a day or an hour to be 
               <br />
               lost, and I believe that if this country is put 
               <br />
               into a proper condition of defence, the union 
               <br />
               will be the best safeguard we can have. If 
               <br />
               our neighbors see that we have the means of 
               <br />
               causing them to sit down on our frontier and 
               <br />
               spend a summer before they can hope to make 
               <br />
               any impression upon the country, we will then 
               <br />
               be in a pretty good condition to defend our- 
               <br />
               selves. I trust that the blessings of peace 
               <br />
               ma longbe preserved to us, that the good 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feefing</span> which ought to subsist between Can- 
               <br />
               ada and the United States may never be in- 
               <br />
               terrupted; that two kindred nations which 
               <br />
               have so many ties, so many interests, and so 
               <br />
               many associations in common, may never be- 
               <br />
               come enemies,and I think that we ought to make 
               <br />
               every honorable concession in order to avert 
               <br />
               the calamities of war. No man can a pre- 
               <br />
               ciate the blessings of peace more than do, 
               <br />
               and no one is more alive to the horrors of war 
               <br />
               than I am. But at the same time we cannot 
               <br />
               conceal from ourselves the fact that within 
               <br />
               the last three or four years we have sev- 
               <br />
               eral times been scriousl threatened. It 
               <br />
               is not in the power any man to say 
               <br />
               when the cloud, which so darkly over- 
               <br />
               shadows us, may burst in full fury on our 
               <br />
               heads, and those who have the direction of 
               <br />
               the destinies of this country ought to be pre- 
               <br />
               pared to do all that in them lies to lace it in 
               <br />
               a position to meet that event. e cannot 
               <br />
               recede from the position we have assumed. 
               <br />
               We cannot go back, we must go forward; 
               <br />
               and it is certain to my mind that if what has 
               <br />
               now been undertaken is not consummated, we 
               <br />
               will regret it in years to come. I have but to 
               <br />
               add one word more, and I must apologize to 
               <br />
               the House for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;me</span> I have already occu- 
               <br />
               pied. (Cries of “Go on.”) I am afraid I 
               <br />
               have very much transgressed the limits'I had 
               <br />
               assigned to myself. There is but one point 
               <br />
               more, and I have done. My honorable friend 
               <br />
               opposite (Hon. Mr. DOBION) says that this 
               <br />
               scheme is ing to ruin us ﬁnancially—that it 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnauciîy</span> unfair. But he has failed to 
               <br />
               point out in what feature this can be regarded 
               <br />
               as ﬁnancially injurious to any particular sec- 
               <br />
               tion. There can be nothing fairer to my 
               <br />
               mind than that, in forming a partnership be- 
               <br />
               tween these ﬁve provinces, the amount of the 
               <br />
               debt should be equalised at the time the part- 
               <br />
               nership is formed, and that whatever one is 
               <br />
               short should be made up by an annual grant 
               <br />
               to the other, not an increasing one but a ﬁxed 
               <br />
