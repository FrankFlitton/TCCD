               that honorable gentleman gave as a reason for 
               <br />
               its apparent success, that Switzerland was

               I think, on the other hand, that the reason

               assigned would be the very cause of a failure 
               <br />

               <br />
               an evidence to my mind that the Federal sys-

               <br />
               greatness by which it would be attended. 
               <br />
               At the time of the union Scotland had only a 
               <br />
               revenue of £150,000 per annum, and last

               nearly £7,000,000. (Hear, hear. This,
