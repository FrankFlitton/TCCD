               <br />
               earlier period of our history, it would have been 
               <br />
               so regarded. 
               <br />
               When such views are held in England, when 
               <br />
               so strong a desire is manifested in Canada to 
               <br />
               maintain our connectiJn with England, and 
               <br />
               to remain under the sheltering folds of that

               <br />

               Mn. CARTWRIGHT, said—Mr. SPEAK- 
               <br />
               ER, the turn which this debate has assumed 
               <br />
               of late is somewhat remarkable. Up to a 
               <br />
               very recent period, hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               have dwelt chieﬂy on the extreme—I think 
               <br />
               they even said the indecent—haste with 
               <br />
               which this project has been pushed forward. 
               <br />
               They have asserted that this scheme was the 
               <br />
               sole, the only bond of union between the 
               <br />
               members of the present Ministry, and fur- 
               <br />
               ther, that so rash, so inconsiderate was their 
               <br />
               eagerness to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ‘ect</span> their end at any cost, 
               <br />
               that they have seriously compromised our 
               <br />
               interests by undue concessions to the remain- 
               <br />
               ing provinces, and notably to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and New Brunswick. Latterly, however, 
               <br />
               the questiOn has assumed a new and different 
               <br />
               phase. It has been discovered that so far 
               <br />
               {ram being a bond- of union, the project of 
               <br />
               Confederation is a mere pretext, a blind to 
               <br />
               cover their predetermination to maintain 
               <br />
               their position at all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hazards.</span> N ow, sir, pass- 
               <br />
               ing over the obvious inconsistency of these 
               <br />
               contradictory accusations, passing over the 
               <br />
               absurdity of calling the Confederation the 
               <br />
               sole bond of union, and yet a sham to cover 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union,}</span> shall have a few words to say

               <br />
               and I believe with a great majority of the 
               <br />
               people of this country, to support honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the Treasury benches, not only 
               <br />

               effecting the extraordinary fusion of parties 
               <br />
               which took lace last summer. Sir, 
               <br />
               it is idle to k of that step as if those 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen were alone responsible 
               <br />
               for their conduct on that occasion. What 
               <br />
               they did was done with the full <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know-</span> 
               <br />
               ledge and consent of their supporters, and 
               <br />
               reﬂects on our honor, if wrong, quite as 
               <br />
               much as on theirs. But, sir, I am very fu 
               <br />
               indeed from admitting that we were wrong. 
               <br />
               I think the reasons which inﬂuenced ul 
               <br />
               then were strong enough to justify us fully; 
               <br />
               those reasons are tenfold stronger now. To 
               <br />
               understand them, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> we need 
               <br />
               only glance at the parliamentary history of 
               <br />
               the last few years, and then ask ourselvœ 
               <br />
               whether any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language</span> is too strong, any 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce too great, to put an end to the state 
               <br />
               of things which prevailed throughout that 
               <br />
               period. But first, sir, let me pause to deal 
               <br />
               with the charge of undue haste. Doubtless 
               <br />
               the rapidity with which these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiation</span> 
               <br />
               have advanced was as remarkable as it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> 
               <br />
               unexpected. I believe there is hardly an 
               <br />
               instance in which a political project of such 
               <br />
               magnitude and delicacy has made such 
               <br />
               astonishing progress in 80 short a time; and 
               <br />
               so far from holding it an objection, so far 
               <br />
               from allowing that this is any evidence that the 
               <br />
               country has been taken by surprise in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meeting</span> 
               <br />
               to this scheme, I hold that it is, on the con- 
               <br />
               trary, the best possible omen of its ultimate 
               <br />
               success, no matter what temporary checks it 
               <br />
               may encounter, because it shows conclusively 
               <br />
               not only how zealously and honestly Minis- 
               <br />
               ters have devoted themselves to the task of 
               <br />
               carrying it into eﬁ'ect, but, which I think of 
               <br />
               even more impôt-tance, because it proves 
               <br />
               how powerfully the events of the last few 
               <br />
               years have contributed to mature men’s 
               <br />
               views on this subject, and shows that, so far 
               <br />
               as this province is concerned, my honorable 
               <br />
               friends are but aiding to carry out a foregone 
               <br />
               conclusion—a conclusion long since arrived 
               <br />
               at by every man among us who desires to 
               <br />
               maintain our independence or our connection 
               <br />
               with the British Crown; that in this, or 
               <br />
               some such scheme as this, lies our best, if 
               <br />
               not our only hope of escaping absorption 
               <br />
               into the great republic which adjoins us. 
               <br />
               Sir, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this,</span> is an argument which perhaps has

               more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weight</span> with me than with some hon.
