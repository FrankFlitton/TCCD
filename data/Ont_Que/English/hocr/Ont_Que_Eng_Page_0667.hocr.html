               that this subject has engaged our anxious 
               <br />
               attention as a Government. The Provincial 
               <br />
               Government has been in continued corres- 
               <br />
               pondence with the Home Government as to the 
               <br />
               best means of organizing an efﬁcient de- 
               <br />
               fence against every hostile pressure, from 
               <br />
               whatever source it may come. And, as this 
               <br />
               House knows, the resolutions themselves 
               <br />
               speak of the defence question as one that 
               <br />
               must immediately en age the attention of 
               <br />
               the Confederation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Väe</span> had hoped that the 
               <br />
               Confederation scheme would have assumed 
               <br />
               such an aspect that the question could have 
               <br />
               been adjudged of as a whole, and that one 
               <br />
               organized system of defence could have been 
               <br />
               arranged between the Federal Government 
               <br />
               and the Imperial Government at an early 
               <br />
               day. But we cannot disguise, nor can we 
               <br />
               close our eyes to the fact that the course of 
               <br />
               events in New Brunswick will prevent an 
               <br />
               early united action among the provinces on 
               <br />
               the subject of defence; and, therefore, that 
               <br />
               question comes up as between Canada and 
               <br />
               England, and we feel that it cannot be post- 
               <br />
               poned. (Hear, hear.) In fact the subject 
               <br />
               has already been postponed quite too long. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) It is time, high time, that it 
               <br />
               was taken up and dealt with in a vigorous 
               <br />
               manner. (Hear, hear.) These are two of 
               <br />
               the reasons which, the Government feel, 
               <br />
               press for a prompt decision of the House 
               <br />
               u nthe resolutions before it. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               T en there is a third reason, which is found 
               <br />
               in the state of the commercial relations exist- 
               <br />
               ing between Canada and the United States. 
               <br />
               The threatened repeal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Reciprocity</span> 
               <br />
               treaty, the hazard of the United States 
               <br />
               doing away with the system of bonding goods 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> transitu, and the unsatisfactory position 
               <br />
               generally of our commercial relations with 
               <br />
               the neighboring country—all this calls for 
               <br />
               immediate action. And the fact of the union 
               <br />
               of these provinces being postponed, and of 
               <br />
               the construction, therefore, of the Intercoln- 
               <br />
               nial Railway being put oﬁ' indeﬁnitely, ren- 
               <br />
               ders this all the more imperative. It is, 
               <br />
               therefore, the intention'of the Government -— 
               <br />
               and they seek the support of this House and 
               <br />
               of the country to the policy which I now 
               <br />
               announce—ﬁrst, to bring this debate to an 
               <br />
               end with all cenvenient speed, with a view 
               <br />
               to having a declaration of the House upon 
               <br />
               the question of Confederation. The Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, to this end, will press for a vote by 
               <br />
               every means which they can properly use. 
               <br />
               Then, secondly, as soon as that is obtained, 
               <br />
               it is the intention of the Government to ask
