               than if it holds its commission from the 
               <br />
               Crown. Besides, it must be remembered that 
               <br />
               an Upper House, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> of which areto 
               <br />
               be appointed for life, would not have the same

               qua ity of permanence as the House of Lords; 
               <br />
               our members would die; strangers would suc-

               the membership and state of opinion in our 
               <br />
               Upper House would always be more rapid 
               <br />
               than in the House of Lords. To show how

               case, as regards life members, I will call 
               <br />
               the attention of the House to the following 
               <br />
               facts :-—At the call of the House, in Febru- 
               <br />
               ary, 1856, forty-two life members responded ; 
               <br />
               two years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afterwards,</span> in 1858, only thirty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve answered to their names; in 1862 there 
               <br />
               were only twenty-ﬁve life members left, and 
               <br />
               in 1864, but twenty-one. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               This shows how speedily changes take place 
               <br />
               in the life membership. But remarkable as 
               <br />
               this change has been, it is not so great as 
               <br />
               that in regard to the elected members. 
               <br />
               Though the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">electivefprinciple</span> only came into 
               <br />
               force in 1856, and although only twelve 
               <br />
               men were elected that year, and twelve more 
               <br />
               every two years since, twenty-four changes 
               <br />
               have already taken place by the dccease of 
               <br />
               members, by the acceptance of oﬁicc, and 
               <br />
               by resignation. So it is quite clear that, 
               <br />
               should there be on any question a difference 
               <br />
               of opinion between the Upper and Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span>
