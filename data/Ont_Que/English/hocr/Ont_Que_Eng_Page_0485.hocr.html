               Great Britain will always extend to us, if we 
               <br />
               show that we on our part are prepared to do 
               <br />
               our duty—I believe that we are in quite as 
               <br />
               good a position to hold our own as those who 
               <br />
               successfully resisted the invader in the war 
               <br />
               of 1812. (Hear, hear.) On this point we 
               <br />
               can take an encouraging lesson from history. 
               <br />
               When the American colonies which now form 
               <br />
               the United States rebelled against Great Brit— 
               <br />
               ain, their population was not over one or two 
               <br />
               hundred thousand in excess of the population 
               <br />
               of the ﬁve colonies that are to form our pro- 
               <br />
               posed Confederation. (Hear, hear.) At 
               <br />
               that time they had certainly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iewer</span> resources 
               <br />
               in every respect than the people of this coun- 
               <br />
               try now possess, and yet they resisted, and 
               <br />
               successfully resisted, one of the greatest 
               <br />
               powers in the world, and wrested from it 
               <br />
               their independence. Here, in the event of 
               <br />
               an attack, we are placed in a precisely similar 
               <br />
               position. One man in this country is equal 
               <br />
               to three invaders. (Hear, hear.) It has been 
               <br />
               demonstrated in the struggle now pending 
               <br />
               between the North and the South, that on 
               <br />
               account of the difﬁculties the country attacked 
               <br />
               presents to the enemy, and the advantages it 
               <br />
               gives to those defending it, one man is equal 
               <br />
               to three in resisting an invading army. The 
               <br />
               South—although they have been blockaded 
               <br />
               on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sea-cost—although</span> they have had an 
               <br />
               immense extent of frontier to defend—al- 
               <br />
               though the have had the internal weakness 
               <br />
               of four millions of slaves to contend with— 
               <br />
               and although the white population is little 
               <br />
               more than that now possessed by the provin- 
               <br />
               ces which are to form this Confederation; 
               <br />
               have nevertheless resisted for four years—I 
               <br />
               may say successfully—all the power and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-i</span> 
               <br />
               ﬁuence and available resources which the 
               <br />
               United States have been able to bring against 
               <br />
               them. Hear, hear.) I sincerely trust and 
               <br />
               pray, an it should be the desire of every true 
               <br />
               Canadian, that we may continue in peace; but 
               <br />
               to say that it is impossible for us to contend 
               <br />
               against a force that may be brought against 
               <br />
               us, is to say that from which I for one must 
               <br />
               dissent. (Hear, hear.) Now, sir, I believe 
               <br />
               that in a commercial, agricultural, and defen- 
               <br />
               sive point of view, the union would be desir- 
               <br />
               able. Placed as we are now, with the abro-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">âation</span> of the Reciprocity treaty threatened, 
               <br />
               oes it not become our duty, I ask, to make 
               <br />
               some effort to change and improve our condi- 
               <br />
               dition? As I stated, sir, the subject has 
               <br />

               the whole of British North America, to which

               I would for a moment invite the attention of 
               <br />
               the House. The union is desirable with a

               view to the development of our mineral re- 
               <br />
               sources. In British Columbia and Vancou- 
               <br />
               ver’s Island the gold ﬁelds equal, if they do 
               <br />
               not exceed in value, these of any other 
               <br />
               part of the world. Iron we have in that 
               <br />
               vast extent of country lying between the 
               <br />
               Rocky Mountains and Lake Superior, a 
               <br />
               country equal if not superior, for the purposes 
               <br />
               of settlement and cultivation to any we 
               <br />
               have in Canada, and whose area is esti- 
               <br />
               mated at from eighty to one hundred million 
               <br />
               acres. Then, again, we have magniﬁcent iron 
               <br />
               and copper mines in Canada, while the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces possess vast mineral resources, ex- 
               <br />
               tensive coal ﬁelds, and valuable ﬁsheries. We 
               <br />
               have all the natural wealth to make us a great 
               <br />
               peeple if we pursue a course to develope it. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) To illustrate my argument. I 
               <br />
               will mention some of the ﬁgures showing the 
               <br />
               resources of the different countries adjacent 
               <br />
               to and forming part of that great district, with 
               <br />
               an identity of interest. Hear, hear.) In 
               <br />
               Nevada, in 1860, the pepu ation was 6,857, 
               <br />
               and in 1863, 60,000. About eleven millions 
               <br />
               of dollars have been invested in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opening</span> 
               <br />
               up of roads and in other improvements, an 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               the resources of the country in 1863 amounted 
               <br />
               to $15,000,000. Victoria, in Australia, in 
               <br />
               1861, had a population of 540,322, and they 
               <br />
               have constructed 350 miles of railway. The 
               <br />
               revenue was $15,000,000, and they have their 
               <br />
               magniﬁcent cities and splendid homesteads, 
               <br />
               with every comfort and luxury. In Utah, 
               <br />
               where perhaps there are many difﬁculties to 
               <br />
               retard the growth of the country, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that in 1860 the population was 41,000—an 
               <br />
               increase in ten years of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">254</span> per cent. The 
               <br />
               value of property in 1850 was $986,000, and 
               <br />
               ten years afterwards, in 1860, it was ﬁve and 
               <br />
               a half millions—an increase in this period of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">468</span> per cent. Iron and copper mines have 
               <br />
               been more developed in that territory than 
               <br />
               gold, although they possess gold as well. In 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">186}</span> the population was estimated at 75,000. 
               <br />
               Colorado has a population of 60,000, and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               millions of dollars. Agriculture also is
