               <br />
               taken a most extraordinary turn. At ﬁrst,

               honorable members addressed the House in 
               <br />

               Government more especially, and then some 
               <br />
               honorable gentlemen supporting them ; but 
               <br />
               latterly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wezhave</span> heard several honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen expressing their views very stron ly and 
               <br />
               emphatically against many of the reso utions 
               <br />
               embraced in the scheme of Confederation, but 
               <br />
               while expressing themselves so strongly, they 
               <br />
               seemed to feel it to be their duty to support 
               <br />
               it as a whole. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heu.)</span> Now, it strikes 
               <br />
               me, and I trust it will strike some other hon- 
               <br />
               orable members, also, that we have been 
               <br />
               elected to this Legislature with a view to

               position that may properly come before it.

               If we have views on a particular measure 
               <br />
               which would lead us to propose amendments

               have no right to dispute or alter any portion 
               <br />
               of it. For my part, I look upon the scheme 
               <br />
               now before the House as upon the whole very 
               <br />
               diﬂ'erent from what we had a right to expect 
               <br />
               from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> of the present Government. 
               <br />
               They have been strongly supported in both 
               <br />
               Houses of Parliament and in the country, 
               <br />
               and I do not desire to see an difﬁculty thrown 
               <br />
               in their way, or anythin one calculated to 
               <br />
               lessen their support in t e Legislature; but 
               <br />
               at the same time I do say that, with the sup- 
               <br />
               port and conﬁdence they have received, they 
               <br />
               ought to have brought forward a better scheme 
               <br />
               than that which they have presented to the 
               <br />
               House and country. Why, take the uestion 
               <br />
               of the Intercolonial Railroad involved in these 
               <br />
               resolutions, and what do we ﬁnd ? More than 
               <br />
               two years ago the governments of the provin- 
               <br />
               ces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia made 
               <br />
               a proposition to the Canadian Government to 
               <br />
               build this road and pay seven-twelfths of 
               <br />
               the cost, Canada to pay the remaining ﬁve- 
               <br />
               twelfths. Well, what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arranrrement</span> have we 
               <br />
               now—what has time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bmught</span> about—what 
               <br />
               advau s have these two years gained for 
               <br />
               us? T is, that the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               come down to the Legislature with a scheme 
               <br />
               according to which Canada will have to pay 
               <br />
               towards the construction of this road mne- 
               <br />
               twelfths of the entire amount, and the other 
               <br />
               provinces the balance—thus involving addi- 
               <br />
               tional ex use on the part of Canada to the 
               <br />
               amount 0 several millions of dollars—certainly 
               <br />
               not less than six millions to build the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway alone—more than was de- 
               <br />
               manded of us two are ago—and a total 
               <br />
               additional expenditure that will add to the 
               <br />
               annual taxation of Canada more than a mil- 
               <br />
               lion and a half of dollars for all 'time to come. 
               <br />
               This heavy expenditure over the proposition 
               <br />
               made two years ago has, therefore, been need- 
               <br />
               lessly undertaken. It is admitted, even by 
               <br />
               the promoters of this scheme, that the east- 
               <br />
               ern provinces will beneﬁt far more largely 
               <br />
               than Canada by the construction of the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway. It is admitted by the best 
               <br />
               commercial men who have spoken upon the 
               <br />
               subject, that as a commercial undertaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> 
               <br />
               will not pay. It is admitted that it will be 
               <br />
               of little or no value whatever as a defensive 
               <br />
               work. This being the case, why then rush 
               <br />
               into this large expenditure with such precipi- 
               <br />
               tancy ; why not, at least, postpone its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pesage</span> 
               <br />
               in order to get a measure of a more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rfect</span> 
               <br />
               character, and one more in harmony vnth the
