               Every danger of false interpretation ought to 
               <br />
               be removed from these resolutions. If, as it is 
               <br />
               stated, our language is to be fully protected 
               <br />
               under the new system, I do not see why it is 
               <br />
               not so stated clearly in the Constitution. 
               <br />
               The explanations of the Honorable Solicitor

               <br />

               <br />
               sufﬁcient, and I should much prefer a written 
               <br />
               statement in the Constitution itself, formally 
               <br />
               setting forth that these matters shall not be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affected</span> by any legislation of the Federal

               English members of this House will not take 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offence</span> at my insisting on more am e gua-

               tions, and that they will see that it is not

               through a spirit of hostility to their institu-

               Hos. SOL. GEN. LANGEVIN—Will my 
               <br />
               honorable friend allow me to say a few words 
               <br />
               in explanation ? He said he hoped the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment and members on this side of the House 
               <br />
               would admit that his desire was to defend the 
               <br />
               religious and national interests of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. The honorable member for Vercheres 
               <br />
               need not be uneasy on that point. For it 
               <br />
               must always be taken for granted—and every 
               <br />
               member on this side of the House will agree 
               <br />
               with me in this—that eve sentiment ex- 
               <br />
               pressed on the ﬂoor of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> by honor- 
               <br />
               able gentlemen opposite, relative to those ques- 
               <br />
               tions touching our nationality and our re- 
               <br />
               ligion, is frank and sincere, and we, therefore, 
               <br />
               feel that in expressing himself as he has done, 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Vercheres is per- 
               <br />
               fectly frank and sincere. However, I take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               liberty of answering him on two points. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst question is that of marriage. The hon— 
               <br />
               orable member did not quote the whole of 
               <br />
               that portion of my speech which relates to 
               <br />
               marriage; he simply quoted the ﬁrst part, 
               <br />
               but he ought to have given the second, which 
               <br />
               18 as follows :— 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The fact is that the whole matter amounts to 
               <br />
               this- the Central Government may decide that 
               <br />
               any marria contracted in Upper Canada or in 
               <br />

               <br />
               with the laws of the country in which it was con- 
               <br />
               tracted, although that law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be diﬂ‘erent from 
               <br />
               ours, shouldbe deemed vali in Lower Canada, 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               in case the parties should come to reside <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there,</span> 
               <br />
               and vice versa. 
               <br />
               This was merely a development of what I 
               <br />
               said. I stated before that the interpretation 
               <br />
               I had given of the word “marriage” was 
               <br />
               that of the Government and of the Conference 
               <br />
               of Quebec, and that we wished the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion to be drafted in that sense. The honor- 
               <br />
               able member for Vercheres quoted that part 
               <br />
               of the draft of the civil code which states 
               <br />
               that one of the articles provides that a mar- 
               <br />
               riage contracted in any country whatever, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the laws of the country in which it 
               <br />
               shall have been contracted, shall be valid, and 
               <br />
               he argues from that, that since it was declared 
               <br />
               by the civil code, there was no necessity for 
               <br />
               inserting it in the resolutions. But the hon- 
               <br />
               orable member must be aware that that part 
               <br />
               of the code may be repealed at any time, and 
               <br />
               that if this occurred, parties married under 
               <br />
               the circumstances referred to would no lon er 
               <br />
               enjoy the protection they now have and which 
               <br />
               we desire to secure for them under the Con- 
               <br />
               stitution. I maintain, then, that it was abso- 
               <br />
               lutely necessary to insert the word “ mar- 
               <br />
               riage” as it has been inserted, in the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, and that it has no other meaning than 
               <br />
               the meaning I attributed to it in the name 
               <br />
               of the Government and of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference.</span> 
               <br />
               Thus the honorable member for Vercheres had 
               <br />
               no ounds for asserting that the Federal 
               <br />
               islature might change that pa rt of the 
               <br />
               civrl code which determines the age at 
               <br />
               which marriage can be contracted without the 
               <br />
               consent of parents. Another int on which 
               <br />
               the honorable member for Vercheres insisted, 
               <br />
               no doubt with the view of obtaining in- _ 
               <br />
               formation, which I shall be delighted to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span> if it should induce him to vote for the 
               <br />
               resolutions—and I am perfectly certain it 
               <br />
               ought to be sufﬁcient—is the point as to the 
               <br />
               use of the French language under Con- 
               <br />
