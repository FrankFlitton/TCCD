               also said that, in time past, although there 
               <br />
               has not been an open hostility to the educa- 
               <br />
               tion or' the Protestant minority, there has 
               <br />
               been a very decided under-hand obstructive- 
               <br />
               ness. This is stated by gentlemen who have 
               <br />
               taken a particular interest in the matter, and 
               <br />
               who, I am conﬁdent, would not make such 
               <br />
               a statement if they did not think it to 
               <br />
               be the case. And I must say, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for.</span> my 
               <br />
               own part, that I do think the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority have some grounds for this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fear.</span> 
               <br />
               And this is my reason: the religious faith 
               <br />
               of the majority in Lower Canada is, as we 
               <br />
               know, Roman Catholic, and they receive 
               <br />
               from the head of the Romish Church their 
               <br />
               inspiration ; they are guided by the prin- 
               <br />
               ciples that are laid down, and that are from 
               <br />
               time to time publicly promulgated by the 
               <br />
               head of that Church. New, I do not think 
               <br />
               that my Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen 
               <br />
               can be surprised—and I would ask their 
               <br />
               attention to what I am saying, I desire to 
               <br />
               speak honestly, but, of course, courteously— 
               <br />
               I do not think they can be surprised at these 
               <br />
               suspicious and fears of their Protestant 
               <br />
               brethren. And why? Because they must 
               <br />
               themselves be aware what are the principles 
               <br />

               “that emigrants to Catholic countries

               <br />
               one more anxious than myself to avoid

               anything like religious discussion in this

               every man to speak honestly. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I have said that the Protestant minority in

               Lower Canada fear lest they should not have 
               <br />

               <br />
               everything is shaped according to the wishes 
               <br />
               of that body. They know that that hier- 
               <br />
               archy receives its inspiration from Rome, 
               <br />
               and within the last few weeks we ﬁnd what 
               <br />
               is the character of that inspiration. (Re- 
               <br />
               newed murmurs of disapprobation.) N ow I 
               <br />
               ask my Roman Catholic friends to consider 
               <br />
               this candidly. When there comes from the 
               <br />
               Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               Church, a letter clothed with all the autho- 
               <br />
               rity that we know the French Canadians 
               <br />
               attribute to that source, and when we have 
               <br />
               it declared here that it is an error to 
               <br />
               say that in some countries called Catho- 
               <br />
               lic, emigrants should enjoy the free 
               <br />
               exercise of their own worship—(Hear! 
               <br />
               hear !)—I hear some of my honorable 
               <br />
               friends say “ Hear, hear,” in rather a jeering 
               <br />
               tone. But I ask you to think honestly 
               <br />
               about it. Suppose _it were possible for the 
               <br />
               Protestants of Canada to speak in a manner 
               <br />
               similar to that in which the head of the 
               <br />
               Romish Church has spoken, and that we 
               <br />
               were to declare it to be a principle that 
               <br />
               should guide us, that we ought not give to 
               <br />
               those who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘ered</span> from us the freedom of 
               <br />
               religious worship, would not the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics in Upper Canada have good reason 
               <br />
               to be alarmed ? Now, I ask you to do me 
               <br />
               the justice, my hon. friends, to think of it 
               <br />
               in a just light, and not in the light of an 
               <br />
               attack upon your religion. I ask you to 
               <br />
               think of it fairly, especially at such a time 
               <br />
               as this, when the Protestants of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada are called to put themselves into the 
               <br />
               power of the Roman Catholic hierarchy; for 
               <br />
               I believe it is simply tantamount to that. I 
               <br />
               ask you to think what must be their feelings 
               <br />
               when they read, as emanating from the head 
               <br />
               and ruler of the Bomish hierarchy, such a
