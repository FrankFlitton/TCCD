               Then the Federal Government will have

               the right of settling questions of divorce

               and marriage. With respect to divorce I

               shall make no remarks, because I think it 
               <br />
               best that the decision of such questions 
               <br />

               ject of marriage—the basis of all our

               <br />
               at the mercy of the Federal Government? 
               <br />
               We shall soon be told probably that it is but 
               <br />
               a sounding affair, and before long, mayors 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">based</span> on the Roman law. These are the 
               <br />
               only laws suitable to Canadians, and the wise 
               <br />
               provisions characterizing them were the fruit 
               <br />
               of the experience of several ages. We 
               <br />
               should not incur the risk of any change in 
               <br />
               them by a legislature, the majority of whose 
               <br />
               members do not hold our Opinions on this 
               <br />
               subject. The hon. member (Hon. Sir N. F. 
               <br />
               BELLEAU) might have favored uswith his 
               <br />
               opinion on this head, but he did not, and I 
               <br />
               regret that he did not. There is another 
               <br />
               question deeply interesting to Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               but it seems that on that neither must we 
               <br />
               permit ourselves to speak. That question 
               <br />
               relates to the interest of money. Do we 
               <br />
               not know that the question of the rate of 
               <br />
               interest has something to do with our civil 
               <br />
               laws? Is that also of no importance? An 
               <br />
               Upper Canada majority has already sad- 
               <br />
               dled us with a law abolishing the rate of 
               <br />
               interest. Free trade in money was not 
               <br />
               suitable to Lower Canada, and the right of 
               <br />
               legislating on the question is now sought to 
               <br />
               be entrusted to the Federal Government. 
               <br />
               What will be the result? Who will assure 
               <br />
               us that the law limiting the rate of interest 
               <br />
               will not be repealed as it respects all cases, 
               <br />
               and that banks and corporations will not be 
               <br />
               allowed to exact such rates of interest as 
               <br />
               they may think ﬁt, as private persons may 
               <br />
               now. This might become the fate of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. Why not allow the local legislatures 
               <br />
               to regulate the question according to the 
               <br />
               exigencies and the ideas of communities 
               <br />
               which they represent, as the same is now 
               <br />
               ﬁxed and decided in the United States, where 
               <br />
               the rate of interest varies in the several 
               <br />
               states? Thus Lower Canada will be pre- 
               <br />
               vented from regulating a question which has 
               <br />
               been decided for us by Upper Canada against 
               <br />

               our wishes. I confess that I am surprised 
               <br />
               at this, because I see in the present Admin- 
               <br />
               istration men who have done battle at my 
               <br />
               side on that very question. The local legis- 
               <br />
               latures will have the power of making laws 
               <br />
               on the subjects of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immigration</span> and agricul- 
               <br />
               ture; but the Federal egislature will have 
               <br />
               the same pow er, and it is evident that it will 
               <br />
               have the upper hand on these matters; that 
               <br />
               the laws of Lower Canada, for instance, may 
               <br />
               be overridden by means of the veto of the 
               <br />
               Federal Government. But there is some- 
               <br />
               thing yet more fraught with danger for us. 
               <br />
               The Federal Government will have the right 
               <br />
               of imposing taxes on the lprovinces without 
               <br />
               the concurrence of the coal governments. 
               <br />
               Under article ﬁve of the 29th resolution, the 
               <br />
               Federal Government may raise moneys by 
               <br />
               all modes or systems of taxation, and I look 
               <br />
               upon this power as most excessive. Thus, 
               <br />
               in case it should happen, as I said a moment 
               <br />
               ago, that the Lower Canada Government 
               <br />
               refused to undertake the payment of the debt 
               <br />
               contracted for the redemption of the Seig- 
               <br />
               niorial Tenure, the Federal Government 
               <br />
               would have two methods of compelling it to 
               <br />
               do so. First, by retaining the amount out 
               <br />
               of the eighty cents per head indemnity to 
               <br />
               be accorded to the Local Government, and 
               <br />
               secondly, by imposing a local and direct 
               <br />
               tax. The Lieutenant Governor of the Local 
               <br />
               Government will be appointed by the Federal 
               <br />
               Government, and will be guided by its 
               <br />
               instructions. We are not told whether the 
               <br />
               Local Government will be responsible to the 
               <br />
               Local Legislature; whether there will be only 
               <br />
               one or two branches of the Legislature, nor 
               <br />
               how the Legislative Council will be ccm- 
               <br />
               posed, if there is to be one; we are refused 
               <br />
               any information whatsoever on these points, 
               <br />
               which are nevertheless of some importance. 
               <br />
               I regret, therefore, that the amendment pro- 
               <br />
               posed yesterday by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Grandville, should have been rejected, since 
               <br />
               it would have enabled us to obtain important 
               <br />
               information before voting on the question. 
               <br />
               I do not see that the reasons advanced yes- 
               <br />
               terday by the Hon. Sir N. F. BELLBAU, to 
               <br />

               <br />
               to pass this measure, are legitimate and 
               <br />
               conclusive. We are told that the present

               will be adopted without important amend-
