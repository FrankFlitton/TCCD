               <br />
               too vacillat—ing, but on their proving a proper, 
               <br />
               healthy and valuable check on the lower 
               <br />
               branch of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Some honorable gentlemen have urged that 
               <br />
               the people should not elect their representa- 
               <br />
               tives to the Upper House, because it involves 
               <br />
               a very eat expense on the part of the elect- 
               <br />
               ed, an because they cannot judge who is 
               <br />
               worthy of their conﬁdence so well as the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the day. Now, I argue that if 
               <br />
               the people are unﬁt to choose members of this 
               <br />
               House, the are unﬁt to choose members of 
               <br />
               the other ousc too. If three counties united 
               <br />
               are not able to make a good selection, how 
               <br />
               œn one—third part of that constituency make 
               <br />
               a ood one ? And with regard to the corrupt 
               <br />
               in uences that may be brought to bear, will it 
               <br />
               be for a moment said that a large constit- 
               <br />
               uency of three counties can be as easil cor- 
               <br />
               rupted as a constituency composed of on y one 
               <br />
               county ? I think not. I think a more inde- 
               <br />
               pendent vote is brought to bear on the elec- 
               <br />
               tion of a member of the U per House than of 
               <br />
               the Lower. Yet the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> of the Lower 
               <br />
               House want to assume the power of dictating

               <br />

               they themselves can do no wrong. ( car,

               hear.) To sum up, honorable gentlemen, I 
               <br />
               complain that this arrangement for bringing 
               <br />
               about the Confederation of the British North 
               <br />
               American Provinces is being made on terms 
               <br />
               of great disadvantage to Canada, that a fair

               agreement has not been settled upon as be— 
               <br />
               tween the several colonies. I complain that 
               <br />
               in making such an arrangement with the 
               <br />
               other provinces, the constitution of this 
               <br />
               House should have been interfered with ; and 
               <br />
               I complain, ﬁnally, of the manner in which 
               <br />
               the whole measure is being forced through 
               <br />
               the Legislature, without ﬁrst being submit-

               <br />
               cannot but feel that these proposed changes 
               <br />
               so rashly adopted, carry with them the 
               <br />
               seeds of their early dissolution—n result

               HON. MR. MCCREA—Honqrable gentle- 
               <br />
               men, so much has already been said on the 
               <br />
               subject of the Confederation of the British 
               <br />
               American Provinces during the course of this 
               <br />
               debate, which has now occupied the House 
               <br />
               for several days, both here and in the Assem- 
               <br />
               bly, by the ablest men in the province, that I 
               <br />
               do not hope to add anything of great weight 
               <br />
               or importance to what has been urged on the 
               <br />
               question now submitted to our consideration ; 
               <br />
               still, I feel that I should neither do justice to 
               <br />
               my constituents, who have sent me here, nor 
               <br />
               to myself, if I do not upon this occasion 
               <br />
               state, with what force I may, the reasons which 
               <br />
               induced me to give my hearty approval to this 
               <br />
               measure for the Confederation of all these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces under one government, upon the basis 
               <br />
               of these resolutions which Ministers have laid 
               <br />
               upon the table of this House. Very much 
               <br />
               has been said, by almost every speaker who 
               <br />
               has preceded me, upon the importance of the 
               <br />
               subject now before us, and the consequent 
               <br />
