               <br />
               SPEAKER, this is a matter of great impor— 
               <br />
               tance, but I can now only state the purport 
               <br />
               of the resolution ; for, as I said before, I am 
               <br />
               not about to provoke a debate. This whole 
               <br />
               matter proceeds upon the theory that the 
               <br />
               people of Canada desire a change in their 
               <br />
               Constitution. Of course we know that the 
               <br />
               supreme sovereignty rests with the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament—of course we know that the 
               <br />
               power to change our Constitution and re- 
               <br />
               model it in any way rests there—~but we are 
               <br />
               proceeding on the assumption that the Im- 
               <br />
               perial Parliament will acquiesce in our de- 
               <br />
               sire for a change, and in the nature of the 
               <br />
               change desired. Well, sir, the gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the Treasury benches, having the con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdenee of the majority of this House, and 
               <br />
               presumably the conﬁdence of the majority 
               <br />
               of the people also, are going to approach 
               <br />
               Her Majesty’s Government in England and 
               <br />
               ask them to submit to the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment a change in the Constitution of this 
               <br />
               country; but, sir, these gentlemen have not 
               <br />
               explained to us precisely how these resolu- 
               <br />
               tions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aredto</span> be translated into an Act of

               Parliament—they have not explained to us 
               <br />
               which of these resolutions are to form part 
               <br />
               of our new Constitution, and which of them 
               <br />
               are to be carried out in some other way. 
               <br />
               But, Mr. SPEAKER, it will be of the last 
               <br />
               importance to the people of this country 
               <br />
               to know what their Constitution really is to 
               <br />
               be before its ﬁnal enactment. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I would recall, sir, especially to hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men from Lower Canada, the experience of 
               <br />
               the past in reference to this matter. In 1852 
               <br />
               Mr. HINCK’S Government carried through 
               <br />
               this House an Address in favor of a change 
               <br />
               in the constitution of the Legislative Council. 
               <br />
               They sought, by that Address, a change in 
               <br />
               the Union Act, operating a change in the 
               <br />
               constitution of the Legislative Council only. 
               <br />
               But instead of such a change in the Consti- 
               <br />
               tutional Act as was desired by the House, 
               <br />
               power was given to the Legislature to effect 
               <br />
               such a change, and along with that, the 
               <br />
               two-thirds clause of the Union Act was 
               <br />
               repealed—nobody to this day knows how. 
               <br />
               (Hear.) What assurance have we then—— 
               <br />
               what assurance can we have—that a similar 
               <br />
               event will not occur now? Hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               from Lower Canada must have a vivid recol- 
               <br />
               lection of our own very recent experience in 
               <br />
               constitutional changes. The change actu- 
               <br />
               ally made in the Union Act in 1852 was one 
               <br />
               which was deprecated by all the representa- 
               <br />
               tives from Lower Canada—by the entire 
               <br />
               people of Lower Canada—and was brought 
               <br />
               about in a way which has never yet been 
               <br />
               satisfactorily explained. Well, sir, presum- 
               <br />
               ing that the people of this country are mak- 
               <br />
               ing for themselves a new Constitution-— 
               <br />
               recognising the power of the Imperial Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to eﬂ'ect any such change as they 
               <br />
               may deem ﬁt-—but also recognising the well- 
               <br />
               kncwn desire of the Imperial Parliament to 
               <br />
               meet our views in the matter—I propose 
               <br />
               that this House shall pray, in this Address, 
               <br />
               that any act founded on the resolutions of 
               <br />
               the Conference which met in Quebec in 
               <br />
               October last, may only be put in force on the 
               <br />
               prayer of both branches of the Legislature 
               <br />
               of Canada. With these few words, explana- 
               <br />
               tory of my resolution, I place it in your 
               <br />

               HON. MR. DORION—I desire, as I did

               with reference to the amendment of the hon.
