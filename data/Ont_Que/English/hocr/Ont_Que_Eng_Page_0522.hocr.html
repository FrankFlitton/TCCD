               the problem on the former of these two 
               <br />
               plans, I will show presently. For the latter, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, in the States, it is always 
               <br />
               carried on with two elective houses, never 
               <br />
               with one, and with an elective governor; 
               <br />
               and all are chosen for terms that are not 
               <br />
               long. It could not be made to work other- 
               <br />
               wise. An appointed governor, holding in- 
               <br />
               dependently, for a term not short, and above 
               <br />
               all, with only one House, is an experiment 
               <br />
               as new and unpromising as need be. For a 
               <br />
               moment, before going further, I revert to 
               <br />
               the principle on which the Federal Execu- 
               <br />
               tive is to be constituted. We are promised 
               <br />
               there a cabinet, responsible after the British 
               <br />
               model, and strangely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> anomalously as we 
               <br />
               have seen that it will have to be organized, 
               <br />
               in sections to represent our provinces, we 
               <br />
               must understand that the British principle 
               <br />
               of its joint responsibility is to be and will 
               <br />
               be carried out. But it is of the essence of 
               <br />
               responsible government, that with its re- 
               <br />
               sponsibilit such government should have 
               <br />
               power. 0 ministry can be answerable tor 
               <br />
               the entire government of a country, unless 
               <br />
               it has the power to control in some way or 
               <br />
               other, and to the requisite extent, the course 
               <br />
               of affairs. If we are going to build up or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guﬂ'er</span> in the country any power too strong for

               <br />
               sible. It must be able to overcome opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, and that in a constitutional manner. 
               <br />
               Yet, accordin to this scheme, indepen— 
               <br />

               <br />
               rincisl governments also, to embarrass it. 
               <br />
               Let these last be what you will, responsible 
               <br />
               or republican, or some of them the one and 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> themselves, so soon you have got powers

               <br />
               without clashing, and yet neither of which 
               <br />
               can overcome the other, unless by practically 
               <br />

               <br />
               Indeed, aside even from Federalism, the 
               <br />
               British system and the republican are 
               <br />

               <br />
               work mixed up with the other. You 
               <br />
               must be content with one or other, and

               <br />
               to be capable of being worked at all. 
               <br />
               And now, Mr. SPEAKER, let us just fol- 
               <br />
               low out the course of our distinguished fel- 
               <br />
               low-colonist who is trying to govern some 
               <br />
               one of our provinces under this proposed 
               <br />
               amalgamation of the two systems. We will 
               <br />
               suppose him a most admirably ﬁtted person 
               <br />
               for the post, the functions of which heis called 
               <br />
               upon to exercise; but he must necessarily 
               <br />
               have one or two causes of incapacitation, so 
               <br />
               to speak, for it. When Her Majesty appoints 
               <br />
               a governor to come out to Canada, or any 
               <br />
               other colony, she is presumed by every one 
               <br />
               here to have named somebody holding a 
               <br />
               good position at home, and somebody against 
               <br />
               whom no one in the colony can have any 
               <br />
               ground of dislike. He comes with a social 
               <br />
               rank and status presumedly higher than that 
               <br />
               of the people whom he is here to meet with 
               <br />
               and govern. Every one is disposed to re- 
               <br />
               cognise in him the representative of Her 
               <br />
               Majesty; and he has every chance of main- 
               <br />
               taining himself in that pleasant attitude— 
               <br />
               that of administering his government to the 
               <br />
               satisfaction, so far as such a thing is pos- 
               <br />
               sible, of all parties. In adepting the views 
               <br />
               of his constitutional advisers, he is not called 
               <br />
               upon to give up any views which he may 
               <br />
               himself be thought to entertain. He can 
               <br />
               express to the people’s representatives the 
               <br />
               views of his Cabinet, whether they be con- 
               <br />
               servative or reform, or even though they be 
               <br />
               conservative this session and reform the 
               <br />
               next, without any sacriﬁce of position, no 
               <br />
               matter what his own political views may 
               <br />
               have been in the Mother Country. But 
               <br />
               suppose any of our politicians, whether of 
               <br />
               this province or of any other in the Con- 
               <br />
               federacy, say Canada, Newfoundland or Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, to be assuming this rôle of lieuten- 
               <br />
               ant-governor in any of our provinces. He 
               <br />
               has this disadvantage to begin with; he has 
               <br />
               to that moment been passing through that 
               <br />
               ordeal of abuse under which every prominent
