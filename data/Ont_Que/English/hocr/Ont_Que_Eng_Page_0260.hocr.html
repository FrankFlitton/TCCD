               <br />

               <br />
               Lower Canada. Many of you, honorable 
               <br />
               gentlemen, have spent laborious days and 
               <br />
               laborious nights in canvassing these immense

               <br />
               know the wear and tear thus imposed on 
               <br />
               the human body, and that some gentlemen 
               <br />
               after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">canvasäng</span> these immense divisions, 
               <br />
               have found their graves in consequence of 
               <br />
               the exhaustion brought on by these efforts. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hm,</span> hear.) But, honorable gentlemen, it 
               <br />
               is not merely this tear and wear of the human 
               <br />
               constitution which you have had to encounter. 
               <br />
               This country, I need not say, is not very 
               <br />
               wealthy. In point of Wealth it does not re- 
               <br />
               semble the Mother Country. There are gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen there with £200,000 or £300,000 a 
               <br />
               year, who think nothing of spending several 
               <br />
               thousand pounds, provided that by that cx- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pœditure</span> they can put themselves in a con- 
               <br />
               spicuous position before the country. But 
               <br />
               here our fortunes are limited. That is the 
               <br />
               ease in Lower Canada. I hope it is not so 
               <br />
               in Upper Canada.
