               roverb that “ union is strength, and division 
               <br />
               IB weakness.” So universally accepted is this 
               <br />
               statement, that no man can venture to deny 
               <br />
               its correctness. And I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feel,</span> as an advocate 
               <br />
               of union, that our position is one which is 
               <br />
               unassailable, and the argumehts must indeed 
               <br />
               be strong which would convince me that we 
               <br />
               are not going in the right direction when 
               <br />
               moving towards union and consolidation. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Apart from the intrinsic force 
               <br />
               and power of union, which would be in itself 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> to call us in that direction, Canada 
               <br />
               has special reasons for desiring that the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish provinces should draw together more 
               <br />
               closely than they have yet done. By such a 
               <br />
               step we may remove one great cause of our 
               <br />
               own political difﬁculties. I do not think that 
               <br />
               this is at all a necessary part of the argument 
               <br />
               for our uniting together. ‘But it so happens 
               <br />
               that by our union we hope to remove these 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties, and that is an additional argument 
               <br />
               for union, although not at all necessary to 
               <br />
               induce the adoption of the scheme. I believe 
               <br />
               that if we had no diﬂiculties whatever in 
               <br />
               Canada, if we were perfectly satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               our political position, union would still be 
               <br />
               desirable on the broad ground of the advan- 
               <br />
               tages we would derive from it. But, in addi- 
               <br />
               tion to those advantages, and the force and 
               <br />
               strength which union will give us, it will assist 
               <br />
               us in surmounting and removing those great 
               <br />
               difﬁculties under which we labor; and it is a 
               <br />
               moat happy circumstance that, while we are 
               <br />
               carrying out a principle so excellent in itself, 
               <br />
               we are at the same time enabled to remove 
               <br />
               diﬁculties which might prove most disastrous 
               <br />
               to our prospects. And, in addition to these 
               <br />
               reasons, we have evidently the wishes of the 
               <br />
               Mother Country for the success of this scheme. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) No one can with reason ques- 
               <br />
               tion the reception which the scheme has met 
               <br />
               with from the press and from men of all shades 
               <br />
               of political opinion in the Mother Country. 
               <br />
               It has met with universal approbation there. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) There has been no jealousy 
               <br />
               of it that I know of. There has not pro- 
               <br />
               ceeded from any quarter one word of disap- 
               <br />
               probation or of doubt as to the prudence and 
               <br />
               the wisdom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Which</span> have dictated our advances 
               <br />
               towards union. The good wishes of Great 
               <br />
               Britain are thoroughly with us. ' (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) An additional reason, I may say 
               <br />
               necessity,_ for union exists in the hostility of 
               <br />
               the United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> so palpably manifested

               well as others, intimated to the House that 
               <br />

               line of remark only shews me how ignorant

               those honorable gentlemen were of the subject

               <br />
               incompetent to deal with this question. From 
               <br />
               much that I have heard relative to the cause 
               <br />
               of the dissatisfaction known to prevail in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, I think it well not to be alto- 
               <br />
               gether silent about it. We must look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deçu</span> 
               <br />
               than the displeasure felt and manifested at the 
               <br />
               passing of certain measures obnoxious to the 
               <br />
               majority of that section, or at the unjust 
               <br />
               principle of an equal distribution of the public 
               <br />
               revenues between the two sections. It is true

               that these tended to draw attention to, and 
               <br />
               make more prominent the real cause of 
               <br />
               discontent. It lay deep in the chaﬁng of the 
               <br />
               minds of men whose national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">characteriztie</span> is 
               <br />
               impatience of intolerance and injustice. It 
               <br />
               dwelt in the abiding sense of the unfair post- 
               <br />
               tion that the terms of the union of 1840 new 
               <br />
               imposed upon them, and obeying their national 
               <br />
               instincts, they could nevercease to insist upon 
               <br />
               a representative reform. (Hear, hear.) I 
               <br />
               suppose there are no people on the earth who 
               <br />
               feel more strongly or who will resist more

               determinedly the perpetration and continu—
