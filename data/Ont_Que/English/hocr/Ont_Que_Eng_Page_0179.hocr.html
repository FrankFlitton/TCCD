               derstand why a duty should be imposed, but 
               <br />
               when a ship is laden in one port of the Con- 
               <br />
               federation, with coal, for another port in the 
               <br />
               same country, it does not appear much like a 
               <br />
               free Confederation if an export duty is levied 
               <br />
               upon the cargo. (Hear, hear.) There would 
               <br />
               seem, then, to be a distinction—a preference 
               <br />
               for one portion over another—within the 
               <br />
               limits of the Confederation. If we are to have 
               <br />
               a union, I hope we shall have it in fact. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
