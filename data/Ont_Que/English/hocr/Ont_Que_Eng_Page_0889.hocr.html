               have hitherto had but little success in their

               country, instead of limiting their exertions to 
               <br />
               cries and reproaches ? But no. It is always 
               <br />
               thesame thing with them. “ Great cry, and 
               <br />
               little wool.” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) The Opposition 
               <br />
               have always had but one object in view, and 
               <br />
               that was, not the good of the country, but the 
               <br />
               attainment of power. This has been the aim 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> all their actions, and when they did ac- 
               <br />
               tually, by an accident, acquire power, their 
               <br />
               conduct was far worse than that of which they 
               <br />
               accused their predecessors in oﬂice. Their 
               <br />
               intention is to frighten the people, as they did 
               <br />
               on the militia question, by enlisting prejudices 
               <br />
               of all kinds against the measure now under 
               <br />
               discussion—trying every pett subterfuge and 
               <br />
               shabby artiﬁce to bring bac the honorable 
               <br />
               member for Hochelaga (Hon. Mr. A. A. 
               <br />

               <br />
               their little game will have no luck. To be 
               <br />
               sure, we cannot deny the honorable member 
               <br />
               for Drummond and Arthabaska, forhis part, 
               <br />
               the credit of knowing how to work upon 
               <br />
               the people, or rather how to agitate them, 
               <br />
               while they, good . souls, trust blindly to the 
               <br />
               integrity of the. men who represent them 
               <br />
               here. It-was. in this spirit of truth that he 
               <br />
               stated in his strictures on the Militia Bill 
               <br />
               introduced by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CARTIER-MACDONALD</span> 
               <br />
               Government that. it was a measure which 
               <br />
               would entail a tax of $20 a head on every 
               <br />
               habitant, and it is in the same s irit that he 
               <br />
               now tells them Confederation wi l entail one 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$40</span> a head. One assertion is as true as 
               <br />
               the other—neither of them is worth much. 
               <br />
               How can the honorable member venture on 
               <br />
               such assertions, since he knows nothing of the 
               <br />
               details of themeasure—that is, the measures 
               <br />
               of detail which are to come after? He can 
               <br />

               <br />
               trouble and sow discontent throughout the 
               <br />
               land, with relation to the great question 
               <br />
               which has for months been the subject of 
               <br />
               discussion. For this end, they get up little 
               <br />
               petitions, to be signed in the concessions, 
               <br />
               saying to the women,—“ If you would not

               <br />

               their religion l " (Hear, and laughter.) It is 
               <br />
               by such means that they gain their little ad- 
               <br />
               vantages. I have just been informed that 
               <br />
               these men, who have always cried out that 
               <br />
               the clergy ought not to interfere in politics, 
               <br />
               are doing all they can to enlist the clergy and 
               <br />
               swell the cry against Confederation, by pro- 
               <br />
               claiming that the Church is in danger. But 
               <br />
               the clergy know them too well, and will let 
               <br />
               them shout. W h_en I hear these hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               of the Opposition pretend that the clergy are 
               <br />
               on their side, because two priests have written 
               <br />
               against Confederation in the newspapers, I 
               <br />
               cannot help laughing. They are now, for- 
               <br />
               scoth, the saviours of religion and of the 
               <br />
               clergy, loving and respecting them above all 
               <br />
               things. They spoke another language when 
               <br />
               they insulted religion and the clergy in their 
               <br />
               journals; when they declared, in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Institut</span> 
               <br />
               Canadien, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prit</span> sts ought to be forbidden 
               <br />
               to talk politics, and not to be allowed to vote 
               <br />
               at elections. Let them recollect the famous 
               <br />
               parody on excommunication, published in the 
               <br />
               Pays, which never existed save in the narrow 
               <br />
               and diabolical mind which rules the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Siècle.</span> 
               <br />
               But now all this is to be forgotten; now they 
               <br />
               say,—-“Give up your leaders—the traitors who
