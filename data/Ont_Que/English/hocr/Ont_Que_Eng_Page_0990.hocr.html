               the fact that a majority of some six or seven

               <br />
               there were, therefore, strong reasons why,

               nothing to prevent this new system being 
               <br />
               inaugurated on the true and proper basis on 
               <br />
               which it ought to be inaugurated, namely, 
               <br />
               on the popular will, and receiving therefore, 
               <br />
               from the outset, that strength which the 
               <br />
               popular will alone could give to it, in its 
               <br />
               endorsement by those who have a right to 
               <br />
               send representatives to this House. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) It has been said that a motion of 
               <br />
               this kind takes away, in point of fact, from 
               <br />
               the Legislature, the power which the Legis- 
               <br />
               lature has, by denying the right of the 
               <br />
               Legislature to make any such change. I do 
               <br />
               not say anything against the power of the 
               <br />
               Legislature. The Legislature has, within the 
               <br />
               limits that are assigned to it, all the rights 
               <br />
               which its charter gives it. But I cannot 
               <br />
               help feeling that when we are dealing with 
               <br />
               this question, we are dealing with it very 
               <br />
               diﬁ'erently from the manner in which it was 
               <br />
               dealt with, either by the independent Par- 
               <br />
               liament of Scotland, or by the independent 
               <br />
               Parliament of Ireland. We are acting 
               <br />
               under a limited charter and constitution — 
               <br />
               having no right ourselves to deal with this 
               <br />
               matter ﬁnally by any act of our own—having 
               <br />
               only the right to deal with it by these reso- 
               <br />
               lutions, and not to enact it with the autho-

               rity of law. (Hear, hear.) We, therefore, 
               <br />
               stand limited in our powers at the outset—- 
               <br />
               so limited that it has been decided in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, that the privileges which belongto 
               <br />
               the House of Commons and the House of Lords 
               <br />
               in England do not belong entirely to our legis- 
               <br />
               lative bodies—that these have grown with 
               <br />
               time, until they have become incorporated 
               <br />
               with the very existence of the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment—while we hold our privileges in a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               diﬁ'erent way, not having the same compre- 
               <br />
               hensive grasp of them, as in the case of the 
               <br />
               House of Commons. It is clear that we have 
               <br />
               not the same power as the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment—otherwise we should not be obliged to 
               <br />
               go to that body for its sanction of these 
               <br />
               resolutions. And there are limitations of 
               <br />
               the power of the Imperial Parliament itself, 
               <br />
               to which we also are subject. We cannot 
               <br />
               make any act of ours permanent, any more 
               <br />
               than we can make ourselves permanent, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               because another Parliament has the right to 
               <br />
               repeal what we have done. We cannot of . 
               <br />
               ourselves enact this measure into a law. 
               <br />
               We can offer these resolutions—we have the 
               <br />
               power to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that—and</span> the Imperial Govern- 
               <br />
               ment and Parliament have, no doubt, the 
               <br />
               power to act upon them as they choose. 
               <br />
               But the question is—is it wise to give these 
               <br />
               resolutions the force of law; is it proper to 
               <br />
               do so; is it the most just course to take 
               <br />
               towards the peOple of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,.to</span> 
               <br />
               declare that in a matter of this importance 
               <br />
               we will legislate for them, to the extent of 
               <br />
               introducing an entire change of the Consti- 
               <br />
               tution—of providin g that the Upper Chamber, 
               <br />
               which they have declared to be elective, shall 
               <br />
               cease to be elective, and shall be nominated 
               <br />
               by the Crown, without consulting them? 
               <br />
               I do not mean to say, with regard to that 
               <br />
               change, that it is not a beneﬁcial change. I 
               <br />
               was one of the few who stood on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this Legislature battling against the 
               <br />
               change from nomination by the Crown to 
               <br />
               election by the people in the Upper House. 
               <br />
               I was one of those also who contended {or 
               <br />
               resolutions, the effect of which would be to 
               <br />
               place the power of the people in the Lower 
               <br />
               House, by representation according to num- 
               <br />
               bers in that body, with equal representation 
               <br />
               for the two sections of the province in the 
               <br />
               Upper House. And I recollect that some 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen now on the Treasury benches 
               <br />
               —the Hon. President of the Council among 
               <br />
               others, through the columns of the inﬂuen- 
               <br />
               tial paper he controls—declared that the idea 
               <br />
               embodied in those resolutions was absurd, and 
               <br />
