               racter of the United States Government has

               and which has plunged the country into all 
               <br />
               the horrors of the deadliest strife—is the 
               <br />
               comment upon the working of 
               <br />
               the Federal principle—the strongest argu- 
               <br />
               ment against its application to these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. (Hear, hear.) The French element 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada will be separated from us 
               <br />
               in its Local Legislature and become less united 
               <br />
               with us than it is now; and therefore there 
               <br />
               is likely to be disagreement between us. Still 
               <br />
               more likely is there to be disagreement 
               <br />
               when the people of Upper Canada ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               this scheme will not relieve them of the bur- 
               <br />
               dens cast upon them, but, on the contrary, 
               <br />
               will subject them to a legislature that will have 
               <br />
               the power of imposing direct taxation in addi- 
               <br />
               tion to the burdens imposed by the General 
               <br />
               Government. When they ﬁnd that this 
               <br />
               power is exercised, and they are called upon 
               <br />
               to contribute as much as before to the Gene- 
               <br />
               ral Government, while taxed to maintain a se 
               <br />
               arate Local Legislature—when they ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the material question is to weigh with them, 
               <br />
               they will look to the other side of the line for 
               <br />
               union. I feel that we are going to do that 
               <br />
               which will weaken our connection with the 
               <br />
               Mother Country, because if you give power to 
               <br />
               legislate upon the same subjects to both the 
               <br />
               local and the federal legislatures, and allow 
               <br />
               both to impose taxation upon the people, dis- 
               <br />
               agreements will spring up which must neces- 
               <br />
               sarily have that effect. (Hear, hear.) Then 
               <br />
               again, by this scheme that is laid before us, 
               <br />
               certain things are to be legislated upon by 
               <br />
               both the general and the local legislatures, 
               <br />
               and yet the local legislation is to be subor- 
               <br />
               dinate to the legislation of the Federal Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. For instance, emigration and agricul- 
               <br />
               ture are to be subject to the control of both 
               <br />
               bodies. N ow suppose that the Federal Legis- 
               <br />
               lature chooses to decide in favor of having 
               <br />
               emigration ﬂow to a particular locality, so as 
               <br />
               to beneﬁt one province alone-—I do not mean 
               <br />
               this expression to be understood in its entire 
               <br />
               sense, because I think that emigration in any 
               <br />
               one portion will beneﬁt the whole, but it will 
               <br />
               beneﬁt the particular locality much more at 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time—and</span> if provision is made by the

               again, for instance, that arrangements are

               Lower Canada or New Brunswick, and a 
               <br />

               <br />
               whether it is for the local or general good? 
               <br />
               It is the Federal Legislature that has to pro- 
               <br />
               nounce upon it. The expenditure and the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt would be received by a portion of the 
               <br />
               province lying remote from that which pays 
               <br />
               the largest proportion of the money, and so 
               <br />
               we would not be relieved from the diﬂiculties 
               <br />
               that have existed between Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. This being the case, the reasoning 
               <br />
               on which this whole scheme is based falls to 
               <br />
               the ground. (Hear, hear.) But this question 
               <br />
               has been of some service. It has enabled us to 
               <br />
               ascertain what our debt is. This we have never

               previously been enabled with certainty to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out. Our highest authorities have widely dif- 
               <br />
               fered in footing it up. I recollect the Hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
