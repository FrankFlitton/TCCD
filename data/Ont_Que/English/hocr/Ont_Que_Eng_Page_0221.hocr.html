               <br />
               tal of three millions. The lands of the other

               provinces are well taken care of ; but those 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, what are they worth? 
               <br />
               They are entirely valueless. When my hon- 
               <br />
               orable friend the Commissioner of Crown 
               <br />
               Lands has all these lands to control, I am 
               <br />
               sure he will have his hands full The lands 
               <br />
               of other provinces were worth retaining, and 
               <br />
               they were left under their own management; 
               <br />
               but as these happened to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beâood</span> for nothing, 
               <br />
               they were put upon the eneral Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Had they been good for anything, 
               <br />
               they would also have been reserved. There 
               <br />
               is another question. It is proposed to take 
               <br />
               the government railways of New Brunswick 
               <br />
               and Nova Scotia, and make them provincial 
               <br />
               works. I suppose we shall be told that the 
               <br />
               canals of Canada are also taken, and made 
               <br />
               public works of the Confederation. But 
               <br />
               there is a very great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between these. 
               <br />
               The railways had only an existence of a few 
               <br />
               years, they would be worn out soon, and 
               <br />
               must be kept up at the expense of the Con- 
               <br />
               federate Government. What advantage 
               <br />
               could they be to the Confederate Govern- 
               <br />
               ment? What are our expenses now for 
               <br />
               public works? Have we not seen the tolls 
               <br />
               removed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘on</span> our canals, and will it not be a 
               <br />
               part of the policy of the Confederate Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to remove the rates paid on these 
               <br />
               railways, and they will be kept up, as all 
               <br />
               public works are, at an enormous loss to the 
               <br />
               Government. (Hear, hear.) My honorable 
               <br />
               friend from Niagara the other day, I thought, 
               <br />
               on one point, was not quite correct in what 
               <br />
               he said in respect to Upper Canada. (Laugh- 
               <br />
               ter, and hear, hear.) From the census of 
               <br />
               1861, I ﬁnd that the cash-value of farms in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$295,162,315,</span> and in

               Lower Canada, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$168,432,546,</span> makings total 
               <br />
               of $463,594,861. The live stock in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada was valued at 853,227,516 ; in Lower

               <br />
               ﬁsheries, Upper Canada is quite equal to

               I believe that if Upper Canada could be left 
               <br />
               alone, if it was not to be burthened and its 
               <br />
               back broken by these concessions, the whole

               ous, provided we did not enter into any 
               <br />
               further useless and wasteful expenditure. 
               <br />
               Compare these resources with those of the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces! The gallant Premier, 
               <br />
               the other day, stated something with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> 
               <br />
               to the wealth of those provinces—with res- 
               <br />
               pect to their mines and timber. But the 
               <br />
               timber must become exhausted, and conse- 
               <br />
               quently that country cannot grow richer; 
               <br />
               whilst in Canada, with a good productive 
               <br />
               soil and an industrious population, we must 
               <br />
               go on increasing in wealth. What is the 
               <br />
               value of the mines which we are to get? In 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia the royalty on coal is only 828,— 
               <br />
               000, and the revenue derived from the gold 
               <br />
               ﬁelds, $20,000 ; and what else have we to 
               <br />
               obtain from these provinces? Why, in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia they have no timber, and con- 
               <br />
               sequently their revenue cannot increase; 
               <br />
               whilst we in Canada must inevitably go on 
               <br />
               and grow in prosperity, because the ele- 
               <br />
               ments of our wealth are in the soil and
