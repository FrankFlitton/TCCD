               the aggregate real debt of the country

               assumed up to this ﬁgure of $25 a head, are 
               <br />
               to be paid interest at ﬁve per cent. on any

               amount of shortcoming in that behalf they 
               <br />
               may be guilty of. And Newfoundland and

               purposes, therefore, the debts of the four

               Lower Provinces are thus brought up to this

               standard level. The Federal Government 
               <br />
               is to pay interest on them to that tune—if

               <br />
               with a clear, practical debt of 825 a head 
               <br />
