               mitted what the Premier had claimed for his 
               <br />
               oountrymen—namely, their well-known liber- 
               <br />

               <br />
               never had any disposition to deny it. But 
               <br />
               my argument was that, in establishing a Con- 
               <br />
               stitution, our rights and interests should be 
               <br />
               protected by distinct provisions in that Con- 
               <br />
               stitution—that these would form the only 
               <br />
               satisfactory assurance we could get—that we 
               <br />
               could not rest upon the liberality of any class 
               <br />
               of men, but must have the assurance of dis- 
               <br />
               tinct tees. That was the line of argu- 
               <br />
               ment pursued. Hear, hear.) I do not

               think the Premier 3 ould have been so hard 
               <br />
               upon me for not stipulating that the ten men

               HON. MR. DORION, in resuming the 
               <br />
               adjourned debate on Confederation, said-— 
               <br />
               I should have desired to make my remarks 
               <br />
               to the House in French, but considering the 
               <br />
               large number of honorable members who are 
               <br />
               not familiar with that language, I think it 
               <br />
               my duty to speak at the present time in 
               <br />
               English. In rising on this occasion to ad- 
               <br />
               dress the House on the important question 
               <br />
               submitted to us, I must say I do so with an 
               <br />
               unusual degree of embarrassment, not only 
               <br />
               on account of the importance of the sub- 
               <br />
               ject of our deliberations, but also because I 
               <br />
               have to diﬁ'er from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many-of</span> those with whom 
               <br />
               I have been in the habit of acting ever since 
               <br />
               I ﬁrst entered into political life. Yet, Mr. 
               <br />
               SPEAKER, when I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider</span> the uestions 
               <br />
               raised by the resolutions submitte by ‘the 
               <br />
               Government, I ﬁnd that whether they be 
               <br />
               purely political ones, such as the proposal to 
               <br />
               restrict the inﬂuence and control of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple over the Le 'slature of the country by 
               <br />
               substituting a C amber nominated by 'the 
               <br />
               Crown for an Elective Legislative Council, or 
               <br />
               whether they are purely commercial in their 
               <br />
               character, such as that regarding the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial Railway, or the larger question of 
               <br />
               Confederation itself, I still hold the same 
               <br />
               views that I held, in common with others 
               <br />
               who have now changed their opinions, when 
               <br />
               the subjects were ﬁrst mooted. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               And as I have not heard, since the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               opening of this debate, any reason for sub- 
               <br />
               stituting a nominated for an elective Upper 
               <br />

               <br />
               1856, when, by an overwhelming majority 
               <br />
               of this House, it was decided that the elec- 
               <br />
               tive principle should prcVail—as I have 
               <br />
               not heard any reason why we should pledge 
               <br />
               our credit and resources to the construction 
               <br />
               of the Intereolonial Railway, even previous 
               <br />
               to any estimate of its cost being made, that 
               <br />
               was not urged in 1862 when the question was
