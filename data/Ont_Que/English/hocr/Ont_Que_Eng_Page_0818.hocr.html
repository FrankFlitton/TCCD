               must eventually take place. And since the

               <br />
               and in particular one very able article in the

               <br />
               could refer to show the advantages of a union 
               <br />
               of these provinces. Whether Legislative or 
               <br />
               Federal unimportant-—union is strength, and 
               <br />
               union is desirable if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exrect</span> future growth 
               <br />
               and greatness. I think the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguments</span> are 
               <br />
               in favor of a legislative union. When we ap- 
               <br />
               proach the subject fairly, we must acknowledge 
               <br />
               that it is not reasonable to suppose that the 
               <br />
               people of the Lower Provinces should prefer 
               <br />
               a Federal to a Legislative union. I can quite 
               <br />
               understand why they appreciate the advantages 
               <br />
               of the local parliaments; to ask them to give 
               <br />
               up their whole machinery of government, and 
               <br />
               to place themselves in the hands and at the 
               <br />
               tender mercies of a people who would have 
               <br />
               the commanding inﬂuences in the legislation 
               <br />
               of the country, and with whom they are com- 
               <br />
               paratively little 3 uainted, would be asking 
               <br />
               rather too much. here is also some reason 
               <br />
               to fear why a legislative union would be too 
               <br />
               cumbersome. Many think that too much of 
               <br />
               the time of the Legislature of the country 
               <br />
               would be taken up with the local business of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> sections of the province. I 
               <br />
               believe, after this machinery has been 
               <br />
               well in Operation, and after we have be- 
               <br />
               come better acquainted with each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span> , that we 
               <br />
               shall ﬁnd we can work together, and that 
               <br />
               this has been a movement in the right direction, 
               <br />
               by bringing together the pee le from all parts 
               <br />
               of the country. We she ﬁnd that our 
               <br />
               interests are better understood, indeed that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theytare</span> one ; it will be the more easy to do 
               <br />
               away with the local parliaments, and to merge 
               <br />
               them all into one. (Hear, hear.) Then, sir, 
               <br />
               there will be this advantage from the present 
               <br />
               scheme—we shall have the machinery for 
               <br />
               governing the whole country in existence; and 
               <br />
               it will be easy for those who desire it—if in 
               <br />
               the wisdom of the people who will be living 
               <br />
               under the institutions of the country at that 
               <br />
               time, it is thought desirable—the necessary 
               <br />
               machinery will be in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ekistence</span> for consolidation, 
               <br />
               and the change will not be of that radical nature 
               <br />
               that it would be at the present moment. Take 
               <br />
               another view of the case, which I believe will

               there will be work enough for the local gov-

               ernments as well as for the General Govern— 
               <br />

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of inducing, on the part of the local 
               <br />
               administrations, a spirit of emulation in the 
               <br />
               way of conducting their respective govern— 
               <br />
               ments as cheaply and as economically as pos- 
               <br />
               sible. I have no doubt, too, that when the 
               <br />
               local parliaments are once established, the 
               <br />
               peeple will see the advantage of material

               changes in the municipal institutions of the 
               <br />
               country; those institutions being to a greater

               degree subordinated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to:</span> the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments. At all events, these are all matters 
               <br />
               for future consideration, and possibly for 
               <br />
               future action. (Hear, hear.) I shall now, 
               <br />
               M r. SPEAKER, refer brieﬂy to the question of 
               <br />
               Confederation in a commercial point of view. 
               <br />
               It is stated that in this respect no beneﬁt 
               <br />
               will accrue to the country—that there will be 
               <br />
               no incrcaxe of trade between the provinces. ' 
               <br />
               But I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask</span> this House to look at the matter in 
               <br />
               this light—and I am sorry to say that we 
               <br />
               have good reason for so viewing it—there 
               <br />
               can be no doubt of the fact. The United 
               <br />
               States have given notice of the abrogation of 
               <br />
               the Reciprocity treaty, and there is too much 
               <br />
               cause for the apprehension that the bonding 
               <br />
               system will also be done away with. Well, if 
               <br />
               we are cut off from all these facilities and ad- 
               <br />
               vantages, what is our position ? We are cut 
               <br />
               off from the ocean for six months of the year, 
               <br />
               and in this resPeet our position of dependency 
               <br />
               on a foreign power is a most humiliating one. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The construction of the In- 
               <br />
               tercolonial Railway has been insisted upon as 
               <br />
               a Commercial necessity, and although it may 
               <br />
               be an expensive work, I think the time has 
               <br />
               come when it must be built. I may brieﬂy 
               <br />
               state my own sition in regard to that un- 
               <br />
               dertaking. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\</span> hen the appr0priation w :s 
               <br />
               brought up for the Intercolonial Railway sur- 
               <br />
               vey, so strongly was I opposed to that scheme 
               <br />
               at the time that I voted against it. But, as 
               <br />
               I have already stated, I now see the necessity 
               <br />
               for it. I believe the time has come when this 
               <br />
               railway should be constructed. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               I hope it will be constructed in a proper and 
               <br />
               economical manner, and, when it is built, I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> that in a commercial point, our posi- 
               <br />
               tion will be reatly improved. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               It is impossi le for any honorable gentleman 
               <br />
               to shew that by means of that railway no 
               <br />
               increase of trade will spring up between the 
               <br />
