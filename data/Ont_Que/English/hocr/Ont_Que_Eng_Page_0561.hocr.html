               adoption of this scheme is so to improve our

               <br />
               know why a something of the same kind may

               not by possibility be hoped for, even though 
               <br />
               this project should be set aside. If we are to 
               <br />
               be capable of the far harder task of working 
               <br />
               out these projected unworkable political in— 
               <br />
               stitutions, why is it that we must be incap- 
               <br />
               able of the easier task of going on without 
               <br />
               them ? I know well that in all time the tem- 
               <br />
               per of those who do not think has been to put 
               <br />
               faith rather in the great thing one cannot do, 
               <br />
               than in the smaller thing one can. “ If the 
               <br />
               prophet had bid thee do some great thing, 
               <br />
               wouldest thou not have done it? ” And here 
               <br />
               too, air, as so often before, if the truth must 
               <br />
               be told, the one thing truly needed is what 
               <br />
               onemay call the smaller thing—not perhaps 
               <br />
               easy, but one must hope not impossible—the 
               <br />
               exercise by our public men and by our people 
               <br />
               of that amount of discretion, good temper and 
               <br />
               forbearance which sees something larger and 
               <br />
               higher in public life than mere party 8 es

               <br />
               quite bad enough for them to ﬁght over 
               <br />
               and make worse.- Mr. SPEAKER, I feel that 
               <br />
               I have taken up a great deal of the time of 
               <br />
               the House, and that I have presented but 
               <br />
               imperfectly the views I am anxious to impress 
               <br />
               upon it as to this great question. But for 
               <br />
               sheer want of strength, I might have felt it 
               <br />
               necessary, at whatever risk of wearying the 
               <br />
               House, to go into some matters more thor- 
               <br />
               oughly, and more especially into that branch 
               <br />
               of the subject which relates to what I may 
               <br />
               call the alternative policy I myself prefer to 
               <br />
               this measure, and would wish to see adopted 
               <br />
               and carried out. As it is, I have but to say 
               <br />
               in conclusion, while warmly thanking the 
               <br />
               House for the attention and patience with 
               <br />
               which it has for so many hours listened to 
               <br />
               me, that I have said nothing but what I 
               <br />
               ﬁrmly believe, and felt myself bound to say, 
               <br />
               and that I trust the sober good sense of the 
               <br />
               people of these provinces, after full reﬂection 
               <br />
               and discussion, will decide rightly upon this 
               <br />
               the largest question by far that has ever been 
               <br />
               before them for decision. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span>

               this occasion, sir, my intention is not to 
               <br />
               occupy the attention of the House for a 
               <br />
               long time, nor to discuss the merits of the 
               <br />
               measure which is now before us. I intend 
               <br />
               merely to explain my own motives for the 
               <br />
               vote which I shall give, and this I shall do 
               <br />
               as brieﬂy as possible. I am bound to ac- 
               <br />
               knowledge at once that when I arrived in 
               <br />
               Quebec, at the commencement of the session, 
               <br />
               I was opposed to the plan of Confederation, 
               <br />
               and so strongly Opposed to it, that I was 
               <br />
               fully determined to vote against it. But 
               <br />
               alter a more serious consideration of the 
               <br />
               question, and after hearing the explanations 
               <br />
               which have been aﬁ'crded to us of the 
               <br />
               scheme of the Government. I have arrived <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               at the conviction that I had decided, if not 
               <br />
               wrongly, at least hastily, and that Ionght 
               <br />
               not to aid in the rejection of the measure, 
               <br />
               merely because it did not quite coincide 
               <br />
               with all my opinions. After listening to 
               <br />
               the discussion, and the explanations of the 
               <br />
               members of the Administration, I perceived 
               <br />
               that the plan was one of compromise and 
               <br />
               could not, therefore, be adapted to suit all 
               <br />
               views, nor shaped even to meet those of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               men who framed it. I can understand that 
               <br />
               those persons who are opposed toany degree 
               <br />
               of Confederation, and who would rather 
               <br />
               have representation based on po ulation or 
               <br />
               the annexation of Canada to t e United 
               <br />
               States, may be opposed to the project of the 
               <br />
               Government, and reject it accordingly ; but 
               <br />
               those Who, like myself, are not opposed to it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               under any circumstances, and are capable of 
               <br />
               appreciating the necessity of it at the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               conjuncture, together with the advantages it 
               <br />
               may produce to the country, ought not, can- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               not, I think, reject it, only because some of 
               <br />
               its details are not exactly to their mind. It 
               <br />
               is our business ﬁrst to enquire whether some 
               <br />
               constitutional changes are not necessary, 
               <br />
               and none I think will deny that they are. 
               <br />
               The political leaders of the two parties into 
               <br />
               which this House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">h</span> divided, have acknow- 
               <br />
               ledged this as a necessity. It remains, 
               <br />
               therefore, only to consider what changes 
               <br />
               should be made. The members of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span>
