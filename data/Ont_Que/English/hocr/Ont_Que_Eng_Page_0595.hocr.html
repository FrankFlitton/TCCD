               hear.) If we cannot suppose a body without

               a form, so we cannot suppose society with-

               mula you destroy society. That is the 
               <br />
               reason why the marriage tie should be in- 
               <br />
               dissoluble; it is it which constitutes the 
               <br />
               family, and in breaking that tie you destroy 
               <br />
               the family, in breaking thattie you strike 
               <br />
               a mortal blow at society, because family ties

               are its only base, its only foundation. its

               <br />
               prove their existence and at the same time

               another place than in this House, men who, 
               <br />
               forgetting the natural law and the principles 
               <br />
               of society, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">become</span> affected at the recital 
               <br />
               of the domestic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miseries</span> of one of their 
               <br />
               fellow-beings, and even invoke the Divine 
               <br />
               word to justify them in granting a divorce 
               <br />
               for cause of adultery. Let us see if the 
               <br />
               language of the Sawiour of the world, who 
               <br />
               taught here upon earth a social doctrine, 
               <br />
               by preserving the inviolability of domestic 
               <br />
               ties and surrounding them with duties which 
               <br />
               rendered them still more sacred, justiﬁes 
               <br />
               such an interpretation—“l say unto you, 
               <br />
               that he who putteth away his wife, except 
               <br />
               for adultery, and marrieth another, commit- 
               <br />
               teth adultery, and he who marrieth her who 
               <br />
               hath been put away also <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cmnmitteth</span> adul- 
               <br />
               tery.” Are not these words as clear as day, 
               <br />
               and do they not expressly forbid divorce, 
               <br />
               since they declare an adulterer the man who 
               <br />
               shall marry the woman separated from her 
               <br />
               husband. (Hear, hear.) These words per- 
               <br />
               mit the sending away, the separation of the 
               <br />
               body, but they expressly forbid divorce—- 
               <br />
               that is, the rupture ot family ties. (Applause) 
               <br />
               I have said that those Divine words had a 
               <br />
               social object; in fact what other object could 
               <br />
               they have but to preserve intact the social 
               <br />
               formula for the transmission of property ; and 
               <br />
               if they surround that formula with a super- 
               <br />
               natural sanction, accompanied by a prospect 
               <br />
               of reward or punishment, it is to protect it 
               <br />
               still more. It is for this reason that, in 
               <br />
               Catholicism, marriage, a natural contract, is 
               <br />
               elevated to the dignity of a sacrament, but it 
               <br />
               was inviolable and indissoluble before that 
               <br />
               sanction. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) Now, if we drop

               denying the right, but unable to deny the

               <br />
               not ask us to—day to proclaim a principle, but

               simply the transposition of the exercise of a

               speaking I express the general sentiment of 
               <br />

               sary one, and cannot be got rid of, I would 
               <br />
               rather see it where its consequences would be 
               <br />
               less serious, because they would be more 
               <br />

               <br />
               presents itself to us here under another aspect 
               <br />
               ——that is, marriage with regard to its civil 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effects.</span> This project attributes the civil laws 
               <br />
               and legislation as to property to the local 
               <br />
               legislatures. N ow, marriage, considered as a 
               <br />
               civil contract, becomes necessarily a part of 
               <br />
               these laws, and, I might even say, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affects</span> 
               <br />
               the entire civil code, containing in its broadest

               sense all the marriage acts, all the qualities 
               <br />
               and conditions required to allow marrisgeto 
               <br />
               be contracted, all the formalities relative to 
               <br />
               its celebration, all its nullifying causes, all its 
               <br />
               obligations, its dissolution, the separation of 
               <br />
               the body, its causes and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cﬂects;</span> in a word, all 
               <br />
               the possible consequences that can result from 
               <br />
               marriage to the contracting parties, their

               If such had been the intention of the dele 
               <br />
               gates, we might as well say that the civil laws 
               <br />
               will not be one of the attributes of our Local 
               <br />
               Legislature, and that these words, “Property 
               <br />
