               of the proposed Confederation. I do not 
               <br />
               wish to assert that the country at large is 
               <br />
               averse to any idea of Confederation, but I 
               <br />
               maintain that it cannot be in favor of a 
               <br />
               scheme with the details of which it is un- 
               <br />
               _acquainted, and of the entirety of which it 
               <br />
               is ignorant. The most eﬂ'ectual means of 
               <br />
               providing for the defence of a country is to 
               <br />
               make the people attachedto the Constitution 
               <br />
               of the country ; to attempt to force a con- 
               <br />
               stitution u on them is, in plain language, 
               <br />
               to impel <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> towards anarchy. Ah! we 
               <br />
               are already surrounded by dangers enough 
               <br />
               to abstain from aggravating our position. 
               <br />
               Let us conduct ourselves so that the people 
               <br />
               may be attached to their constitution, and 
               <br />
               then we may rest assured that they will be 
               <br />
               ready to defend it when it is threatened. 
               <br />
               Undoubtedly, it is not by acting as we are 
               <br />
               now doing that we shall attain that result. 
               <br />
               The reason assigned by the Honorable Com- 
               <br />
               missioner of Crown Lands for urging on this 
               <br />
               measure does not appear to me to he suﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient. We are not here to please the Mari- 
               <br />
               time Provinces or to legislate in their inter- 
               <br />
               cats, but we are here to preserve the rights 
               <br />
               of our fellow-citizens. We did not come 
               <br />
               — here with a predetermined resolution to 
               <br />
               throw impediments in the way of any plan 
               <br />
               of union. We are all interested in the pros- 
               <br />
               perity and greatness of our country. The 
               <br />
               last time I had the honor to address this 
               <br />
               Honorable House, I stated that with respect 
               <br />
               to the questions which possessed the highest 
               <br />
               interest for Lower Canada, the proposed 
               <br />
               Confederation would be a legislative union, 
               <br />
               that is to say, that we should be at the 
               <br />
               mercy of Up er Canada and the Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces. Ip ex pressed that opinion in good 
               <br />
               faith, and if I was incorrect in my conjec- 
               <br />
               tures, I hope that the members of the 
               <br />
               Government will be good enough to enlighten 
               <br />
               me on the subject, and point out my error. 
               <br />
               Such was not done at the time, for I cannot 
               <br />
               accept as a satisfactory reply the few expla- 
               <br />
               nations given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en</span> the subject by the honorable 
               <br />
               member who sits opposite to me. I say that 
               <br />
               the Federal Government will have power to 
               <br />
               declare that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religious</span> corporations, for in- 
               <br />
               stancz, shall not be allowed to hold real 
               <br />
               estate of more than a certain value—more 
               <br />
               than is required for the immediate necessities 
               <br />
               of their establishments. It will also have 
               <br />
               power to enact that there shall be no con- 
               <br />
               nection between Church and State. I say 
               <br />
               that the powers of the Federal Government 
               <br />
               will be so great that Lower Canada will he a 
               <br />
               eypher in the aﬁ'airs which most concern her.

               <br />
               when I ask questions in sober earnest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span>

               <br />
               ask for information on so important a matter, 
               <br />
               I can get no answer but an ironical one. I 
               <br />
               ask for information, because I confess, for 
               <br />
               my part, that I may be mistaken in my 
               <br />
               Opinions on this matter. My opinions are 
               <br />
               not infallible any more than those of the 
               <br />
               members of the Quebec Conference—any 
               <br />
               more than those of the Lower Canadian 
               <br />
               members of the Ministr ; audit is for that 
               <br />
               very reason that I see information which 
               <br />
               may serve to enlighten me and enable me to 
               <br />
               form a correct judgment on the question. 
               <br />
               Have those who devised this scheme the 
               <br />
               presumption to think that they are not liable 
               <br />
               to mistake? When I ask for the details of 
               <br />
               the scheme in the name of my constituents, 
               <br />
               I am answered ironically. But I know what 
               <br />
               such answers are worth. I know that some 
               <br />
               persons have recourse to irony when they 
               <br />
               have no serious answer to make, when they 
               <br />
               have no solid reasons to give. I know what 
               <br />
               discussion is; and, if I have not often mixed 
               <br />
               in the debates of this Honorable House, I 
               <br />
               have argued at the bar, and I am erfectly 
               <br />
               aware that those who have no vali reasons 
               <br />
               to oppose to the pleas of their adversaries, 
               <br />
               endeavor to shift their ground and blink the 
               <br />
               issue, by calling attention to some minor 
               <br />
               point and calling in the aid of irony. If I 
               <br />
               am denied the explanations which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">claim</span> in 
               <br />
               this lace, how can I answer the questions 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> my constituents have a right to ask 
               <br />
               me ? But I must now address myself to the 
               <br />
               consideration of the appointment of members 
               <br />
               by mandamus which is to beintroduced into 
               <br />
               the new Constitution of the Federal Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive Council. When I heard the honorable 
               <br />
               and gallant Knight tell the history of the 
               <br />
               last moments of the Legislative Council 
               <br />
               sitting under that authority, I tool: it as the

               strongest sentence of condemnation of the 
               <br />
               present scheme. He told us, in effect, that

               those members who had been appointed for life 
               <br />
