               cations, I for one would not hesitate to give 
               <br />
               my voice, and whatever inﬂuence I possess, to 
               <br />
               oppose them. (Hear, hear.) I wish to be

               understood that I mention these gold-hearing 
               <br />
               countries, and countries possessing mineral 
               <br />
               wealth, to illustrate that we have all that 
               <br />
               wealth in our own possession if we only de- 
               <br />
               velop it. The gold produced from Australia, 
               <br />
               British Columbia and California during the 
               <br />
               last six years has been estimated at nearly 
               <br />
               two thousand millions of dollars. The polit- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">icd</span> divisions of British North America are as 
               <br />
               follows: Upper Canada, Lower Canada, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land, Newfoundland, Vancouver’s Island, Bri- 
               <br />
               tish Columbia, Red River Settlement, and the 
               <br />
               Hudson Bay Territory. The combined ter- 
               <br />
               ritory is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equal</span> to a square of 1,770 miles, or 
               <br />
               more than three millions of square miles. 
               <br />
               This vast area is peopled by about four mil- 
               <br />
               lions of inhabitants, of whom nearly three 
               <br />
               millions are contained in the Canadas. That, 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, is what I understand to be the 
               <br />
               contemplated union; that is the union which 
               <br />
               I understand the Government are pledged to 
               <br />
               this House and to the count to carry out, 
               <br />
               and I say that if I did not believe it was their 
               <br />
               honest intention to carry that union into ef- 
               <br />
               fect, I would not have the slightest hesitation 
               <br />
               in giving my vote against them. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Now, sir, I would allude to British Columbia 
               <br />
               and its resources. ‘British Columbia embraces 
               <br />
               an area of 213,500 square miles. Its exports 
               <br />
               in 1862 amounted to $9,257,875, chieﬂy in 
               <br />
               gold and furs, and its imports were valued at 
               <br />
               $2,200,000. Vancouver’s Island embraces 
               <br />
               an area of 16,000 square miles, with a popula- 
               <br />
               tion of 11,463. In 1862 its imports amount- 
               <br />
               ed to $3,555,000. The Hudson Bay Terri- 
               <br />
               tory embraces an area of 1,800,000 square 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miles,</span> with a population of 200,000. Now we 
               <br />
               come to the Lake Superior region, which has 
               <br />
               been entirely or almost entirely neglected by 
               <br />
               the people of Canada, whilst our neighbors on 
               <br />
               the American side, more energetic and more 
               <br />
               enterprising I must confess than we have been, 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               have built up an immense trade. In 1863 the 
               <br />
               amount of capital employed to work the mines 
               <br />
               on the American side was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$6,000,000.</span> 
               <br />
               The amount of copper produced in 1863 was 
               <br />
               nine thousand tons, and of iron a hundred 
               <br />
               and eighty—ﬁve thousand tons. The total 
               <br />
               exports were $10,000,000, and the imports 
               <br />
               812,000,000. But whilst this vast trade has 
               <br />
               been produced on the American side, little or 
               <br />
               no attention has been given by the people of 
               <br />
               Canada to the mineral section on our side, 
               <br />
               and I mention these ﬁgures to show what 
               <br />
               wealth we possess still in an undeveloped 
               <br />
               state. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> Mr. SPEAKER, I regret 
               <br />
               that I am not able to place my views so clear- 
               <br />
               ly before the House as other honorable gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen who have addressed it. I regret that 
               <br />
               on this occasion, not having intended to 
               <br />
               speak to-night, I have not been able to in- 
               <br />
               terest the House more than I have done. 
               <br />
               (Cries of “Go on.”) But I think that - 
               <br />
               what should occupy the attention of this 
               <br />
               House, and of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of the country, is 
               <br />
               the practical consideration of the question 
               <br />
               now under discussion. (Hear, hear.) Sir, 
               <br />
               the resources of Canada it is unnecessary for 
               <br />
               me to allude to. They are well known to 
               <br />
               every member of this House. But it has 
               <br />
               been said, in reference to those of the Lower 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span> that the people will not bring into 
               <br />
               the union a reasonable proportion of wealth. 
               <br />
               Mr. SPEAKER, it has been stated that the 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               have nothing to bring us but ﬁsh and coal. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> 
               <br />
               believe that their resources will compare favor-

               ably with those of this province or of tl e 
               <br />
               United States. (Hear, hear.) The revenue 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick in 1850 was $416,348; 
               <br />
               in 1860, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$833,324;</span> and in 1862, $692,230. 
               <br />
               New, sir, I think that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thest</span> ﬁgures will show 
               <br />
               that New Brunswick was increasing in an 
               <br />
               equal, if not greater, ratio than this country. 
               <br />
               Being isolated from this province, being al- 
               <br />
               most entire strangers, and having little or no 
               <br />
               intercourse with each other, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               nearly all the trade has gone to a foreign 
               <br />
               country. The trade in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1862</span> was, with Ca- 
               <br />
               nada—imports, $191,522; exports, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">848.090.</span> 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$82,240;</span> exports, $80,932. Newfoundland—

               <br />
               union, Canada might expect to get the trade 
               <br />
               of all these provinces. The trade with
