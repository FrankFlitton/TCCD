               8140. Nevertheless he drew a comparison 
               <br />
               showing that while the comparatively poor 
               <br />
               people of Canada would have to pay 825 
               <br />

               <br />
               ain had only 837 to pay. It is very re- 
               <br />
               markable, however, that the whole of this 
               <br />
               portion of the honorable gentleman’s speech 
               <br />
               was omitted from the report given in the 
               <br />
               papers next morning. I do not propose to go 
               <br />
               mto these ﬁgures, but merely to refer to a few 
               <br />
               facts to place the assertions made by that 
               <br />
               honorable gentleman in their true light before 
               <br />
               the House. Our debt is indeed very large, 
               <br />
               and we could all wish that it was very much 
               <br />
               less than it is, but we have got to bear it and 
               <br />
               to pay it, and must do the best we can under 
               <br />
               the circumstances. The measure of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, in my opinion, will not add to nor 
               <br />
               yet lessen it, except what may be incurred for 
               <br />
               the construction of the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way. lt is quite possible, of course, that we 
               <br />
               may undertake enormous expenditures for 
               <br />
               public works calculated to open up and de- 
               <br />
               velope the resources of the country, and thus 
               <br />
               soon render our debt much heavier than at pres- 
               <br />
               ent, and it will be a question for the Govenment 
               <br />
               that may be established after Confederation, 
               <br />
               to decide how far it will be wise or prudentto 
               <br />
               undertake works of great cost until we shall 
               <br />
               have a good surplus in hand. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               One of the objections urged by the opponents 
               <br />
               of the measure is, that it is being hurried 
               <br />
               through too fast—that in a matter of so much 
               <br />
               much importance to present and future gener- 
               <br />
               ations, more time for consideration should be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given.</span> We have been discussing this question 
               <br />
               or many ears in Canada West. Since the 
               <br />
               ' Toronto onvention of 1859, the question has 
               <br />
               been continuously before the people. It is now 
               <br />
               nearly a year since it was ropoæd in some— 
               <br />
               thing like its present shape in this House, and 
               <br />
               since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> time the whole of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">newspaÊeG-s</span> 
               <br />
               have been writing upon it continually. e 
               <br />
               have nearly 300 newspapers in the country— 
               <br />
               and they have been carrying on a constant 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               ment for or against the scheme, until I 
               <br />
               do not think it is possible to say or write much 
               <br />
               more upon the subject with any advantage. 
               <br />
               If the question is not now fully understood, 
               <br />
               I fear it will not be much better understood 
               <br />
               b any delay that can be now accorded. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Bear,</span> hear.) Another objection raised is, 
               <br />
               that a measure of such vast importance ought 
               <br />
               not to be carried through without its ﬁrst 
               <br />
               being submitted to the people. Ihave mixed 
               <br />
               with the people a good deal, and I have found 
               <br />
               the opinion all but universal amongst them,

               any beneﬁt to the country, and the desire is 
               <br />
               general that we should get rid of the present 
               <br />
               constitutional diﬁiculties and get settled down 
               <br />
               to some quiet and permanent way of manag-

               ing our governmental business and political 
               <br />
               discussions. (Hear, hear.) The ch that

               are made against members of this House about 
               <br />
               inconsistency in advocating this measure, are 
               <br />
               very easily met. In a country like ours, so 
               <br />
               full of change, with a constant agitation going 
               <br />
               on for constitutional changes and for new 
               <br />
               laws, both local and general, it is utterly im- 
               <br />
               possible that a man can remain long in public 
               <br />
               ife without being open to charges of incon- 
               <br />
               sistency; but if these are caused by a strong 
               <br />
               effort to settle the diﬂiculties under which 
               <br />
               the country has been laboring, like the present 
               <br />
               one, I feel certain that the success of the 
               <br />
               measure in hand will render the charges of 
               <br />
               onl evanescent existence. I think it exceed- 
               <br />
               ing y desirable, even for the sake of those 
               <br />
               people who might reasonably feel the strongest 
               <br />
               objections to it—I mean the English minority 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada, and the Catholic minority 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada-that it should be settled 
               <br />
               at once. So long as the question remains in 
               <br />
               its present state, there will be a constant agi- 
               <br />
               tation going on, and much injury may be 
               <br />
               done by the misrepresentations that will be 
               <br />
               indulged in, and the misapprehensions which 
               <br />
               will exist ; but if these people can be assured 
               <br />
               that the scheme provides a perfect remedy 
               <br />
               for any injustice that they might apprehend, 
               <br />
               they willimmediately concur in it. As regards 
               <br />
               the people of Lower Canada of French ori- 
               <br />
               gin, and who are Roman Catholics, I have 
               <br />
               always heard it said in their favor, that a 
               <br />
               large degree of liberalism characterizes their 
               <br />
               conduct toward their Protestant neighbors. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Lower Canada, I believe, was 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst portion of British territory to give 
               <br />
               political freedom to the Jew. I believe that a 
               <br />
               rson of this persuasion sat in the Lower 
               <br />
               anada Legislature thirty years before the same 
               <br />
               privileges were accorded in Great Britain. 
               <br />
               People who charged the French Canadians 
               <br />
               with intolerance should remember this with 
               <br />
               some degree of favor. With regard to the 
               <br />
               people of British origin, over the whole 
               <br />
               Confederacy, I do not think it is at all 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necœsary</span> to defend them from any ch 
               <br />
               of this kind. I do not think they will be in-

               clined to persecute the people of Lower Can- 
               <br />
