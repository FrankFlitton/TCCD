               HON. Mn. CURRIE—Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               to have $106,000 a year, not for this year 
               <br />
               only, but for all time to come. She gets as 
               <br />
               well 80 cents per head for all time to come. 
               <br />
               Then she gets also, what I am sure the 
               <br />
               Commissioner of Crown Lands can hardly 
               <br />
               justify, that is a bonus of $165,000 for 
               <br />
               all time to come; and this, if capilatized, 
               <br />
               amounts to 83,000,000—and all this that 
               <br />
               she may come into the Confederation. 
               <br />
               And why does she receive so large a sum ? 
               <br />
               My hon. friend tells us that she gets it in 
               <br />
               consideration of the valuable Crown lands 
               <br />
               and minerals which she surrenders to the 
               <br />
               General Government. But we have yet to 
               <br />
               learn as a matter of fact that a ton of coal 
               <br />
               has ever been raised in the island. And 
               <br />
               what other minerals have they? We know of 
               <br />
               none. Their Crown lands, too, are of no value, 
               <br />
               as is proved by their not having yielded 
               <br />
               anything at all for many years past. Then 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               h should we give them $3,000,000, or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“$5,000</span> per year for worthless lands? I 
               <br />
               will not say, however, that they are altogether 
               <br />
               worthless ; but I know this, that for years 
               <br />
               past a statute has been in force, giving the 
               <br />
               ands free of charge to anybody who will 
               <br />
               go and settle on them for ﬁve years. And 
               <br />
               these are the valuable lands for which we 
               <br />
               are to pay an equivalent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">83,000,000.</span> But 
               <br />
               my‘ hon. friend the Commissioner of Crown 
               <br />
               Lands, perhaps, when he addresses the House, 
               <br />
               will tell us these Crown lands and minerals, 
               <br />
               whatever their value to Newfoundland, are 
               <br />
               worth 83,000,000 to the Confederation, and 
               <br />
               will argue as that they give up these lands and 
               <br />
               minerals, and have no local source of reve- 
               <br />
               nue, it is necessary they should receive this 
               <br />
               subsidy in return. But why have they no 
               <br />
               local source of revenue ? Why not ado t the 
               <br />
               same means to raise revenue in Ne ouud- 
               <br />
               land that we adopt here ? Why should we 
               <br />
               be called upon to contribute from the public 
               <br />
               chest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$165,000</span> for a purpose that we in 
               <br />
               Canada tax ourselves for ? Hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               I stated that the country was taken b sur- 
               <br />
               prise in regard to the manner in whic this 
               <br />
               measure was brought down to the House; 
               <br />
               and I think I have good reason for making 
               <br />
               that statement. Before we came here we had 
               <br />
               very little explanation of the ﬁnancial part 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               of the scheme; and that is a most important 
               <br />
               part. I am not one of those who, while fa- 
               <br />
               vorable to Confederation as a principle, would 
               <br />
               put a few hundred thousand dollars in the 
               <br />
               scale against it. But my grounds against the 
               <br />
               scheme are these— that if it is commenced 
               <br />
               upon a basis which is unjust to one portion 
               <br />
               of the community, it will be based upon a 
               <br />
               false foundation, and the tenement thus 
               <br />
               preposed to be erected will not withstand 
               <br />
               the breath of public opinion. We had 
               <br />
               reason to suppose that when we came here 
               <br />
               the measure promised at the close of the 
               <br />
               last session would be submitted ; but instead 
               <br />
               of that we have a very diﬁ‘erent measure 
               <br />
               altogether. But supposing this Address 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passes—supposing</span> these resolutions are 
               <br />
               carried, and the other colonies do not 
               <br />
               concur in the same Address as ourselves, 
               <br />
               what is to be the consequence? As I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand</span> it, the consent of all the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces must be had, and if they do no‘t 
               <br />
               concur, the scheme falls to the ground. 
               <br />
               What we ought to have had in Canada was 
               <br />
               the promised measure to put an end to the 
               <br />
               sectional difﬁculties between Upper and 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. But, instead of that, we are 
               <br />
               placed in consequence of the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference in this position—a scheme is brought 
               <br />
               down which is declared to be in the nature 
               <br />
               of a treaty, and we are told that we are to 
               <br />
               have no voice in its alteration. No matter 
               <br />
               what the details my be—our discussion of 
               <br />
               them is to be a mere farce. Even the 
               <br />
               reasonable delay I am now asking for will, 
               <br />
               I fear, be opposed by the Government of

               ablest men, perhaps, that Canada can claim. 
               <br />
