               <br />
               a question of time and of expediency? Why 
               <br />
               then should he make the opinions of us, the ma-

               jority, such a crime, when he himself arrives, 
               <br />
               at the end of a four hours’ speech, at the con-

               clusion that Confederation" will be good or

               necessary at a time which is more orless near?

               In his manifesto against the scheme of Con- 
               <br />
               federation he adheres so far to his previous

               <br />
               submitted to us as merely premature. There 
               <br />
               again, then, it was only a question of time, 
               <br />
               and in declaring himself to-day opposed to 
               <br />
               Confederation, he therefore changes his

               Opinion as to the very basis of the question. 
               <br />
               Ido not cast it up to him as a reproach ; for, 
               <br />
               as I said but a minute ago, he who main- 
               <br />
               tains that he has never changed, conveys but 
               <br />
               a poor opinion of his judgment and of his 
               <br />
               aptitude for ublic affairs. Events, in 
               <br />
               changing, abso utely compel men to change 
               <br />
               also. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear)</span> A general was once boasting 
               <br />
               to the great TUBENNE that he had never 
               <br />
               committed an error of strategy. “ He who 
               <br />
               boasts that he has never been mistaken,” 
               <br />
               returned TUBENNE, “ proves thereby that he 
               <br />
               knows nothing of the art of war.” These 
               <br />
               words, which are full of wisdom, may be 
               <br />
               applied to the hon. member for Hochelaga, 
               <br />
               who, by his persistence in maintaining that 
               <br />
               be has never contradicted himself nor been 
               <br />

               <br />
               have been better tor him to lay aside per-

               July, 1858, he said :—

               he hon. member for Hochelaga talked to 
               <br />
               us of conﬂicts between the Federal Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment and the local Houses, and of the 
               <br />
               sovereign power of the Central Government 
               <br />
               over the legislatures of the provinces. But 
               <br />
               what, then, is this sovereign power over the 
               <br />
               attributes of the provincial legislatures? If 
               <br />
               it exists it must be in the Constitution. If 
               <br />
               it is not to be found there, it is because it 
               <br />
               does not exist. He says that the Federal 
               <br />
               Legislature will always predominate; and 
               <br />
               why? Who then will decide between the 
               <br />
               one and the others ?—the judicial tribunals 
               <br />
               being sworn to respect the laws and the 
               <br />
               Constitution in their entirety, and charged 
               <br />
               by the very nature of their functions to 
               <br />
               declare whether such a law of the Federal 
               <br />
               Parliament or of the local legislatures does 
               <br />
               or does not affect the Constitution. (Hear, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> There will be no absolute sovereign 
               <br />
               power, each legislature having its distinct 
               <br />
               and independent attributes, not proceeding 
               <br />
               from one or the other by delegation, either 
               <br />
               from above or from below. The Federal Par. 
               <br />
               liament will have legislative sovereign power 
               <br />
               in all questions submitted to its control in 
               <br />
               the Constitution. So also the local legis— 
               <br />
               latures will be sovereign in all matters which 
               <br />
               are speciﬁcally assigned to them. How is 
               <br />
               the question of a conﬂict now settled in the 
               <br />
               United States, when it arises between the 
               <br />
               legislation of Congress and that of individual 
               <br />
               states? I do not speak of the present time 
               <br />
               when nearly the whole of the territory of
