               Ma. O'HALLORAN—It has been said, 
               <br />
               and it seems to be thought a strong argu- 
               <br />
               ment_in favor of this scheme, that we must 
               <br />
               do something; that our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘airs</span> cannot with 
               <br />
               advantage go on in the same channel in 
               <br />
               which they have been doing; and that there 
               <br />
               is a necessity for some change. It is made 
               <br />
               a complaint that legislation is obstructed by 
               <br />
               party strife, and that the country suﬂ'ers 
               <br />
               for the want of new laws. Sir, if there 
               <br />
               is one vulgar error in political economy 
               <br />
               more false and unsound than another, 
               <br />
               it is that the prosperity of any country 
               <br />
               depends on the amount of its legislation. 
               <br />
               We have, as a general thing, too much legis- 
               <br />
               lation. If I may use the term, we are legis— 
               <br />
               lated to death. And when I have seen bills 
               <br />
               pouring into this House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ty</span> the hundred at 
               <br />
               every session, I have said to myself :— 
               <br />
               “What, in Heaven’s name, will become of 
               <br />
               this country if all these bills should, by any 
               <br />
               possibility, ever become law? ” (Laughter.) 
               <br />
               The idea seems to prevail, that in this coun- 
               <br />
               try even the grass cannot grow unless its 
               <br />
               growth is regulated by an Act of Parliament.

               change your skies by the proposed constitu- 
               <br />
               tional changes.) I remarked, at the outset, 
               <br />
               that I must deny to this House the right to 
               <br />

               <br />
               to frame a Constitution? You were sent 
               <br />
               here to administer the Constitution as you 
               <br />
               ﬁnd it. Throughout the length and breadth 
               <br />
               of British North America, there is not one 
               <br />
               other government that has dared to arrogate 
               <br />
               to itself the right of changing the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of their people without consulting them, 
               <br />
               except ours. I am surprised, sir, that even 
               <br />
               this strong Government of ours have dared 
               <br />
               to assume this power, when, sooner or later, 
               <br />
               they must go before the pe0ple of the country. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) There comes to my hand, 
               <br />
               this evening, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution</span> proposed by the 
               <br />
               Honorable Attorney General of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land in the Legislature of that colony. It is 
               <br />
               instructive as shewing that there was one 
               <br />
               uniform sentiment, throughout all the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces, in favor of submitting the question 
               <br />
               to the people. It was so submitted in New 
               <br />
               Brunswick—it met its fate. It is now about 
               <br />
               to be submitted to the peeple of Nova Seo— 
               <br />
               tia. The Administration ol this province 
               <br />
               have been wiser in their generation than 
               <br />
               those of the Lower Provinces. They did 
               <br />
               not dare to submit it for the consideration of 
               <br />
               the people—a course which, if not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exhibiting</span> 
               <br />
               wisdom on their part, shows, at the least, 
               <br />
               that skill and craft in public matters for 
               <br />
