               HON. MR. CAMPBELL said, with respect

               moreover, that I was apprehensive that some

               HON. Ma. OL VIER—Another reason 
               <br />
               why I cannot approve of the plan of Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, as it is now presented to us, is that I 
               <br />
               consider it as a retrograde step in the politi- 
               <br />
               tical progress of the country. The spirit of 
               <br />
               modern society is to give to the people as 
               <br />
               much litical liberty as possible; and it is 
               <br />
               my be ief that by this plan of Confederation 
               <br />
               we shall sacriﬁce whatever liberty is already 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">messed</span> by the people of this country.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               en I expressed this idea, a short time 
               <br />
               since, the Honorable Premier seemed to give 
               <br />
               an ironical assent to it, as if he considered 
               <br />
               my notions exaggerated. I am bound to tell 
               <br />
               him that I neither love nor approve of mob- 
               <br />
               rule any more than he does, but I have always 
               <br />
               held as a political principle, that as much 
               <br />
               political liberty as possible should be conceded 
               <br />
               to the masses, combined always with a Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment strong enough to maintain order and 
               <br />
               administer thelaws; and herein I consider that 
               <br />
               I conform to the principles of modern society, 
               <br />
               without giving in to the dictates of demagogy. 
               <br />
               I am favorable to democracy, but not to dema- 
               <br />
               gogy, and in this sense I spoke. I say, then, 
               <br />
               that in taking from the people for all time, 
               <br />
               the right which they acquired after long 
               <br />
               struggles of electing members to this ll case, 
               <br />
               we are retrograding, making a step backward, 
               <br />
               and I am sure the people will not look upon 
               <br />
               this project with a favorable eye. We are
