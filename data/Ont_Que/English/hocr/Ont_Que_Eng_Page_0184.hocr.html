               gentlemen, are of immense value to Canada. 
               <br />
               By imposing tolls on our canals to an extent 
               <br />
               which they would easily bear, and which 
               <br />
               would not prevent our carrying on the same 
               <br />
               immense trade as at present, we could readily 
               <br />
               raise half a million a year. The Welland 
               <br />
               canal alone has reduced a revenue of 8200,- 
               <br />
               000 a year. ell, all such sources of income 
               <br />
               are to be thrown into the hands of the Federal 
               <br />
               Government, while New Brunswick is to give 
               <br />
               us a railway which only pays three-eighths of 
               <br />
               one per cent. over its working expenses. This 
               <br />
               small sum, remember tee, is what is paid new 
               <br />
               ——two or three years after the construction of 
               <br />
               the line—but when the rolling stock gets out 
               <br />
               of repair, the rails want renewing, and other 
               <br />
               matters usual after a railroad has been some- 
               <br />

               expense of the line to the Federal Gevemment 
               <br />
               will constantly increase. The road will be a

               <br />
               are opening an account without knowing when 
               <br />

               <br />
               not satisﬁed with 's, we are giving a sort of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Regina;</span> donum of $63,000 for ten years to the

               Province of New Brunswick. Again, we are 
               <br />
               to purchase for $160,000 a year the mines 
               <br />
               and minerals and Crown lands of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land. Now, I venture to say, we shall not 
               <br />
               realize $40,000 a year out of these minerals 
               <br />
               and Crown lands. We have a large mining 
               <br />
               country ourselves, which we ﬁnd no very

               fertile source of revenue, and though it is 
               <br />
               true we have no coal in Canada, we can 
               <br />
               get that from Nova Scotia by paying an export 
               <br />
               duty and the cost of freight. In the face of 
               <br />
               these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disdvantages</span> we are entering a union 
               <br />
               which, by judicious management, might have 
               <br />
               been brought about without involving us in 
               <br />
               this immense expense. As I said before, I 
               <br />
               dæire to see a union, but I want to see it
